1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:01,606
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:02,348 --> 00:00:03,519
Katrina Bennett.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,787
She comes in,
she takes over,

4
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:06,294
She acts like everything
is her idea.

5
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:08,124
This wasn't
about a job for me.

6
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,126
It was about having a life,

7
00:00:10,193 --> 00:00:12,128
But I guess
you wouldn't understand that.

8
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,797
So you're gonna punish me
by giving me to Louis?

9
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:15,998
Because you and I are done.

10
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,667
You make me want
to be a better man.

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,970
I can't let you do this.

12
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,207
I regret where we are,

13
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,843
And I've been trying to get us
back to where we were.

14
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,678
You're suggesting
bribing a man

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,210
to get you out
of your bribery charge.

16
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:35,017
"In for a penny, in for
a pound," mother always said.

17
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,885
Ava Hessington
doesn't plead no contest.

18
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:37,937
She pleads guilty.

19
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,321
And you get
to call it a win.

20
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,824
I can beat you, and I did.

21
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,776
You put me
in that position again,

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,362
and I'll do
whatever I have to do to win.

23
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,748
Are you saying screw this
deal, let's kick his ass?

24
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:51,534
I'm saying take the deal.
We already did.

25
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,570
I win, you back me
for managing partner.

26
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,238
You want
to take down Jessica.

27
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,540
I do.

28
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,808
What time
are you coming over?

29
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:19,278
Um, I thought
we were doing my place.

30
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,597
No, because whenever
I'm at your place,

31
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,700
all I can see is Tess
in a bed sheet.

32
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,202
I'll be there at 9:00.

33
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,442
Bran bars are forbidden
to first years.

34
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,494
- Since when?
- Since two seconds ago.

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,079
Order of the quartermaster,

36
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,664
who is no longer
speaking with you.

37
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:40,499
Rachel.
Hmm?

38
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:41,967
Can you please instruct
the associate to your right

39
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:43,952
to pass
the nondairy creamer?

40
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,121
Louis, as I have been trying
to tell you in person,

41
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,123
and in the note I left,

42
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,893
and in your voice mail,

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,428
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,846
Do you know what
nondairy creamer is, Rachel?

45
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,181
- Uh--
- It's a metaphor.

46
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:56,899
The first sip, you think
it's real, you know?

47
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,184
After all,
it wants you to believe

48
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,935
that it's genuine
and it's good,

49
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,137
and it's gonna deliver
on its promise.

50
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,572
But then with time,

51
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,680
you realize that it's
just a concoction of chemicals

52
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:07,326
that's designed
to disguise the truth

53
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,828
that it's actually
full of shit.

54
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:10,196
Then why
are you drinking it?

55
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,748
I'm lactose intolerant.

56
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,261
I don't accept.

57
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,629
Don't accept what?

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,600
Whatever bullshit apology
you're here to give me.

59
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:29,849
You gave me your word,

60
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,413
and the second
you found out that Mike

61
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,519
was actually gonna say yes,
you couldn't stand it.

62
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:34,720
You sold me out.

63
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:36,204
I'm not here
to give you an apology.

64
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,024
I'm here to give you a case.

65
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,810
Those are
the Hessington oil files.

66
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,011
Yeah, you know what, Harvey?

67
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,563
I don't want
your sloppy seconds.

68
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,282
That takeover attempt's
gonna be dead in the water

69
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,284
the second that Ava Hessington's
settlement goes public.

70
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,319
Tony Gianopolous isn't
going to just sell his shares

71
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,654
and go away.

72
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,821
You're right.
You know what he's gonna do?

73
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,206
He's gonna
leverage his position,

74
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,958
and he's gonna get
as much greenmail as he can.

75
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,660
Which is exactly
why I'm here.

76
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,046
You're better suited
to beat him back than I am.

77
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:02,464
You think I don't know that?

78
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:06,335
I know you know it.
I want you to know I know it.

79
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,975
Leave the box.

80
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,514
Louis,
have you given any thought

81
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,932
to a rebound associate?

82
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,551
Harvey, come on, you know
I'm not that kind of guy.

83
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,988
Come on, you have him
file a few interrogatories,

84
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,023
maybe pick up your dry cleaning,
and then you cut him loose.

85
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,525
With no strings attached?

86
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,861
Better men than you
have done it.

87
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:33,996
No.

88
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,998
- Yep.
- Who, Baird?

89
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:39,118
A week-long fling
I ended six days too late.

90
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,536
Yeah, but Harvey,

91
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,748
I don't just want a superficial
relationship, you know?

92
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,506
I want a true mentee.

93
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,342
Someone I can take
to the gun club or mudding

94
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,793
or to the origami festival.

95
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:51,096
Louis, you're gonna find
the right one.

96
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:57,419
Origami festival?
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:12,234
Well, this is a surprise.

98
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,486
What?

99
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:18,273
I just never thought I'd see
the great Harriet Specter

100
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,409
making her own copies.

101
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,215
Is that
what this thing does?

102
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,050
You've never made a copy
in your life before, have you?

103
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,502
Of course not,
I'm too busy being a badass

104
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:31,754
and worrying about my hair.

105
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,006
And your brilliant associate,
Michelle Ross,

106
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,508
does all the hard work
for you anyway.

107
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,894
You're goddamn right
she does.

108
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,730
I'm really sorry

109
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,400
for what I said
about having a life.

110
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,102
I know.

111
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,355
So we're good?

112
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,439
We're good.

113
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,441
And you and Mike,
you're good?

114
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,942
Do you really think
that Harvey

115
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,911
had an emotional epiphany
on his own?

116
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:57,613
So you did forgive him?

117
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,914
Yes.

118
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,249
Well, he doesn't know that.

119
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:03,168
Which is why I have
a triple-whip, double-fat,

120
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:06,038
extra shot mocha latte
with caramel.

121
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:07,489
Fair enough.

122
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,425
But maybe it's time
you told him.

123
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,260
So you decided
not to go back to London?

124
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,178
Well, we have some
unfinished business to discuss,

125
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,880
and I thought it best
to do it in person.

126
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,131
The takeover attempt.

127
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,050
Tony Gianopolous.

128
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,686
Well, I've assigned it
to another attorney,

129
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,523
but before you express
any concern, he's excellent.

130
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,476
Well, not only
do I not have concerns,

131
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,645
I'm glad
you've handed it off.

132
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,480
And why is that?

133
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,615
Because that way I know you'll
trust the man you're overseeing

134
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:37,319
when you come and work for me.

135
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,405
I have to say,
I'm flattered.

136
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:40,689
I don't want you
to be flattered.

137
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,708
I want you to say yes.

138
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,210
As much success as I've had
with that line myself,

139
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:48,029
I'm afraid
I'm not an oilman.

140
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,498
The oil business
is about oil

141
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,334
as much as you being
a lawyer is about the law.

142
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,803
Every day is a knife fight
in a prison yard,

143
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,223
and something tells me
you like a good knife fight.

144
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,758
No rules in a knife fight.

145
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,594
Harvey, I've just lost
my number two.

146
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,347
I can't think of anyone better
to replace him.

147
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,515
Ava

148
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,183
I'm a woman
who gets what I want,

149
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,235
and I am willing
to pay for it.

150
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,721
Don't get me wrong,
I'm happy to whore myself out.

151
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,274
I just prefer to have
more than one client.

152
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:18,077
Harvey, what a coincidence.

153
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,446
Cameron, I'm surprised
you can afford this place

154
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,331
now that
you're unemployed again.

155
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,950
Well, my temporary gig
isn't over just yet.

156
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:27,903
You may think
you have them fooled, Cameron,

157
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,071
but they'll figure you out
eventually.

158
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,072
You didn't.

159
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,374
What are you talking about?

160
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,209
Ava Hessington,
you're under arrest.

161
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,794
- What?
- On what charge?

162
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,079
Conspiracy
to commit murder.

163
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,251
This is bullshit, Cameron.
We had a deal.

164
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,586
A deal where your client

165
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,389
admitted to bribing
a foreign official.

166
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,224
That Colonel
that she paid off?

167
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,760
After that, six people
were killed by his troops.

168
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,530
I give my driver a tip,
and then he runs over someone.

169
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,365
Doesn't mean I had
anything to do with it.

170
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,033
But if the person
he hit was me,

171
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,568
sure would look like that.

172
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,787
What the hell
are you talking about?

173
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,622
All six people
did whatever they could

174
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,824
to stop your client
from getting her pipeline.

175
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,659
If that's all you got,
you don't have shit.

176
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:09,378
She did this, Harvey.
You don't know her.

177
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:10,946
Yeah, but I know you,

178
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,997
and you don't give a damn

179
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,049
about murder
in some foreign country.

180
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:15,751
You took this case
to stick it to me.

181
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,419
And I did.

182
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,921
She admitted that was a bribe

183
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,422
because she never thought we
would tie her to those deaths,

184
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,473
and now I got her.

185
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:22,679
And you didn't
see it coming,

186
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,812
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

197

What do you need me to do?

198
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,088
Whatever you have to
to get Ava out,

199
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,623
because Cameron's gonna
try and keep her in.

200
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,208
You really think he's gonna
try and deny her bail?

201
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:17,593
- I know it.
- Harvey, one thing.

202
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,261
Hey, look, if you have
a problem defending someone

203
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:21,630
who's accused of murder,
I don't want to hear it.

204
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,265
Look, you won't, 'cause I'm
willing to do whatever it takes

205
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:26,552
to win
whether she's innocent or not.

206
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,604
Then come with me.

207
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,806
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm going to see Ava with you?

208
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,191
- Yep.
- Yeah, baby!

209
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,609
Butch and Sundance are back.

210
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,444
Ooh, no go.

211
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:37,279
What do--what do--
what do you mean, "no go"?

212
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:38,786
I mean, you're not
Butch or Sundance.

213
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:39,782
Why not?

214
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,016
'Cause Butch was the leader,

215
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,118
and Sundance was the gunslinger,
and I'm both.

216
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:44,686
Okay, but Sundance
couldn't swim,

217
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:47,239
and Butch never shot anyone,
so that makes you a loser.

218
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:48,490
Better than a fraud.

219
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,708
I think it's time
for some new material.

220
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:51,693
You write
<i>Midnight Train to Georgia,</i>

221
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,245
you don't just
sing it once.

222
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:57,249
And speaking of Butch Cassidy,
let's go start a knife fight.

223
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,717
Uh, Norma,

224
00:08:58,802 --> 00:09:02,037
I just want you, from now on,
to just try to wear socks,

225
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:05,307
because if you--
there isn't--

226
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:09,711
and what is that?

227
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:11,346
Hessington oil's earnings
per share

228
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,983
and market cap growth
over the last 11.2 years.

229
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,152
Somebody ask you
to do this?

230
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,238
I didn't do it because
somebody asked me to, Louis.

231
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:23,492
I did it
because I want in on the case.

232
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,277
You know, you realize
something like this

233
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,496
would entail
working hand in glove

234
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:31,617
and possibly even
a trip or two to the mud club.

235
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,169
I'm in.

236
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:35,170
And what makes you think
you're good enough

237
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:36,505
to be my personal associate?

238
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,674
I don't want to be
your personal associate.

239
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:41,076
- What?
- I'm a fifth year.

240
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,345
I don't want to be
anyone's personal associate,

241
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:47,015
but I know how good you are,
you know how good I am.

242
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,133
We can use each other.

243
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:52,020
Hmm.
Like a symbiotic relationship.

244
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:53,555
Like between a phytoplankton
and a whale.

245
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,692
I'm not familiar
with their specific dynamic,

246
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,310
but, yes, exactly.

247
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:01,563
Well, Katrina, I kind of
had enough of being used

248
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,694
by associates looking to move
one rung up the ladder,

249
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,818
so I suggest you get
the hell out of my office

250
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:08,403
and find yourself
another whale.

251
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:20,499
Did you know
about these murders?

252
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,584
I knew there was
a demonstration,

253
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,387
it turned ugly,
and that people died.

254
00:10:25,454 --> 00:10:26,472
Did you know those people

255
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:27,890
were the leaders
of the demonstration?

256
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:29,091
No.

257
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,592
Did you know the military
was responsible?

258
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:33,512
All I know about these deaths
is that they happened.

259
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:35,264
On your land.

260
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,684
We own thousands of acres.
It's a volatile country.

261
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,652
People kill each other
on a regular basis.

262
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:41,904
So you just chalk it up
to coincidence

263
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:44,273
that the six leaders
of this demonstration,

264
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:47,159
against
your company's policies,

265
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,995
on your company's
private property, were murdered?

266
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,248
It was reported as
a combat incident, not a murder.

267
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:54,316
You just said all you know
about these deaths

268
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,584
is that they happened.

269
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:56,835
Now you know
it was a combat incident.

270
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Which one is it?

271
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:59,371
Harvey,
what the hell is this,

272
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,706
and who the hell
does he think he is?

273
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,824
Mike's just doing his job.

274
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,343
Well, Mike,

275
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:07,713
every death in that country is
reported as a combat incident,

276
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,497
and for your information,

277
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:11,934
there were thousands of people
opposed to our pipeline.

278
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,436
That's all we need
right now.

279
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:20,809
Would you
please excuse us?

280
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,572
How exactly did you manage
to get your head

281
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:35,958
so far up your own ass?

282
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,460
You told me
to take this deal.

283
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,279
I did,
and now here I am.

284
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,564
I didn't know
about these murders.

285
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:44,950
What you don't seem to believe
is neither did I.

286
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,434
We were doing our job.

287
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,872
Cameron Dennis
will come at you with worse.

288
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:51,290
Do you think
I did this?

289
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:53,125
That's irrelevant.

290
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:56,712
I just want to make sure I know
all the evidence against you.

291
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,330
I have no idea
what the evidence is,

292
00:11:58,414 --> 00:11:59,965
because I had
nothing to do with it,

293
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:03,051
and you say it's irrelevant,
but it's not irrelevant to me.

294
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,520
Do you think I did this?

295
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:06,638
Do you want a lawyer

296
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,123
who thinks
you're innocent and loses

297
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,676
or a lawyer who doesn't
want to know and wins?

298
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,394
You know
the answer to that.

299
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:14,146
Then don't ask me
that question again,

300
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,964
'cause after I win
and you're free,

301
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,967
what I think won't matter.

302
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,190
So what did she want
to talk to you about?

303
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,942
She wanted to know
if you were single.

304
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:28,360
Listen, when you
get back to the office--

305
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:29,661
Wait, what do you mean?

306
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:31,029
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

307
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:33,782
I mean, I thought we were
gonna go back together.

308
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,417
I don't know, I thought we could
get some lunch or something.

309
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,651
Like what?

310
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:39,087
I don't know.
Like, maybe steak or something.

311
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,505
It's the middle of the day.

312
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,958
Yeah, Harvey, that's when
people usually eat lunch.

313
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,210
This is about Louis,
isn't it?

314
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,179
What? No.
Maybe.

315
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:48,824
So I'm supposed to
take you mudding now?

316
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:50,549
That's not the point.

317
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,634
Look, let's just concentrate
on winning this thing,

318
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:53,885
and when it's over,
we can talk

319
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,771
about lunch, dinner,
or anything else.

320
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:56,772
Whoa, whoa,
you really mean that?

321
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,307
No.

322
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:00,642
Butch and Sundance are back.

323
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:25,968
What are you doing?

324
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,586
Dropping off
something for Harvey.

325
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,921
You don't have
any cases with Harvey.

326
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:31,706
I will when he sees
what's in here.

327
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:32,975
No.

328
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,043
You're not taking credit
for my ideas again.

329
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:36,678
Harvey's gonna know
I built this airplane.

330
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:38,513
Harvey's not gonna
know anything.

331
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:39,982
You're a little late
to the party.

332
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,316
He and I
are working together again.

333
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:43,402
I'm not looking
to take your place.

334
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:44,820
Oh, really?

335
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:46,438
You just happened to prepare
a document for him,

336
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:48,106
thinking he didn't
have an associate?

337
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,908
He's working a case
that I'm right for.

338
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:52,227
That's not how it works
around here.

339
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:53,862
I handle all of his cases.

340
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,280
Does Harvey know that?

341
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:58,233
What Harvey knows
is that I'm the "A" team,

342
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,402
and you're the "B" team,
so you can leave the folder,

343
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:01,920
or you can take it
with you,

344
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,255
but if you're looking to ride
some partner's coattails,

345
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,624
you're gonna have
to look somewhere else.

346
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,844
Well, the "B" team
worked at the D.A.'s office

347
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:10,345
and came up
with a defense strategy

348
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,515
based on a specific knowledge
of Cameron Dennis.

349
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,634
The "A" team
quotes him movies.

350
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:18,186
We'll see who Harvey does
and doesn't value.

351
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:21,473
Katrina,
Mike is Harvey's guy.

352
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:23,558
When he tells you
he's speaking for Harvey,

353
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:25,060
he's speaking for Harvey.

354
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,144
And please don't
come into this office

355
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:30,399
when I'm away
from my desk again.

356
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:38,940
Boy, am I glad I never
snuck into Harvey's office

357
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:42,627
when you
weren't around before.

358
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:43,995
Thanks, Donna.

359
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,630
I still expect
free, exotic,

360
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:49,718
caffeinated beverages
for the foreseeable future.

361
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,109
Cameron Dennis.
Son of a bitch.

362
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,277
He played us.

363
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,862
He slid that guilty plea
right by.

364
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,148
I should've seen it coming.
We should've seen it coming.

365
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,450
I'm the one that convinced you
to take that deal.

366
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,835
What's done is done.

367
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,670
Question is,
what's being done?

368
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:08,039
I'm working on getting Ava
off these charges,

369
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,675
and I got Mike working
on getting her out on bail.

370
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,210
So you're back with him.

371
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,995
What's the point
of having a right arm

372
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,430
without a right hand?

373
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,432
- Good.
- Is it?

374
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,384
- What do you mean?
- I mean, he threatened you.

375
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,602
I've never known you
to be forgiving

376
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,103
with someone
who threatened you.

377
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,939
I've never known you to be
particularly forgiving either.

378
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,647
Um, I'm sorry,
I'll come back.

379
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,982
It's okay.

380
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,700
We're all good.

381
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:38,036
We're good?

382
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,737
When you work with tigers,

383
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:43,074
once in a while, they're gonna
take a swipe at you.

384
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:44,709
I like working with tigers.

385
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:48,463
Of course, when they get out of
hand, you have to put them down.

386
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,034
Now, where are we on the prep
for Ava's bail hearing?

387
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,469
Well, I was thinking,

388
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,039
since Cameron used the
settlement to double-cross us,

389
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:01,142
why don't we use the bail
hearing to double-cross him?

390
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,345
Your Honor,
this is not

391
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,147
a Ponzi scheme
or insider trading,

392
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,682
this is cold-blooded murder.

393
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,100
Prosecution moves
that bail be denied.

394
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,736
That's ridiculous.
My client's not going anywhere.

395
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,987
She's got a business to run.

396
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,188
Let's look
at how she does business.

397
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,358
Less than 48 hours ago,
she admitted to bribery.

398
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,243
You want to talk
about how she does business?

399
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,162
Let's talk
about how you do business.

400
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,498
Your Honor,
I have a list of 87 murder cases

401
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,333
that Cameron Dennis
tried as a D.A.

402
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,752
In each instance, he allowed
reasonable bail to be set.

403
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:30,237
I allowed bail
because gangbangers

404
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,041
don't have a fraction
of Ms. Hessington's resources.

405
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,426
You allowed bail
because you didn't give a damn

406
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,962
about those guys,
and this is personal.

407
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,932
It's why you took the case,
it's why you hid a witness,

408
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:44,185
and it's why you negotiated
a settlement in bad faith.

409
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:47,105
My chambers now.

410
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,442
You bring an accusation
like that into my courtroom,

411
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,644
you better be able
to back it up.

412
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,362
Your Honor,
when I told him

413
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:55,829
he took this case
to stick it to me,

414
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,899
he said, quote, "I did,

415
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,234
and now I got her,
and you didn't see it coming."

416
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,402
You know what, Your Honor?

417
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,603
He's right.
I am sticking it to him.

418
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,455
Guilty as charged,
just like his client.

419
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,657
- Okay, let me--
- That's enough.

420
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,325
I am not a washing machine.

421
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,628
You two are not here
to air your dirty laundry.

422
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,714
She admitted to bribing
a Colonel in the army,

423
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,582
and that same army
killed these people.

424
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,468
Three environmentalists
died in the polar ice cap.

425
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,834
You think she killed them also?
Maybe I'll look into that.

426
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,673
You gonna leak it
to a corporate raider too?

427
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,007
What's he talking about?

428
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:24,291
I'm talking about the fact
that he leaked

429
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,144
this whole thing
to Tony Gianopolous.

430
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:27,729
This is a personal vendetta,

431
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,065
and he has no concrete evidence
against my client.

432
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,967
Not only do I want no bail,

433
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,019
I want you to throw
this case out right now.

434
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,738
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

435
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,273
But I'll tell you something,
Mr. Dennis,

436
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,943
I am setting bail at $1.

437
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,078
And if you don't
have any evidence,

438
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,447
I'm gonna hear his motion
for summary judgment,

439
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,949
rule in his favor,

440
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,985
and this trial is going to be
over before it even starts.

441
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,039
Bloody hell.

442
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:35,362
Um, excuse me, do you not
see me sitting here?

443
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,633
Yeah, I saw you.
I just chose to ignore you.

444
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,134
You must like
living dangerously.

445
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,253
I do, and that's
why stopping here,

446
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:45,223
doing this with you,
well, that's playing with fire.

447
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,758
There's nothing wrong with
a little casual conversation.

448
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,709
What happens
when casual conversation

449
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,094
becomes serious fun?

450
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:52,096
Oh, you're good.

451
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:55,983
I can promise you,
I'm better than good.

452
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,070
Stephen Huntley,
senior partner, London office.

453
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:00,071
Donna.

454
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:01,906
Just Donna?

455
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,991
Yeah, it's like a name
and a title in one.

456
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,243
You'll see.

457
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:06,894
I've heard.

458
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,496
Secretarial pool's
been buzzing

459
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:10,414
about some new, feisty ginger
for a fortnight.

460
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,783
Look, if you're trying
to charm your way

461
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,251
into Harvey's office,
it's not gonna happen.

462
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:14,669
Mm, no, I'm not trying
to charm my way

463
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,837
into Harvey's office.

464
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,371
Oh, what were you
trying for?

465
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,173
Well, actually,
I was gonna try for--

466
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,341
Donna, I need you
to send Louis

467
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:22,043
everything we have
on Tony Gianopolous.

468
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,127
He's running point.

469
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,545
Harvey, a pleasure.
I'm Stephen.

470
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,848
I know who you are,
and I know why you're here.

471
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,268
You're Darby's fixer, and you're
here to hijack my case.

472
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,388
Did you text him
whilst we were--

473
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,108
You said you're good?

474
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:38,442
I'm good too.

475
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:41,062
This isn't over.

476
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,897
Is that a threat?

477
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:43,931
Mm, you take it
in whatever tone

478
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,934
pleases you the most.

479
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,907
You're right.

480
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,327
I am Darby's fixer, but I'm not
here to hijack anything.

481
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:57,745
When I got on a plane
at Heathrow,

482
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,047
this was still
merely bribery.

483
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,582
I've only just learned
of the murder charges now

484
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,884
as I touched down.

485
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,787
It just means the timing
changed, not the motive.

486
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,640
Forget the bombshell
the prosecution's just dropped.

487
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:13,895
Let's talk about the bombshell
outside your office.

488
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,013
Donna?

489
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:17,464
She's got a body
like Elizabeth Hurley

490
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,016
and the sass
of Maggie Thatcher.

491
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,269
I went out with Liz.

492
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,688
Don't sell her short
in the sass department.

493
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,107
Oh, I'm well aware
of her sass.

494
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,108
'99.

495
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,242
'98.

496
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,144
Really?

497
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,996
Well, you're obviously
a better man than I am.

498
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,815
Don't beat yourself up.
You got plenty of company.

499
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,151
By the way,
before you say anything else,

500
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,371
she can hear
every word we say.

501
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,757
Now, I've got
a murder charge to defend,

502
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,126
so why don't you tell me
why the hell you're really here?

503
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,212
Well, I'm here to oversee
cultural integration.

504
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:49,931
Cultural integration.

505
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,433
Standard part of the merger,
been on the books for two weeks.

506
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,517
And why do you need me?

507
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:55,102
Well, smoothing over

508
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,305
these transitional periods
is never easy.

509
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,523
It's not child's play.

510
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,360
You're an influencer here.
People listen to you.

511
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,528
I want you to help them
listen to me.

512
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,030
I get it.

513
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,149
You want me
to pave the way for you.

514
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,533
Here's the thing.

515
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:11,986
I don't pave the way
for people.

516
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,155
People pave the way for me.

517
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,408
Mm.

518
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,210
I get it.

519
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:22,046
Steer clear of you,
and you and I

520
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,499
will get along
just fine.

521
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,136
Welcome to New York.

522
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,064
So, have you met
Stephen Huntley yet.

523
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:39,898
- I did.
- What'd you think?

524
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:41,510
Turns out we have
some things in common.

525
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:45,771
Turns out he didn't
show up empty-handed.

526
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,039
That's $1/2 million.

527
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,624
Mmhmm, first dividend check
of the merger.

528
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,908
That was my buy-in amount.

529
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,461
Maybe it wasn't
such a bad idea after all.

530
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,130
Wait a second.
What was your check for?

531
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:56,415
More than that.

532
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:57,499
1.2?

533
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,001
I'm not telling.

534
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,887
1.5?

535
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,756
You're three times
more valuable than me?

536
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:06,308
Oh, I don't think that.
The check thinks that.

537
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,559
Does the check think
the only thing

538
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,645
that guy's here for
is cultural integration?

539
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,930
The check
wasn't born yesterday.

540
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:13,399
He is to Darby
what you are to me,

541
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,933
and I wouldn't send you
to do that.

542
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:15,984
No, you wouldn't.

543
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,352
So what'd you tell him?

544
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,822
I told him as long
as he steers clear of me,

545
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:20,823
he'll be fine.

546
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,191
You told him wrong.

547
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:26,528
I want you to find out
what the hell that guy's up to.

548
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:30,332
She's right, you know.

549
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,334
Cultural integration's
scheduled for a week.

550
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,754
Stephen Huntley booked a room
at the Peninsula for a month.

551
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,623
Is it a room or a suite?
It's important.

552
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:39,792
- A suite.
- Good work.

553
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:42,127
- It's what I do.
- There's only one problem.

554
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:46,548
Jessica just told me
to look into him one second ago.

555
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,717
- I anticipated her needs.
- No, you didn't.

556
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,969
I anticipated your needs?

557
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,639
You anticipated your needs.
And by "your needs," I mean--

558
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,475
Okay, my needs are not
the topic of this conversation.

559
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:57,943
All I'm saying is,
you went to the trouble

560
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,029
of specifically finding out
he booked a suite.

561
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:04,032
- W--
- Save it.

562
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:15,327
Can I talk to you
for a second?

563
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:19,698
Not if it's about working
with Harvey on this case.

564
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:23,719
Look, this isn't easy for me
to do, but for some reason,

565
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:27,306
you and I keep locking horns,
and now I'm out in the cold.

566
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:29,925
I know how I got here, but
I don't know how to get back.

567
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,510
What do you want, Katrina?

568
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:34,480
I want to figure out a way
we can coexist in this firm.

569
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:35,714
You want to know a way?

570
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:37,883
When you see me coming,
give me a wide berth.

571
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:40,068
You know what?
I'm apologizing to you.

572
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:41,904
You don't have to be a dick.

573
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,405
I'm a dick?

574
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,223
You have treated
everyone at this firm

575
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,442
below your station
like shit.

576
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,611
Now all of a sudden
you want to be my best friend?

577
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,446
Oh, I get it.

578
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,898
This isn't about me and you.

579
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:55,751
This is about me
and your little girlfriend.

580
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:58,287
Rachel
is not my girlfriend.

581
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:02,174
This has nothing to do with her,
and this conversation is over.

582
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:07,179
Funny how you know exactly
who I was talking about.

583
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:20,425
Thank you.

584
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:23,362
Harvey, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this lunch?

585
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,314
I wanted to thank you
for the check.

586
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,733
Oh, I thought
that'd change your attitude.

587
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:28,784
It did.

588
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,619
In fact,
you gave something to me,

589
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,154
I want to give
something to you.

590
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:35,106
What is it?

591
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:36,208
It's a hotel bill.

592
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,461
I paid it.
Then I checked you out.

593
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,781
Hope you left housekeeping
a hefty gratuity.

594
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:43,999
You're not here
to deliver checks

595
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,968
or make
smooth transitions,

596
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,719
and if you're not
gonna tell me the truth,

597
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,221
you don't need
to be here at all.

598
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,422
Well, that's gonna make it

599
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:53,809
extremely difficult
for me to help you

600
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,812
take over the firm
from Jessica.

601
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,964
I know about your deal
with Edward.

602
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:00,098
He sent me here to help.

603
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,817
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

604
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,235
Well, you told me
Miss Moneypenny was listening.

605
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,153
I didn't know
whether you wanted her to hear.

606
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:09,608
So you're here to help me
take over the firm from Jessica?

607
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,578
What exactly does that mean?
You know what it means.

608
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,780
I don't need you
baby-sitting me on this case.

609
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:15,948
I'm not a baby-sitter.

610
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,917
I'm a fixer.
I'm here to help you.

611
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,118
Now why would you
turn that down?

612
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:22,004
What's to stop you
from using this

613
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,455
to take over
the firm from me?

614
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:24,790
I'm not like you.

615
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:27,342
I don't care to have
my name on the door.

616
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,678
So you're here
just to help me.

617
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,430
You don't need
anything in return.

618
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,599
Your car club has a pair

619
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,802
of mint 1956
Porsche Speedsters.

620
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,370
You want to drive one?

621
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:40,138
I want to race you.

622
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:43,008
Harvey,
fancy meeting you here.

623
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:44,226
Cameron,
you keep showing up unannounced,

624
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,228
and I'm not sure why.

625
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,729
I can meet you
anytime, anywhere,

626
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:49,314
because I'm not afraid
of you.

627
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:51,149
Well, you should be.

628
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,484
I've got five witnesses

629
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:54,536
who place the Colonel
that your client bribed

630
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,570
at the scene
of those murders.

631
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,990
You want evidence?
Here it is.

632
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,658
See you in court.

633
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:03,662
We can schedule it
for anytime, anywhere.

634
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,834
You still
don't want my help?

635
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:12,004
No, I don't.

636
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:13,088
I don't trust you.

637
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,473
I'm not telling you
to trust me.

638
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,425
I'm telling you
that this is what Darby wants.

639
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:17,676
Well, Darby isn't here.

640
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,768
Hey, you wanted to talk to me?

641
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,987
Hey, yes.

642
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,356
So I know you don't want me
fighting your battles for you,

643
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:33,358
and I didn't.
Uhoh.

644
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,827
I just don't want you
to get upset with me.

645
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,412
What?

646
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:38,780
I went to talk to Donna

647
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:43,285
about her and me,
and you came up.

648
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,253
What about me?

649
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:49,958
That it's time for you
to be accepted back.

650
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:52,794
- That's why she did it.
- Did what?

651
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,713
I caught Katrina
trying to horn in on my case.

652
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:56,214
- Again?
- Yeah, I know.

653
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:57,425
Donna walked in
in the middle,

654
00:26:57,433 --> 00:27:00,385
and she took her
to the woodshed.

655
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:02,054
So you're okay
with what I did?

656
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:03,772
I'm more than okay.

657
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,308
Not only did Katrina
slink away,

658
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,893
but she came back later
with her tail between her legs,

659
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:09,644
looking to be my friend.

660
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,763
Well, she is not your friend.

661
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,431
She's definitely not
my friend.

662
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:16,318
She most certainly isn't.

663
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,819
What are you talking about?

664
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,488
Um...

665
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,907
After I told her that she
could take her friendship

666
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,441
and shove it up her ass,

667
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:26,795
she said that this whole thing
was about you

668
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:31,299
and that I was just trying
to protect my girlfriend.

669
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:32,801
She called me
your girl--girlfriend?

670
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:33,802
Mmhmm.

671
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,087
And what did you say?

672
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:37,622
I mean, what--
what could I say?

673
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:40,759
We're keeping it a secret.
I-I said you weren't.

674
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,729
Good.

675
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,598
Yeah.

676
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,737
Am I?

677
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,355
Don't you know?

678
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,190
Well, we never really
talked about it.

679
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,358
You mean,
I've never really asked.

680
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,360
Nobody asks
anybody anymore.

681
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,251
Whoops.

682
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,254
Sorry.
Are you okay?

683
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:14,793
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,
will you be my girlfriend?

684
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,265
Yes.

685
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,058
What the hell is this?

686
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,777
What?

687
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,945
I'm working with Harvey,
my best friend.

688
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,947
Harvey gave birth to me.

689
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,199
When you see me coming,

690
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,534
give me a wide berth,
because I'm a dick.

691
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,203
I'm a dick, dick, dick.

692
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,121
I'm working with Harvey,

693
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,990
my best friend...
Oh, my God.

694
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,298
You're not the fool anymore,
Louis.

695
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,000
Mike Ross is.

696
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,469
And I can't take it back.

697
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,204
I put myself
out on a limb for you,

698
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:03,975
so if you say no to me,
I won't just be a fool.

699
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,978
I'll be done.

700
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,853
Ugh, this means war.

701
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:16,354
And I am not taking
any prisoners.

702
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:18,440
If you think I'm staying
out of it, you're crazy.

703
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:19,658
I don't want you out of it.
I want you in it.

704
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,526
So what are we gonna do?

705
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:22,527
Nothing right now.

706
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:25,831
I need to help Harvey.

707
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:31,453
I don't believe it.

708
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:34,122
It's a setback,
but it's going away.

709
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:37,175
And what exactly
does that mean?

710
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:40,629
I looked into three
of the witnesses,

711
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:43,465
and all three were affiliated
with a guerilla faction

712
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,350
within the last five years.

713
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,857
We're gonna paint
the entire incident

714
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,855
as a firefight between
the government and armed rebels.

715
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,223
Which, as you pointed out,

716
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:52,858
is exactly how it was reported
in the first place.

717
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,143
They're still placing
the Colonel at these murders.

718
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,349
I don't think
you understand.

719
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:57,445
This is what I found
in two hours.

720
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,198
In another day--
I understand perfectly.

721
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,317
You want to tear
these people down in court.

722
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,619
Well, I'm suggesting
they never get there.

723
00:30:04,704 --> 00:30:08,073
We find out how to get to them,
and we pay them off.

724
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:09,708
Bribery is what got you
into this situation.

725
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,459
Now you think
that's your way out?

726
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,628
That's what you said
when I suggested that with Nick,

727
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:15,046
and I listened to you.

728
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,748
And I was able to
neutralize him without a payoff.

729
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,160
You were able
to get Cameron Dennis

730
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:21,419
to offer me a deal that's
now being used against me.

731
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,005
And even if you can
impugn these five witnesses,

732
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,057
your way still
goes to a verdict.

733
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,309
Mine doesn't.

734
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,760
It doesn't
if we don't get caught.

735
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:29,844
Then don't get caught.

736
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,813
We're not
going to get caught,

737
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:33,481
because we're not doing this.

738
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,985
You told me you'd do
anything it takes to win.

739
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,653
Remember that?

740
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:40,418
You'll steal
the rival pitcher's girlfriend

741
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,773
the night
before the big game.

742
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:43,992
This is the night
before the big game.

743
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,578
Ms. Hessington, what
you're proposing is a crime.

744
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:50,999
A crime to get me
out of a crime I didn't commit.

745
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,287
You said it doesn't matter
whether you believe me or not.

746
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:56,788
It doesn't.

747
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,256
But it does,

748
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,592
because if you thought
I was innocent, you'd do this.

749
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,094
I won't.

750
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:06,881
Then you're fired.

751
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:10,552
And I'll find
someone who will.

752
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,747
Where did you get
this picture?

753
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:20,172
- I friended her on Facebook.
- She accepted?

754
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,256
Not as me.

755
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:23,008
I found an intern
at the D.A.'s office

756
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:24,176
that she worked with
two years ago

757
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:25,627
who doesn't have
a Facebook account.

758
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:27,229
Mm. See?

759
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:29,564
You're not the only one
who can away with fraud.

760
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:33,051
Okay, step aside.

761
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:35,270
Aha.

762
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:36,571
Holy shit.

763
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:38,556
Yeah, you do not want
to get on my bad side.

764
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:39,608
I can see that.

765
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:41,360
What are you working on?

766
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:43,328
Oh, let me rephrase.

767
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:46,665
Why the hell aren't you
working on Ava's defense?

768
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:50,869
Uh, because we got fired.

769
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,671
That's no reason
not to work on her defense.

770
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:54,122
Look, Harvey,

771
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,841
I know we're just getting back
on the same team and all,

772
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:57,009
and I don't want
to disagree with you,

773
00:31:57,076 --> 00:31:58,716
but it's actually
a very excellent reason.

774
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,012
Wrong.

775
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,247
Odds are Cameron's
expecting her to do this,

776
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:03,415
and we get a call tomorrow

777
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:04,716
to get her
out of a new bribery charge.

778
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,751
And then whatever lawyer
she replaces us with

779
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:08,470
can't stand up
to Cameron in court.

780
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,972
'Cause he's not gonna
stop working on this.

781
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:11,440
And neither are we.

782
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:12,941
One more thing.

783
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:14,726
Don't.
Don't what?

784
00:32:14,777 --> 00:32:15,944
You think I don't know

785
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,696
what you were doing
in there with Rachel?

786
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,781
You saw it too?

787
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:22,034
I did,
and I need you to let it go.

788
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:24,403
Wait, so you're saying
she threw a punch,

789
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:26,038
and you don't want me
to throw a punch back?

790
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,407
I'm saying we're
in the middle of a murder trial,

791
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:31,609
and I need you
to let it go.

792
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:38,950
Harvey, is there something
you'd like to tell me about Ava?

793
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,253
Yeah, some clients can be
a pain in the ass.

794
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:42,921
Some ex-clients too.

795
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:44,756
- Temporary situation.
- Good, good.

796
00:32:44,807 --> 00:32:46,725
'Cause I just wanted to make
sure you were still all over it.

797
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,343
Did you want to make sure
the sun was still shining

798
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:50,262
and the sky
was still blue?

799
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:53,298
I'd be humble
after I got fired.

800
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:55,767
If I ever got fired.

801
00:33:00,306 --> 00:33:03,025
I don't know what it's like
in the D.A.'s office now,

802
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,192
but if I did
what you did

803
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:06,611
to someone who was with me
in the trenches,

804
00:33:06,662 --> 00:33:08,663
I'd be done,
like you are now.

805
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:11,917
You have no idea what the
story is between me and Mike.

806
00:33:11,984 --> 00:33:13,201
I don't care
what the story is.

807
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:15,987
You hired me,
and then you hung me out to dry.

808
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,090
You don't give me cases.
You don't give me a word.

809
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:19,291
What am I supposed to do?

810
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:21,159
We both know
how you got here.

811
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,296
You expect more from me?
That's not my problem.

812
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:25,630
I do know how I got here,

813
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:28,833
which is how I know
you're not gonna fire me.

814
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:30,852
So keep your empty threats
to yourself.

815
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:33,055
When I said, "you're done,"

816
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:35,507
I meant your future
at this firm is over,

817
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:37,025
because you will
never be anything

818
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,611
more than you are
right now.

819
00:33:39,678 --> 00:33:43,482
And if you ever do
anything like that

820
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,283
to Mike Ross again,

821
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,235
I don't give a shit
what our deal was.

822
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,238
You'll be gone.

823
00:33:57,046 --> 00:33:58,363
Hey.

824
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:00,499
Remember that thing
we were gonna do to Katrina?

825
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,883
We don't need
to do it anymore.

826
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:03,968
- What are you talking about?
- Harvey just did it.

827
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,587
He went to talk to her?

828
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,806
He laid her out.

829
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:12,394
Yeah, you don't want to be
on his bad side either.

830
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:13,562
You know, we could still
send her that thing.

831
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:14,679
Really?

832
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,348
No, actually,
Harvey told me not to.

833
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,566
So?
He's not so tough.

834
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,600
Yeah,
but we could take him.

835
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:19,651
What's he gonna do?

836
00:34:19,718 --> 00:34:22,187
Talk to us with his words?

837
00:34:22,238 --> 00:34:23,321
Wag a finger at us.

838
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,489
Maybe give us a time-out.

839
00:34:24,557 --> 00:34:26,658
Maybe even slap us
with a lawsuit.

840
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,031
High five.

841
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:35,333
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:38,843
We don't need to bribe
the witnesses.

843
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,372
We need them to sue us,
right?

844
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:42,624
The alien tort statute
allows foreign nationals

845
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,209
to bring civil claims
in U.S. court.

846
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,544
And then we settle.

847
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:47,179
Might be a payoff,
but it's a legal payoff.

848
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:48,913
And the witnesses
aren't Americans,

849
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,182
so Cameron
can't subpoena them.

850
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:51,416
Exactly.

851
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:52,750
Good, but they need
a legitimate claim,

852
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:54,853
or we could be on the hook
for bribery ourselves.

853
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,054
What are they suing us for?

854
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:57,666
Harvey, they witnessed
multiple murders.

855
00:34:57,723 --> 00:34:59,441
That would be
emotionally distressing.

856
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:01,059
Might even
suffer from P.T.S.D.

857
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,644
Which would prevent them
from getting on the plane

858
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:04,112
and testifying
in our case.

859
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:05,564
Get it going.

860
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:07,399
You got a lawyer
to take the other side?

861
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,766
I have someone in mind,

862
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:10,569
but we need a way to get
those witnesses to go for it.

863
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,937
No, right now our problem
isn't getting them to go for it.

864
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:15,657
It's getting to Ava before she
gets someone to bribe them.

865
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:17,042
Hey, Harvey.

866
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:20,745
I heard about what you did
with Katrina.

867
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:23,882
I know I asked you not to,
and I wasn't going to,

868
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:26,001
but I saw her,
and I couldn't help it.

869
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,052
I get it.

870
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,453
She brings that out
in people,

871
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:32,424
but listen,
just don't let it happen again.

872
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:37,729
Son of a bitch.

873
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,886
I'd call you
a lying son of a bitch,

874
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:08,938
but you were
true to your word.

875
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:11,274
- Yeah, what word's that?
- You're not like me.

876
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:13,059
I didn't hijack
your client, Harvey.

877
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,977
Oh, no, you waited
for her to fire me,

878
00:36:15,062 --> 00:36:17,063
and then you swooped in
with an illegal fix.

879
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:18,281
You're wrong.

880
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:19,815
You gonna look me in the eye
and tell me

881
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,260
you didn't just meet with her
about bribing those witnesses?

882
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,070
That's exactly
what I met with her about.

883
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:26,122
She asked me if I was willing,
and I said I was.

884
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:29,909
I also told her that
in this particular situation,

885
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,578
it'd be counterproductive.

886
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:34,330
You looked
into Cameron Dennis.

887
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:37,083
She bribes those witnesses,
he'll be lying in wait.

888
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:38,501
And that's what
you told her?

889
00:36:38,585 --> 00:36:39,919
Yeah, amongst other things.

890
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,004
You told her
to stick with the lawyer

891
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:43,306
she picked
in the first place?

892
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,559
More or less.

893
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:47,977
Harvey, listen,
I told you,

894
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:50,179
you don't have
to trust me, okay?

895
00:36:50,264 --> 00:36:51,814
But Darby does.

896
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,182
And Darby wants this win.

897
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:54,850
Therefore, so do I.

898
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:57,270
I'm guessing you think
that means that I owe you.

899
00:36:57,321 --> 00:37:00,573
No, I think it means
you're gonna pay me.

900
00:37:06,697 --> 00:37:08,147
You look happy.

901
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:09,699
Dodged a bullet.

902
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:11,083
You got Ava back.

903
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:13,836
Stephen got Ava back.
Turns out he's here to help.

904
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:15,454
And you believe that?

905
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,707
He got Ava back.

906
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:20,426
Mike's on his way over there
as we speak.

907
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:21,427
Mike?

908
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:22,545
He made the call.

909
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:24,096
Why not let him
score the touchdown?

910
00:37:24,164 --> 00:37:26,716
And you must have
someplace else to be.

911
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,100
Blonde or brunette?

912
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:29,101
Neither.

913
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:31,938
I have to go repay a debt.

914
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:37,610
So once this is all
taken care of, I wire the money.

915
00:37:37,677 --> 00:37:42,148
And Cameron's witnesses
never take the stand.

916
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,067
Harvey told me
this maneuver was your idea.

917
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:48,988
I'm not one to take credit,
but, yes, it was.

918
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,123
He trusts you,
doesn't he?

919
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:52,524
I like to think so.

920
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:54,543
So you know
how he thinks?

921
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,045
What I know
about how Harvey thinks

922
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:58,581
is that you can never be sure
what Harvey's gonna think.

923
00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:00,466
What do you think
he thinks?

924
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:04,420
I think
that he's not really interested

925
00:38:04,504 --> 00:38:06,055
in whether
you did it or not.

926
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:08,207
He's interested
in what the evidence is

927
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:09,875
and what we can
make it say.

928
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:11,143
I want to know.

929
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:14,730
- Then you should ask him.
- I'm asking you.

930
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:19,652
I have no idea
whether Harvey thinks

931
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,822
you had those people
murdered or not,

932
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:25,324
but even if I did,
I would never say anything

933
00:38:25,392 --> 00:38:28,911
because he wouldn't
want me to.

934
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:30,363
He's picked
a good number two.

935
00:38:30,414 --> 00:38:33,115
I like to think so.

936
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,167
What do you think?

937
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:40,572
I think it's my job
to represent you

938
00:38:40,624 --> 00:38:42,758
to the best
of my ability.

939
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:44,960
To say anything else would be
as big a betrayal to Harvey

940
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:47,963
as discussing
what he thinks.

941
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:11,454
Let me guess,
you won the Testosterone 500,

942
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:12,655
and you're here to brag.

943
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:15,274
Actually,
Harvey took the checkered flag,

944
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:16,575
and I'm here for you.

945
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:18,711
Why would I go out
with a loser?

946
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:20,296
Well, losing
has its benefits.

947
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,664
If he thinks
he's a better man than me,

948
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:23,799
then he won't get jealous.

949
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:25,524
Oh, Harvey's got
nothing to be jealous of.

950
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:26,635
Not yet.

951
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,756
He will be
if you take a ride with me.

952
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:32,558
That could be dangerous.

953
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,394
Yeah.

954
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:36,462
Look,
if you think

955
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:38,230
a fancy car
and some smooth talk

956
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:40,099
is all it takes
to get to me...

957
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:46,605
Okay, I understand.

958
00:39:46,656 --> 00:39:48,574
I'm sure I can find another
connoisseur of the theater

959
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:49,658
to take to <i>MacBeth.</i>

960
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:51,327
Oh, your research
came up short.

961
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:52,611
I've already seen <i>MacBeth.</i>

962
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:55,147
Not with me,
not in the front row,

963
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:58,951
and certainly
not with Daniel Day-Lewis.

964
00:40:05,158 --> 00:40:06,342
I'm in trouble.

965
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:15,184
This is everything
I have on Tony Gianopolous.

966
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:19,472
Read it, summarize it,
and make it your life.

967
00:40:19,523 --> 00:40:20,890
I won't let you down.

968
00:40:20,974 --> 00:40:24,009
Welcome to team Litt.

969
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:28,564
Louis.

970
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:30,733
Thank you.

971
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:44,296
Here it is.
Fully executed settlement.

972
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:47,716
Signed, sealed, delivered.

973
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:49,552
Who'd you get
to represent the other side?

974
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:50,920
Harold Gunderson.

975
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:53,222
Louis' whipping boy?

976
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:55,207
Yeah, he works
for Allison Holt now,

977
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:56,425
which is actually
kind of perfect,

978
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,476
'cause everyone
knows she would

979
00:40:57,544 --> 00:40:58,761
never do anything
to help us.

980
00:40:58,845 --> 00:41:01,230
But I got Harold the job,
so--

981
00:41:01,314 --> 00:41:02,765
He owes you one.

982
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:05,267
Not anymore.

983
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:09,321
What'd you say?

984
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:11,023
What?

985
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:12,775
When Ava asked
if I thought she was guilty.

986
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,277
I told her that I had no idea
what you thought

987
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:19,248
and it was none of her business
what I thought.

988
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:24,503
Good answer.

989
00:41:29,843 --> 00:41:32,211
What about you?

990
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:33,546
You want to know
what I think?

991
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:38,100
I know what you think,
and I think it too.

992
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:40,419
She did it.

993
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:50,196
We, uh...
We never had drinks before.

994
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:52,281
I know.

995
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:54,366
Harvey,
we just admitted to each other

996
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:57,236
that we're defending
a murderer.

997
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:59,622
Doesn't really seem like
cause for celebration.

998
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:02,491
It's not a celebration.

999
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:05,878
Remember when you said
Butch and Sundance were back?

1000
00:42:05,945 --> 00:42:09,164
They weren't.

1001
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:10,966
What do you mean?

1002
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:13,219
I mean
it's time I told you

1003
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:16,755
I made a deal with Darby to
take over the firm from Jessica.

1004
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:27,075
