1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:01,405
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,854
You're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

3
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:05,106
to get your pipeline.

4
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:07,208
Guilty as charged.

5
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,555
You think
you're not replaceable?

6
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:10,161
I've been doing this
before I met you,

7
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:13,531
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

8
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:14,665
Please don't do this.

9
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,034
Your beloved associates
are mine.

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,670
What you want is
a long, drawn-out trial

11
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:20,988
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,123
I'm here to tell you

13
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:23,624
he's recusing himself
from the case.

14
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,492
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

15
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:28,546
I win, you back me
for managing partner.

16
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,464
You want
to take down Jessica.

17
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:32,216
Yes, I do.

18
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:37,271
Holy shit.

19
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,724
Was that a good "holy shit"
or a bad "holy shit"?

20
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,009
Harvey, you just told me
that you're planning a coup.

21
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,644
Give me a second
to figure that out.

22
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,513
Not a coup.
It's a move.

23
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,032
And when you're done
with your lecture--

24
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,367
No.
No lecture.

25
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:52,903
I just have one question.

26
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:56,157
Do I get my own office?

27
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,658
Harvey, if you want
to be managing partner

28
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,076
and Darby
agreed to back you,

29
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,628
then I'll follow you
to the ends of the earth.

30
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:02,747
But before we start,
I want to make sure

31
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:04,632
you're ready to do this
to Jessica.

32
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,634
I am.

33
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:10,971
Then let's go beat the shit
out of Cameron Dennis.

34
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,473
I know you don't want
to see me.

35
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,308
And yet--

36
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,726
I just wanted
to let you know that I got

37
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:18,045
a copy of the letter that
Jessica blackmailed me with,

38
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:19,546
and I made it clear to her
that I would take it

39
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,432
to the D.A.
if she ever threatened me,

40
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,017
so what I did
will never happen again.

41
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:25,552
Never should have happened
in the first place.

42
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:26,720
Close the door
on your way out.

43
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,723
Donna and I
have work to do.

44
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,199
There's a harsh reality
I need to inform you of,

45
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,668
and it's a bitter pill
to swallow.

46
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,737
But the truth is,
a mistake was made.

47
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,706
A fatal mistake.

48
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,908
And as much
as I hate to admit it,

49
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,679
our time together is done.

50
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,348
No more work,

51
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,517
no more laughter.

52
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,803
Remember?

53
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:01,188
No more mentorship

54
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:05,142
and, um, no more anything.

55
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:08,195
See, I reached too high,
and I fell.

56
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,364
And my punishment is the end
of my tenure

57
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,117
as head of the associates.

58
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,986
So I would like to leave you

59
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,489
with the immortal sentiment

60
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:21,575
of Robin Williams.

61
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,828
There have been
other associates before you.

62
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,947
They believed they
were destined for great things,

63
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:28,332
just like you.

64
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:33,170
If you just listen,

65
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:37,091
you can hear 'em whisper
their legacy to you.

66
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:39,426
Carpe diem.

67
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,181
Seize the day, people.

68
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:47,268
Make your legal lives
extraordinary.

69
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,520
Oh, Captain,
my Captain.

70
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:55,159
There was a time
I would've been relieved

71
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:58,412
to see that--
no more Louis.

72
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,446
It's just wrong.

73
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:01,148
This whole merger
is wrong.

74
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,150
How'd it go with Harvey?

75
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,201
It didn't.

76
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:05,152
Did you tell him
about Jessica?

77
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,755
Yeah.
He didn't care.

78
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,791
What?

79
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:13,093
I just wish I could give you
a hug right now,

80
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,930
but I can't because we still
want to keep us quiet.

81
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,998
Well, come on.
You can give me a hug.

82
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,600
Something could've happened.

83
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,520
Something bad,
like a...

84
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:23,554
My dog could've died.

85
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,189
Oh, you have a dog now?

86
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:28,142
I was really close
to this dog.

87
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:30,194
Well, the best way
to get over the death of a dog

88
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,645
is to get a new one.
Mmmm.

89
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:32,980
- No?
- No.

90
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:34,348
I'm just--I'm just too upset.

91
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,367
I'm--I don't know
if I'm ready

92
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,903
for a new fake dog
right now.

93
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,037
- Okay.
- Yeah.

94
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,039
Just leave me
like this.

95
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:49,836
How did it go?

96
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,275
I don't know.
Awful.

97
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:56,893
Probably the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

98
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,194
Louis, we just merged,

99
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,197
and I wish I could undo
you losing the associates,

100
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,782
but I can't.

101
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,234
What I can do

102
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,653
is take
what you've been giving

103
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,205
to so many for so long

104
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,074
and have you channel it
into one.

105
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,959
You mean...

106
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,962
I want you to mentor
your own associate.

107
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:21,334
Finally.

108
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:25,371
The D'Artagnan to my Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis.

109
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,590
All for one
and one for all.

110
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,926
<i>En garde!</i>

111
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,345
Sorry.

112
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:35,398
Jessica, wait.

113
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,317
I can have anyone?

114
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:39,903
Louis, take your pick
of the litter.

115
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,192
- Good morning, Ms. Paulsen.
- Spit it out.

116
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,660
Is that any way to start
the day?

117
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:49,112
You want something.

118
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:50,363
I need the 411
on the breakup.

119
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:52,415
- Are we in high school?
- Life is high school.

120
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,566
And I need to know
if the prom king

121
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:55,919
and his boy wonder
are still an item.

122
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,203
What high school
did you go to?

123
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:58,955
Donna,
it's a simple question.

124
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,291
Did Mike and Harvey
<i>break up</i> break up,

125
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,043
or did they take a time-out
and, like, say to each other,

126
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,546
"hey, let's see other people
and make sure that we're sure."

127
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,048
I see what's going on here.

128
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,467
Jessica feels sorry
for you,

129
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:11,885
so she's given you
your pick of the litter.

130
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,252
And now you're sniffing
around here,

131
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:15,271
trying to put the moves on Mike
behind Harvey's back.

132
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,316
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I would never do that.

133
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:19,476
No, that's why I'm here
to ask permission.

134
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,927
So ask him.

135
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:21,978
Well, I think
it might go better

136
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,029
coming
from a different source.

137
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,898
- You want me to ask him.
- Yeah.

138
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,932
Would you please?
No.

139
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:27,033
Why?

140
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,034
Because it would be
so much more fun

141
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,737
for me to listen to you
ask him.

142
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,821
Well, let me
get this straight.

143
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:33,490
You want my permission
to take Mike

144
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:35,208
and force him to be
your associate.

145
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,993
No, I would never force him
to do anything.

146
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,161
It has to be consensual.

147
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:41,447
Not like Sally Jones
and senior prom.

148
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,416
Wait a second.
Did you just admit to a crime?

149
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,752
No, a crime was committed
upon me.

150
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,954
Okay, I don't want to,
but I have to.

151
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,806
What crime?

152
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,959
My mom felt bad for Sally,
so she forced me to take her.

153
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,563
Well, what was so bad
about her?

154
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,400
She had four nipples.

155
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,569
Okay, if that date
was so bad,

156
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,938
I mean,
how did you find that out?

157
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,939
Okay, you know what,
Harvey,

158
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,574
do I have your blessing
or not?

159
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,108
Knock yourself out,
Louis.

160
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,693
See, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

161
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:12,745
You're just saying that because
you think he's gonna say no.

162
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:15,615
- Oh, I know he'll say no.
- Well, I know you're wrong.

163
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,649
So you better think
about this very carefully,

164
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,501
because once permission
is given,

165
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,987
you cannot go back.

166
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,672
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

167
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:25,157
Fine.
He's yours.

168
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:27,510
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

169
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,213
Good, 'cause
when I'm done with him,

170
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:34,601
Mike Ross will be begging
to be my associate.

Well, well,
what a surprise.

182
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:12,413
Jessica.

183
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:13,864
Last time we saw each other,

184
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:15,950
you were blackmailing me
out of my job.

185
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:17,501
Here to do it again?

186
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:18,953
Because you gave me
what you had on me.

187
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,588
I just want
to make one thing clear.

188
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:23,907
What I did to you,
I did to you.

189
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,040
Don't take it out
on Harvey.

190
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,077
Oh, that's sweet.

191
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,079
Like a mother
protecting her cub.

192
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:31,248
Take me on
anytime you want,

193
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,134
but don't punish
Harvey's client

194
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,435
for what I did.

195
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,420
You did?

196
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:39,807
You just happened on evidence
from his time

197
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:42,476
at the D.A.'s office?

198
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,729
Oh.

199
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,097
Ah.
The redhead.

200
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,449
Well, it doesn't matter,

201
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,701
because he may not have been
the one to betray me,

202
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,069
but he didn't stop it.

203
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,071
So after you threw him
under the bus and I saved him,

204
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:55,823
he should have thrown himself
back under the bus?

205
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,208
You just don't get it.

206
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,609
Yes, I do.

207
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,877
What you're really pissed at

208
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:01,945
is that he chose me
over you.

209
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:03,464
Not you.
What you are.

210
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:04,948
I put bad guys away.

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,116
You try to figure out

212
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:07,168
how to let them do
whatever they want.

213
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,552
So don't come in here
telling me

214
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,472
that I'm taking something out
on Harvey's client,

215
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,290
because I'll tell you
something--

216
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:16,293
she did this.

217
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,015
You made me a mixed tape.

218
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,634
Watch it,
and then make me an offer,

219
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:25,236
which I'll reject
because...

220
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,988
I got your client
dead to rights.

221
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:35,496
Mmm, mmm.

222
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,814
Well?

223
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:39,250
This is the best steak
I've ever had in my life.

224
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,202
That is the best steak
you <i>will</i> ever have

225
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:42,536
in your life.

226
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,088
As much as I appreciate
for once

227
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:47,174
not having to eat my lunch
from the hot dog stand,

228
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,426
what are we doing here?

229
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,845
Can't a man
just take out another man

230
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,663
in the middle of the day
for some steak and some wine

231
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:55,433
and some cheesecake that's
gonna knock your socks off?

232
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,301
Uh, some men could.

233
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:00,020
But I think you and I
both know

234
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,472
that you are not one
of those men.

235
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:03,023
- True that.
- Mm.

236
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:04,024
Want some more wine?

237
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:05,359
Don't mind if I do.

238
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,444
And you gotta
try this cheesecake.

239
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,562
Oh, no, Louis, I'm--
mm--

240
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,197
You know what I mean, right?
What do you think of that?

241
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,849
Hey, Louis! How was the steak?

242
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,117
- Heaven.
- How about you?

243
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,535
Best steak you ever had?

244
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,321
Uh, best steak
I <i>will</i> ever have.

245
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,689
You taught him well.

246
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,374
What are you guys,
brothers?

247
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:22,576
Oh, I'm just kidding.

248
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,528
Louis here's got
a lovely sister, Esther,

249
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:25,663
two wonderful parents.

250
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:26,914
Who the hell are you?

251
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,800
I am Mike Ross.
Louis and I work together.

252
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,669
I wanted him to know
who he was working for.

253
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,036
- Oh.
- And I would like you to know

254
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:34,138
who's working for you.

255
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,473
'Cause Mike here,

256
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,841
he's the best steak
you'll ever have.

257
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:38,375
You want to know
what you're working for?

258
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:42,146
Tina, Gina, Adrian.

259
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,647
They've been here 50 years
between them.

260
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:47,101
They are my family.

261
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:50,654
That's
what you're working for.

262
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,656
I-I understand.

263
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,778
I do not understand.

264
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:58,913
Eminent domain.

265
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,998
- Shit.
- Final hearing's Tuesday.

266
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,501
If we don't win, this place
becomes a shopping center.

267
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:04,735
Then this place
becomes a shopping center,

268
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:06,754
because nobody wins
eminent domain cases.

269
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:09,423
But what if we did,
Mike?

270
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,591
Then he'd get to keep
his restaurant.

271
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,043
He would get to keep
his dream,

272
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:17,548
and I would get to keep
my dream.

273
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:20,100
- And what is that?
- To rewrite the law.

274
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:21,135
And the way to do that

275
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:22,603
is to win
an un-winnable case.

276
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,605
What do you need me to do?

277
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,526
You went to see Cameron?

278
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:30,194
I was just coming
to apologize.

279
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,301
For interfering
on my case.

280
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,429
He's pissed at you.

281
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,614
He's going to take it out
on Ava.

282
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:34,815
I wanted to let him know
the person

283
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,367
he should be pissed at
is me.

284
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:37,368
Well,
it's not gonna stop him

285
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,869
from taking it out
on Ava.

286
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,154
Which is why
I was coming to apologize.

287
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:41,238
Are you also going
to apologize

288
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:42,990
for sending the message
that I need you

289
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:44,708
to help me fight
my battles for me?

290
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:45,910
I don't want
to fight Cameron for you.

291
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,711
I want to fight Cameron
with you.

292
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,129
When the evidence
is stacked against you,

293
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,715
you do what O.J. did--
you hire the dream team.

294
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,801
Oh, that's our bar?
O.J.?

295
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:56,387
Did he walk or not?

296
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:57,388
Fine.

297
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,974
But I'm Johnnie Cochran.

298
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:03,594
You know.

299
00:11:03,645 --> 00:11:04,678
You know I know.

300
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:05,846
Mike told me.

301
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,297
Nobody had to tell me
after you sent me

302
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,633
on that wild goose chase
after <i>American Gigolo.</i>

303
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:10,818
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,403
You know, it's not
that you violated

305
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,971
the sanctity
of our friendship.

306
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:17,140
It's that you violated
the sanctity of Richard Gere--

307
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,242
something
I would like to do,

308
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,693
but not the way
you did it.

309
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,862
Look, I was just trying
to get Mike back with Harvey.

310
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,247
I understand.

311
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,982
Because I never want
their thing to be our thing.

312
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,200
It's not.

313
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,918
And the way to keep it
from becoming our thing

314
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,620
is to stop talking about them.
Done.

315
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,122
So you and Mike.

316
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:33,757
I know.
It's a lot.

317
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:34,792
Do you want to talk
about it?

318
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,093
Of course I do.

319
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,378
Okay, I think
we should start

320
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,513
with the most important
emotional question.

321
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,049
Okay.

322
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,104
I'm actually
getting worried for you.

323
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,331
You don't know
the half of it.

324
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,781
Louis, you said 5:00.
It's only 4:30.

325
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,567
I've been here
since we ate.

326
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,368
I've been researching
every eminent domain case

327
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:02,987
ever tried,
starting with 1905.

328
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,204
Clark v. Nash.

329
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,205
I thought you wanted me
to be doing

330
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,523
the research?
I did.

331
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:09,827
But if I don't do it too,
how can I help you?

332
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:10,828
You're helping me?

333
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,195
Yeah.
I help you help me.

334
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:14,214
That's how it works.

335
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,716
Help me help you.

336
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,967
What?

337
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:20,370
Help me help--
it's <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

338
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:23,007
- Jerry Mc-what?
- You--

339
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,842
okay, if you've gone
over every case file,

340
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,560
then you know
that the reason nobody wins

341
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,545
is because there is no chink
in the armor.

342
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:31,882
Well, then we make
a chink of our own.

343
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,157
If I'm on a jury,

344
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,159
I'm looking at a bribe,
plain as day.

345
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:44,161
Because that's exactly
what it is.

346
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,195
I don't care
what it looks like.

347
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:46,614
There's no audio.

348
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:47,915
It's our story
versus theirs.

349
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,000
It's a shady deal
and a case full of cash.

350
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,418
Their story is going
to be more compelling.

351
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:54,254
Cameron's not going
to risk trial without more.

352
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,406
- Do you think he has audio?
- What would it say?

353
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,010
It would have this gentleman,
Colonel Mariga,

354
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,462
asking if we had
the money

355
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,847
and my number two, Nick Howell,
showing it to him.

356
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,083
Then he would thank us
for paying

357
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,052
a pollution remediation fee.

358
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,087
That sounds
environmentally sound.

359
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:11,355
Except we'd already
remediated everything

360
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,590
that needed
to be remediated.

361
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,476
Which is how you knew
it was a bribe.

362
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,061
- Yes.
- Hmm.

363
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,145
The question is,

364
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,147
did you ever use
that word in that room?

365
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,598
I may be brazen,
Mr. Specter,

366
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,033
but I am not a fool.

367
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,452
Then the audio
won't help them anyway.

368
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,037
The Colonel?

369
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,707
No, they're still in power.
He's not getting indicted.

370
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:36,714
What?

371
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,499
Cameron's got your protege.

372
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,501
No.

373
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,285
I've been grooming Nick
for ten years.

374
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:44,171
I've taught him everything
he knows.

375
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,806
Like how to bribe
a foreign government?

376
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,309
That is not the same.
He would never turn on me.

377
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:50,844
You'd be surprised
what people you trust

378
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,980
would do when someone
puts them in a position

379
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:56,400
where they think
they don't have a choice.

380
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,737
Harvey's right.

381
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,689
Once someone puts
another person down the path

382
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:03,807
of bending the law,

383
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:04,858
people tend to turn
on each other.

384
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,143
You don't know him.

385
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,445
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

386
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:09,663
A few days ago.

387
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,532
Call him.
He won't take your call.

388
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,117
You're wrong.

389
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:16,319
He always takes my calls.

390
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:18,172
Hi, it's Nick.
Leave a message.

391
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:21,208
Let me tell you
what that message really said.

392
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,843
"Hi, Ava.
It's Nick.

393
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,887
"I'm not here right now
because I'm cutting a deal

394
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,047
to sell you out."

395
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,944
- Hey.
- Hey.

396
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:36,735
How's it going with Louis?

397
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,488
You know,
it's actually not bad.

398
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,706
But the truth is,

399
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,625
I would rather be--

400
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:43,826
- No.
- What? Come on.

401
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,211
It's the middle
of the night.

402
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:46,212
Louis could be back
at any minute.

403
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:47,913
- I can be fast.
- I know.

404
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:51,366
That was a one-time thing.

405
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,422
Mm, mm, mm.
Enough, enough.

406
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:58,891
But I--
okay.

407
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,227
Yeah, you're probably right.

408
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,761
The last person
we want catching us is Louis.

409
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:03,896
Did it ever occur to you

410
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,481
that's he's trying
to recruit you?

411
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:06,682
Can we just
for once assume

412
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,235
that Louis doesn't have
an ulterior motive?

413
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,938
I got us
some refreshments.

414
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:16,659
I will leave you two
to your work.

415
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:18,160
- So?
- Yeah.

416
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:20,062
Louis, it's the middle
of the night.

417
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:21,229
Where did you get all this?

418
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:24,250
I'm the new quartermaster,
remember?

419
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:25,618
Okay.

420
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:28,454
Here, check this out.

421
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,758
Whoa, no one's thought
to come at it this way.

422
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:34,376
Mike, this is outstanding.

423
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:36,411
I actually got the idea
from a movie.

424
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,914
- <i>Moneyball.</i>
- <i>I thought you hated sports.</i>

425
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:39,965
<i>Moneyball</i>
<i>isn't about sports.</i>

426
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,171
- It's about math.
- Exactly.

427
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:43,135
One problem.
It's outside the scope.

428
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,604
- What if it weren't?
- What if I could fly?

429
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:46,722
Well, I can't help you
with that.

430
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:47,806
But if we want to get it
in the scope,

431
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:48,941
we just have to get
the other side

432
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,644
to put it there for us.

433
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:04,373
Morning.

434
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,325
Nice Mustang, Harvey.

435
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:08,627
I see you're still trying
to be Steve McQueen.

436
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:09,778
Not trying.

437
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:11,413
Being.

438
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:14,282
This is the scene
where he corners the asshole.

439
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,418
Speaking of movies,
did you enjoy

440
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,803
the one that I sent over?

441
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:20,288
It's not often we get
the whole crime on film.

442
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,509
All you have is a silent film
with no proof of anything.

443
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,094
And by the way, I'm going
to have you sanctioned

444
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:26,294
for withholding evidence.

445
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,797
I gave you that video
in a timely manner.

446
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,182
You gave us that video,

447
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,684
so we'd take our eyes
off Nick.

448
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,852
Nick who?

449
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:36,405
The Nick you have stashed
in a hotel room somewhere.

450
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:37,573
Oh, that Nick.

451
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,074
Now that you mention it,

452
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:42,494
I probably should put him

453
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,780
on my witness list.

454
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,982
I'm a little
out of practice.

455
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:49,118
Yeah.

456
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:51,120
There you go.

457
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:53,622
Now...
Why don't you get

458
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:57,325
that piece of shit
out of my driveway, okay?

459
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:01,797
The first time
I ever had steak,

460
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:04,216
it was at Peter's.

461
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,668
I mean,
I'd had steak before...

462
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,105
But I never
<i>had</i> steak before.

463
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,774
But that's not
why I'm here today.

464
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,392
You see,
halfway through the meal,

465
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:14,610
Peter came
over to my table,

466
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:17,529
and he asked
how I'd liked it.

467
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,514
He wanted to know
because he cared.

468
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,400
He cared about me.

469
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:24,236
I don't make friends
very easily,

470
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,622
but the second I set foot
in Peter's Steakhouse,

471
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,074
I had made a friend
for life.

472
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,193
And that is how Peter
treats every single person

473
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:32,294
who walks
through his door.

474
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,712
So I don't care
what they say.

475
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:36,999
Your Honor,
this is not a public benefit.

476
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,336
Your Honor, I'm...
I'm touched.

477
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:42,638
He makes me want to run
right over there

478
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:44,306
and get a steak.

479
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,308
But as for the Supreme Court
decision in Kelo,

480
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,310
public benefit is determined
on a quantitative,

481
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,045
not qualitative basis.

482
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,730
Well, I'm glad
you brought up Kelo,

483
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,316
because we happen to have
some quantitative evidence

484
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:55,317
right here.

485
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:57,269
Kelo was decided in 2005.

486
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:59,021
Eight years later
and still,

487
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:01,023
nothing has been built
on this land.

488
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:03,776
No jobs created, no taxes
collected, no money made.

489
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,694
Zero quantitative benefit.

490
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:08,447
Just because they say
it will be better

491
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:10,165
doesn't mean
it actually will be.

492
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:13,419
Even if it were true,
we have every right to do it.

493
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:16,088
The state determines benefit,
not the court,

494
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,539
and until such time
as the law is changed,

495
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,241
you have no authority to affect
the state's determination.

496
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:20,876
Uh, Your Honor, you can
establish authority today.

497
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,044
There's no basis for that.

498
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:23,429
You have no choice
but to uphold

499
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:26,265
the established practice
of eminent domain.

500
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:28,517
I'm afraid opposing counsel
is right.

501
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:31,804
Demolition begins next week.

502
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:35,808
I just remembered something
about <i>Moneyball.</i>

503
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:39,778
The A's never actually
won the World Series.

504
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:41,429
I'm sorry, Louis.

505
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:42,865
Now is not the time
to be sorry.

506
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:45,367
What is it the time for?

507
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,236
Get in.

508
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,955
Nah, I think I'm good.

509
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,207
Mike, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

510
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:54,209
It's just good, clean mud.

511
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,078
That doesn't make
any sense.

512
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,379
Is this about the fact
that I'm in the nude?

513
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,131
Please don't harp on that.

514
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:00,582
Yeah, I'm just saying,
I know

515
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:01,800
how the younger generation
gets hung up on that stuff,

516
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:03,051
but you don't have to worry

517
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,386
because you have
your own self-contained unit.

518
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,389
Okay, if I get in,
will you stop saying words?

519
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:17,844
You know,
if you go in with boxers,

520
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:19,131
you're not gonna
have them later.

521
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:22,154
You're gonna have
to go smokeless.

522
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:35,650
That disloyal piece
of filth.

523
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:37,252
Believe me,
I know how you feel.

524
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,820
Do you?

525
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:41,206
Because I've heard you prefer
to work alone.

526
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,041
Well, I don't.

527
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,993
I may have been above him
when we started,

528
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:46,328
but for the last two years,

529
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:48,463
we worked together
side by side.

530
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:51,383
I'm not a sentimental person,
but it meant something to me,

531
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,028
and I thought it meant
something to him.

532
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:56,221
- He deserves to be shot.
- He does.

533
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,440
But I suggest
we promote him instead.

534
00:19:58,507 --> 00:19:59,808
You want to give him
a new title

535
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,276
to keep him
from testifying?

536
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:04,530
I believe it will require
a substantial raise as well.

537
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:05,697
You know
that's not what I meant.

538
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:07,115
You're suggesting
bribing a man

539
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:08,483
to get you
out of your bribery charge.

540
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:10,819
"In for a penny,
in for a pound,"

541
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,321
mother always said.

542
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:14,790
This is
what Cameron wanted.

543
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:17,042
He didn't give us that video
so we wouldn't find Nick.

544
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:19,328
He gave us Nick,
so you'd try to bribe him.

545
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,079
Well,
how can you know that?

546
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:22,864
Because Cameron knows
people are who they are.

547
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,033
You bribed once,
you'll bribe again.

548
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,385
Well, then what are you
suggesting I do?

549
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:27,836
Because I'm going to make
a run at him.

550
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:31,924
No, I'm gonna
make a run at him.

551
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:39,565
Louis.

552
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:41,316
Yeah?

553
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,685
This is the best damn mud
I've ever had.

554
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,388
Hey, I--

555
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,442
I know why you picked me
for this case.

556
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,327
I wouldn't have picked you
if you didn't.

557
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,062
If you wanted me to be
your associate,

558
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:55,948
why didn't you just ask?

559
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:56,999
Because you would've
said no.

560
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:59,868
- Louis, come on.
- No, Mike.

561
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,370
I know what people
think of me,

562
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:03,071
and I know
what you think of me.

563
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:04,572
I knew you'd remember

564
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:06,008
all the bad things
about working with me.

565
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,626
I just wanted to remind you
of some of the good ones.

566
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,511
I remember
all the good ones,

567
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:11,263
but I also remember
after those things,

568
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:12,881
you going back to being

569
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:14,967
the same Louis I met
the first day of work.

570
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:17,769
The Louis who fired someone
right in front of my face

571
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:20,922
for the sole purpose
of teaching me to be afraid.

572
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:23,859
You're right.

573
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:27,112
I remember you once said
that my actions matter

574
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:28,897
and that it's not water
under the bridge.

575
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:30,699
You've changed me.

576
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:33,318
You make me want to be
a better man.

577
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:35,570
Wait, are you saying
I complete you?

578
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,205
You have seen <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

579
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:38,707
No, I'm quoting
my cinema hero,

580
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:40,942
the character of Melvin Udall,
expertly portrayed

581
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:42,577
by Jack Nicholson
in <i>As Good As It Gets.</i>

582
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,963
- Oh. Never saw it.
- Oh, well, then you're lucky.

583
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:46,381
Why is that?

584
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:47,749
Because you can still see it
for the first time.

585
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:53,171
The first time.

586
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:54,973
- Yeah.
- That's it, the first time.

587
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,791
- What?
- The judge.

588
00:21:56,843 --> 00:21:58,927
You were making your argument
about the first time.

589
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:00,858
He wanted to rule in our favor,
but he couldn't.

590
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,898
I know, that's why we need him
to rewrite the law.

591
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:04,149
No, we don't,
because there's already

592
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,318
a provision in the law
that works for us.

593
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,569
It's in section--
No, no, no, no.

594
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:10,322
First of all,
I cannot mix work

595
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:11,907
with mudding, okay?

596
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:12,908
Let's hit the showers.

597
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:14,660
I can't wait to stick it

598
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:16,244
to opposing counsel.

599
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:18,246
Do you need me to give you
a hand out of there?

600
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:26,719
I know who you are.

601
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,021
You shouldn't be here.

602
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,939
No, Nick.
You shouldn't be here.

603
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:30,940
I'd like you to go.

604
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:33,276
No.
You wouldn't.

605
00:22:33,343 --> 00:22:34,727
You'd like to give me
five minutes

606
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,479
to see if I can get you
out of the box you're in

607
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,482
before you sell your soul.

608
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:47,574
I didn't want to do this.

609
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,192
You wouldn't let me in
if you did.

610
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,877
I had no choice.

611
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,629
Ava's in trouble
whether I testify or not.

612
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:54,297
That's what Cameron
wants you to believe.

613
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:57,333
- You haven't seen the video?
- I saw a business transaction.

614
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:59,586
- You don't believe that.
- I can sell that.

615
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,221
You just got to keep your head
and shut your mouth.

616
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:02,338
Just do
what you're here to do.

617
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:03,640
Threaten me,
or offer me a deal.

618
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:05,975
- I've considered both.
- Cameron said you would.

619
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:07,894
Cameron's wrong.

620
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:09,018
I'm not going to do either

621
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:11,648
because I think
you care about Ava.

622
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,516
I do.

623
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,602
Then think about this.

624
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,403
Whatever deal
Cameron offered you,

625
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:19,689
it's based on a lie.
He doesn't have anything.

626
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,724
He's just trying to use
your fear

627
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,276
to pit you against Ava.

628
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,640
Look, I've seen it happen
before,

629
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,197
and the one thing
I can tell you is

630
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:28,865
you go through with it,
you'll regret it

631
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:29,999
for the rest of your life.

632
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,834
Because she'll
never forgive me.

633
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:35,004
Because you'll never
forgive yourself.

634
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:39,542
Okay, what is so important
that we need

635
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,010
to have
an emergency hearing?

636
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,246
Your Honor, we need to be
heard before demolition starts.

637
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,337
What's he going to do now,

638
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,598
tell us
about his first demolition?

639
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:47,133
It was riveting,
but this has nothing to do that.

640
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,801
Your Honor,
based on the new zoning

641
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,046
put through
for their project,

642
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,055
we're simply asking
for a revised valuation

643
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:54,807
of the property
that they're taking.

644
00:23:57,528 --> 00:23:58,778
$100 million?

645
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:00,280
That valuation
has no basis.

646
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:01,814
It has
a mathematical basis.

647
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,816
Specifically, the present
value of future cash flow,

648
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,101
as shown right there.

649
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,602
Bullshit. You've heard
of voodoo economics.

650
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,954
This is voodoo math.

651
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:10,239
They're making crazy assumptions
to inflate their value.

652
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:11,607
Just like Kelo,
but that really

653
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,076
didn't seem to bother you
when it was in your favor.

654
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:14,544
Your Honor,
this is ludicrous.

655
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:15,712
They're only picking
that number

656
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:16,663
because they know
it makes our project

657
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,114
too expensive
to be feasible.

658
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,582
Well, in the words
of opposing counsel,

659
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:22,835
even if that were true,
we have every right to do it.

660
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:27,257
Hi, Donna.
I love your dress.

661
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:28,841
And I love
when you compliment me

662
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:29,892
before you ask
for something.

663
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,511
You're so insightful.

664
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,013
Look, I know we said
Harvey and Mike's problem

665
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,232
isn't our problem,
but Louis is stealing Mike.

666
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,734
It's not stealing
when someone's available

667
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:38,818
for the taking.

668
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:40,403
You knew?

669
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,522
When do I not know?

670
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,326
Louis asked
for Harvey's blessing with Mike,

671
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:45,325
and he gave it.

672
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,576
Why didn't you tell me?

673
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,810
Because we agreed
that their problem

674
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,279
isn't our problem.
I know.

675
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,830
But Harvey
doesn't really want this.

676
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:53,783
- And you know that because--
- Because he can't.

677
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,785
Look, he needs you
to do your Donna thing

678
00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:57,337
and help him get over it.

679
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:00,590
Harvey listens to me because
I tell him what I believe.

680
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:03,509
What do you believe?

681
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:10,300
That Mike betrayed Harvey.

682
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,552
- Mike was blackmailed.
- And then he betrayed Harvey.

683
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,104
- Donna, how can you--
- How can I what?

684
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:16,806
I just spent
the last year hiding

685
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,107
your boyfriend's
double life.

686
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:19,976
I'd say I'm
a pretty understanding person.

687
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:21,844
But what I don't understand
is when someone

688
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,862
takes loyalty like that,

689
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:24,680
and they throw it
in the garbage.

690
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,034
Would you like me
to say that to Harvey?

691
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,737
Sorry I asked.
Won't happen again.

692
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,623
- Yeah, that was awesome.
- That was a great job, Mike.

693
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,458
- Thanks, Louis.
- Rachel.

694
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:38,161
- Looks like you won.
- The judge is ruling tomorrow.

695
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:40,463
Then what were you
just celebrating?

696
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,298
Well, we were
dead in the water,

697
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:43,800
and now we have
a fighting chance.

698
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:47,503
I'm glad.

699
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:48,671
Is something wrong?

700
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:51,224
Oh, I just got
into a fight with Donna.

701
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:52,708
About what?

702
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,893
I went to tell her about you
and Louis, and she just--

703
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:56,012
You went to Donna
about me and Louis?

704
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:57,764
- I thought she could help.
- You what?

705
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,349
I thought if she knew,
she'd go to Harvey,

706
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
and they'd just put
an end to it.

707
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:01,984
Someone butting in
and telling him what to do

708
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:03,603
is only going to push him
further away.

709
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,321
I didn't tell him
what to do.

710
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,440
I went to Donna.
If Donna tells him,

711
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,491
all it says is
that I'm too weak

712
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:09,992
to fight my own battles.

713
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,341
God, if it's coming from you,
that makes it so much worse.

714
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,247
Why?

715
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:15,898
What?

716
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:24,707
Harvey forbid me
to tell you anything.

717
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:26,709
You and Harvey
talked about me?

718
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,344
After we went out,
I went to him,

719
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,533
I said I wanted
to tell you--

720
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,930
And he said
I wasn't trustworthy.

721
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:32,098
It's not that.

722
00:26:32,182 --> 00:26:33,099
He didn't want you
to go out with me.

723
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:34,300
No, it's not that either.

724
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,386
He didn't have a problem
with us going out, he--

725
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:40,189
Oh, so it's okay if you
screwed me so long as you lied.

726
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:41,474
Rachel.

727
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,925
Oh, my God.

728
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,477
That's why you cut things
off with me.

729
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,279
- I didn't want to lie to you.
- I can't believe him.

730
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:47,930
Rachel, he didn't
just risk everything

731
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,365
he had for me once.

732
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:51,067
When Jessica found out,
he put everything

733
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:52,985
he had on the line
for me again.

734
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,204
I hope you know as you
stand here defending him,

735
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:57,623
he has no intention
of ever forgiving you.

736
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,460
Because I found out when Louis
asked Harvey for his blessing,

737
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:02,328
he said, "Take him.
He's all yours."

738
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,796
So instead
of getting mad at me

739
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,215
for trying to get Harvey
to forgive you,

740
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:07,216
maybe you should
get pissed at Harvey

741
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:10,303
and think about moving on.

742
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:19,312
What the hell
is wrong with you?

743
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:22,682
I said I was sorry,
I gave back the office,

744
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,268
I helped you with your case,
I even blackmailed Jessica.

745
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,936
Harvey, I get that you
are pissed off at me,

746
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,070
but eventually,

747
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:29,355
you are going
to have to forgive me.

748
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,441
Forgive you for what,
making me hire Katrina?

749
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:33,809
Getting high on the job
your first week?

750
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,578
Betraying me
with Jessica?

751
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:38,614
Or for telling Rachel
about your secret?

752
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,585
You cut me loose.

753
00:27:42,652 --> 00:27:44,003
Okay?
You fired me.

754
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:46,038
I was at my lowest point.
She was there for me.

755
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,656
She's still there for me.

756
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:48,758
Congratulations.

757
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,146
I hope you two
are happy together.

758
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:51,928
So you're gonna punish me
by giving me to Louis?

759
00:27:51,995 --> 00:27:53,429
Well, let me
tell you something.

760
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,630
It failed.

761
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:56,516
I actually like
working for Louis.

762
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,601
He makes me feel
like I'm working with him,

763
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:00,303
not for him.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

764
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:02,054
Because I didn't give you
to Louis as punishment,

765
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:06,726
I gave you to Louis
because you and I are done.

766
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,845
Harvey,
I regret what I did.

767
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,981
But I'm telling you right now,
you're gonna regret this.

768
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:15,785
Maybe you didn't hear me.

769
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:18,488
I said you and I...

770
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,856
We're done.

771
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:32,335
Whatever it is, I'm not really
in the mood right now.

772
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:35,671
Harvey,
I know how Cameron works.

773
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,306
He's setting something up.

774
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:38,925
You think
I don't know that?

775
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,876
He's setting Ava up
to bribe Nick.

776
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,646
- Isn't that what you just did?
- No.

777
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:45,097
I went to him and told him

778
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,599
he'd regret being disloyal
to her.

779
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,235
Something I know
a little bit about.

780
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,220
Harvey, do you know
what started it

781
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,989
between the Hatfields
and the McCoys?

782
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:56,659
I didn't catch the miniseries,
but I heard Costner killed it.

783
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:57,726
Doesn't matter.

784
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:58,911
Because whoever
they say started it,

785
00:28:58,996 --> 00:29:00,279
I guarantee you,

786
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,783
the other side says,
"bullshit."

787
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,452
You went to Darby
for this merger behind my back.

788
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:09,905
And then you picked a fight
with him behind my back.

789
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,291
And then you
blackmailed Mike behind mine.

790
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,010
And I was only able
to do that

791
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:15,845
because you brought a fraud

792
00:29:15,912 --> 00:29:17,413
into my firm
in the first place.

793
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,131
So you do think
it's my fault?

794
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,969
What I think is
I regret where we are,

795
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,022
and I've been trying to get us
back to where we were.

796
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,857
And what would the evidence
of that be?

797
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:30,226
What evidence
would you like?

798
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:31,360
Why don't you
tell me the truth

799
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:34,263
about why the hell
I'm on this case?

800
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,115
All right, Harvey.

801
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,766
I lied to you.

802
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,953
When I told you I fought
to get you on this case,

803
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:42,121
I didn't.

804
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:43,739
Darby made that call.

805
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,209
And I used it as an opportunity
to reach out to you.

806
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:49,545
- "Used."
- To reach out to you.

807
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:53,299
Which I am now here doing
without using anything.

808
00:29:53,383 --> 00:29:55,051
So do you want
to let it go or not?

809
00:29:55,118 --> 00:29:56,952
I want to know one thing.

810
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,787
If you had it to do over,

811
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,340
would you do it again?

812
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:06,729
Deposition's on the books
with Cameron tomorrow.

813
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:09,732
You want me there or not?

814
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:20,574
Harvey, I'd introduce
you to Nick,

815
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:22,706
but I understand
you two already met

816
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:24,240
when you witness-tampered.

817
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,759
Nick works
for Hessington Oil.

818
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:26,927
We're their lawyers.

819
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,428
Therefore,
I didn't witness-tamper.

820
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:29,596
And if you say it again,

821
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:30,681
I'm gonna slap you
with a slander suit.

822
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:32,883
Well, let me slap you
with something.

823
00:30:32,934 --> 00:30:35,519
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video somehow,

824
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:36,920
and he gave it
to your shareholders.

825
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:38,271
They're filing
some sort of lawsuit.

826
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:39,806
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

827
00:30:39,891 --> 00:30:42,359
You son of a bitch.
You leaked it.

828
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,760
I deny that.

829
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,095
And if your client
says that again,

830
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,481
I will slap her
with a slander suit

831
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:49,733
to go
alongside her bribery charges.

832
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:52,335
And by the way,

833
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:53,570
Nick wasn't swayed

834
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:56,123
by your attempt to tug
at his heartstrings.

835
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:57,908
Emotional pleas?

836
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,459
What did you do to him,
Jessica?

837
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:01,161
This is not the kid
I mentored.

838
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:03,163
Hold on a sec.

839
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:05,632
You were never my mentor.
Jessica was.

840
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:08,552
You're just
a fast-talking car salesman

841
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,088
that hides behind the line,
"I do good."

842
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:14,141
Now get out of my face
while I confer with my client.

843
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,564
You told me
you knew this man.

844
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:22,599
I thought
that was an advantage.

845
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,851
Instead, you've goaded him
into orchestrating

846
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:26,186
an attempt
to take over my company.

847
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,605
You know
how sometimes the doctor says

848
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:30,607
you're gonna feel worse
before you feel better?

849
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:33,309
- What are you saying?
- What he's saying is

850
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:37,280
let us know how you feel
in half an hour.

851
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,671
- Hey.
- Hey.

852
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:46,006
Do you have a second?

853
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,507
I want to talk to you
about how we left things.

854
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:50,093
I don't know,
did you run it by Harvey first?

855
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:51,595
- What?
- I understand

856
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:54,514
that he has final say on who
his employees fraternize with.

857
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,050
Look.

858
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:59,553
Harvey wasn't just
trying to protect himself,

859
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:00,854
Mike, Jessica, and me.

860
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:02,389
He was also trying
to protect you.

861
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:05,525
Right, my protection's
at the top of Harvey's agenda.

862
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,611
He barely knows who I am.
Rachel.

863
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:08,845
And if he did know me,

864
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:10,313
he would know
that I would never tell anyone.

865
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,398
Okay, look.

866
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:12,682
You want to be mad
at Harvey, fine.

867
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:13,984
But you might as well
be mad at me,

868
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:17,037
because I told Mike
the same thing.

869
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:19,122
What?

870
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,356
I dragged Mike
into Harvey's office,

871
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:23,160
and I told him
that Harvey was right.

872
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:25,361
- That Mike should lie to me?
- No.

873
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:28,582
I told him
that he should get over you.

874
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:37,207
Was that before
or after I came to you

875
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:38,875
and told you
that I kissed him

876
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:42,095
and that I called him
and told him how I felt?

877
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,181
It was after.

878
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:45,982
You told him
not to be with me,

879
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,211
and then you let me think
that he didn't care about me.

880
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:50,904
No,
I told him what I thought,

881
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:52,105
and then I tried

882
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,710
to help you move on
because their truth

883
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:54,891
wasn't mine to tell you.

884
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:55,859
I thought you were my friend.

885
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,943
I am.

886
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:58,411
You cared more
about protecting Harvey

887
00:32:58,496 --> 00:32:59,446
than protecting me.

888
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,415
Yes, Rachel!
That's my job.

889
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:09,072
I get that everyone's jobs
are important.

890
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:11,174
This wasn't about a job
for me.

891
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:14,127
It was about having a life.

892
00:33:14,212 --> 00:33:17,681
But I guess
you wouldn't understand that.

893
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,468
Rachel...

894
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:24,804
I'm going to walk away
before you and I can't go back.

895
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,478
It's the second largest
oil deposit found

896
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:32,946
in the last decade.

897
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,032
We had the contract for it,
but to get it out of the E.I.R.,

898
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,485
we needed the pipeline.
What were you told?

899
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:39,602
And by whom?

900
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:41,321
We were told
by Colonel Mariga

901
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:43,540
we could build the pipeline
if we paid

902
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,709
a pollution remediation fee.
But?

903
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:46,960
We'd already remediated
everything

904
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:48,545
that needed
to be remediated.

905
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,915
So what was the fee for?

906
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,466
It was a bribe.

907
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:55,969
And Ava Hessington
paid this fee

908
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:58,672
with the full knowledge
that it was a bribe?

909
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:02,008
Yes, she did.

910
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:03,643
On this screen here, Nick,

911
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:06,563
are you sliding
a briefcase full of cash

912
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,515
across the table
to Colonel Mariga?

913
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,934
Yes.

914
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:13,270
And you were aware
it was a bribe?

915
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,304
Yes, but--

916
00:34:14,355 --> 00:34:17,407
How was Ms. Hessington
as a boss?

917
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,309
She taught me
a great deal.

918
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,411
- Did she trust you?
- I believe so.

919
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,446
- Rely on you?
- Yes.

920
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:24,480
Did she look
over your shoulder

921
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:25,749
on everything you did?

922
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,450
No.

923
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,785
Was she aware
of everything you did?

924
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,486
She was aware of this.

925
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,455
Yet all we have
is your word on that.

926
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:34,007
So let me get this straight.

927
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:36,626
She groomed you,
promoted you,

928
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:39,662
gave you autonomy,
then you engineered a bribe.

929
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:40,797
And when you got caught,

930
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,766
you cut a deal

931
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,968
to lay that bribe
on your mentor.

932
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,436
Is that correct?

933
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:47,437
She knew.

934
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,723
Yes.
You claimed that before.

935
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,609
If Ava Hessington
were convicted of this crime,

936
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:54,116
who would be considered
next in line?

937
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:55,678
That's speculative.

938
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,230
Is it at all possible
it would be you?

939
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:00,483
Yes.

940
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:03,870
Wow, sounds like
you have a lot to lose

941
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:05,521
and even more to gain.

942
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:07,123
We're not in court.

943
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,492
Your testimony
doesn't help you here.

944
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:10,827
No, but we wanted
to give you a taste

945
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:12,362
of what it would be like
in court

946
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:14,497
when Nick still won't be able
to look her in the eye

947
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:17,167
when he stabs her
in the back.

948
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,640
We won.

949
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,558
- We did?
- We did.

950
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,347
I just want
to say one thing.

951
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:31,481
You know,
if Harvey had the power

952
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,383
to become Mariano Rivera,
he would,

953
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,685
because Harvey
doesn't love the law.

954
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:38,688
It's just his vehicle
for forcing

955
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:39,779
his will on his opponents,

956
00:35:39,824 --> 00:35:42,025
for winning.

957
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,827
But you see, Mike, that's not
how I feel about the law.

958
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,079
I love the law.

959
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:47,864
And I'd never trade it
for anything.

960
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:50,583
I love it too.
I also like winning.

961
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:53,119
I know.

962
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:56,089
You know what I think?

963
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:59,092
I think you're half Harvey
and you're half me.

964
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:00,844
You've had your time
with him.

965
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,129
Now have your time
with me.

966
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:09,777
You here for an interview?

967
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,100
They let you go already?

968
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:12,435
You made your point.

969
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,904
If we go to trial,
you eviscerate Nick.

970
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:16,155
But we still have that video,

971
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:19,609
she's on it,
and he says she knew.

972
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:22,361
And you know what?
The truth is I believe him.

973
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:24,330
And I'll make them
believe him.

974
00:36:24,397 --> 00:36:27,750
Then why are you here?

975
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:30,002
Nice job, Harvey.
You got me.

976
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,587
They want you
to cut a deal.

977
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,589
Against my recommendation.

978
00:36:33,674 --> 00:36:35,675
I guess they know
what you don't.

979
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:37,426
You can't beat me.
Here are our terms.

980
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:39,578
No, here are my terms.

981
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,214
Our original offer stands.

982
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,132
Hessington Oil
pleads no contest,

983
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:45,051
we pay a $50-million fine,

984
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,887
and all criminal charges
against Ava are dropped.

985
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:49,755
They were going
to go for that,

986
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:52,024
but I convinced them
to make one change,

987
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:53,943
nonnegotiable.

988
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:57,446
Ava Hessington
doesn't plead no contest.

989
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:59,699
She pleads guilty.

990
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:01,234
And you get
to call it a win.

991
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,619
Well, the record
is going to say guilty.

992
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:05,121
It <i>is</i> a win.

993
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:07,073
I can beat you,

994
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,791
and I did,

995
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,626
and it's going
to eat you up.

996
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:12,611
Dennis, one.

997
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,716
Specter, zero.

998
00:37:16,783 --> 00:37:19,835
Take it or leave it.

999
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:23,089
- This deal is bullshit.
- Harvey.

1000
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,890
Cameron can say
what he wants.

1001
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,342
Darby asked you
to take this case.

1002
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:28,094
No way he doesn't
consider this a win.

1003
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,012
I don't consider it
a win.

1004
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,847
Do you really want to gamble
five years of her life,

1005
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:33,766
so you can prove
you're better than Cameron?

1006
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:35,737
You know as well as I do,
he's only offering this

1007
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:37,486
'cause he knows
he's got a loser.

1008
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:39,305
It's the exact same deal
we offered

1009
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,856
with one technical change.

1010
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:42,658
Do you know how they enter
a technical knockout

1011
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:43,776
in the record books?

1012
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,861
As a knockout.

1013
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,833
I would.

1014
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,084
What?

1015
00:37:52,152 --> 00:37:55,288
You asked me before
if I'd do it again.

1016
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,956
I would.

1017
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,009
You put me
in that position again,

1018
00:38:00,093 --> 00:38:02,511
and I'll do
whatever I have to do to win.

1019
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:04,930
Because we win.

1020
00:38:04,998 --> 00:38:07,683
Are you saying screw
this deal, let's kick his ass?

1021
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:08,768
No.

1022
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:10,853
I'm saying take the deal.

1023
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:13,672
We already did.

1024
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,784
Sorry.

1025
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:26,518
Me too.

1026
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,020
You were just trying
to help me.

1027
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:29,238
Yeah, but I shouldn't
have said something

1028
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:31,824
I knew would hurt you
just to end an argument.

1029
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:34,493
I don't want
to keep secrets from you.

1030
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:37,529
You don't have to.

1031
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,216
So Louis asked me.

1032
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,251
And what did you say?

1033
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,670
I told him I needed
some time to think about it,

1034
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:47,556
and then
I came straight here.

1035
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:49,759
So you're really
just apologizing

1036
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,677
because you need
my advice.

1037
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:52,728
Well, I also want sex.

1038
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,096
You can have one
or the other.

1039
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:55,181
I really don't need
any advice.

1040
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:10,579
It's a good deal, Ava.
Don't second-guess yourself.

1041
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:14,233
I'm not in the habit
of second-guessing myself.

1042
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:16,252
No, I just realized
when I get back to London,

1043
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:18,587
my right hand
is going to be gone.

1044
00:39:18,672 --> 00:39:19,955
Your right hand
sold you out.

1045
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,006
You made it
seem like he did it

1046
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:22,208
for his own personal gain,

1047
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,844
but he did it
for his own survival.

1048
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:26,045
He still did it.

1049
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:27,079
But that doesn't mean

1050
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,099
I'm not going to miss him.

1051
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,471
Good-bye, Harvey.

1052
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:37,256
Goodbye, Ava.

1053
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:44,697
Do you want me
to send a copy to Darby?

1054
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:46,565
I do.

1055
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:47,933
I thought maybe
working with Jessica

1056
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,452
would change your mind
about taking over the firm.

1057
00:39:49,536 --> 00:39:51,954
- It didn't.
- Why not?

1058
00:39:52,038 --> 00:39:53,489
Because if she had it
to do all over again,

1059
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:55,941
she would.

1060
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:58,828
Harvey,
if this whole thing

1061
00:39:58,912 --> 00:40:01,113
is really Jessica's fault,

1062
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:04,450
maybe it's time
we considered forgiving Mike.

1063
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:12,391
If she's not vacuuming
properly, then just fire her.

1064
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:13,559
It doesn't matter.

1065
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:14,560
You'll get someone--

1066
00:40:14,627 --> 00:40:16,645
Mom, I gotta go.
Bye.

1067
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,468
You make me want
to be a better man.

1068
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,154
- You watched it?
- Loved it.

1069
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:28,324
Well, you had me
at hello.

1070
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:30,910
You watched
<i>Jerry Maguire?</i>

1071
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:32,695
Jerry, did you know
the human head weighs 8 pounds?

1072
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,413
These are the A.B.C.s
of me, baby!

1073
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:37,149
Show me the money!

1074
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:40,786
Ahh.

1075
00:40:40,837 --> 00:40:42,621
You know, normally, I wouldn't
want to jinx anything,

1076
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:44,156
but I got us something.
Okay.

1077
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:45,491
It’s the perfect way to consummate
our relationship.

1078
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,509
So just wait right here.
It's in the kitchen.

1079
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,511
Sure.

1080
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:03,192
I can't let you do this.

1081
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:06,512
Let me?

1082
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,864
Don't do this.

1083
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:15,154
I already said yes.

1084
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:16,789
I can't go back
on my word.

1085
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:19,708
You're not going back
on your word.

1086
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:22,127
You're going back
where you belong.

1087
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:28,384
I am.

1088
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:34,039
I am sorry.

1089
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,707
I know.

1090
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:39,178
Look, why don't you
take tonight off

1091
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:42,231
and go out
with your girlfriend?

1092
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:53,275
Thanks, Harvey.

1093
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,160
No, we're going up top.

1094
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:56,745
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1095
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,748
But if you come in
late tomorrow, you're fired.

1096
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,367
We'll see.
