1
00:00:01,437 --> 00:00:03,029
I get Ava Hessington acquitted,

2
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:05,106
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,775
I don't want it anymore.
Get out of my sight.

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,560
You called Mariga
to offer him a bribe.

5
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:10,745
Doesn't matter--
Dennis never

6
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:11,829
had him in the first place.

7
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:12,863
But he does now.

8
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,082
You're saying
he traced my call.

9
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:18,085
You're suing me for ownership
of the Mikado?

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,237
He said he might as well
have left his cat

11
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,340
with Michael Vick.

12
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:23,874
I'm offering you
a settlement.

13
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:27,178
You get back the associates,
I get back my cat.

14
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:28,879
Clifford Danner is 18.

15
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:31,682
I put him in jail 12 years ago.
He's innocent.

16
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,916
Cameron buried the evidence.

17
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:34,769
Emmanuel Mariga,
20 years ago

18
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:37,221
at the University of Cape Town
on the rugby team.

19
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:39,190
You know who else played rugby?
Stephen Huntley.

20
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:41,025
Stephen was the one
who ordered those killings.

21
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:42,777
I'm so sorry, Harvey.

22
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:47,698
Aah!

23
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,876
Tell me he looks worse.

24
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,996
He does.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,298
Are you hurt?

26
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:06,167
No, I'm fine.

27
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,388
I hope you didn't do that
because of me.

28
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:13,557
It was a fight, Donna,
not a duel.

29
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,929
- How could I not have--
- Listen to me.

30
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,799
Stephen betrayed us all.

31
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,434
You don't understand,
Harvey.

32
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:26,637
I was with him.

33
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:28,773
And he was capable
of something like that,

34
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:30,191
and I didn't even see it.

35
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,610
You know, I'm supposed to--
Donna!

36
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:36,313
It's okay.

37
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:38,866
Just tell me
you're gonna make him pay.

38
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,203
He'll pay.

39
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,464
Let's not talk about it.

40
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:56,517
Talk about what?

41
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,302
What do you need me to do?

42
00:01:58,353 --> 00:01:59,970
I need you to keep going
with everything you have

43
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:01,505
to impeach
Mariga's testimony.

44
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:02,690
What about the stuff
on Stephen?

45
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,508
- Not yet.
- Why not?

46
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,893
Because we don't have proof.

47
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,028
The trial's in two days.

48
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:08,229
We should bring Ava in
and tell her--

49
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:09,230
- Not yet.
- Why not?

50
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:10,281
Because we don't have proof.

51
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:11,588
Harvey, we have
to do something.

52
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,011
And how would
that conversation go?

53
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:15,119
"Hi, Ava, turns out
one of the lawyers from our firm

54
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,954
"is trying to frame you
for a crime he committed.

55
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,356
But right now we're not sure
we can do anything about it."

56
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:20,958
What are you gonna do?

57
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,526
I'm gonna go home,
get a good night's sleep,

58
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,744
and then tomorrow
I'm gonna find out

59
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,912
what the whole story is.

60
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:26,396
Harvey, Stephen
isn't gonna tell you

61
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:27,715
what the whole story is.

62
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,200
No, but there's
someone else who can.

63
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,204
You knew this case
was heading your way

64
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,589
before you ever
came after us.

65
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:37,174
That's why
you wanted to merge.

66
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,426
Yes, it is.

67
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,270
And I regret the situation
as much as you do.

68
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:41,729
But what's done is done.

69
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,814
Is that what you told Stephen
when you found out he did it?

70
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:44,982
Found out?

71
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,600
How do we know
he didn't order it?

72
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:48,385
Because I am giving you
my word.

73
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:50,571
Why should we trust a man
who sent Stephen over here

74
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:52,073
to cover his ass?

75
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:55,526
I sent Stephen over here
because I care about Ava,

76
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:58,228
which is why I sent him to
the E.I.R. in the first place.

77
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,581
I had no idea
he would do what he did,

78
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,800
and I have been trying
to fix it ever since.

79
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:05,169
- Then fix it right now.
- And how exactly can I do that?

80
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:06,804
By stating in court

81
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:09,206
Stephen acted alone
without Ava's knowledge.

82
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:10,841
- I can't.
- Why not?

83
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,293
Because he never told me.

84
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:15,346
And you never asked because
you never wanted to know.

85
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:17,181
You piece of shit.

86
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,100
You care about Ava
so much.

87
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:21,084
How could you
do this to her?

88
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:23,304
I wasn't doing anything
to her.

89
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:25,756
I was trying to do
something for her.

90
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:29,126
Remind me never to ask you
for any favors.

91
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:31,028
Well, I'm not asking
for a favor.

92
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:33,447
But you are going to agree
to do something right now.

93
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:36,317
And what is that?

94
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:47,128
It's not gonna work.

95
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:50,131
I cut you off
to get your attention.

96
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,051
Well, you have it.

97
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:57,004
Good, 'cause I just have
one question for you.

98
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,923
How can you live
with yourself?

99
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,758
- What?
- You know what?

100
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:02,176
I don't have any questions
for you.

101
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,294
I just came in here to let
you know that you make me sick.

102
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:06,897
Obviously
I hurt you, Donna,

103
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,983
and I never meant
to do that.

104
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:10,401
Oh, you didn't hurt me.

105
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:12,570
You just made me somebody
who slept with a murderer.

106
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:15,356
Murderer?

107
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,358
I don't know
what you think you know,

108
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,494
but those people that
were killed were terrorists.

109
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,745
They were people...

110
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,480
Who lived on top
of something that you wanted.

111
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:26,333
People who had guns--
murderers, Donna.

112
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:28,752
Now, if you're so appalled
by how business is done,

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,254
may I suggest
that you return

114
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:33,340
all of your designer clothes
that you look so ravishing in,

115
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,176
because they're paid for

116
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,294
by the dirty work
this firm does.

117
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,679
We don't kill people.

118
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:41,131
You mean chemical companies
that Harvey represents

119
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:43,217
or car companies
that Harvey defends?

120
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:47,021
How about insurance providers
whose claims he helps deny?

121
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:50,173
- Don't bring him into this.
- He's always been in this.

122
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:52,059
You know what?
I've had enough of this.

123
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,778
I didn't really cut off your
shit to get your attention.

124
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:58,949
I cut it off because
you don't need it anymore.

125
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,367
You're fired.

126
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,621
Darby would never allow that.

127
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:06,240

138
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:47,915
2 months, 5 days, and 3 hours
under Nigel's tutelage,

139
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:49,542
and this is what
you have to show for it?

140
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:51,655
That's over 20 motions.

141
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:52,989
20 dog shits.

142
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:54,791
Did you get this
out of a Grisham novel?

143
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,109
Because that's fiction.

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,828
And you...

145
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:00,130
My mother can get
this motion thrown out.

146
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:02,115
And you--well, you're gone
anyway in two days.

147
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,250
Listen up, people.

148
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:06,503
I've reviewed your work
in my absence.

149
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:08,305
And guess what.

150
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,789
It's pathetic.

151
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:13,009
Every stinking one of you
should get down on your knees

152
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:14,511
and thank God and me

153
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,963
for letting you continue
to exist in our kingdoms.

154
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,152
Louis, what was that about?
What's going on?

155
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:23,636
It was about me letting
these assholes know

156
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:25,638
who's in charge.
They know you're in charge.

157
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,408
They put you in charge.
They didn't put me in shit.

158
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,527
They sat there in judgment while
my character got ripped apart,

159
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:32,812
and not one of them
lifted a single finger to help.

160
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:35,365
They ruled in your favor.
They chose you over Nigel.

161
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,819
No, they made me
give up Mikado for them.

162
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:44,090
Okay, you're displacing your
anger over Mikado onto them.

163
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:47,377
They didn't put you
in this position.

164
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:48,879
It's not fair.

165
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:50,046
You're right.

166
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,832
They didn't put me
in this position,

167
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:53,967
but I know who did.

168
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,385
Goddamn Darby--

169
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,429
unleashes his dog, leaves us
to clean up the mess.

170
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:58,805
We can still go after Mariga
in court.

171
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,173
I mean,
he's an admitted murderer

172
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:01,691
who cut a deal
to save his life.

173
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,026
Wait a second.

174
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,778
That deal is only good
if he's telling the truth.

175
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:06,813
We can't go after him
with the truth on the stand.

176
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:10,016
Maybe, but we can go after him
with the truth not on the stand.

177
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,018
Cameron would have
to be willing to listen.

178
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,403
Then I better
get him to listen.

179
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:14,788
And I better
go after Mariga.

180
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:16,856
- And change your clothes.
- What? Why?

181
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:18,992
If they see a lawyer
within 20 yards of that lobby,

182
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:21,527
they'll lock the place down.

183
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,830
- Oh, you're not room service.
- No, I'm not, but...

184
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:58,865
I do need to talk
to Colonel Mariga.

185
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,534
And I need to stop paying
alimony to my cheating ex-wife,

186
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,403
but that's not going
to happen.

187
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:04,955
If you let me in,
maybe I can make that happen.

188
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,674
And how the hell are you
gonna make that happen?

189
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:10,510
I'm a lawyer.

190
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,045
You don't look like
a lawyer to me.

191
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,246
Okay. All right.
You got me.

192
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,598
Look, I'm not--
I'm not a lawyer.

193
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,934
In fact, between you and me,
I'm a complete fraud.

194
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:21,021
But what I am
is Colonel Mariga's cousin.

195
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,692
On his mother's side.

196
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,776
- All right.
- Okay, all right!

197
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:27,978
All right,
you don't believe me?

198
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:30,730
That's fine.
Just do me a favor, okay?

199
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,033
Give him this photo
of him and my Uncle Stephen.

200
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:38,455
Then let him decide
if he wants to talk to me.

201
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,991
Louis, how did you
get in here?

202
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:42,292
I told them
I was your uncle.

203
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:43,660
Though how they could believe
that we share

204
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:44,828
the same DNA is beyond me.

205
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:47,163
This is about your trial,
isn't it?

206
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:48,288
You're goddamn right
it is!

207
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,382
Why the hell
would you do that to me?

208
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,134
I had no choice.
I was subpoenaed.

209
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:54,287
It was a mock trial.
You could have refused.

210
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:55,588
What do you want
from me, Louis?

211
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,956
I want to yell at you!

212
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:58,525
Well, you can't do that
anymore--you fired me.

213
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:00,060
Is that what this
whole thing was all about?

214
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,262
You're damn right it was.
And you want to know the truth?

215
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:03,980
When I found out
about your stupid trial,

216
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,465
I called Nigel
and volunteered.

217
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,300
How dare you?

218
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,402
Me firing you was business.

219
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,321
You bringing up the death
of my cat--

220
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:12,822
that was personal.

221
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:14,824
You made me take care
of that stupid cat.

222
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,826
I'm allergic.
It could have killed me.

223
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:18,328
And when that cat did die,

224
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:20,830
not only did you never tell me
that it wasn't my fault,

225
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:23,649
you then fired me
in front of my very best friend.

226
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,586
If that's not personal,
then I don't know what is.

227
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,922
Now get the hell
out of my office.

228
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,125
I will.

229
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:34,928
But before I do,

230
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,047
I have some personal news
for you

231
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:40,383
about how your firing
really went down.

232
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,356
Ah, I love this.
We'd just won the championship.

233
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,690
Might I get a copy?

234
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,692
Yeah, I'll get one
framed for you.

235
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,361
You can look at it
in the ten minutes

236
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:52,862
before they
put you to death.

237
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:54,680
The photograph
proves nothing.

238
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:58,201
Trust me, there's a whole
lot more where that came from.

239
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:01,571
We know all about the ties
between you and Stephen.

240
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:02,906
Then bring them up.

241
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,958
But I made a deal
to testify against Ava,

242
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,459
and that is what
I'm going to do.

243
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:07,961
No, you made a deal
to put away

244
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,046
the person responsible
for ordering these killings,

245
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,248
and I suggest you do that
while you still can.

246
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,550
Young man...

247
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:16,052
If your intention is to shake
my testimony,

248
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,370
that is not
going to happen.

249
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:18,888
It doesn't need
to happen,

250
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:21,758
'cause once we prove
that you're lying about Ava,

251
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:23,426
Cameron Dennis is going
to cancel your deal,

252
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,812
and you're gonna come to me
begging for help.

253
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:30,767
Do you think
you're the scariest man

254
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:32,102
I've ever sat across from?

255
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,737
I know
you're not scared of me.

256
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:37,574
But you are scared
of your own people,

257
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:39,325
and you should be,

258
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:40,577
because you and I
both know

259
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:43,396
they're gonna kill you
the minute you get back.

260
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:46,065
That I know Stephen doesn't
mean I'm lying about Ava.

261
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:47,200
But you are.

262
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,335
Ah, and you can see
into my soul.

263
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:51,337
It doesn't take a fortune
teller to know you're lying.

264
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:53,906
And it doesn't take one
to know that if you had proof,

265
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,842
you wouldn't be here
talking to me.

266
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,580
So you're not protecting
Stephen out of principle.

267
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:02,599
I'm not a man
of principle.

268
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:05,351
I'm a man of expediency.
I get it.

269
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,887
If you change your tune now,
you'll lose the deal you have.

270
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:12,108
Therefore, I prefer to--
how do you say it--

271
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:15,111
dance with the one
who brought me.

272
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,618
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

273
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,319
Game time's tomorrow.
We got nothing to say.

274
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:24,770
I'm here to help you.

275
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:26,456
I don't need your help.

276
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,441
And you wouldn't be here
unless you need mine.

277
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:29,909
You're wrong.

278
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,045
I can help you do what you
always said you're all about--

279
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,546
putting bad guys away.

280
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:35,415
You got a confession for me?

281
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:37,333
You're going
after the wrong person.

282
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,302
You're her lawyer.
That's what you would say.

283
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:41,337
I'm not here as her lawyer.

284
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:42,805
This isn't a speech
for a jury.

285
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,058
I'm here man-to-man to talk
to the guy I used to know.

286
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,177
All right.

287
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,728
Talk.

288
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,848
- I know who really did this.
- Then tell me who it is.

289
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,399
I need a guarantee
you won't use

290
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,800
what I tell you
against Ava.

291
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,569
If you think
I'm gonna guarantee you

292
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:58,521
anything but a war tomorrow,

293
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:00,139
you are sadly mistaken.

294
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,192
I can't tell you who did it,
but somebody else can.

295
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,476
Who?

296
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:05,978
Colonel Mariga.

297
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,997
Are you kidding me?

298
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,649
I've got the murder weapon.

299
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,151
He says Ava Hessington
pulled his trigger,

300
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,986
and you want me to have him
change his story?

301
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:15,154
He's only pointing at Ava

302
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:16,489
because that's what
you want to hear.

303
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,324
Change his deal,
he'll tell you the truth.

304
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,760
He changes his story now,

305
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,962
anything he says
about anybody means shit.

306
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,547
It means shit in court,
but if you are

307
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:27,884
who you say you are,
it should mean something to you.

308
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:29,385
You know what, Harvey?

309
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,105
I believe that you believe
she's innocent,

310
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,533
and if you can convince me
of that,

311
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,558
I won't go after her,
but I'm not gonna guarantee

312
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:37,694
I won't use what you say
before I hear it.

313
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:40,513
- You want me to just trust you?
- That's what you're asking me.

314
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:43,399
But if you think that I'm gonna
kneecap my star witness

315
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:46,653
the day before the trial,
you are out of your mind.

316
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,780
Harold.

317
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,064
What's up, man?
it's good to see you.

318
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,549
I thought
you were my friend.

319
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,117
I am.
What the hell?

320
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,019
Friends don't say they tried
to save your job

321
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,521
when, really,
they hung you out to dry.

322
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:01,856
So it's true.

323
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,375
Look, Harold,
I didn't mean to--

324
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,210
You know what? Save whatever
bullshit explanation you have,

325
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,545
because I don't want
to hear it.

326
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,463
I'm not trying to give you
a bullshit explanation.

327
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,631
Because there is none.

328
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,216
You got to choose
between you and me,

329
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,533
and you chose yourself.

330
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,483
And then you lied to me
about it.

331
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:15,534
Yes, Harold, I did.

332
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:16,779
And then after I lied to you,

333
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,672
I got you a job
at a huge, powerful firm.

334
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,257
Yeah, you got me that job
so I'd owe you one

335
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:22,258
when the time came.

336
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:23,492
I got you that job

337
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,160
because I thought you deserved
a second chance.

338
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,680
And then you came calling
when you needed a lawsuit filed

339
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,665
to get rid of your witnesses
in your murder trial.

340
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,133
I trusted you
with that lawsuit

341
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:32,551
because I thought
you were a competent attorney.

342
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:34,887
And you were more than happy
to take it.

343
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:37,556
And that murder trial you just
mentioned is about to start.

344
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,892
So you can choose to be
pissed off with me or move on.

345
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,611
But right now
I have a job to do.

346
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,202
- Rachel.
- Louis, what did you do?

347
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,704
What do you mean?
What is this?

348
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,906
Fairfield Computers
is being sued.

349
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,791
- How's that my fault?
- Because they're your client,

350
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,460
and the attorney of record
is Harold Gunderson.

351
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:00,129
He also sent
a settlement offer.

352
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:02,882
He wants to pick
a fight with me.

353
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,366
He's gonna regret
the day he was born.

354
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:05,918
Aren't you the one
who picked a fight with him?

355
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:07,887
Rachel, whose side
are you on?

356
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,221
Don't answer that question.

357
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,393
You shouldn't be here.

358
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,897
Stephen said that we're
no different than he is.

359
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,932
I need to see you show him
that he's wrong.

360
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,151
This isn't his trial.
It's Ava's.

361
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:23,719
You're not gonna put him
on the stand?

362
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,571
You said you were gonna
make him pay.

363
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:28,157
Donna, I will,
but now is not the time.

364
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:30,392
Then when?
Because he killed people,

365
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,162
and if we let him
get away with it...

366
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,448
Then maybe we are
no different than he is.

367
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,502
Had these insurgents
had their way,

368
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:41,253
they would have blown up
the pipeline.

369
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,173
Instead, Ms. Hessington
retained a valuable asset,

370
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,259
and I, in turn, was compensated
for a job well done.

371
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:51,130
And this compensation came
directly from Ava Hessington?

372
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:52,598
Yes.

373
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,884
She specifically directed you
to kill people?

374
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,303
Yes.

375
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,254
One more thing,
Colonel Mariga--

376
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:01,440
do you and I have a deal
for you to testify

377
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,110
in exchange
for a more lenient sentence?

378
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,094
Yes.

379
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:07,429
And why should
the jury believe

380
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:09,765
that you aren't making this up
to save yourself?

381
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:12,201
Because if what I say to you
proves to be a lie,

382
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,436
you'll send me back home,

383
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,123
where I will be dead
within minutes.

384
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,457
No further questions.

385
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:24,246
Ten minutes recess.

386
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,298
Why didn't you just
jump right in there?

387
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,300
I get it--
you read a book that says

388
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,618
you don't let the jury
sit with things.

389
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:30,719
The only problem is...

390
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:31,887
We're not inside
of a book.

391
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,422
And I don't want
to seem defensive.

392
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,513
Harvey, we still have
a ton of shit to hit him with.

393
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,793
Were you in there?
They're buying what he's saying.

394
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:39,284
Then we make them
buy something else.

395
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:40,896
We got a pair of aces.

396
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:42,348
If the jury believes that
Cameron's got three of a kind,

397
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:44,633
we're not gonna win.
We can't go after Stephen.

398
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,018
Cameron
won't go after Ava

399
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,653
if I can convince him
it was Stephen.

400
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:49,071
- You went to Cameron?
- Yes.

401
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,639
And you're going
to trust him?

402
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,141
I'm not sure
we have another choice.

403
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,530
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

404
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,114
don't.

405
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,033
I'm thinking I'd like
to rip your face off.

406
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:02,718
You get Mariga
to point the finger at me,

407
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:04,820
I will point it
straight at Ava.

408
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,590
Stephen, Jessica
doesn't respond well to threats.

409
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,091
Well, I don't make threats.

410
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,210
I give warnings.

411
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,295
You've been warned.

412
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,554
Mr. Specter...

413
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:24,273
I have no questions
for Colonel Mariga, Your Honor,

414
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,341
but I'd like to call
a rebuttal witness.

415
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:28,194
Harvey, come on,
you know what he's gonna say.

416
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,895
I don't care
what he's gonna say.

417
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,897
He's talking to the jury.
I'm talking to Cameron Dennis.

418
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:36,068
The defense calls
Stephen Huntley to the stand.

419
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:38,888
What has Stephen Huntley
got to do with this?

420
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:40,539
Harvey knows
what he's doing.

421
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,907
This is what
you wanted to sell me--

422
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:43,209
a lawyer from your own
goddamn firm?

423
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,573
You want to put away
the bad guy?

424
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,046
I'm about to hand him to you
on a silver platter.

425
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,382
Mr. Huntley,
did you work at the law firm

426
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,635
headed by Edward Darby
last year?

427
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,303
Yes.

428
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,972
Did Mr. Darby ask you
to solve any problems

429
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,474
for Hessington Oil

430
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,676
regarding their pipeline
in the E.I.R.?

431
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,811
I decline to answer under
my fifth amendment rights.

432
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,064
The right
against self-incrimination.

433
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,515
How long have you known
Colonel Mariga?

434
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:07,733
I decline to answer.

435
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,602
Is it true that you
went to school with him

436
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:10,936
at the University
of Cape Town?

437
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,054
I decline to answer.

438
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:13,522
Well, let me refresh
your memory.

439
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,491
You were teammates
on a championship rugby team.

440
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,576
Objection.
Counsel is testifying.

441
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,111
The witness is hostile,
Your Honor.

442
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:21,030
Hostile? They work
at the same law firm.

443
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,531
He was fired yesterday.

444
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,199
Gentlemen, approach.

445
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,421
He's making things up
to create reasonable doubt.

446
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,924
I'm bringing things up,
so you'll see the truth.

447
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,677
The only thing tying Ava to this
is Mariga's testimony.

448
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:37,596
You only have Mariga because
you tapped Stephen's phone.

449
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,914
That's a ridiculous
accusation.

450
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,099
Cameron, please.

451
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,935
Why did he call him?
How did he call him?

452
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,436
Enough.

453
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,555
You're on a short leash,
Mr. Specter.

454
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,091
The gentleman
invoked his rights.

455
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:55,948
Mr. Huntley, did you meet
with your old friend

456
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,600
Emmanuel Mariga
and direct him

457
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:01,704
to kill the opponent
of Hessington Oil's pipeline

458
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:04,239
without Ava Hessington's
knowledge?

459
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,209
I decline to answer.

460
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:08,877
I have
no further questions.

461
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:11,630
Mr. Dennis,
do you have any questions?

462
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:15,951
Mr. Dennis.

463
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,392
Mr. Huntley,
until you were let go,

464
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,628
you worked at the same firm
as Mr. Specter, correct?

465
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,296
Yes.

466
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:31,150
And his job today
is to give this jury

467
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:35,187
cause to doubt that
his client is the murderer?

468
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,139
- Yes.
- In your experience...

469
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,692
Is pointing the finger
at someone else

470
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,309
a good strategy?

471
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,579
It can be
an excellent strategy.

472
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:46,081
And why do you think
that Mr. Specter

473
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,866
is pointing the finger
at you?

474
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,835
Well, maybe it has something
to do with the fact

475
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,988
that a few weeks ago
Ms. Hessington approached me

476
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,373
and asked me
to bribe witnesses

477
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:56,125
who were about
to testify against her,

478
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,543
and I refused.

479
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,211
And if you think
I'm lying under oath,

480
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:02,214
then, please,
ask Mr. Specter.

481
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:03,599
He knows that's the truth.

482
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,552
And a woman who bribes
witnesses against her

483
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:07,770
is not innocent.

484
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:08,887
Objection.

485
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:10,839
Withdrawn.
One last thing.

486
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,942
Did the defendant
ask you to arrange a meeting

487
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,311
with Colonel Mariga
where she she would pay him

488
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,732
millions of dollars
in exchange for...

489
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,734
Killing opponents
of her pipeline?

490
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,036
I decline to answer.

491
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,039
Can't blame a guy
for trying.

492
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,741
No further questions.

493
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:40,807
Is Stephen Huntley involved
in this,

494
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,990
or is it some kind of stunt like
he just told the jury it was?

495
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,491
He ordered the killings.

496
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,610
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We didn't have proof.

497
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,945
Why would you put
that man on the stand?

498
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,731
It was a calculated risk.

499
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:02,450
You took a calculated risk
with my life

500
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:05,686
without telling me.

501
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,631
I'm sorry.

502
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,509
You screwed me.

503
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,011
I said
I wouldn't go after her

504
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,979
if you convinced me--
you didn't convince me.

505
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:24,181
Then take a recess

506
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,982
instead of twisting
everything he said.

507
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,868
I'm not gonna let the jury
sit with that shit.

508
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:29,319
And thank God I didn't.

509
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:30,970
Otherwise,
I would have found out

510
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,656
that she tried
to bribe witnesses

511
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,990
and you kept it from me.

512
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:35,776
It had nothing to do
with the murders.

513
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,327
That's funny--
when I kept things from you

514
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:38,779
that had nothing to do
with other murders,

515
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,830
you called me a criminal.

516
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:40,997
Well, that ended up
with you

517
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:42,916
putting an innocent person
in prison.

518
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:45,035
And now you're doing it again.
Oh, don't give me that shit.

519
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,337
Stephen Huntley is up
to his goddamn neck in this,

520
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:48,872
and you know it.

521
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,842
So he just goes around
killing his clients' enemies

522
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:52,992
behind their backs?

523
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,261
I don't think so.

524
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:56,096
You want corroboration?
Ask Mariga.

525
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:57,163
I just did.

526
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,516
And he answered me
in open court.

527
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,351
And I'm not putting
an innocent woman away.

528
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:03,220
I'm doing my job.
Cameron-

529
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,222
Lawyers killing people?

530
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,024
That's a hell of a firm
you got your name on, Harvey.

531
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,728
You must be proud to have left
the D.A.'s office for that.

532
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,684
Let's do racquetball,
James.

533
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,319
Again? Louis, you were
supposed to be waiting

534
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,787
in the conference--
I don't wait for anyone.

535
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:22,038
And you don't sue me.

536
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:23,874
Yes, I do.

537
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,493
Because I realized
I now work at a huge firm,

538
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:28,361
and I have the power
to do this to you.

539
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,774
Now, we can negotiate
a settlement,

540
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,915
unless, of course, you don't
think you can handle me.

541
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,750
Do you really want
to embarrass yourself

542
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,201
with your mother watching?

543
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,003
It kills you that they
don't ban us having pictures

544
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:39,205
of our mothers,
like you did, doesn't it?

545
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,341
A man is judged
by the photos he displays.

546
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,926
You have a photo
of yourself.

547
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,395
And now you're making
my point for me.

548
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,398
You don't intimidate me
anymore, Louis.

549
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,401
Really?
I know you, Harold.

550
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:53,570
I know that you gargle
before meetings

551
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:55,605
that make you nervous.

552
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,559
And I...smell...mint.

553
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,661
- I--
- We don't agree

554
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,747
to paragraph three or four.
I need to have four.

555
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:04,998
Or seven through ten.

556
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:08,067
My mo--my client
won't stand for that.

557
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,755
Your client will stand for
whatever the hell I give them!

558
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,457
Please, can I have nine?

559
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,380
You know what?

560
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:21,798
I'll give you nine...

561
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,403
Because it's meaningless,
and I want it

562
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:25,418
to tell all the other paragraphs
out there what happens

563
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,021
when Harold Gunderson
goes after Louis Litt.

564
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:29,589
That doesn't make any sense.

565
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,974
Haven't you ever seen
a mob movie?

566
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,309
They always let one survive
to tell the others.

567
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,110
Well, yeah,
but paragraphs can't talk--

568
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:36,313
Okay, whatever. Fine.
Just type this up as agreed,

569
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,865
and don't you ever let me see
your pasty, Norwegian,

570
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:41,651
Carrot Top-wannabe
face again.

571
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,655
Carrot Top is a very
underrated comedian

572
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,273
who's never done anything
to anyone.

573
00:22:49,877 --> 00:22:51,795
Did you know that Harvey
was going to ambush Stephen

574
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:52,996
on the stand?

575
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,614
I wouldn't have stopped him
if I did.

576
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,583
And to hell
with the ramifications?

577
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,969
The ramifications for who,
Edward?

578
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,137
I didn't come here to fight
with you, Jessica.

579
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,289
But Stephen didn't take
the most direct hit.

580
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,624
Ava did.

581
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,810
You keep talking about
how much you care about Ava.

582
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:08,311
But I've only just met her.

583
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:11,982
And you're the one who did
what you did.

584
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:18,021
I treated you
as if you were my own blood.

585
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,105
Ava...

586
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:20,907
Did you do this to me?

587
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:22,442
Of course I didn't.

588
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:26,246
Did you keep this
from me?

589
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:29,666
I want to hear you say it.

590
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,151
I didn't know
until it was too late.

591
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:37,340
I didn't want to burden you
with what had been done

592
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:39,009
to get your pipeline,

593
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:41,378
and there was nothing
I could do to undo it.

594
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,013
Burden me?

595
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:44,497
What about protecting me?

596
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,049
Well, that's exactly
what I was doing

597
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,834
when I assigned Harvey
to the case.

598
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,020
And after I was brought up
on murder charges,

599
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:51,271
rather than tell me,

600
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,506
you send the very man
who committed the crime.

601
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,192
Who were you trying
not to burden then?

602
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:11,374
You once asked me if she knew
about her father and I.

603
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:16,029
In those days,
to be a lawyer and to be out--

604
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,248
not possible.

605
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,083
Her father
was in the oil business.

606
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,368
He would have been finished.
What does that have to do-

607
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,538
We used to go away
on occasion.

608
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,424
In order to do that,

609
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,394
Ava joined us and pretended
to be my girlfriend.

610
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,929
She did that for us.

611
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:40,070
Ava is family to me.

612
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:42,022
I sent Stephen out there
to help her.

613
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,990
I didn't know what he'd do.

614
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,409
And I would give anything
to undo it.

615
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:52,248
What do you want
from me, Edward?

616
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,000
I want you to put aside
your anger

617
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:55,835
and figure out a way to help.

618
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:04,210
What are you doing here?

619
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:06,763
I'm here to put aside
my anger.

620
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:09,099
We're in the middle
of a murder trial.

621
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:11,518
We can spare
five minutes for this.

622
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:13,103
Wait a second.

623
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:16,106
I gave you that bottle
when you took over from Daniel.

624
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,925
- I know.
- I told you to only open it

625
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,110
in case of an emergency.

626
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:23,096
You think this isn't
an emergency?

627
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,031
We're about
to lose a huge murder case,

628
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:27,117
and it turns out
the person behind it

629
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,119
is one of our own lawyers.

630
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:31,121
And we're in business

631
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:33,156
with the man
who helped cover it up.

632
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,108
But the thing
that's been most on my mind

633
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,045
is that you goddamn
betrayed me.

634
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,583
Now...

635
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:47,303
The truth is, you warned me
about all of this.

636
00:25:47,388 --> 00:25:51,057
And I am tired
of feeling betrayed by you.

637
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,476
I'd rather forgive you.

638
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,730
Can you?

639
00:25:56,797 --> 00:25:58,848
Why do you think I'm here?

640
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,651
I never should have come
after you.

641
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:03,987
I'm sorry.

642
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,524
You didn't kill anybody.

643
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,410
And if I'm really
going to forgive you,

644
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:12,362
then I need
to tell you I'm sorry

645
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,998
that I made you want to do it
in the first place.

646
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:24,174
What changed your mind?

647
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:27,326
Edward.

648
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,513
He said Ava
was family to him.

649
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,017
You're family to me,

650
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:36,269
and you did what he didn't.

651
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:38,138
You came clean.

652
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:41,224
Is that all you came here
to tell me?

653
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,777
Like you said, we're in
the middle of a murder trial.

654
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:46,196
And you have an idea.

655
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,814
We're not the only people

656
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:49,899
that are like family
to each other.

657
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,818
And sometimes
you have to put your family

658
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,903
in a position
where they don't have a choice.

659
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,189
What do you need me to do?

660
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:06,151
New plan-we're gonna
convince Cameron

661
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:07,292
that Ava's innocent.

662
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:09,042
Have you been drinking?

663
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:10,510
Yeah. Why?

664
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:12,012
Because wasn't that
the old plan?

665
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,263
That was the old goal.

666
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:15,081
This time, it's you
who's going to Cameron.

667
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:16,633
If he won't hear
the truth from you,

668
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:18,802
how's he gonna hear it
from me?

669
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:21,972
Cameron can't see the truth
because all he sees

670
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:23,473
is that he has
a winnable case.

671
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,275
How does that affect
what I just said?

672
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,776
Prosecutors are hammers,

673
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:28,182
and they see the accused
as nails.

674
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:30,363
How am I gonna change that?

675
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,615
You're gonna gonna remind him

676
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:34,150
about the time
he hit the wrong nail.

677
00:27:36,037 --> 00:27:38,121
Can you tell me
how the waffles are here?

678
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:41,741
Mike Ross, my man.

679
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:42,942
It's good to see you, man.

680
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,794
It's good to see you too,
Clifford.

681
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:46,630
What the hell you doing out
in the middle of the night?

682
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:47,831
Oh, you know, I told you.

683
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:50,133
I got an urge
for some waffles.

684
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,951
This isn't a coincidence,
is it?

685
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,054
I need a favor.

686
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,555
No doubt.
What you need?

687
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:58,141
I need you to talk
to Cameron Dennis.

688
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:00,310
No.

689
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:01,561
Hell, no.

690
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:03,430
- Clifford...
- Look at me, man.

691
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,148
Look where I am...

692
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:07,350
Cleaning up people's shit!
I know.

693
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,486
You know this is all I can get
because of him?

694
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,406
My life passed me by
because of that motherf--

695
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,909
I get in a room with him,
I'll kill him.

696
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:17,456
And I need you to tell him
all of that

697
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,746
so that he doesn't do
the same thing to somebody else.

698
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:22,165
You need?

699
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,501
I know who "you" is.

700
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,536
And I don't owe Harvey shit.

701
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,154
Now, he may have
got me out,

702
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,490
but he and Cameron put me there
in the first place.

703
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,260
Yeah, you're right.
You don't owe Harvey.

704
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,512
But you do owe me...

705
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:37,847
'Cause I didn't have anything
to do with putting you in there,

706
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:40,550
but I broke the law
to get you out.

707
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:49,008
I am feeling generous,

708
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,011
so absolutely, 100%,
without a doubt,

709
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,780
go screw yourself.

710
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:55,198
Everything okay?

711
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:56,516
Yeah, of course.

712
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:57,951
I was just using
tactic number 36

713
00:28:58,018 --> 00:28:59,686
in Louis Litt's handbook,
due to be published never

714
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:01,321
because I don't share
my tactics.

715
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,707
Tactic number seven,
by the way.

716
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,191
Okay.

717
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,694
Well, whatever tactic you used
on Harold didn't work.

718
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,129
He's not caving.

719
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:10,630
I don't know
what you're talking about,

720
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:12,082
because he gave me
everything I wanted.

721
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,500
The client just called.

722
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,868
The contract Harold sent over
has a loophole in it.

723
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,505
It leaves him open
to punitive damages.

724
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,040
Paragraph nine.

725
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,642
Get that contract back.

726
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,011
We need to renegotiate.

727
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:28,064
Oh, my God, Harold
pulled one over on you.

728
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:29,429
Don't you dare
say that out loud.

729
00:29:29,483 --> 00:29:30,717
Call him up,
set up the appointment

730
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,435
for me to go over there.
I tried.

731
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,771
He insisted on coming here.
He's on his way right now.

732
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,072
He?

733
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,911
What the hell
are you doing here?

734
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,896
He's here
to tell you who you are.

735
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,115
I know who I am.

736
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,250
I don't need
to hear it from him.

737
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:50,086
You think I'm giving you
a choice?

738
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:06,219
Okay. We were supposed to meet
in the conference room.

739
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,950
I don't need to wait
in the conference room

740
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,589
to knock your dick
in the dirt.

741
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,940
What'd you just say to me?

742
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:12,592
It's from <i>The Breakfast Club,</i>
asshole.

743
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,444
Not all of us only watch
<i>The Sound Of Music.</i>

744
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,980
You little bastard.
You just crossed a line.

745
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:19,265
Julie Andrews
is a national treasure.

746
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,651
Maybe your client
would be better off with her.

747
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,736
Maybe they would be.

748
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,937
But she isn't here.
And I am.

749
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,106
And here are a few
of my favorite things--

750
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,992
countersuit for slander,

751
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:30,994
motion to decertify class,

752
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:32,796
motion for summary judgment,

753
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,081
change of venue, sanctions,

754
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:38,301
depositions, discovery!

755
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,720
Great use
of folders there, Louis.

756
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,505
Too bad none of them
are gonna work.

757
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,123
Well, they may not work
on the case,

758
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,309
but they're definitely
gonna work on you.

759
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:47,894
What are you talking about?

760
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:49,962
Oh, I'm talking
about you may win in the end,

761
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,849
but it won't justify you
spending every waking minute

762
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:54,350
of your life
on this bullshit,

763
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,353
instead of doing everything else
you've been assigned to do.

764
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,739
- You'd do that to me?
- I won't be doing it to you.

765
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,741
I'll be doing it
for Bratton Gould.

766
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:03,243
And you'll be laughed
out of there

767
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,950
the same way you were laughed
out of here.

768
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:06,579
- Louis--
- We got nothing left to say!

769
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,331
Drop the suit
by the end of the week,

770
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,700
or one of my associates
will see you in court.

771
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,835
Get out!

772
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,350
I don't want him here.

773
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:30,687
Ava, whatever he did,
he's here to help,

774
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:32,872
and he's an asset.

775
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,008
Then what does the mighty
Edward Darby have to say?

776
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,061
You're innocent
until proven guilty

777
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:39,646
beyond a reasonable doubt.

778
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,864
Take the stand.

779
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:43,316
Any juror that hears you
will have that doubt.

780
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,901
She opens that door,
the first question

781
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:47,987
Cameron asks is, did she try
and bribe those witnesses?

782
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:52,909
The answer is yes.
There goes reasonable doubt.

783
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,294
How much did you pay him?

784
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:56,045
- Cameron.
- Pay who?

785
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,715
Don't play dumb.
Clifford Danner.

786
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,583
Who the hell
is Clifford Danner?

787
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,052
He was an innocent person
that Cameron put behind bars.

788
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:04,817
And I thought
he would make you see reason.

789
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,055
That has nothing
to do with this.

790
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,707
And I didn't put him
behind bars--you did.

791
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:09,142
Then I got him out.

792
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:11,060
Well, you're not getting
her out, because she did it,

793
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:13,813
and yesterday your own colleague
said that she did it.

794
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,266
He did not say that,
and you know it.

795
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,351
- You willing to take that risk?
- What are you suggesting?

796
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,853
I've worked with him
long enough

797
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,237
to know what he's suggesting.

798
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:23,156
Cameron Dennis
doesn't go to verdict.

799
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:24,858
He cuts deals.
Then let me tell you...

800
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,410
About what's
behind door number one--

801
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:29,061
Eight years.

802
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:33,500
Eight years instead of forever.
Leave us alone.

803
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,169
Court's in ten minutes.
You have until then.

804
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:39,172
Harvey...

805
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,957
He's got us,
and you know it.

806
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,208
No, he doesn't.

807
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,127
She's not going to prison
for one day.

808
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,012
She's going
for the rest of her life

809
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,747
if we don't take this deal.

810
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:49,432
I am not losing to him.

811
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:52,251
You-your blood feud

812
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,304
or whatever it is
you have with that man

813
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:57,307
is what put the target
on my back in the first place.

814
00:32:57,391 --> 00:32:59,943
Ava, we need
to face reality.

815
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:02,362
She is not taking that deal.

816
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:05,448
She better, because
she can't buy her way out of it.

817
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,934
And you can't cover up
your way out of it.

818
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,435
- I don't care.
- Well, what's your idea?

819
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:10,870
Because unless
you're gonna testify

820
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:13,039
that Stephen did this
without Ava's knowledge,

821
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:14,240
you can't help.

822
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,992
And as you said,
you have no proof.

823
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:19,579
So why don't you get out of the
room and let the grown-ups talk?

824
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,498
What if I was
to testify to that?

825
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:26,002
What are you talking about?

826
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:28,671
I'm talking about putting
words to a conversation

827
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,974
that should have happened
but didn't.

828
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:34,477
You'd say that you confronted
Stephen, and he admitted it?

829
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:37,463
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

830
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:38,965
This isn't gonna help.

831
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,634
You're her old friend coming
to her aid at the last second.

832
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:42,769
It's a lie.

833
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,187
The jury will see
right through it.

834
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:45,855
Then we need to make Cameron
believe it.

835
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,857
Harvey, Cameron wants a win.

836
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,859
You need to convince him
this is a win.

837
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,579
Can you do that?

838
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:55,999
I guess it's the best shot
we have.

839
00:34:06,193 --> 00:34:09,009
I knew you would cave.
With five minutes to spare.

840
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:11,550
We're not here
to take your offer, Cameron.

841
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:12,852
We want you to take ours.

842
00:34:12,936 --> 00:34:15,170
Nah, I'm not negotiating.
Eight years is final.

843
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,839
This isn't about making
a deal for Ava.

844
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,274
It's about making
a deal for me.

845
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:21,176
If he's got something
to say about this,

846
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,279
you should put him
on the stand.

847
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:27,066
I already trusted you once.
I need your word.

848
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,018
Go ahead.
Off the record.

849
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,488
I instructed Stephen Huntley
to do whatever it took

850
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:33,906
to get Ava her pipeline,

851
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:36,742
and I told him
to do it behind her back.

852
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,694
So you authorized
these murders.

853
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:39,862
Absolutely not.

854
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,530
When I heard people
had been killed,

855
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:42,748
I confronted him immediately.

856
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,383
And what did he say?

857
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:46,385
He didn't care
that he'd resorted to murder.

858
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,203
His job
was to get things done.

859
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:52,258
You just admitted to being
an accessory after the fact.

860
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,926
No, he didn't.

861
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:58,014
I get it.
Off the record.

862
00:34:58,065 --> 00:34:59,214
What do you want?

863
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,600
Edward pleads
to obstruction of justice--

864
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:02,985
five years probation.

865
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:05,104
You drop the charges
against Ava.

866
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,238
And he testifies

867
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:08,991
at Stephen Huntley's
murder trial.

868
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:14,229
And why would I swap out Ava
for her minion?

869
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:18,084
Cameron, you gave us
that offer for a reason.

870
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:20,569
You're at the finish line--
you can taste the win,

871
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,339
but it's not 100%,
and you know it,

872
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:25,446
because you're still banking
on an admitted murderer

873
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,959
with an incentive to lie.

874
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,794
I'm giving you
a respected lawyer

875
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,914
with an incentive to keep
his mouth shut.

876
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:34,416
You know who has
a better chance

877
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:37,970
at getting you a win.

878
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:44,143
Draw up the paperwork.

879
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,467
I thought you never wanted
to see me again.

880
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:10,285
I thought
about what you said.

881
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,122
What, about the kind
of business your firm does?

882
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,841
Yes.

883
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:17,893
And I realized that maybe
you're not as bad

884
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:19,979
as I said you were.

885
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:22,798
- No?
- No.

886
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:27,486
You're much worse.

887
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:34,476
Harvey and Cameron
made a deal to take you down,

888
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,996
and part of that deal
was that I got to be the one

889
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,165
to tell you about it.

890
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:46,655
I meant it when I said
I never meant to hurt you.

891
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,959
And I meant it when I said
that you make me sick.

892
00:36:59,102 --> 00:37:00,386
It's all there.

893
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,222
You testify, you get
five years probation.

894
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,691
And he pleads
obstruction of justice.

895
00:37:05,776 --> 00:37:07,526
- What is this?
- What is what?

896
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:09,528
This says that I forfeit
my license

897
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:11,530
to practice law
in this country.

898
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:13,682
Oh, that--that's just
something I added in.

899
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,818
- This is unacceptable.
- Wait a minute.

900
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,020
How could you add that in
if we did the paperwork?

901
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,206
And if he can't practice law
in the country,

902
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,570
he can't be a member
of our firm.

903
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:25,077
We must have agreed to it
in advance.

904
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,580
You set
this whole thing up.

905
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,548
Jessica set
this whole thing up.

906
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:31,217
But what's it matter?

907
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:32,885
You really gonna put this
on Ava

908
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:34,637
when you can get off
with a slap on the wrist?

909
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:36,672
I asked you to put aside
your anger.

910
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:39,842
I did.
You said Ava was family.

911
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:42,728
The thing about family
is they make it easy

912
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:46,015
to put you in the position
where you don't have a choice.

913
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:48,017
Now, you gonna
sign the deal,

914
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:51,220
or do I just pick up the trial
right where we left off?

915
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,576
You're doing
the right thing, Edward.

916
00:37:57,661 --> 00:38:00,246
We'll worry about the terms
of our dissolution tomorrow.

917
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:03,899
And, Edward...

918
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,751
We may be getting a divorce,

919
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:08,454
but I fully intend on keeping
ownership of the house.

920
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:16,912
Who'd have thought
we'd end up here?

921
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,247
I did.

922
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,965
No, you didn't.

923
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,800
You took a chance
with Clifford Danner,

924
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,302
and you know it.

925
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:24,970
It wasn't a chance.

926
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,421
I played the man.

927
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,775
And, Cameron, you're not
only about winning.

928
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,278
You're about putting
guilty people away.

929
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:37,149
Nice working with you.

930
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:40,619
Onetime deal.

931
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,144
I guess this means
you're not looking

932
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:43,372
for another name partner?

933
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:45,241
Goodbye, Cameron.

934
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:54,300
Norma said you
had something for me?

935
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:56,335
I do.

936
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:00,639
He dropped it.
I win.

937
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:03,509
Do you?

938
00:39:05,628 --> 00:39:07,813
What?
What are you talking about?

939
00:39:07,898 --> 00:39:10,966
Why do you hate Harold
so much?

940
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,801
- I don't hate him.
- Yeah, you do...

941
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,353
Because I've never seen you
be as mean to anyone

942
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:15,654
as you are to him.
Rachel, I-

943
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,907
- don't "Rachel" me.
He's a human being.

944
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:19,658
What's the matter with you?

945
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,867
When I was a kid
in gym class...

946
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,205
We had to climb the rope.

947
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:37,159
Every day I tried
really hard,

948
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,378
and every day...

949
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,764
Everyone would laugh at me.

950
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:50,005
The one thing in my life
that I've always been great at

951
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,691
is training
the associates...

952
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:55,644
Except for Harold.

953
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:57,179
He's my failure.

954
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,566
And every time
I look at him, it...

955
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,821
puts me right back
in gym class.

956
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,629
Louis...

957
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:15,965
Harold's climbing
that rope.

958
00:40:16,032 --> 00:40:17,699
He's succeeding.

959
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,635
And the way
you got this victory

960
00:40:19,702 --> 00:40:22,087
was by going
after his career.

961
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,758
And you're just yanking him
right back down.

962
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:40,656
We never got this.

963
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:43,392
Send back his original offer
marked "accepted."

964
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:55,237
I never want this
spoken of again.

965
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:57,406
You never want what
spoken of again?

966
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,878
Harvey,
what did Ava have to say?

967
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,214
She'd already left
for the airport.

968
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:08,300
Someone saves my life,
I might stop to say thank you.

969
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:09,718
You really blame her

970
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,303
after what this firm
put her through?

971
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:12,688
When you put it
that way...

972
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:14,640
It doesn't matter.
It was a huge win.

973
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,258
Go celebrate.

974
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:17,443
Whoa.
Hey, hey.

975
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:18,927
Don't you mean
"let's go celebrate"?

976
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:21,096
Am I really the person
you want to celebrate

977
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,981
this big murder-trial
victory with?

978
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,933
I don't know. It depends.
Do you put out?

979
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:27,436
- Why don't you ask Rachel?
- That's not funny.

980
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:45,637
Harvey.

981
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:48,424
Donna.

982
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:49,624
How'd it go?

983
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,177
As well as it could.

984
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,799
Harvey...

985
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,137
Thank you.

986
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,656
Why don't you keep the car?

987
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:07,142
I feel like walking tonight.

988
