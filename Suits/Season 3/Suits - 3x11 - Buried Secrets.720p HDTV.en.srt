1
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:02,776
I don't know anyone
that has ever made

2
00:00:02,777 --> 00:00:04,678
a long-distance
relationship work.

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:06,656
But I can't stand
that I put you in this position,

4
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,415
and the only way
I can see out of this

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,035
is for you to go to Stanford.

6
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:13,954
Come after me, Tanner.
That's what you're here for.

7
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:15,239
You actually care about her.

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,790
You think he didn't say
some things in there

9
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:18,325
that got to me too?

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,211
Well, I'm not bringing them up,
because right now,

11
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:21,462
we need to stick together.

12
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,363
Sticking together
means telling the truth.

13
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,666
I can't stand
to see them come after you.

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,884
You think I can't take it!

15
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:28,252
Look, you're not listening
to me, okay?

16
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,703
I can't take it!

17
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:30,721
If all you want to do
is work with me,

18
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,372
I can find a job
somewhere else.

19
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,142
Scottie, that's not
all I want.

20
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:36,176
Then say it.

21
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,095
I want you in my life.

22
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:39,513
I don't want her to go,

23
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,381
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

24
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,683
I finished my list.

25
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:44,384
And?

26
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:45,402
You're staying?

27
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:48,939
Just try and stop me.

28
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,077
This place has every
Harvard law student file ever.

29
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:55,946
Do not touch
any of the files in here.

30
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:58,666
Mike Ross--
he's not here.

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,079
What are you thinking about?

32
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:14,431
You look beautiful.

33
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:16,383
Thank you.

34
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,918
What are you thinking?

35
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,853
That your furniture's
really old.

36
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:22,856
I think the word you're
looking for is "antiquey."

37
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:26,393
That is not a word, and
this sofa is Ikea circa 1994.

38
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:27,778
Okay, I get it.

39
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:30,281
So you get up early just so you
can do a thorough critiquing

40
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:31,615
of my furniture?

41
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,486
Actually, I got up early,
so I could figure out

42
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:39,039
if there's anything around here
that I could stand living with.

43
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:44,111
Ah...I'm sorry--do you want
to move in together?

44
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:45,829
Yeah, I mean,
if the offer still stands.

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,333
Are you kidding me?

46
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:50,801
So is that a yes?

47
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:53,754
Oh, no, this is a yes.

48
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,144
I figured out
what we can bring.

49
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:01,512
- What?
- You.

50
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,347
Panda, right here.

51
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,099
That's my favorite piece of art.

52
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,151
That is not art.

53
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:08,969
Grammy gave that to me.

54
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:10,104
Oh, I love it.
Panda can come.

55
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,105
And the chair.

56
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,740
Oh.

57
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:13,741
That was
Grammy's favorite chair.

58
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:14,975
I don't--I don't--

59
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:16,643
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm telling you, Rachel,

60
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,813
she used to sit in that chair
every Sunday

61
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:22,649
and drink her hot cup
of Hershey's cocoa

62
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,002
and tell me
all about growing up

63
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:27,320
on the mean streets
of Philadelphia.

64
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,157
When you lie,
try less details.

65
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:31,158
Got it.

66
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,638
Looking for me?

67
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:47,174
No.

68
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,177
The woman I'm looking for
is a lot more in my bed.

69
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:53,313
What can I say?
My schedule stops for no man.

70
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:57,534
Yes, but we've got
a little unfinished...

71
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,120
Business.

72
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,623
I wouldn't call last night
"unfinished."

73
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:05,659
And I wouldn't call it
"business."

74
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,532
I was talking about breakfast.

75
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,501
Harvey Specter
makes breakfast?

76
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,003
You never heard
of the Specter special?

77
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,805
I think I just had
the Specter special.

78
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,806
Oh, no, no, no, no.

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,924
The Specter special is--
Let me guess.

80
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:24,895
It's two eggs, over easy,

81
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:28,148
with a side of "Scottie,
I want you in my life."

82
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,566
Bacon.

83
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,935
And now I'm reconsidering
the "in my life" thing.

84
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:35,072
Oh, no, I saw your face.
You had your serious face on.

85
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,491
"Scottie, I want you
in my life.

86
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,611
Scottie...
I want you in my life."

87
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:43,363
You know what?
You don't deserve my bacon.

88
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:46,733
Oh, that's fine,
'cause I have to go anyway.

89
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,202
Where could you have to go?
You're unemployed.

90
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:51,071
Well, actually a top-tier
law firm offered me a job

91
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:52,539
last night,
and I thought it might be best

92
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,541
if I negotiate the terms
of my agreement

93
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,511
with the partner
I'm not sleeping with.

94
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:00,914
There's a slight problem
with that plan.

95
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,385
You offered her a job
before talking to me?

96
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,555
I didn't offer her a job.
I asked her if she wanted one.

97
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:11,108
I didn't want to waste
your time, and for the record,

98
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:12,182
we'd be lucky to have her.

99
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,527
I know that.

100
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,395
But my question isn't
why I should want her here,

101
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,780
it's why you would want
her here.

102
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:20,567
She's the best lawyer I know,
after me.

103
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,768
And you.

104
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:22,986
Are you sleeping with her?

105
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,538
Excuse me?

106
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,156
You have history
with this woman,

107
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,541
so I just want to know

108
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,376
are you doing this
because you feel sorry for her

109
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,494
or because you want to pay
her back

110
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:31,962
or because you love her
or what?

111
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,964
- It's none of your business.
- It is my business.

112
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:36,250
It is literally my business.

113
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,805
I want a relationship
with her.

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,973
Well, I'm happy for you.

115
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:45,125
I hope you two make a run at it.
Thanks.

116
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:46,626
I'll pretend you meant that.

117
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:48,262
Your track record
isn't great.

118
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,297
You've had three name partners
in two years.

119
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:51,798
Let's talk
about your commitment issues.

120
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:52,933
I'm not asking you

121
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,402
to give my commitment issues
a corner office.

122
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:56,937
You don't need to give her
a corner office.

123
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,238
Any regular office will do.

124
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,440
Harvey, I get it.

125
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,476
She's a catch, for you
and for this firm.

126
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,015
But what happens
when you two break up?

127
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,281
Who says
we're gonna break up?

Foreman versus Heart Med--
I want it.

139
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,501
"Good morning, Harvey.

140
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:50,619
What can I do for you today?"
I'm serious.

141
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,787
They're pushing for a settlement

142
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:52,788
because they know our client
can afford it.

143
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,873
I know they are.

144
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,091
You haven't even looked
at the file.

145
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,408
My name is on the door.

146
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:58,710
You think I don't know
our cases?

147
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:00,245
So why are we settling?

148
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:01,463
Because regardless
of the merits of this case,

149
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:02,681
it's not worth our time.

150
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:04,216
Harvey, listen--

151
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,084
Heart Med's in-house lawyer
negotiated this

152
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:09,187
because the bad PR costs them
more than the settlement.

153
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:10,439
We'd have to get the thing
dismissed to make it worth it,

154
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,556
and that's not gonna happen.

155
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,025
The lawyer is Nick Rinaldi.

156
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,140
- Who the hell is Nick Rinaldi?
- You don't remember?

157
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,947
I was 11 years old,
a little boy, powerless.

158
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,699
I watched him boil my parents'
lives down to a few dollars.

159
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,484
Yes.

160
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:23,869
I'm not gonna let that piece
of shit get a penny from us.

161
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:27,605
I said yes.

162
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:29,074
Thanks, Harvey.

163
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:30,742
You want to thank me,

164
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:34,379
why don't you go beat
the shit out of this guy?

165
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:38,834
Monday, 2:20 p.m.

166
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:42,954
This conundrum is burning a hole
in my brain.

167
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:45,257
Think.

168
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,457
Logically.

169
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:50,428
I mean, Sheila is professional
and meticulous

170
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:52,981
and wonderfully anal,

171
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,766
and if she says that nothing
gets misplaced

172
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,985
in her inner sanctum,
then I believe her,

173
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:00,071
which leaves
the national security option.

174
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,276
Is Mike Ross CIA?

175
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,944
Please.

176
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,696
There's a better chance
that Esther's in the KGB.

177
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:09,114
I mean, I can ask Sheila,

178
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:12,000
if I'm no longer fond
of my testicles, which--

179
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:15,003
wait a second,
missing testicles, missing file.

180
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:18,990
It can't be missing
if it doesn't exist.

181
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:22,660
Holy shit.

182
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,597
What if Mike Ross never went
to Harvard at all?

183
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:29,134
What if he just went to some
crappy third-tier law school,

184
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:32,687
like Fordham or Arizona State?

185
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:34,439
"Yeah, hey, bro.

186
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:36,191
"Yeah, no, I'll see you
at the party.

187
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:37,642
"I'm not going to study
for the bar.

188
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,644
"Damn straight, that's right,
bros before hos.

189
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:41,346
Oh, yeah, you know--"
all right, that's enough.

190
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:47,285
He's been peeing directly into
our pristine pool of eliteness.

191
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,905
He's been--oh, shoot,
it's blinking out.

192
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:51,072
Norma, really quickly,

193
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,824
I need you to get a pack
of rechargeable AAA--

194
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:53,992
shit, it's out.

195
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:57,362
So I guess I'm just talking
to myself.

196
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,999
Harvey convinced me,
so let's get to it.

197
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,802
- I want a relocation fee.
- Done.

198
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:05,170
And a 10% increase
on my signing bonus.

199
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:06,838
7%.

200
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:08,139
You gave Harvey 10%.

201
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:10,725
Do you think you're worth
as much as Harvey?

202
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,876
I'm less of a pain
in the ass.

203
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:14,512
10% it is.

204
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,147
Now, no one ever opens
with the big stuff,

205
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,149
so why don't you tell me
what you're really after?

206
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:20,018
You know what I'm after.

207
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:22,654
The name of the firm
is Pearson Specter.

208
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,906
It's changed too many times, and
it's not going to change again.

209
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:27,692
Never?

210
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,194
I never say never.

211
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,830
- That's all I'm looking for.
- Of course.

212
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:35,367
After all, who knows where any
of us will be in a few years?

213
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:37,235
You, me, Harvey.

214
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:39,237
I think we just changed
the subject.

215
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:41,456
We did.

216
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:45,176
Now it's time for me to tell you
what I'm really after.

217
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:47,796
You want to know how committed
I am to Harvey.

218
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:51,683
I want to know how committed
you are to me.

219
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,918
- How serious are you?
- About what?

220
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,021
Me.

221
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,389
We had this conversation.

222
00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:58,723
We had this conversation

223
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:00,475
before it was going to cost me
$500,000.

224
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:04,229
Jessica's making you pay
the buy-in up front?

225
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,730
- Yep.
- Sh--.

226
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:07,198
What did you say?

227
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,283
Well, I said I don't want
to have to pay

228
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,318
a Harvey-Specter-girlfriend tax.

229
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,453
You're not exactly paying
a tax.

230
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:12,904
You're just buying in early.

231
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,873
Harvey, there's a reason
that firms are designed to have

232
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,074
a six-month trial period.

233
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,628
Yeah, to see
if it's going to work out.

234
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,294
- Exactly.
- Which you don't think it will.

235
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,611
I'm saying
that I need to know

236
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,081
what "I want you in my life"
really means.

237
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:25,283
You know what it means.

238
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,785
It means I want to have
a relationship.

239
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:31,256
But it doesn't mean that
I'm ready to give you a ring.

240
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,807
You think I'm ready
for a ring from you?

241
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:34,292
Then what are you ready for?

242
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,794
I'm ready for it not
to cost me a $1/2 million

243
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:38,396
if it doesn't work out.

244
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:40,148
So if it doesn't, are you
saying you're going to leave?

245
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,599
Would you want me to stay?

246
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,802
I don't even know what
you're gonna do to break us up.

247
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,905
Harvey, I'm not kidding.
I'm...

248
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,026
I'm scared.

249
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:52,327
You know, I just got an offer

250
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,079
from Latham & Watkins
in Chicago,

251
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:58,616
and I don't want to take it,
but...

252
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,452
I need to know that
you're serious about this.

253
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:03,788
Scottie, I am.

254
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:07,325
Yeah, but nobody's asking you
to put up $1/2 million.

255
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,427
Maybe we can make it

256
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:12,714
so nobody's asking you
to do that either.

257
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,470
Rinaldi.

258
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:24,442
You remember me?

259
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,777
James and Nina Ross.

260
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:27,896
That's good.

261
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:31,282
Finally know
my parents' names.

262
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:32,867
What you maybe don't know
is that I'm a lawyer,

263
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:34,319
I work for Pearson Specter,

264
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:37,355
and we're not going to be
settling this Foreman suit.

265
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:38,356
We had an agreement.

266
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:40,959
Yeah, maybe, but instead,

267
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:44,212
we're gonna be filing this.

268
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:47,916
There's no way you're getting
this case dismissed.

269
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,801
You know, I actually wanted
to believe that whole sob story

270
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,219
about being reformed, but--

271
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:54,222
My client is a widow,
not a drunk driver.

272
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,706
Oh, so you don't actually
bully the little guy anymore,

273
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:56,891
you just try
and capitalize on him.

274
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,393
Do you even know the details
of this case,

275
00:10:58,427 --> 00:10:59,844
or are you just coming after us
because I'm on the other side?

276
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:01,212
No, I'm coming after you

277
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,047
because you're
a worthless ambulance chaser,

278
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,066
and I'm not gonna let you take
my client's money.

279
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,551
This is the second time
you've come after me

280
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,569
from out of the blue.

281
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:08,686
I apologized to you once.

282
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,388
I will not apologize
to you again.

283
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,490
You don't have to.

284
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:13,775
And we're not going to court,

285
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,911
because I'm gonna prove
you're full of shit.

286
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:19,845
You ready
for the deposition?

287
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:21,313
Yeah, of course I'm ready.

288
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,898
- Your fly is unzipped.
- No, it's not.

289
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,233
Didn't even flinch.

290
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,284
That means you're ready.

291
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,635
Then why are you still walking
with me?

292
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,070
'Cause I'm coming
to your deposition.

293
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,405
What?
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

294
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,706
You said that I could take
this case.

295
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,408
You told me I could kick
this guy's ass.

296
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,876
It's my deposition, not yours.

297
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,544
- I know.
- You know?

298
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,746
Why are you babysitting me?
I'm not babysitting you.

299
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,947
I want to watch you
kill this guy.

300
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,249
That's why I brought snacks.

301
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,963
You can't bring peanuts
into my deposition.

302
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,585
- Why?
- It's unprofessional.

303
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,220
So is that tie,
but I've made my peace with it.

304
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,388
Look, I don't give a shit

305
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:47,756
whether you made your peace
with it or not.

306
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,974
You want in my room?

307
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,559
You're not bringing peanuts.

308
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:53,479
You really are ready.

309
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,630
Here.

310
00:11:58,268 --> 00:11:59,768
What's this?

311
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,154
Harvey's interviews
the day Mike Ross was hired.

312
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,574
But Mike Ross isn't on it.

313
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:06,942
Where'd you get this?

314
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,810
Doesn't matter where I got it.
The fact is I did.

315
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,746
Are you asking me
why Mike Ross isn't on it?

316
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,282
Yeah, Donna, that's
precisely what I'm asking.

317
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,817
How exactly did Harvey
find him?

318
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,203
We didn't find him,
he found us.

319
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:19,421
What are you talking about?

320
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,793
Mike hadn't signed up
for the interview on time,

321
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,961
so he pretended to be

322
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,047
one of the other associates
on the list.

323
00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:29,598
He talked his way past me

324
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:30,999
and impressed the shit
out of Harvey,

325
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,518
whose main requirement was
somebody who had the balls

326
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,269
to do something like that
in the first place.

327
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,305
Okay.

328
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:39,608
What if he had the balls
to do something

329
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,527
a lot bigger than that?

330
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,278
What are you talking about?

331
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,679
I think Mike Ross went
to a subpar law school

332
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,181
and has been lying about it
the whole time.

333
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,901
Louis, listen to yourself.
You're talking about Mike.

334
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,119
You're insane.

335
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,788
I'm...

336
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,374
Okay, I was in the Harvard
file room with Sheila.

337
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,159
Don't ask details.

338
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,046
And I noticed Mike Ross' file
was not there.

339
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,199
You specifically looked
for his file?

340
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,417
Yes, and I looked
for Harvey's too,

341
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:06,668
and his was there.

342
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,337
And by the way,
he looked like a major douche.

343
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,339
So you looked at a grand total
of two files

344
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,673
out of tens of thousands,

345
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,560
and this is the conclusion
you jump to?

346
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,644
What is wrong with you?

347
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,146
You don't know Sheila.

348
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,897
She's like a surgeon,
and the files are her patients.

349
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,015
She doesn't make mistakes.

350
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,735
- You told her about this?
- Hell no.

351
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,737
She told me not to touch
any of those files,

352
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,105
and she'd kill me
if she found out that I did.

353
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,573
I just asked her
about it generally.

354
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,325
Well, of course she's
gonna say she never loses one,

355
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,027
but I can tell you
from personal experience,

356
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,397
anything can happen to a file.

357
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,782
I don't know.

358
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,119
Well, I do. I know Mike,
and I know he's for real.

359
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,287
But if you still doubt it,
there's an easy answer.

360
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:45,240
Just call up Harvard and ask
for a copy of his transcript.

361
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,293
And what if it's not there?

362
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:51,430
Then I will apologize
for calling you insane

363
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,933
and personally help you escort
Mike Ross out of the building.

364
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,857
Good-bye.

365
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:04,193
In 2002, you were sued
for the malfunctioning

366
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,778
of an earlier model
of the heart stent.

367
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:06,895
Is that correct?

368
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,763
Yes, and we admitted
wrongdoing.

369
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,617
The stent that was installed
in your patient was a new model

370
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,204
developed through three years
of extensive trials.

371
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,406
Making it outside the scope,
and frankly, not a good argument

372
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,740
for establishing pattern.

373
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,942
They saw a problem,
and they fixed it.

374
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,611
How horrible,
we should sue them.

375
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,912
We're not in court.

376
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,464
Opening statements
are made before a judge,

377
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,049
or have you never been
in court before?

378
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,404
I just wanted to give you
a taste,

379
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:31,086
seeing as we're never
actually gonna get there.

380
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,339
A dismissal is
never gonna happen, son.

381
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,262
Sorry for your loss, son.

382
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,430
What?

383
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,300
I'm saying, don't hope
for a dismissal.

384
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,568
Please direct your questions
to our client.

385
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,303
That wasn't a question.
It was a comment.

386
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,572
Here's a question for you,
Mr. Dimond.

387
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,107
What is this really worth
to you?

388
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,909
You may think you have
a defense.

389
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:56,278
Your lawyer certainly thinks
you do.

390
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,113
But I just want to be clear
about the facts.

391
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,949
What is this really worth
to you?

392
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,669
There's no question,
this was a terrible accident.

393
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,254
But let's be clear
about the facts.

394
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:10,926
His blood alcohol level
is an issue here.

395
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,294
If you pursue this in court,

396
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,962
there's no guarantee
you'll receive anything.

397
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,098
Think about the boy.

398
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,100
Think about what he needs.

399
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,002
Something is better
than nothing.

400
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,563
Stop stalling, Mr. Ross.

401
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,986
- Um, I--
- He's not stalling.

402
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,988
And we're under no obligation

403
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,157
to disclose trials
from an earlier model.

404
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,792
It's beyond the scope.

405
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,410
Our expert will place
that study within the scope.

406
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,411
Um, uh--

407
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:47,862
If there isn't a trial,

408
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,531
your expert won't have
any scope to place it in.

409
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,583
And since you insist
on asking questions

410
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:53,385
we're under no obligation
to answer,

411
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,921
this deposition is over.

412
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,677
What the hell happened
in there?

413
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,545
You said you wanted to watch,
not hijack my case.

414
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,314
You said
you were going to kick his ass,

415
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:06,481
not drift
into never-never land.

416
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,400
- I'm handling it.
- Handling it?

417
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,768
I could've eaten
that whole bag of peanuts

418
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:12,053
in the pause you took
to answer that question.

419
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,189
You got thrown,
and I bailed you out.

420
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,657
Harvey, this is my case.

421
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,026
This is not your case.
It's the client's case.

422
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,394
And after what happened
in there,

423
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,246
they're in a worse position
than when we started.

424
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,398
Look, I know I got thrown,
but I can still recover.

425
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,400
Maybe, but they're gonna call
in a half an hour

426
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,702
wanting to take the deal,

427
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,237
and when they do,
I'm gonna buy you one day,

428
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,257
and then
I'm pulling the plug.

429
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,109
Hey, do you have a minute?

430
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,194
- I'm a little busy right now.
- We have a problem.

431
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,396
Scottie's not going to be
a problem.

432
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:45,700
I thought it through--
Louis might be onto Mike.

433
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,421
He found out that Mike
doesn't have a file

434
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,839
in the Harvard file room

435
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:54,208
and that he wasn't
on your original interview list.

436
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,343
What did you tell him?

437
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:56,711
Well, I handled the list.

438
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:58,930
- What about the other?
- What could I tell him?

439
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,414
I mean, I told him
if he was so curious,

440
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,350
he could order a copy
of Mike's transcript.

441
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:04,084
Then we don't have
a problem.

442
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:06,938
Well, don't you think maybe
we should do something else?

443
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:09,256
Anything else is just going
to make him more suspicious.

444
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:11,559
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

445
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,027
Okay.

446
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:14,028
Oh, wait a second.

447
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:15,429
Where did you say
Louis was again?

448
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:16,948
Oh, he was
in the Harvard file room.

449
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:18,116
How was he
in the Harvard file room?

450
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,434
He has a relationship
with Sheila Sazs.

451
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:21,702
What?

452
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:24,739
Yeah, never mind.
We're good.

453
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:38,619
Oh, thank you,

454
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,671
but I'm sorry,
I don't have time.

455
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:42,673
It's food.
It's not going to stop you.

456
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:43,724
It's going to keep you going.

457
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,143
Yeah, I don't need food.

458
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,227
I need to find something
I can take

459
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,763
to this dismissal hearing
tomorrow.

460
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,898
Mike, it was
a pretty decent settlement.

461
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,133
Would it really be so bad
to just take it?

462
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,356
My dad was one of those guys

463
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:00,691
who liked to celebrate
everything--

464
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:04,362
the half birthdays
or first time

465
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,831
I struck someone out
at Little League.

466
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:09,200
And the last time I saw them,
they were celebrating

467
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:13,287
the anniversary
of their first date.

468
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,291
They were so excited,
all dressed up,

469
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:20,428
and I was annoyed,

470
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,679
because I didn't want
to spend the night

471
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:24,498
at my grandmother's house.

472
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:26,467
So before they left,

473
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,335
my dad came upstairs
to say good-bye,

474
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:32,056
and I told him that celebrating
a first date was stupid.

475
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,509
And he just looks at me like,

476
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:37,028
"Michael, you have no idea

477
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:40,531
how important
a first date can be."

478
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:43,150
Theirs must have been
a great one.

479
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:45,820
No, no, no,
it was a total disaster.

480
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:48,823
He spilled wine all over her.
He forgot his wallet.

481
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,693
And then, for some reason,
this woman, you know--

482
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:57,715
this woman who he knew
was just perfect--

483
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,750
agreed to a second date.

484
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:02,753
And a third.

485
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:06,641
And everything after that.

486
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:09,560
I wish
I could have met them.

487
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,597
He tried
to hug me good-bye...

488
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,268
But I didn't hug him back.

489
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,575
I didn't even go downstairs
to say good-bye to my mom.

490
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,288
And then they were gone.

491
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:42,076
And then the next morning,
Rinaldi shows up at our house,

492
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,795
and he offers my grandmother

493
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:49,083
the equivalent
of one year's rent.

494
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,434
Rinaldi didn't kill
my parents,

495
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:54,588
but he did try to tell me
what their lives were worth.

496
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:59,393
And I'm sorry, but I know that
my mom and dad were worth...

497
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,728
A lot more than that.

498
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:04,431
Forget the food.

499
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:07,735
Give me half the files.

500
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:23,801
What about a hedge fund guy?
It's big money.

501
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:24,835
Think bigger.

502
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:26,286
Obama.

503
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,338
I'm not going to land
the president

504
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:29,423
as my first client.

505
00:20:29,457 --> 00:20:30,925
Fine, if you don't think
you can.

506
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,561
You're not going to manipulate
me into trying to land Obama.

507
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:35,479
Well, it better be somebody
like that,

508
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:38,799
or Jessica won't give up
on her early buy-in bullshit.

509
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,818
What if I got myself
a sports guy?

510
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:44,405
The very fact that you call it
"a sports guy" means it's a no.

511
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,157
Harvey, just because
I don't know sports

512
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:48,475
doesn't mean I don't know you.

513
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:49,643
What are you talking about?

514
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,245
If I'm going to change
Jessica's mind,

515
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,363
I can't just land someone,

516
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,415
I have to land someone
you couldn't.

517
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,483
There's no one
I couldn't land.

518
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,253
You think I don't know
about Beijing?

519
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:04,125
That's his word
against mine.

520
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,595
Oh, well, um, I guess
we can clear that up right now,

521
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:11,265
because look
who just walked in.

522
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,437
You knew
he was coming here tonight?

523
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,022
You think
I like Argentinean food?

524
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:19,724
I just need you to stop him
for a second.

525
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,108
I get it.

526
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:23,694
You got the idea
from <i>Working Girl,</i>

527
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,346
when they crash the wedding
to get to Trask radio.

528
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,732
Harvey, I'm not
a 14-year-old girl.

529
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:30,951
I don't get my ideas
from movies.

530
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:33,687
Michael.

531
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:34,989
Harvey.

532
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,357
I have no interest
in talking to you.

533
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,994
Hi. Dana Scott.

534
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:41,629
I work with Harvey,
and I don't blame you.

535
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,363
I wouldn't want him
to represent me either.

536
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:44,415
But he's not
the only lawyer there.

537
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:45,750
Let me guess.

538
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:47,168
You've done your research
on my record,

539
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:49,036
and you're here to impress me.

540
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:50,554
That's what
every other lawyer would do.

541
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:52,390
- I didn't do that.
- Harvey, shut up.

542
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:55,092
I don't give a shit
about how fast you used to swim.

543
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:57,144
I only care about how fast
I can make you money.

544
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,146
How fast is that?

545
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:01,098
Why don't you sit down,
and I'll tell you?

546
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,484
- All right.
- Okay.

547
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,188
Harvey, you mind?

548
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:09,073
- Actually, I--
- Great.

549
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:11,575
I'll see you tomorrow.

550
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,912
Good to see you, buddy.

551
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:16,330
So what really happened
in Beijing?

552
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:18,232
Let's get a drink first.

553
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,201
Sounds good.

554
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,119
Doctor, how routine
is this procedure?

555
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,570
Sid Foreman
should have been dancing

556
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:25,840
at his daughter's wedding
a week later.

557
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:29,176
Instead, he went
into heart failure.

558
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:32,430
Dr. Lombard,
on December 7, 2006,

559
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:35,716
did a patient die on your table
during a routine angioplasty?

560
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,718
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

561
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:38,919
It speaks
to his qualifications

562
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:40,054
as an expert witness,
Your Honor.

563
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:42,589
I'll allow.

564
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:44,391
Yes, a patient died.

565
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,893
And was a malpractice suit

566
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,361
filed against you
for physician error?

567
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:48,529
That case was sealed.

568
00:22:48,563 --> 00:22:49,780
I didn't ask you
if it was sealed.

569
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,866
I asked if it was filed.

570
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,033
It was.

571
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:54,985
- And settled?
- For almost nothing--

572
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:55,986
Objection, Your Honor.

573
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:57,238
Move to strike.
The case is sealed.

574
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,672
The witness
isn't allowed to testify

575
00:22:58,707 --> 00:22:59,790
to the details
of that settlement.

576
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:00,908
Sustained.

577
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:02,910
Have you practiced medicine
since?

578
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:05,246
Yes, I've been practicing.

579
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,631
I'm sorry, what I meant to say
is have you performed surgery,

580
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,834
the job you spent seven years
training to do?

581
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,886
No.

582
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,254
What, loss of confidence?

583
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:14,555
They wouldn't let you?

584
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:15,622
Objection.
Speculation.

585
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,457
I want an answer
to my question.

586
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,926
I chose to do other things.

587
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,177
Other things
that don't involve the chance

588
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:21,228
of you killing people?

589
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:22,629
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.

590
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,131
What's your primary source
of income?

591
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,484
I work as an expert witness.

592
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:27,818
So you testify now
to make a living,

593
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:29,904
because you don't trust yourself
to do the job

594
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:31,188
that you were trained to do?

595
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:33,473
I can speak to the facts
of this case--

596
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:34,742
Yes, you can speak to them,

597
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:35,910
but how are we supposed to trust
your opinion about them

598
00:23:35,944 --> 00:23:39,914
when you clearly
don't trust yourself?

599
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:46,773
You raised some doubts
about my expert.

600
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:48,706
That isn't gonna get
this case dismissed.

601
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:50,341
Maybe not,
but if that's the best expert

602
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,855
you can come up with,
then your client

603
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,660
just got a taste
of how this trial is gonna go.

604
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:56,297
My client
is not gonna drop this case,

605
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:59,967
and neither am I.

606
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:03,270
Well, then you are forcing me
to use this.

607
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:05,672
It's a picture of Mr. Foreman
at his daughter's wedding.

608
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,024
It's a picture of Mr. Foreman
drinking alcohol

609
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:08,609
at his daughter's wedding.

610
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:10,978
It's a toast.
It was one sip.

611
00:24:11,012 --> 00:24:13,680
One sip two hours before his
stent supposedly malfunctioned.

612
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:16,066
Alcohol was strictly forbidden
following his surgery,

613
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:18,786
which makes him liable
for his own death.

614
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,187
This is a total twisting
of the facts.

615
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:21,789
You can't prove
this caused anything.

616
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:23,223
You can't prove
it was only one sip,

617
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:24,959
and it doesn't matter,
because I submit this,

618
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:28,712
it's contributory negligence,
and your case is gone.

619
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,832
And you say I'm a monster.

620
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:33,334
Being a monster would be
putting your client

621
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:35,169
on the stand
and making her testify

622
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:37,471
that her husband's death
was his own damn fault.

623
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:42,409
Hi, Donna.

624
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:44,595
Hi, Louis.

625
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:46,847
I'm nothing
if not a big man,

626
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,750
and I am not ashamed
to admit when I am wrong.

627
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,769
You got Mike's transcript.

628
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:54,188
Arrived this morning.

629
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:55,889
Imagine that,
Mike Ross went to Harvard.

630
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:57,924
What a shocker.
You were right.

631
00:24:57,942 --> 00:25:00,027
Never should have doubted it.

632
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:02,396
You know, it's just hard
to imagine a world

633
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,864
in which Sheila made
a mistake, though.

634
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:05,532
Well, it's just good
you can put this to bed

635
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:06,567
once and for all.

636
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:08,569
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

637
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:10,270
If Sheila's competence
is that important to her,

638
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,792
I need to tell her about this,
so she can fix it.

639
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:15,942
You know what, Louis?

640
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,911
It occurred to me
after we talked

641
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:20,297
that I'm the only one who has
the list of associates

642
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:22,132
that interviewed
with Harvey that day.

643
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,585
That can't be right,

644
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:26,920
'cause I got a copy
off the general server.

645
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:28,138
You got a copy
by bullying Benjamin

646
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,457
into accessing my private files
off my hard drive.

647
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,459
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Louis--

648
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:33,977
Okay, I did it, but that was
only 'cause I was concerned.

649
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:37,097
So your concern gives you
the right to invade my privacy?

650
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,566
I--what?
No, it was just a file.

651
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:41,468
How dare you?

652
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:43,404
You pretend to be
this gallant man.

653
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,806
You make a big show of how you
would never cross into my area

654
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:46,940
without my permission.

655
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,659
I am gallant,
and I would never dare.

656
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:50,744
You wouldn't dare, because
you'd have to do it to my face.

657
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:53,030
But you have no problem breaking
my trust behind my back,

658
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:55,148
and that not only pisses me off,

659
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,868
but it makes me question...

660
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,320
Whether I want to have
a relationship with you at all.

661
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:03,156
I'm so sorry, Donna.

662
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:04,675
No, Louis, you know what--

663
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:07,928
- No, no, no, Donna, I'm sorry.
- No, I can't.

664
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:09,263
- No, no, no, no.
- I can't--I can't even--

665
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:11,331
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, shh! Don't speak.

666
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,501
I cannot even look at you
right now.

667
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,002
And I don't even know
why I'm gonna tell you this,

668
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,554
but if you pissed me off
that much,

669
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:18,806
what do you think
Sheila's gonna do

670
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,675
when you tell her
you violated her trust?

671
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:24,478
Huh?

672
00:26:24,512 --> 00:26:26,864
You're right.

673
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:28,348
Thank you, Donna,

674
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:31,902
for putting your anger on hold
long enough to help me salvage

675
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:34,288
the single most important
non-feline relationship

676
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:37,157
of my life.

677
00:26:50,388 --> 00:26:52,806
- Someone's been a bad boy.
- Sheila.

678
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:53,807
You thought
I wouldn't find out?

679
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:55,876
I hoped you wouldn't.

680
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:02,048
If you wanted a pair
of my underwear,

681
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:04,318
you should have just asked.

682
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:05,719
Oh, that, Sheila.

683
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:07,721
God, what are you doing here?

684
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,773
Aren't you happy I'm here?

685
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:12,159
Of course, absolutely.

686
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:14,611
- You don't seem happy.
- I'm overjoyed.

687
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:16,363
I'm just, you know--
I'm just surprised.

688
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:18,665
But you're all nervous
and sweaty.

689
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,534
Come on, you know
my sweat ducts get excited

690
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:22,068
when they see you.
Good.

691
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:24,237
Because your sweat ducts are
going to be working overtime.

692
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:25,839
What?

693
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:30,260
The Chilton,
room 305, tonight.

694
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:44,758
You didn't have to come

695
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:46,226
all the way over here
just to drop the case.

696
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,196
I came here to tell you
you're doing the wrong thing.

697
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,317
I don't need a lecture
from you on right and wrong.

698
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:54,735
You once asked me
how I live with myself.

699
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:57,955
Well, somewhere along the way,
I realized I had a choice

700
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:59,957
not to be on the side
that made me feel like shit.

701
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:03,109
You're on that side now.
Yeah, I don't feel like shit.

702
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,045
That's because you're telling
yourself you're doing your job.

703
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,630
And I'm telling you
that you're bullying someone

704
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:07,831
who deserves your sympathy.

705
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:10,918
You really want to play
the bullying card?

706
00:28:10,952 --> 00:28:12,636
My grandmother lost
her only son.

707
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,120
You used her grief
against her.

708
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:15,923
This has nothing to do
with that.

709
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:18,058
Look, I know, you need me
to be the villain--

710
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:19,059
No, no, no, no, no.

711
00:28:19,093 --> 00:28:20,811
You are the villain.

712
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:24,431
Well, then congratulations,
because you just became me.

713
00:28:26,317 --> 00:28:29,436
What are you talking about?

714
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:35,409
Your father had two drinks
on the night he was killed.

715
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:37,077
That was the reason I was able
to get your grandmother

716
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:38,695
to settle.

717
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:51,625
It's not every day
I get off the elevator

718
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,095
and find someone in my firm
that makes me look short.

719
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,464
So you've seen
our newest client?

720
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:58,999
You mean
Scottie's newest client.

721
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:00,717
Michael Phelps may be
her client,

722
00:29:00,768 --> 00:29:02,669
but we're gonna get Speedo.

723
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:05,939
And why should that
make me change my mind?

724
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:07,774
Because their fee
is worth more than her buy-in.

725
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,944
You still think
this is about money.

726
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:13,847
I told this to Scottie, and now
I'm going to tell it to you.

727
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:16,533
We've had too much turnover.

728
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:17,851
We can't have any more.

729
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,020
Jessica, I'm telling you
she's in.

730
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:21,521
Then she shouldn't have
any problem putting her money

731
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:22,623
where her mouth is.

732
00:29:22,657 --> 00:29:23,874
It's not right.

733
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:27,527
Harvey, it's time
you and I had the talk.

734
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:28,829
I know
where babies come from.

735
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:31,214
But do you know how couples
stay together?

736
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:32,699
What are you getting at?

737
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:34,885
When Daniel and I
took over the firm,

738
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,803
we had a heart-to-heart.

739
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:39,139
He had a philosophy
that I agreed to live by.

740
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:40,507
Daniel was a piece of shit.

741
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:44,811
Doesn't mean
his philosophy was.

742
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:46,263
I'm listening.

743
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:48,882
He told me,
for a partnership to work,

744
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,069
there has to be trust between
number one and number two.

745
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:54,071
You don't have
to agree with me,

746
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:56,657
but you have to trust
that I listen to you,

747
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:58,358
that my decisions
are reasoned,

748
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:00,360
and that I am doing
what I think is right.

749
00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:01,411
Jessica--

750
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:02,863
You can't have
two presidents, Harvey.

751
00:30:02,897 --> 00:30:04,865
Now I chose to trust you
when you said

752
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:06,450
you didn't want to be
managing partner.

753
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:07,701
Was that true or not?

754
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:08,835
It was.

755
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,704
Then I need you
to accept this.

756
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:13,073
What if I had an idea

757
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,209
where maybe we can both get
what we want?

758
00:30:19,013 --> 00:30:20,413
I'm listening.

759
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,754
That's never happened
to me before.

760
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:29,422
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

761
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,975
<i>Black Hawk Down.</i>

762
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:33,810
First of all,

763
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:35,428
that's an amazing movie,
and you should be proud

764
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:37,280
that you are associated
with it.

765
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:39,783
And second of all, I think
I know what the problem is.

766
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:42,602
You do?

767
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,240
It's about what happened
in the file room.

768
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,409
Listen, Sheila,
I can't tell you

769
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:50,443
how that's been weighing
on my mind.

770
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,612
No, I get it.

771
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,633
Now that we've declared
our love,

772
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:59,119
you think of me
as a good girl.

773
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,088
And you need me to be bad.

774
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:03,473
- What?
- It happens all the time.

775
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:06,426
We're in a relationship now,
and you think that changes

776
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,429
the nature
of our sexual relationship.

777
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:12,015
But I am here to assure you...

778
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,316
I can be bad.

779
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,068
Okay, that's not actually
what--

780
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:16,136
Liar.

781
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,237
Whoa.

782
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,939
Take it easy.

783
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:20,741
I am being serious right now.

784
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:23,476
You think
I'm not being serious?

785
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:26,696
I'm deadly serious.
Ow.

786
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:28,915
- Say it again.
- Ow.

787
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,983
Ooh.

788
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:33,336
Ooh.

789
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,705
Well, what do you know?

790
00:31:35,757 --> 00:31:37,824
<i>The Dark Knight Rises.</i>

791
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:52,172
- She went for it.
- She did?

792
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,473
One catch.

793
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:54,608
What?

794
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:56,693
You have to sign
an ironclad noncompete.

795
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:58,478
You can't represent

796
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:00,513
any Pearson Specter clients
if you leave.

797
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:03,850
- Including Phelps?
- Including Phelps.

798
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,535
How is that any different
than paying in early?

799
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,020
It's $1/2 million different.

800
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:08,205
Harvey.

801
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:12,358
Scottie, this is the best
we're gonna do.

802
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:14,244
Phelps brings in the money.

803
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:16,529
But if you leave
and take him away,

804
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:18,331
what good does that
do Jessica?

805
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:19,916
Jessica or you?

806
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:22,202
Are you kidding?
Are you questioning me?

807
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,204
You've been known
to manipulate situations before.

808
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:27,507
If it were up to me,
I'd waive your whole buy-in.

809
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,975
Now I know
you're full of shit.

810
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,594
You're right, I am.

811
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:33,379
So get your check ready, 'cause
in six months, you're paying it.

812
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:36,399
Are we really doing this?

813
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:45,242
Sign it.
Give it to Jessica.

814
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:48,278
Tomorrow we'll celebrate
with dinner at my place.

815
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,034
Where did you get this?

816
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:56,002
Rinaldi.

817
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:57,087
Mike, I know
what you're thinking,

818
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:58,922
but your father
wasn't legally drunk.

819
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:01,925
Yeah, but he wasn't sober
either.

820
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,910
And how do I know
those two drinks aren't

821
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:07,047
the split second
that he needed not to...

822
00:33:07,081 --> 00:33:08,682
You don't know
that this had

823
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:10,217
anything to do
with the accident.

824
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:13,687
Rachel, do you have any idea
how many times I have wished

825
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:15,055
that they hadn't gone out
that night

826
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:16,523
or that they had taken
a different route home

827
00:33:16,557 --> 00:33:18,091
or any one
of a thousand other things,

828
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:20,777
but the one thing--the
one thing that I never wished

829
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:22,612
is that my father
hadn't been drinking

830
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:26,366
the night that he got killed
by a drunk--

831
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,878
I know he wasn't perfect.

832
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:43,633
But he was.

833
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:48,505
He was perfect to me, and...

834
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,807
I don't want
to have to wonder

835
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,842
if this is all his fault.

836
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:55,061
Mike.

837
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,816
He is just trying
to get to you.

838
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,018
Well, he's got to me.

839
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:07,023
I mean, how am I any different
than him, Rachel?

840
00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:09,859
Because it's
a bullshit claim.

841
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:15,865
I don't know.

842
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:19,152
I know I'm gonna win.

843
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,823
But I don't know.

844
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:25,618
Ah, there you are.

845
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,120
Been looking all over for you.
Why?

846
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:29,346
I just wanted to apologize
once again

847
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,182
for crossing the threshold
of your electronic area.

848
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:32,716
It's okay, Louis.

849
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:34,384
No, no, I breached
your mainframe.

850
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:36,487
No excuse.

851
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:38,055
Why is your face so red?

852
00:34:38,073 --> 00:34:40,357
It's because you gave me the
greatest advice in the world.

853
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,159
What are you talking about?

854
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:44,111
Let's just say that I'm never
gonna tell Sheila what I did

855
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:45,729
in that file room
that night, ever.

856
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:50,000
Apology accepted.

857
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:51,001
Now if you'll excuse me,

858
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:54,288
I need to put some peas
on my face.

859
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,182
Your move didn't work.
I didn't go into a tailspin.

860
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,917
I wasn't trying to send you
into a tailspin.

861
00:35:06,935 --> 00:35:08,269
I was just trying to get you
to understand.

862
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:11,522
Well, I do understand.

863
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,307
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna sell my client out.

864
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,692
Then why are we here?

865
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:16,560
You want to sue someone,
you should sue these people.

866
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,262
They're the ones
that make the medicine

867
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,231
that stent was coated with.

868
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:22,900
And you know that medicine has
something to do with this case?

869
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,434
I know there's
as much evidence against them

870
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:25,703
as there is against my client.

871
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:26,871
That's why
you're pointing me there,

872
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:29,773
because they're not
your client.

873
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:33,327
You know, nothing's gonna
bring Mr. Foreman back.

874
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:34,411
Just like there's nothing

875
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:37,781
that's gonna bring
my parents back.

876
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:41,618
This is the best way I can see
to get your client compensation.

877
00:35:41,636 --> 00:35:43,888
If you think you're doing
the right thing, you're wrong.

878
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:46,307
I'm trying to help,

879
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:47,892
but I'm not gonna sell
my client out.

880
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:50,728
It's a half measure.

881
00:35:57,152 --> 00:36:00,938
All right,
then here's the other half.

882
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,189
I pointed out
your achilles' heel

883
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,442
when I found that photo,
and I found it on Facebook.

884
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:07,828
Do your client a favor,
and have them take it down

885
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:10,647
before you file that suit.

886
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:16,787
So you're gonna fly back to
London, get your life in order,

887
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:19,206
and move back in two weeks.

888
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,326
Tickets are booked.

889
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:25,329
Here's to
your new partnership.

890
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:28,265
I just have one question.

891
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,018
Why did Jessica specifically
make me agree to something

892
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:33,637
that's a standard part
of your contracts?

893
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:35,856
You checked up on me.

894
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,643
I didn't check up on you.
I'm thorough.

895
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:40,978
What's the difference?

896
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,030
God damn it, Harvey,
don't change the subject.

897
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:46,567
What did you do?

898
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:47,851
I fronted your buy-in.

899
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:50,154
I knew it.
You bought me.

900
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:52,356
I didn't buy you,
I bought us time.

901
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:55,993
That is a lawyer's response,
and it's bullshit.

902
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,328
How could you do that?

903
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:59,463
Scottie, you're acting
like I killed someone.

904
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:00,664
I didn't.

905
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:03,801
You paid so that
I could sleep with you

906
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:06,170
and be here at the same time!

907
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:08,005
Do you know what that makes me?
Lucky?

908
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,057
- That's not funny.
- I didn't mean it to be.

909
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:12,176
I paid
because I want you to stay.

910
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,428
I did it
as a romantic gesture.

911
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:15,729
Yeah, well,<i>Pretty Woman</i>
may have been a romantic movie,

912
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:16,981
but Julia Roberts
was still a hooker.

913
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:18,849
Now you come up
with a movie reference?

914
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:19,984
Harvey, can you imagine
how that makes me feel

915
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:21,435
to find that out?

916
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:23,237
Well, what do you
want me to say, huh?

917
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:25,105
I'm not perfect at this,

918
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:28,275
and you don't have to believe
that was romantic,

919
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,527
but it would be nice if you
believed that I thought it was.

920
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:32,663
Harvey, it would
have been romantic

921
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:35,232
if you had begged me to stay
when Jessica wouldn't budge,

922
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,700
but this,
this is not romantic.

923
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:37,901
This is manipulative.

924
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,420
You were about to take
a job somewhere else.

925
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:41,038
That's what
makes it manipulative!

926
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:42,840
Are you telling me you've
never been manipulative with me?

927
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,124
Not since I've been back.

928
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:45,575
I had to learn the hard way,

929
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:49,513
and I'm afraid that
you haven't learned that at all.

930
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:50,881
So you're saying
I'm an asshole?

931
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,083
Yes, that is what I'm saying,
that you are an asshole,

932
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:54,385
but what I'm really saying

933
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:57,354
is that we need to start
being honest with each other.

934
00:37:57,389 --> 00:38:00,924
- About everything?
- Everything.

935
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:09,233
You know that paper
you had to redo,

936
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:10,951
because Professor Gunn
said he never got it?

937
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:12,202
Mmhmm.

938
00:38:12,237 --> 00:38:13,270
He never got it.

939
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:14,822
Son of a bitch.

940
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:16,073
How was I supposed to know

941
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:17,074
you didn't save it
to your hard drive?

942
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,375
Because I told you that.

943
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,912
You know I don't listen
when you say things.

944
00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:26,250
You are an asshole.

945
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,001
This is good.

946
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:30,220
Honesty is good.

947
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:31,922
I told Rebecca Carlin
you were gay.

948
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,724
She slept with me anyway.

949
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:36,293
Once.

950
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:37,394
Yeah.

951
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:39,396
Why did she only
sleep with me once?

952
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:42,850
Because I also told her
that you had crabs.

953
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:46,303
That's not cool.

954
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,140
This is good.

955
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:52,642
It is.

956
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,696
I am in this, Scottie.

957
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:58,315
Okay.

958
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:01,001
So am I.

959
00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:06,673
Well, let's see what you got,
Michael James Ross.

960
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,342
Magna cum laude.

961
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:12,662
So Mr. Smarty Pants couldn't
even manage summa cum laude?

962
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,967
Yeah, well, so what
if I couldn't either?

963
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,685
What? No <i>Law Review?</i>

964
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,054
Well, either you weren't asked,
or you didn't serve.

965
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:23,390
Either way, I win.

966
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,559
"A."

967
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,611
"A."

968
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:29,696
B-plus in International Law?

969
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:33,617
Oh, come on, I aced that class
with my eyes closed.

970
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,569
"A" in contracts.
That's legit.

971
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,823
A-minus in Estate Planning?

972
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:42,993
Remind me to not die intestate
with Mike Ross around.

973
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,258
Tape measure,
as requested.

974
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,643
You look really excited.

975
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:01,345
- Long day.
- I know.

976
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:02,513
Is there any chance
we can punt this,

977
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:03,847
maybe go grab some dinner?

978
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:08,435
We could, or we could accept
that moving in together

979
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:13,390
sometimes means we have to
just shake off our crappy days

980
00:40:13,408 --> 00:40:15,859
and deal with things
like furniture negotiations.

981
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,027
Yeah, that doesn't sound

982
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:18,541
like anything
I want to accept at all.

983
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:20,063
Too bad.

984
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:22,866
This is your life now.

985
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,169
Rachel, look, I'm trying...

986
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:32,742
You said that your dad liked
to celebrate the little things,

987
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,712
and I thought maybe we
should start doing that too.

988
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:38,382
You mean like
furniture negotiations?

989
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:42,853
Mmm, I mean
our first date.

990
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,521
So does that mean I'm not
gonna be able to eat anything?

991
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:46,773
'Cause I didn't like anything
on the menu that night.

992
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:49,226
That wasn't our first date.

993
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,614
Our first date
was in the law library.

994
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:56,700
- Sushi.
- Sushi.

995
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:58,869
That was my first case.

996
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:00,871
I know.

997
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:03,624
Oh, you were so green.

998
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:05,542
Harvey came in and told us
to stop playing footsie.

999
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:06,960
Oh, I remember that.

1000
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:09,112
I wanted to do a lot more
than play footsie with you.

1001
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,214
I know.

1002
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:11,665
I caught you staring at me
five times.

1003
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,250
Oh, so I guess you didn't
catch all the other times then.

1004
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:15,469
I did, just trying to let you
off the hook.

1005
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:18,722
Rachel...

1006
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:19,790
This is perfect.

1007
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,593
Not yet.

1008
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,436
Now it is.

1009
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,687
So where's the chair?

1010
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:35,188
No.

1011
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:43,413
You wanted to see me?

1012
00:41:43,448 --> 00:41:46,316
Professor Gerard's
legal ethics class--you take it?

1013
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:47,651
Of course,
everyone had to take it.

1014
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:48,669
What'd you get?

1015
00:41:48,703 --> 00:41:51,655
Killed it.
I got an A-minus.

1016
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:52,923
Out of curiosity,

1017
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:54,675
did you ever hear of anybody
ever getting an A-plus?

1018
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,426
What? No.

1019
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:58,178
He's famous for never
giving higher than an "A."

1020
00:41:58,212 --> 00:41:59,630
He doesn't believe in it.

1021
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,666
Thank you, Simon.
That'll be all.

1022
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:07,691
