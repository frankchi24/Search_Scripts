1
00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:01,499
<i>Previously on</i>
Suits...

2
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:04,637
I want to work with you.
Come to Pearson Specter.

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:05,822
If all you want to do
is work with me,

4
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,356
I can find a job
somewhere else.

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,193
Scottie,
that's not all I want.

6
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,079
- Then say it.
- I want you in my life.

7
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,749
It's over, Mike.
I'm onto you.

8
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,150
And I'm going to expose you

9
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:20,503
for the lying piece of filth
that you are.

10
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,872
Louis, I went to Harvard.
I just changed my grade.

11
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,373
You cheated,

12
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,158
and now you're looking at me
to help you get away with it.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,877
- No, Louis--
- Get out of my sight.

14
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,161
Louis, he did it
so that he can practice

15
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:30,379
the thing that we all love.

16
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,331
And if you don't let it go,

17
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:34,333
he's never gonna be able
to practice it again.

18
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:35,601
You make Mike confess,

19
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,053
you might as well throw his life
down the toilet.

20
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,671
You say we're friends.

21
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,189
A friend wouldn't ask me
to do this.

22
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,691
No, Louis.

23
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,677
A friend just won't hold it
against you if you don't.

24
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,318
Hey.

25
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,288
Where did you race off to
so quickly this morning?

26
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,689
I went to see my mistress.

27
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,190
Mm. Mm-hmm,
and what's her name?

28
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,575
Felony.

29
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,160
Really?

30
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,296
And how would you feel
if I said the same thing to you?

31
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,580
It depends.
Is she hot?

32
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,031
Mmhmm, you realize

33
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,550
you're just digging yourself in
deeper now, don't you?

34
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,386
Well, then it's good that I
was really out getting you...

35
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,138
This.

36
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,590
Minnie Mouse.

37
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,042
I got a copy from your dad.

38
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,679
I thought
it would complement Panda.

39
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,981
It's perfect.

40
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,934
Good, because I have
a new lease on life.

41
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:29,355
And I wouldn't
if it weren't for you.

42
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:31,991
I am not the only one

43
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,393
who helped convince Louis
to let it go.

44
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:35,661
I know.

45
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,229
So are you gonna get
something for Harvey?

46
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,441
I want to,
but what do you get

47
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,565
the man
who has everything?

48
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:40,750
The same thing you got me.

49
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,402
A picture of him
dressed as a mouse?

50
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:45,288
No.

51
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,740
Something money can't buy.

52
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,292
Hmm.

53
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,095
What do you need?

54
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,714
- Advice.
- That tie has got to go.

55
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:57,633
I've been wanting
to say something for months.

56
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,852
It's not about the tie,
is it?

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,020
You know
it's not about the tie.

58
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,522
You're just giving me shit.

59
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,423
We take our opportunities
where they present themselves.

60
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:07,760
Now what can Donna do
for you?

61
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,313
- I need the perfect gift.
- Mm. Who is it?

62
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,264
Rachel?
Something personal,

63
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,933
preferably a picture
from her father.

64
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,601
How could you possibly--

65
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:16,903
- Jessica?
Simple and elegant.

66
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:19,104
Or wild and crazy,
the choice is yours.

67
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:22,107
Louis?
Oh, God, doesn't matter.

68
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,043
Just get him anything.
He'll cry for days.

69
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,411
What about Harvey?

70
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,447
There is no gift for Harvey.

71
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:29,715
He gets what he wants,

72
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,217
and he doesn't want
what he doesn't get.

73
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,252
And my knowing that is the only
gift he'll ever need from me.

74
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:35,671
Donna, ever since
I've been here,

75
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,676
every morning, I step
off that elevator wondering

76
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,258
if this is going to be
my last day.

77
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:42,311
Last week, that day came,
and Harvey said, "not today."

78
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,096
I...

79
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,565
I just--I need
to get him something

80
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,568
to let him know
what that means to me.

81
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,938
- Okay.
- What?

82
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,974
There is one thing that Harvey
has been wanting to get

83
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,526
for years,
and he hasn't been able to.

84
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,646
- What is it?
- No, it's too personal.

85
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:01,781
And I don't see
how you're going to be able

86
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,193
to make it happen
when he couldn't.

87
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,202
Whatever it is,
it'll make the perfect gift.

88
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,670
Before we do anything else,

89
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,656
I'd like to officially welcome
our newest senior partner,

90
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:12,008
Dana Scott.

91
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,852
I'd like to thank you all
for bringing me in.

92
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:17,179
And I assure you, I will be
hitting the ground running.

93
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,798
Well, that's what
we like to hear.

94
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,716
Harvey, where do we stand
on Franklin Courier?

95
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,636
They just announced plans
for the acquisition Friday.

96
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,521
I'd like to take lead
on this one.

97
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,474
I guess the ground
has been hit.

98
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,309
It's yours.

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,978
Shit.
I am so sorry.

100
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,312
I had an incident at Logan.

101
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,314
Did I miss anything?
Not really.

102
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,566
Scottie's going to be handling
the Franklin acquisition.

103
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:38,951
You're kidding, right?

104
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,820
Franklin's my client.
I was five minutes late.

105
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,321
Ten minutes, actually.

106
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:44,156
Well, I don't care
if I skipped

107
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,659
the whole goddamn meeting
to get a full-body wax.

108
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,211
I landed that company when
they were a regional shithole,

109
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,030
and I don't need
some interloper to--

110
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,999
Scottie's a senior partner,
Louis.

111
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,051
Oh, this is bullshit.

112
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,003
Then I guess you're saying
the bylaws are bullshit.

113
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:00,172
My bylaws are a work of art.

114
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,924
I know.

115
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,426
And the bylaws clearly state
that if a senior partner

116
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,894
is more than ten minutes late
to a meeting,

117
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,729
he or she has no standing.

118
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,397
Well, that rule doesn't take
into consideration

119
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,550
a partner being late due
to reasons beyond his control.

120
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,985
Wait.
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,521
"This rule shall not be abridged
by any circumstance,

122
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:17,389
"including but not limited
to family illness,

123
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,921
"criminal detention,
and travel delay.

124
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:23,562
For without punctuality,
we are animals," right?

125
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,332
How dare you quote me to me?
This isn't over.

126
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,867
Yes, it is.

127
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:29,452
They're still
your client, Louis,

128
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,570
but it's Scottie's transaction.

129
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,955
Moving on.

130
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:36,792
Boom.

131
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,377
What's this?

132
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,930
Oh, it's only the greatest
gift you've ever received.

133
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,766
Better than M.J.'s jersey
from the 63-point game?

134
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,384
If this folder had played
in that game,

135
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,635
it would have scored
80 points.

136
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,887
Okay, I don't even know
what that means.

137
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:49,772
Neither do I.
Just open it.

138
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,774
A run-of-the-mill
corporate case.

139
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,258
I don't get it.

140
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,312
Just look at the attorney
of record on the other side.

141
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,614
A. Eliot Stemple.

142
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,815
How did you know?

143
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,266
I talked to Donna.
She told me everything.

144
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:03,486
- Define "everything."
- Oh, I don't know.

145
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,871
He kicked your ass in moot court
three years running at Harvard.

146
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,623
You're kind of upset about it.
It keeps you up at night.

147
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,608
Yeah, well,
if she told you everything,

148
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:12,161
you'd know he's been ducking me
for the past ten years.

149
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,379
Harvey, I just told you

150
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,164
this gift is
better than M.J.'s jersey.

151
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,582
Do you think
I'd make that kind of claim

152
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,714
if I couldn't deliver
on it?

153
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,718
What are you saying?

154
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,052
I'm saying

155
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,305
that A. Eliot Stemple
is not ducking you today.

166
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,841
Louis, if this is
about Franklin Courier,

167
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,199
I've made my decision.

168
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,734
- It's not.
- Okay.

169
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,102
Then what's this about?

170
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,570
- It's about Franklin Courier.
- Louis.

171
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:15,988
Jessica, I want to know where
I fall in the pecking order

172
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:18,157
with regard to Dana Scott.
There is no pecking order.

173
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,159
I don't look at things that way.
Great.

174
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:22,404
That means I'm behind her
because she's banging Harvey.

175
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:24,046
I'm going to pretend
I didn't just hear that.

176
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:25,464
Well, unfortunately,

177
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:26,966
I can't pretend that
you didn't just screw me over

178
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,118
on behalf
of your partner's girlfriend.

179
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,504
Louis,
I didn't screw you over.

180
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:33,672
Your own bylaws did.

181
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:35,091
And if the shoe
were on the other foot

182
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,559
and you'd taken
the case from her,

183
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,177
you'd be sleeping
like a baby.

184
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:39,762
What does that have to do
with anything?

185
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,097
All right, you know what, don't
bother answering that question.

186
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:44,350
As far as I'm concerned,
Dana Scott is dead to me.

187
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,802
Louis...

188
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,638
Did it ever occur to you
that these situations

189
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,908
may sometimes be a result
of your own doing?

190
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,476
What on God's green earth
are you talking about?

191
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,979
You have an opportunity
to bond

192
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,447
with our newest
senior partner

193
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,332
or make a permanent enemy
of her.

194
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,284
And I'm saying, in the past,

195
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:04,120
you've generally chosen
the enemy route.

196
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:06,122
Can you give me
a specific?

197
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,323
- Off the top of my head?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:12,995
Pemberton, Yates, Cohen,
Duffner, Ramirez...

199
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:16,182
That's
five isolated incidents.

200
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,684
Robinson, Jenkins, Gardner.

201
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:20,469
Okay, okay, fine.
What's your point?

202
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,606
My point is,
if you let this thing go,

203
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,558
you can change
the entire course

204
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:28,444
of your relationship
with Scottie...

205
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,229
And who knows,

206
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:33,315
maybe even redefine yourself
within the firm.

207
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:38,654
Words to live by.

208
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,539
Jessica,
you may have just changed

209
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:43,492
my entire outlook on life.

210
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,903
Is that a bomb?
It's a gift.

211
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,189
You're giving me a gift after
what happened this morning?

212
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,356
You're right.

213
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:17,743
You did poach my client
on a technicality.

214
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,228
And worse than that,

215
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,865
you used my own precious words
against me, and normally,

216
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,783
I'd declare war, but--
But what?

217
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:27,419
It's been pointed out to me
that I have certain proclivities

218
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:28,754
that need to be adjusted.

219
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:30,256
Louis,
what are you saying?

220
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,209
I'm saying I would like us
to be friends.

221
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,884
It's very sweet.

222
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:45,254
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

223
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:48,474
- So we're friends?
- Friends.

224
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,392
Great.
Give me my files back.

225
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:51,777
Excuse me?

226
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,113
You accepted my friendship.
Give me back my case.

227
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,932
Uh, sorry, Louis.
That's not how it works.

228
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,651
What the hell
kind of friend are you?

229
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:01,270
I'm a friend who is not going
to give you my case

230
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,955
14 seconds
after you give me a scarf.

231
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,823
No, no, no,
it's not a scarf.

232
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:06,375
It's one
of the world's finest pashminas.

233
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,210
I don't care if it's
the world's only pashmina.

234
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,046
You're not getting this case.

235
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,281
Well, then you leave me
no choice

236
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:14,500
but to institute
article 19.5/b.

237
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,635
There is no article 19.5/b.

238
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,287
There is now.

239
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,140
All new hires must be
accompanied to client meetings

240
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:23,008
by the existing attorney
of record.

241
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:24,459
You son of a bitch.

242
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,295
You just want to start a fight.
Excuse me?

243
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:27,846
I tried to make friends
with you,

244
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:29,492
and you just told me
to go screw myself.

245
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,568
I am warning you, Louis.

246
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:35,771
This is a fight
you do not want.

247
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:38,941
Oh, no, I want it,
and I'm gonna win it.

248
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:42,861
And when I do, you better not
go crying to your boyfriend.

249
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,092
Well, look who it is,
the ghost of Christmas past,

250
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,761
Harvey Reginald Specter.

251
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:01,163
Speaking of the past,
A. Eliot, F.D.R. called.

252
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:03,498
He wants his bowtie back.

253
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,100
Oh, if you'd had rebuttals
like that,

254
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,853
maybe you would've gotten
past me in moot court just once.

255
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:10,105
Trust me, Archibald,
I'm way past you.

256
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:13,008
Oh, I guess you are.
Look at you, huh?

257
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,860
Tom Ford suit,
$1,000 hairdo.

258
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:16,528
What happened
to the skirt-chasing degenerate

259
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,197
I knew back at Harvard?
Oh, him?

260
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:21,350
He's a name partner at a firm
ten times bigger than yours.

261
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,786
Bigger? Sounds like
somebody's trying to compensate

262
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:26,538
for three huge losses.

263
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:28,023
Or somebody's living
in the past and too afraid

264
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,195
to take me on
in the present.

265
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,525
You're the one
who's afraid.

266
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:32,527
I think you've got
a little PTSD--

267
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:33,962
post-traumatic
Stemple disorder.

268
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,864
Why don't we go head-to-head
right now?

269
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,199
Oh, I'd love to.

270
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,751
But unfortunately,
my case is up on the docket.

271
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,475
But let's do this again
really soon, okay?

272
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,553
Call me.

273
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:49,345
AYZ Technologies
versus Janus Microprocessors.

274
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:51,063
Mike Ross for the plaintiff,
your honor.

275
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,932
A. Eliot Stemple
for the defense.

276
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:55,717
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm sorry.

277
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:58,103
Did I forget to put the name
of my firm on the complaint?

278
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,105
I work at Pearson Specter.

279
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,243
That's Specter,
as in Harvey Reginald Specter.

280
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,328
I'm ready
to hear pretrial motions.

281
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,664
Motion to substitute counsel,
your honor.

282
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:09,731
On what grounds?

283
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,950
On the grounds
that he's a pussy.

284
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:14,903
- What's that, Mr. Specter?
- I was just wondering

285
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:17,589
if he has a copy of his motion,
because we never got one.

286
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:20,459
Not with me, your honor.
Something suddenly came up.

287
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:23,045
My niece, she took ill.

288
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:26,348
Well, when your family's sick,
you have to tend to them.

289
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,767
Your honor, Mr. Stemple may
not have a copy of his motion,

290
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:31,437
but we do have a copy
of his family tree.

291
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:34,022
He has no nieces.

292
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,108
I meant "niece"
figuratively.

293
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:37,943
She is actually
my goddaughter.

294
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,611
And what exactly
is her name?

295
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,530
Sandra Silverstein.

296
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:43,765
Your honor, that's
the same fictitious goddaughter

297
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,067
that's taken ill

298
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,236
every time Mr. Stemple's
needed a continuance

299
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,737
in the last five years.

300
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,072
Sounds serious.

301
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,874
Have you tried acupuncture?

302
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:54,076
They are completely
out of line, Your Honor.

303
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:57,212
The only thing out of line
is you.

304
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,965
Mr. Stemple, not only will you
not be replacing yourself,

305
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,551
you'll be paying the court
a $2,000 fine.

306
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,256
We got him.
The cage match is on.

307
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:09,641
Two men enter,
one man leaves.

308
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:11,009
We don't have anything yet.

309
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,428
What?

310
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,313
Come on, you need me to try
this thing for you too?

311
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:16,849
Listen to me.
This isn't thunderdome.

312
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,435
I need you to look at every case
he's worked since law school.

313
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:20,903
Relax, Harvey.
I'm all over it.

314
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,155
You better be,
because you don't know this guy.

315
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,107
I'm telling you,
once it sinks in

316
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,742
that there's no way
out of that cage,

317
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:30,145
he's gonna
come out swinging.

318
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,276
You wasted a trip.
Harvey's gone for the night.

319
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:41,381
I'm not here to see Harvey.
I'm here to see you.

320
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:43,250
Please, what I have to say
is important.

321
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,784
I'm not interested
in what you have to say.

322
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:48,305
In law school,
I had nothing.

323
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,473
Nothing.

324
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,892
No friends, no girlfriend,
no respect.

325
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,179
The truth is, I was hanging on
to not flunking out by a tread.

326
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,016
Look at me.
I'm not married.

327
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,936
I don't have children.
I'm not particularly successful.

328
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:06,139
Why are you
telling me this?

329
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,742
I have a little piece of glory
that I've been holding on to,

330
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,644
and I don't expect Harvey
to care about that.

331
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:13,080
But you're still first chair.

332
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:16,366
You can still let me out.

333
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:20,120
And I thought
that maybe you would.

334
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:22,822
I'll think about it.

335
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:24,458
That's all I can ask for.

336
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,961
Except for one thing.

337
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:30,680
That's the exact same speech
that your plaintiff gave Harvey,

338
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:31,798
year one.

339
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,134
Doesn't mean it isn't true.

340
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:35,585
You think
I'm gonna let you play me?

341
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,270
A man can try.

342
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,022
Stemple, you've been ducking
Harvey long enough.

343
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:41,641
Now you're either gonna win,
or you're gonna lose.

344
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:44,811
What you're not gonna do
is avoid him anymore.

345
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:47,481
Oh, and you forgot.

346
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:48,782
I looked up your family tree.

347
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,650
You are married,
you do have children,

348
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,486
and your firm is top tier.

349
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,871
Please, I hate my wife,
my children are anchors,

350
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:56,656
and the only reason
I stay at that firm

351
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:58,625
is to pay for them
to leave me alone.

352
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:03,830
Get the hell on the elevator,
Stemple.

353
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,715
I'm not leaving you
in our office.

354
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,367
Good call.

355
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:18,812
Eliot Stemple,
that's a blast from the past.

356
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,347
You should have seen
his smug face

357
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:21,881
when he realized
he couldn't duck me.

358
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,049
Need my help?

359
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,235
No, I am taking this one
all for myself.

360
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:27,771
Harvey,
it was three times.

361
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,095
You remember
what it did to you?

362
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:30,524
Yeah, I remember.

363
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:32,242
But instead of offering help
where it isn't needed,

364
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:33,910
you should be focused
on Louis Litt.

365
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,862
After what you did
at that meeting,

366
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:37,581
he's going to come at you
full-bore.

367
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,917
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

368
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:44,037
You picked a fight
with him on purpose.

369
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:45,738
- Of course I did.
- What happened to the whole

370
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,841
"we need to be open
and honest" thing?

371
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:49,576
I didn't think we needed
to be open and honest

372
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:50,927
that one plus one
equals two.

373
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:52,546
I get it.

374
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,047
You don't want to be seen
as my girlfriend,

375
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:55,298
so you picked a fight
with the biggest,

376
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:56,716
baddest prisoner
in the yard.

377
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,102
I win this, I'm the partner
that beat Louis Litt,

378
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:01,271
not the partner sleeping
with Harvey Specter.

379
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,223
Okay, I respect that.

380
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:05,192
But Louis just did me
a huge favor,

381
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:06,593
and I don't want to get caught
in the middle of it.

382
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,062
I don't need you
in the middle of it.

383
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:10,063
Good.

384
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:12,032
Although...

385
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:13,433
What did you do?

386
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:14,651
Well, it's not really
what I did.

387
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:18,872
- It's, um...
- What you did.

388
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,790
What did I do?

389
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,159
Louis,
what are you doing here?

390
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:24,277
Hey, I got your email
last night.

391
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:26,329
- Yeah, about that--
- No, no, no.

392
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:28,281
I was happy to get it,
happy to do the work.

393
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:29,616
Nothing makes me happier

394
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,800
than to spend all night
helping out a friend.

395
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,285
You were up all night?

396
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,170
Caught a power nap
between 4:30 and 4:45.

397
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:35,922
I'll be fine.

398
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,390
Well,
what'd you come up with?

399
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,725
Per your instructions,

400
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:39,976
I went through eight years

401
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:41,728
of Pritchard Holdings
corporate returns

402
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:43,597
with a fine-tooth comb.

403
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:45,482
That's a remarkably long
time frame.

404
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,400
Yeah, you ask for four,
I give you eight.

405
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,652
It's what I do.

406
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:50,937
And I caught every mistake
there was to find.

407
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:52,322
Great.
File the amended returns.

408
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:53,607
With any luck,

409
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:57,694
Jenner Pharmaceuticals
will be none the wiser.

410
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:59,246
Jenner Pharmaceuticals?

411
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:00,747
This suit's
against Miller Trucking.

412
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:04,167
That's what I meant,
Miller Trucking.

413
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:06,286
Ah.

414
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:07,987
What are they
suing them for?

415
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,155
Trucking?

416
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,324
God damn it.

417
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,825
You sent that email
just to screw with me.

418
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:14,961
Louis,
I didn't send the email.

419
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,179
Scottie did.

420
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,714
She used my computer.
I didn't even know.

421
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:19,516
Oh, bullshit.
She came running to you.

422
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,767
You played on our friendship.

423
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,102
And just now
you had me go on about it

424
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,169
to continue the mockery.

425
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,437
Look, I wasn't mocking you.

426
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,506
I was trying to keep you
from finding out.

427
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,608
I thought if you didn't know,
no harm would be done.

428
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:30,977
No, you know what,
harm was done.

429
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,029
And if you value
this friendship at all,

430
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:34,481
you would stay out of it,

431
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:36,149
because I'm going
to the mattresses

432
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,284
against Dana Scott.

433
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:38,652
Mattresses?

434
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:40,487
Have you been watching
<i>The Godfather?</i>

435
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,021
Yeah, I've been trying to
come up with some common ground

436
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:44,157
to expand our friendship--
sue me.

437
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:49,362
Tell me you finished
the proposal

438
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:50,714
for Franklin Courier.

439
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:51,798
No.

440
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,199
What do you mean, no?

441
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,034
I mean I didn't do it.

442
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:56,419
What, did your mother die?

443
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:57,784
Because if she didn't,
you know--

444
00:16:57,805 --> 00:16:59,422
Louis,
you told me not to.

445
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:00,974
We're at war, Bennett.
Why would I do that?

446
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,561
I don't know,
but I got a note from you

447
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:03,893
telling me that you were gonna
be the bigger person

448
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:05,145
and let Dana Scott handle it.

449
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,379
The bigger person?

450
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,547
You should've known
that was not from me.

451
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:10,150
Good morning, Louis.
Great day.

452
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:11,884
Oh, you look a little tired.

453
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:13,236
I'm not tired.
I don't get tired.

454
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:15,405
What do you want, Dana?
I'm just dropping this by.

455
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:16,990
You sent Franklin
a proposal?

456
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:18,274
Well, I couldn't meet them
without you,

457
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,560
so I figured that I would
send this over instead.

458
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,395
You did this
behind our backs.

459
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:25,165
I don't believe in doing
things behind people's backs.

460
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:27,083
That's why I c.c.'d you both
on this letter.

461
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,169
No, you c.c.'d us, so they'd
know that it came from you,

462
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,516
and we had nothing to do
with it.

463
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:31,671
It did come from me,

464
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,173
and you did have nothing
to do with it.

465
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,674
Yeah, you want to play it
this way, fine.

466
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:36,292
But if you think
you can outsmart me,

467
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:37,877
you're gonna get Litt up.
Litt the hell up.

468
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:39,879
Litt up?

469
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,098
Litt. Oh.

470
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,768
Oh, my God, that is so cute.

471
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:46,419
I'm gonna go make fun of it
on my Facebook page right now.

472
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,920
Thank you.

473
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:54,477
Okay, we're gonna take
this thing apart limb by limb

474
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:55,812
so that little Miss Bullshit

475
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,697
wished she'd never heard
the name Louis Litt.

476
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:59,532
Louis,
she's an excellent attorney.

477
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,950
What if we can't find
anything wrong with it?

478
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,435
We're not gonna find
anything wrong with it.

479
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:03,820
That's why we're gonna
take it apart,

480
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:04,954
to make something wrong
with it.

481
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,407
Mr. Walker,
in October of last year,

482
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,125
you made a pitch to the chairman
of Kyoto Computers.

483
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,443
How did that pitch go?

484
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:11,444
It went amazingly,

485
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,163
right up
until when they told us

486
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,964
there was no way they could
actually buy our product.

487
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,416
And why was that?

488
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,618
Because Janus threatened
to withhold their microchip

489
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,471
if Kyoto did even $1 worth
of business with us.

490
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:23,923
And my next-door neighbor says
he saw his next-door neighbor

491
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:25,291
cheating on his wife.

492
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:27,060
Turned out to be nothing
but a vindictive lie.

493
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,929
These are sworn affidavits
from the CEOs of Kyoto, Griffon,

494
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,633
and Howland all backing up
Mr. Walker's claim.

495
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:37,854
This isn't your next-door
neighbor, Archibald.

496
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:40,306
Mr. Walker, the truth is
that we control the market

497
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:42,776
because our product is
better than yours, isn't it?

498
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:44,477
No, it isn't.

499
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:46,329
Jake, come on.
The cameras are on.

500
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:48,581
We're all under oath here.
We are?

501
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,999
He is.

502
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,452
And I have
independent analysis

503
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:54,487
and sworn testimony
from other CEOs

504
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:56,489
disputing everything
your client just said.

505
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,008
Those things aren't worth
the paper they're printed on.

506
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:00,827
My point is
that you can go to court,

507
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:03,496
spend years fighting
a battle you may not win,

508
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:06,850
or you can take
this settlement.

509
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:13,306
This is actually
pretty fair.

510
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,024
More than fair.

511
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:17,009
The only thing is, he's trying
to get us to sign it,

512
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,611
so he can use it against us
in court.

513
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Just like he did last year
against Micron

514
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:22,449
and the year before that
against Suntech.

515
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:24,651
You're just a one-trick pony,
Archibald.

516
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,353
And once you've been
to the show, it's not that good.

517
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:30,457
Hmm, you're a one-trick pony
too, Reginald.

518
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:33,192
Only my trick doesn't end
with my own client suing me.

519
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:36,129
- This deposition's over.
- What do you mean, it's over?

520
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:37,476
Don't you want
Mr. Walker to know

521
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,165
that you were just sued
for malpractice?

522
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:40,500
That client
dropped that suit.

523
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,469
And before she did,
she stated on the record

524
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,921
that she got shafted because
you had a personal vendetta

525
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:46,539
against your opposing counsel.

526
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,725
He likes to pick fights
with other lawyers,

527
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,426
and he doesn't give a shit
what it does to his clients.

528
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,879
- Okay, that's a lie.
- It is?

529
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,214
I think you and I both know
why he took this case,

530
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,484
because he lost this case
and this case

531
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:59,435
and this case to me
15 years ago.

532
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,987
Go ahead, ask him.

533
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,822
He's not under oath,
but you'll know if he's lying.

534
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,324
And these cases,
they were all in moot court.

535
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:06,943
Imagine what he'll bring down
on you when the stakes are real.

536
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,411
I can tell you this much,

537
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:09,829
it'll be a hell
of a lot more expensive

538
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:10,997
than that settlement.

539
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:13,917
Stemple, we're done.

540
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:17,670
Reginald,
you did a great job

541
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:19,289
making it so I couldn't
get out of it,

542
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:22,675
but you should have picked
a better case to trap me in.

543
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:27,213
Because we both know
that my independent analyst

544
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:31,768
will come up with anything
that I want him to say.

545
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:35,722
Did you hear
what he just said?

546
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:36,890
I sure did.

547
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:38,441
And if you did, and I did...

548
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:41,027
Maybe it did.

549
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:54,464
♪
I already had breakfast, Michael.

550
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:57,850
Maybe, but that's a bag
completely filled with bacon.

551
00:20:57,935 --> 00:20:58,851
Crispy?

552
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:00,186
To quote my friend Benjamin,

553
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,805
"if it's not crispy,
it's not bacon."

554
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,891
I don't deserve it.

555
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:06,058
Benjamin.

556
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:07,843
Michael, I can enhance
the sound of a bee

557
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:09,862
making pollen recorded
from a satellite.

558
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:11,147
How can you possibly
know that?

559
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:12,315
It's been done.

560
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:13,649
But what I can't do
is enhance sounds

561
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,284
that weren't picked up
by a used camcorder,

562
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:17,403
because this firm is too cheap
to go with my recommendation

563
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:19,855
of the $63,000 ZR-X90.

564
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,547
You didn't really
recommend that, did you?

565
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,126
It's also good for making
independent films on weekends.

566
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:24,410
Okay, Benjamin,

567
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:26,963
I need this audio,
or we're screwed on a huge case.

568
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,298
Michael,
look at these sound waves.

569
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:31,918
Okay.

570
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,636
There's nothing there.
No, nothing.

571
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:35,471
And that's after 12 hours of
maximum enhancement on the tape

572
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:36,872
and six Red Bulls in me.

573
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,842
Whoa, you shouldn't be having
that many Red Bulls.

574
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,144
I did it for you, Michael.

575
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:42,545
What do we have?

576
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:44,180
Uh, nothing.

577
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:47,183
Then we go
with what we got.

578
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,153
What's he talking about?

579
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,905
He's saying Stemple bluffed,
so now we're gonna bluff.

580
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,408
What exactly are we
talking about here, gentlemen?

581
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:59,395
We want access to the raw data
from his independent analysis.

582
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:01,531
And I wish I would've had
a vasectomy ten years ago.

583
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:04,233
But raw data is work product,
and he has no right to it.

584
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:05,451
The work product doctrine

585
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:06,919
is fairly clear on this,
Mr. Specter.

586
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:09,422
Except in cases of misconduct,
Your Honor,

587
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,340
is fairly clear on this,
which is the situation here.

588
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:14,010
What exactly
are you accusing me of?

589
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:16,629
At the end of our deposition,
Mr. Stemple basically boasted

590
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:19,348
that he plans to fix
the findings of his analyst.

591
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,516
That is a lie.

592
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:21,517
I never said anything
of the kind.

593
00:22:21,585 --> 00:22:22,802
What you mean to say is

594
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:24,604
you didn't think our microphone
would pick it up.

595
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,189
So let me get this straight.

596
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:28,274
They're doctoring a tape to
accuse me of doctoring a report.

597
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:30,610
Mr. Stemple, you have
a history of lying to me.

598
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:31,978
So if you're on that tape

599
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:33,903
saying anything close
to what they're claiming,

600
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,817
I'll not only sanction you,
I'll report you to the bar.

601
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:40,286
I'll give them what they want.

602
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,872
I have to admit,
when I read 600 million Euros,

603
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:45,458
I thought it was a typo.
It wasn't.

604
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,276
Baltic Freight can get
a bottle of Riesling

605
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:49,412
from an Alsatian Vineyard
to a Dubai hotel in six hours.

606
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:51,914
This is a steal.
I agree. The proposal-

607
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,966
most riveting thing I've read
since <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

608
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:55,218
But--

609
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:56,586
But the real upside for you
is that I...

610
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:57,970
- We.
- Not exactly.

611
00:22:58,055 --> 00:22:59,622
Structured the deal
to avoid U.S. taxes.

612
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,258
By setting up a subsidiary
with headquarters in Cyprus.

613
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,676
Where the rate
is only 5.7%.

614
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,094
Wait a second,

615
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:07,463
doesn't that mean they would
have to build in Cyprus?

616
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:09,765
Mmhmm, and I've already
locked up a developer.

617
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:11,484
Yeah, I see that,
the Whitner Group.

618
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,236
Whoa, I'm so sorry.
Did you just say Whitner Group?

619
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:14,237
Right now
they're being investigated

620
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:15,488
by the FTC for fraud.

621
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:16,906
What?

622
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:19,575
Yeah, it was just announced
this morning.

623
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:20,610
Well,
those are bogus charges

624
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,445
concocted
by a jealous competitor

625
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:24,830
who will stop at nothing--
I'm so sorry, Tom.

626
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:27,650
As Dana mentioned,
I was c.c.'d on this,

627
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,318
but I didn't exactly
have a chance to vet it.

628
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:30,836
Tom.

629
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:31,921
Our reputation is everything,
Ms. Scott.

630
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:33,422
We can't be in bed
with criminals.

631
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,324
I will have another proposal
over to you within the hour.

632
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,509
Thank you, Louis.

633
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:38,928
Oh, and, Tom,
Scottie's new, okay?

634
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,296
So just cut her some slack.

635
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:41,631
Because when
those training wheels pop off,

636
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:44,350
she's gonna be
really, really good.

637
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,056
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing.

638
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,674
I just called a friend
at the FTC.

639
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,008
You made up charges
against a company

640
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,176
just to get back at me?

641
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:55,611
I did nothing of the kind.

642
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,759
I simply alerted a friend
to some possible misdoings.

643
00:23:57,814 --> 00:24:00,199
These are people.
You are hurting their business.

644
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:01,534
Oh, please,
give me a break.

645
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:02,952
They're not publicly traded.

646
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,019
They don't have a stock price
that'll fall.

647
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:05,020
And if they're as clean
as you say,

648
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:06,355
I'm sure they'll be exonerated.

649
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:09,158
But not in time for me
to get Franklin's business.

650
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,693
Oh, I don't give a shit
when they're exonerated.

651
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:13,195
You're never getting
Franklin's business.

652
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,464
You really are a dick.

653
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:26,809
I'm Moby goddamn dick,
and you just swam in my waters.

654
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:36,068
Per your request,
this is everything.

655
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:39,071
You didn't just come over here
to deliver work product.

656
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:40,573
I've got
a revised settlement offer.

657
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,775
And before you say anything,
it contains a provision

658
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,327
prohibiting me
from using it against you.

659
00:24:44,394 --> 00:24:47,062
After what happened today,
you think I'm going to settle?

660
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:48,634
Please, Harvey,
just take a look at it.

661
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:49,699
So now that
you need something,

662
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,567
it's Harvey, not Reginald.

663
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:52,835
Settling is what you do.

664
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:55,738
Not with you.

665
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,340
And the reason I'm not gonna
settle with you--

666
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:58,507
I get it.

667
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,176
I ducked you.

668
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:03,262
Look, I could take the losing,
the gloating, and the taunting.

669
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:05,631
But what I can't take
is losing to a coward

670
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:09,885
who's too afraid to stand up
and try to beat me again.

671
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:11,520
I didn't beat you
the first time.

672
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:15,224
What the hell
are you talking about?

673
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:16,859
It was rigged.

674
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:20,229
I bribed the jury.

675
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,565
- What?
- That's why I keep ducking you.

676
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:25,117
You're telling me
you cheated all three years?

677
00:25:25,202 --> 00:25:27,953
Once I won,

678
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,273
I was the guy
who beat Harvey Specter.

679
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:33,442
There was no going back.

680
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:36,612
And you think admitting that
now is gonna make me settle?

681
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:39,215
I'm coming clean because
it's time to put it to bed.

682
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:40,949
Put it to bed?

683
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:43,952
You gonna take an ad out in
the Crimson saying you cheated,

684
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:45,805
just like you did
when you beat me back then?

685
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:47,973
- Harvey.
- No, no, I remember it.

686
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:50,843
Muhammad Ali standing
over Sonny Liston.

687
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:53,012
Your face on Ali,
mine on Liston,

688
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,346
every day for a week.

689
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:56,465
You know who my hero was,
Eliot?

690
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:57,633
Ali.

691
00:25:57,684 --> 00:26:00,469
That's right,
you piece of shit.

692
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:05,191
You want to know
why I did that?

693
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:07,443
Because you were
an arrogant bastard

694
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:09,645
who skated through life
without a care in the world,

695
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:12,581
getting everything you wanted
from anyone you needed!

696
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,951
And you know what,

697
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:18,370
if I had to do it again,

698
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:21,323
I would do
the exact same thing.

699
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:23,175
I'm not settling.

700
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,329
You so much as think about
breaking the law on this case,

701
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,999
I guarantee
you'll end up in jail.

702
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,068
Is this--
Yes.

703
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,943
- With extra--
- Yes.

704
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:49,529
- To what do I owe this honor?
- Dana Scott.

705
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:51,164
- No.
- Hear me out.

706
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:52,699
You won.

707
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:54,084
I'm not saying you have
to give in to her.

708
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:56,503
I'm saying,
make amends with her.

709
00:26:56,587 --> 00:26:59,005
Mm, and why would I want
to do that?

710
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,006
Well, it would help
if you tried

711
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:01,491
putting yourself
in her shoes.

712
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,126
The same shoes that tried
walking away with my client?

713
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:04,795
Louis, all I'm saying is,

714
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:06,513
she came here
from Darby International

715
00:27:06,597 --> 00:27:07,997
to be Harvey's girlfriend.

716
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:09,433
I'd say that's enough baggage

717
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,034
to deserve you
cutting her some slack.

718
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:12,502
But I did cut her
some slack, Donna.

719
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:13,937
I bought her
the world's finest pashmina,

720
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,188
and she wiped her ass
with it in return.

721
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,606
Okay, I got it.

722
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:18,391
You're never gonna like her.
Forget I said anything.

723
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:20,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

724
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:23,012
Did Harvey send you here?
No, Louis, he didn't.

725
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:24,347
Harvey doesn't care
about this.

726
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:26,199
Why do you?

727
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:30,704
Because I know Harvey,
I know Scottie, and I know you.

728
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:32,989
And if somebody
doesn't back down,

729
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,624
this isn't gonna end well.

730
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:36,793
Are you saying
that you or Harvey

731
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:38,128
are gonna hold this
against me?

732
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:40,080
No, Louis,
I'm not saying that.

733
00:27:40,164 --> 00:27:42,031
Good, because then
I'll tell you what I told him.

734
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,917
If our friendship
is dependent on this,

735
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:45,969
then we do not have
a friendship at all.

736
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:47,971
It's not.

737
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,208
I was just trying to help.

738
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:57,380
Mr. Morris,

739
00:27:57,431 --> 00:28:00,150
please tell the court
what the raw data indicates

740
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:02,402
about the two companies'
microprocessors.

741
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,387
And I remind you,
you're under oath.

742
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:08,191
Both products operate
at the exact same rate.

743
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:10,026
What you're saying is,

744
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:12,662
our product is just
as good as theirs.

745
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,898
I'm saying their performance
is identical.

746
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:16,399
And yet Janus dominates
the marketplace.

747
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,534
Why is that?

748
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:19,569
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

749
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,954
Oh, I'll tell you why.

750
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:22,739
It has nothing to do
with product superiority

751
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,908
and everything to do with Janus
bullying its competitors.

752
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,409
That's not a question,

753
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,745
nor is it Mr. Morris' area
of expertise.

754
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:30,180
No, it isn't.

755
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:32,632
Bullying is his client's area
of expertise.

756
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:34,351
No further questions.

757
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:37,938
Mr. Morris,
you just testified

758
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:41,591
that the microprocessors'
performance was identical.

759
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:44,110
Is it possible that they are
actually identical?

760
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:46,646
- Anything's possible.
- How would that be?

761
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:48,698
Either it's
a one-in-a-billion event,

762
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:51,034
or one of them stole
the other one's design.

763
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:52,569
Mm.

764
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,871
Your honor, based on evidence
introduced by opposing counsel

765
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,289
and Mr. Morris' testimony,

766
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:57,991
I would like to file
a countersuit

767
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:00,577
against AYZ
for patent infringement.

768
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:01,795
That is outrageous.

769
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:04,664
His client stole
my client's design.

770
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:06,132
I am the one
who is outraged.

771
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:08,635
This case has nothing to do
with patent infringement.

772
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:11,137
It does now, Reginald.

773
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,059
Move!
We need to talk.

774
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:17,794
Not now, I'm carbo-loading.

775
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:18,895
For what?

776
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:21,481
For you!
We're still at war.

777
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:22,649
No, we're not.

778
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:24,067
So what,

779
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:25,468
you're telling me
you're waving the white flag?

780
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,607
No, I am waving this,
bylaw 19.5/b,

781
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:32,976
in clear violation of 139/j.

782
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:34,811
I got ratification per 139j.

783
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:38,198
There wasn't
a quorum present.

784
00:29:38,282 --> 00:29:39,532
Big deal,
technical violation.

785
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,668
Not for you.
You're on the bylaw committee.

786
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:44,504
And you know what the bylaws say
about a member of the committee

787
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:48,258
implementing an amendment
without approval?

788
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:49,342
Immediate removal.

789
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:50,677
So back the hell
off my case.

790
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:52,095
This won't stand.

791
00:29:52,162 --> 00:29:56,016
Louis, I am warning you
to not keep pursuing this.

792
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,101
I've beaten you before,
and I will beat you again.

793
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:00,437
- You've never beaten me before.
- Haven't I?

794
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:03,523
Who do you think it was
that assigned Nigel

795
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:06,526
to go against you
in the dissolution talks?

796
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:07,944
Meow.

797
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:10,179
- You're the devil.
- No.

798
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:13,850
I'm not the devil.
I'm a strategic thinker.

799
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:15,986
Louis Litt,
you are hereby notified

800
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:17,557
that your services
are no longer needed

801
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:18,872
on Franklin Courier.

802
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:22,042
And if you go around me,
I will invoke 139j on your ass.

803
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:25,712
- He set us up.
- You think I don't know that?

804
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:27,163
He made our client
look like a thief.

805
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,415
It's not true.

806
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:29,699
It doesn't matter
if it's not true.

807
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,701
Now we're on the defensive.

808
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:34,337
Gentlemen,
that settlement offer

809
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:36,006
is about to get flipped
on its ass.

810
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:38,258
And thank you for introducing
that evidence,

811
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,176
'cause it wouldn't have been
as credible coming from me.

812
00:30:40,227 --> 00:30:41,678
You dropped that comment
on purpose.

813
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:43,546
Mmhmm. I knew that camcorder
wouldn't pick it up,

814
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:45,649
just like I knew you would bluff
to get that data.

815
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:48,384
You made us work for it,
or we would've seen it coming.

816
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,220
He would never have seen
anything coming

817
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:54,891
once I fed him that bullshit
about bribing the jury.

818
00:30:54,942 --> 00:30:56,893
I've got your number,
Reginald.

819
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:59,829
I haven't been ducking you.
I've just been setting you up.

820
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:02,782
I took a page
from your hero's playbook,

821
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:06,002
rope-a-dope.

822
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:12,241
I heard about today.

823
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:13,760
If you hadn't,

824
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:16,125
I'm sure there'll be an ad
about it in the paper tomorrow.

825
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,298
What?

826
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:22,268
Stemple says he's got
my number, and it's true.

827
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:24,420
I don't know what to do.

828
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:25,972
What are our options?

829
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:28,377
For all I know, this deal's
the best I'm ever going to get.

830
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:31,144
Stemple's been outthinking me
ever since I met him.

831
00:31:31,228 --> 00:31:34,280
You're the only other person
who's ever done that.

832
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:35,782
I need your help.

833
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:39,285
Have I ever told you about
my high school tennis career?

834
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,737
I didn't even know
you played.

835
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:43,823
I was 38 and 3.

836
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,376
You know who handed me
every one of those losses?

837
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:47,377
Eliot Stemple?

838
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:49,295
Marsha Myers.

839
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:55,451
A 5-foot-nothing math geek
with a 20-mile-an-hour serve.

840
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,954
I should have left
a Marsha Myers skid mark

841
00:31:58,005 --> 00:31:59,973
on the court
and never looked back.

842
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:03,760
But instead, the little bitch
was a human backboard.

843
00:32:03,811 --> 00:32:05,311
And I think about it
to this day.

844
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:06,479
You're saying
I should take the deal

845
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:07,647
because I can't beat him?

846
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:09,399
I'm saying
I know what it's like

847
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,434
to have an Eliot Stemple.

848
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:13,236
So I'm going to ask you
a question,

849
00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:15,638
and I want you to give me
an instant response.

850
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:17,974
Do you want to beat him,
or do you want to settle?

851
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,859
I want to leave
an Eliot Stemple skid mark.

852
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:21,310
Then there's your answer.

853
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:22,979
If he's got your number,

854
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:27,000
then what you want to do
is what he wants you to do.

855
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:30,170
Harvey, I've been looking
at Stemple's cases.

856
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:32,088
Doesn't matter.

857
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:33,517
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

858
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,991
We're taking the settlement.

859
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:37,927
- You're just gonna give up?
- Jessica has a plan.

860
00:32:37,995 --> 00:32:39,379
Fighting is stepping
into a trap.

861
00:32:39,463 --> 00:32:40,797
We'd be giving him
exactly what he wants.

862
00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:42,766
Jessica was wrong.

863
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,350
Is that a fact?

864
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:45,885
You looked at it
the right way.

865
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,520
You just came
to the wrong conclusion.

866
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:50,190
Stemple wants us to fight,
but I know why.

867
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:51,474
He was on this case

868
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:52,559
long before you and I
came into the picture.

869
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:55,361
What he wants--
what he really wants--

870
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,981
has nothing to do
with you.

871
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,040
Don't you look ready
to rumble?

872
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:12,374
We're not.

873
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,427
We want to take your deal,
with one small change.

874
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:17,346
- I'm not lowering the amount.
- No, don't worry.

875
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:18,598
Instead of $10 million,

876
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:20,433
we'd like to give you
100 million.

877
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:21,651
Because that would
still cost us less

878
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:24,270
than if we fought you
and you got this.

879
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,741
- I have no idea what that is.
- Yes, you do.

880
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:30,409
It's the glue
that enables AYZ

881
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:31,911
to stack more microchips
than you,

882
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:32,912
and you've been after it
for a year.

883
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,897
And when you saw me coming,

884
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:37,450
you used the opportunity
to bait me

885
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:39,085
into introducing evidence

886
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:41,904
so that you could turn it around
and manufacture a suit

887
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:44,624
to get your hands on that
during discovery.

888
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:49,845
You can't prove that.

889
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:52,581
I can when I ask
your analyst

890
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,850
why you hired him
in the first place.

891
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:56,302
He's gonna say
that Janus needed the technology

892
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:57,753
and was willing to do anything
to get it.

893
00:33:57,804 --> 00:34:00,255
You don't know
that he'll roll over on me.

894
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,774
Ali versus Liston.

895
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:03,392
I'm gonna make him
roll over on you.

896
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,094
So here's
what's gonna happen.

897
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:06,929
You're gonna drop the suit,

898
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,932
publicly admit to wrongdoing,
and pay us this.

899
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,655
This'll cost my client
a fortune.

900
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,772
Yeah, but it's better
than being convicted

901
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:18,107
of corporate espionage.

902
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:20,793
Eliot, I'm giving you
a dignified way out,

903
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:24,297
a chance to really
put it to bed.

904
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:27,967
Now the judge is gonna bang
that gavel in 30 seconds.

905
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:30,970
And when that happens,
it's gonna be too late.

906
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:43,265
We'll take the deal.

907
00:34:45,986 --> 00:34:47,069
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna quote a movie,

908
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,604
quote a movie.

909
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:49,905
I got one word wrong.

910
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:51,807
It changed the entire meaning
of the quote.

911
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:53,308
Not to me, it didn't.

912
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,443
That's what I thought
the quote was.

913
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:55,778
Okay, fine.

914
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,863
You want to be disrespectful
to Martin Scorsese,

915
00:34:57,948 --> 00:34:59,314
you go right ahead.

916
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:01,367
Martin Scorsese didn't even
write the damn movie.

917
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,252
If anything, it's disrespectful
to the writer.

918
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:05,320
Harvey, who cares
about the writer?

919
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,839
I guess
you're right about that.

920
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:08,958
- Where have you two been?
- I took him to dinner.

921
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:10,659
Oh, that's never
happened before.

922
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:12,828
Well, he's never beaten
A. Eliot Stemple before.

923
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:14,680
No, he hasn't.

924
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:17,466
What could be different
about this time?

925
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:18,801
I didn't work for him then.

926
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:20,136
Yeah, but didn't
he duck Harvey

927
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,470
the whole time
you did work for him?

928
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:22,938
Okay, fine.

929
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:24,857
You were responsible
for beating Stemple,

930
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:27,193
but I was the one who told you
about Harvey's shameful losses

931
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:28,811
in the first place.
What does he always say?

932
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:32,014
0 and everything, Donna.
0 and everything.

933
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:34,984
- Are you finished?
- Yes, thank you.

934
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:36,619
Oh, and Jessica wanted
to see you

935
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,371
as soon as you got back.
She say what it's about?

936
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:41,123
No, but I was talking
to Mike.

937
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,861
Hmm.

938
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:49,031
I heard you won.

939
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:51,300
- Oh, we didn't just win.
- I know.

940
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:54,870
You got a Fortune 500 company
to publicly admit wrongdoing.

941
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:56,205
Doesn't happen every day.

942
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:57,807
So why don't you
look happy?

943
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:01,644
I am happy about the win.

944
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:05,514
But I got a call from the editor
of <i>New York Lawyer,</i>

945
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:06,932
and they want to interview
the man responsible

946
00:36:07,017 --> 00:36:08,517
for making that happen.

947
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:11,053
And you want to give Harvey
the credit.

948
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:12,188
I want you
to take your name off.

949
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,489
I already did.

950
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:15,491
This case was never for me.
It was for Harvey.

951
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:17,276
I took my name off
as first chair

952
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,744
the second
we trapped Stemple.

953
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:20,696
I appreciate that.

954
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:25,418
But because of this interview,
you can't be any chair.

955
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:31,507
So you don't want me
off this case

956
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:33,008
so that Harvey
can get the credit.

957
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:34,293
You want me off this case,

958
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:35,928
so I don't get
anywhere near the spotlight.

959
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:37,379
In your position,

960
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:40,049
the spotlight can become
an interrogation lamp

961
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,801
pretty damn fast.

962
00:36:41,885 --> 00:36:44,920
I understand.

963
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:47,857
No spotlight.

964
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:58,901
This is always
how it's gonna be, isn't it?

965
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:04,457
I thought you knew that.

966
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:11,113
I guess I did.

967
00:37:14,468 --> 00:37:15,835
Hey, can I talk to you?

968
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,470
Sure, Louis.
What can I do for you?

969
00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:21,974
Um, I'm sure you heard about
Dana Scott's throttling of me.

970
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:23,309
I haven't.

971
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:25,644
You both wanted me
to stay out of it, and I did.

972
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:28,731
Right.

973
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:30,566
See, after Scottie took my case,
I went to Jessica.

974
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:34,970
I was after blood, and...
She told me--

975
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:40,109
She told me that I bring
these things on myself,

976
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,611
and she was right.

977
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:45,114
And that got me to wondering,
what would've happened

978
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:48,751
if I hadn't shown up
to that meeting late?

979
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:51,486
So I went to the library,

980
00:37:51,538 --> 00:37:53,839
and I found a copy
of the bylaws.

981
00:37:53,924 --> 00:37:56,675
Scottie underlined
six different traps.

982
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,094
She deliberately picked a fight
to embarrass me,

983
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:00,662
and I want to know
if you knew.

984
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:03,098
She didn't do it
to embarrass you.

985
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:06,635
She wanted to beat the meanest,
toughest guy at the firm.

986
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:09,388
- Okay.
- It's a sign of respect.

987
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:13,842
See,
the problem with that is,

988
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:17,947
when that guy loses...
He's done.

989
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:21,784
He is no longer the meanest,
baddest guy in the firm.

990
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:23,352
He's nothing.

991
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:25,120
Louis...

992
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:28,741
What do you want from me?

993
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:30,242
I need you
to use your power

994
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:31,648
to give me this case
over Scottie.

995
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:32,828
I can't do that.

996
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,079
Harvey, she can survive this.
I can't.

997
00:38:34,164 --> 00:38:35,485
- Louis--
- Listen, you came to me

998
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:37,216
and said I was your friend
when you needed a favor.

999
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,751
Well, I am now coming to you,

1000
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:40,535
saying that I need a favor
in return.

1001
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:41,754
The last time we talked,

1002
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:43,538
you said if I value
our friendship at all,

1003
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,873
I'd stay out of it.

1004
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:48,310
I don't care.

1005
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:50,229
I know how you operate.

1006
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:51,814
I let it go with Mike
for you.

1007
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,161
And what I'm asking for
in return

1008
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:57,903
doesn't even come close,
so...

1009
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:02,358
I do operate that way, Louis,
but not with my friends.

1010
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:05,894
So I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

1011
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:08,914
Are you asking as a friend,
or are you calling in a chit?

1012
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:17,756
I'm calling in a chit.

1013
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:22,962
So be it.

1014
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:26,849
- Are you mad?
- I'm disappointed.

1015
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,017
Harvey, I--

1016
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:31,103
You can't have it
both ways, Louis.

1017
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,043
Hi.

1018
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,161
The furniture came.

1019
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:59,632
Look, I know we said that
we'd go with all my choices,

1020
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:03,452
but it turns out you have got
pretty good taste.

1021
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:07,122
Yes.
Yes, I do.

1022
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:08,790
- So?
- Hmm?

1023
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,125
What do you think?

1024
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:13,462
I think
that I can't believe

1025
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:15,481
you did all of this
in one day.

1026
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:17,566
Well, I've been working on it
since I got home.

1027
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,735
I just wanted to have
all of it ready,

1028
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:21,186
so we could celebrate
your big win.

1029
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:24,406
Was Harvey appreciative?

1030
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:26,354
Yeah, are you kidding?
He took me out to dinner.

1031
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:28,977
Oh! Dinner.

1032
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,665
Next thing you know,
you'll be getting a promotion.

1033
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:35,367
Yeah. Next thing.

1034
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:46,178
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

1035
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:48,097
I hope you don't mind
that I let myself in.

1036
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:50,966
You ready to celebrate?

1037
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:54,553
- I'm ready for a drink.
- Well, hurry up.

1038
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:56,004
Because underneath
these clothes,

1039
00:40:56,056 --> 00:40:57,389
I am entirely naked.

1040
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:58,807
Scottie.

1041
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:02,444
What's wrong?

1042
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:03,612
You were in such
a good mood earlier.

1043
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,846
What happened?

1044
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:08,317
- I was.
- But?

1045
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:15,857
Scottie, I need you to give
Louis his transaction back.

1046
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,460
What?

1047
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:19,995
He figured out that
you set the whole thing up,

1048
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:22,331
and he came to me.
So what?

1049
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:24,083
What does that have to do
with anything?

1050
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:27,202
You can survive this.
He can't.

1051
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:28,574
Wait, so let me get
this straight.

1052
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:31,090
Louis tells me
that if I lose

1053
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:33,092
I can't go running
to my boyfriend,

1054
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:35,060
and then he turned around
and does the exact same thing?

1055
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:36,895
Scottie,
I need you to do this.

1056
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,064
Does this have something to do
with that favor he did you?

1057
00:41:39,149 --> 00:41:40,882
Yes.

1058
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:48,407
Okay.
Tell me what it is.

1059
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:50,409
I can't.

1060
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:53,746
Guess we're not
sharing everything

1061
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,896
with each other
after all.

1062
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:56,198
Scottie.

1063
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:57,783
Harvey, before you say
what you're about to say,

1064
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:00,569
I need to know.

1065
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,505
Am I talking
to my boyfriend,

1066
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:06,592
or am I talking
to a name partner?

1067
00:42:06,676 --> 00:42:08,243
That depends
on your answer.

1068
00:42:08,294 --> 00:42:11,079
You can't have it
both ways, Harvey.

1069
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:17,419
Then you're talking
to a name partner.
