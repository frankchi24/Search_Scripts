1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:04,076
Why am I being suspended?
I didn't leak any documents.

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:06,392
You were unfairly punished,

3
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:08,778
and I would like
to officially welcome you back.

4
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:10,280
- I want a raise.
- Fine.

5
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:12,499
And Pearson Hardman pays for
law school when I decide to go.

6
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:13,700
Agreed.

7
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:16,086
- I fronted your buy-in.
- How could you do that?

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,570
You were about to take
a job somewhere else.

9
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:19,923
We need to start being honest
with each other.

10
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:21,124
You want me off this case,

11
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:22,926
so I don't get anywhere
near the spotlight.

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,177
In your position,

13
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:26,579
the spotlight can become
an interrogation lamp

14
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:27,964
pretty damn fast.

15
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:30,100
This is always
how it's gonna be, isn't it?

16
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:31,468
I thought you knew that.

17
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:33,470
I guess I did.

18
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:34,675
I need you to use your power

19
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:36,189
to give me this case
over Scottie.

20
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:39,142
Are you asking as a friend,
or are you calling in a chit?

21
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:40,610
Calling in a chit.

22
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,696
Does this have something to do
with that favor he did you?

23
00:00:42,763 --> 00:00:44,364
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.

24
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,482
I can't.

25
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,483
Guess we're not
sharing everything

26
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,368
with each other after all.

27
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,136
Time to wake up, sweetie.

28
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,955
Oh, five more minutes, mom.

29
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,623
Did you just call me mom?

30
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:12,475
What? No.

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,344
Louis,
I've said it before.

32
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:17,847
The bedroom
is a no-mom-talk zone.

33
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:19,015
Understood.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,968
You have to catch your train.

35
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,469
I'll take the later one.

36
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,854
Who are you,

37
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:27,073
and what have you done
with my boyfriend, Louis Litt?

38
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:28,358
Oh, you mean the guy

39
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:30,994
who sweats profusely
before closing arguments?

40
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:32,495
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that guy's gone.

41
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,814
Really?

42
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:37,701
Oh, my God.

43
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:40,153
You're completely dry.

44
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:41,921
Your love has made me dry,
Sheila.

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,293
I'm a changed man.

46
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:49,179
In fact...
I'm gonna rock your world

47
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,264
for one more hour, and then I'm
gonna kick some ass in court.

48
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:52,999
'Cause today
nothing can go wrong.

49
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,500
Today is my goddamn day.

50
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:57,220
Yeah. It is.

51
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,866
Can you pass the sugar?

52
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,452
Yeah, of course.

53
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:16,573
Okay, how 'bout that milk?

54
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,024
Sounds great.

55
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:19,242
How would you feel
about me dating other women

56
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,861
now that we're
living together and all?

57
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:23,380
Pizza's perfect.

58
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:24,864
Rachel.

59
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:26,466
What's going on?

60
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,386
I got my tuition
payment schedule, and...

61
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,704
Wow.
That is a big bill.

62
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:33,590
Yeah, and that's
not even the problem.

63
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:35,041
Remember when Louis fired me

64
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:36,926
because he thought
that I was leaking information?

65
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:38,928
I never told you about

66
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:39,929
negotiating the terms
of my return.

67
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:41,314
Yeah, you did.

68
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:43,817
He gave you a 10% raise.
That's not all he gave me.

69
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,268
He agreed that the firm
would pay for me

70
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,552
to go to law school
when I got in.

71
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:47,604
So what's the problem?

72
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:49,939
It's gonna be
an awkward conversation.

73
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,408
Rachel,
you want to be a lawyer,

74
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:53,526
you're gonna have to have
a lot of awkward conversations.

75
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:54,861
Yeah, but not like this.

76
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:56,229
I mean, "Hey, Louis,
do you remember when I demanded

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,997
"that you pay for me
to go to law school?

78
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,333
"I get that since then you've
now tried to help me get in

79
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,501
"and that we're friends,

80
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,703
but I would really
like my money now."

81
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:05,255
Okay.
So don't talk to him.

82
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:08,958
Just get ready to write
a check for $200,000,

83
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,928
because that's what it's gonna
cost for the next three years.

84
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,597
- Awkward conversation it is.
- Best of luck.

85
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:15,765
Oh.

86
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,634
Norma, it's Louis.

87
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,936
Louis Litt, your boss.

88
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,221
Don't play your games
with me now, woman.

89
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:23,273
I'm due for closing arguments
30 minutes,

90
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:24,607
and I need you to stall.

91
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:28,611
No, you do not pull the fire
alarm as a tactic, okay?

92
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:30,280
I need you to just
buy me ten minutes

93
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:31,648
without committing a crime.

94
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:33,566
Taxi!

95
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:37,737
There we go.
Come on, baby. My man.

96
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,823
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
don't you upstream me.

97
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,624
That's my cab.
That's my taxi.

98
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,776
This is my cab.
This is my cab.

99
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,663
Hey, I'm gonna sue you.
I'm gonna sue you for sucking.

100
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,027
I'm gonna sue you
for not being--

101
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:51,501
okay, I need your name,
date of birth, and I need--

102
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:54,454
all right, let's Litt this up.

103
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,678
Uhoh.
What did you do to Scottie?

104
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:03,430
- Nothing.
- That is not nothing.

105
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:06,433
That is a soy caramel latte with
a double shot of fear and guilt.

106
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:08,518
That is an apology coffee.

107
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,770
Why can't it just be an
"I'm a great boyfriend" coffee?

108
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:12,138
If you're
such a great boyfriend,

109
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:14,324
why don't you know that
your girlfriend is on her way

110
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:15,525
to Chicago
for the Wexler deposition?

111
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,529
- Oh, shit.
- So I repeat, what did you do?

112
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,814
I overruled her
on Franklin Courier.

113
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,500
I made her give the case
back to Louis.

114
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,485
You got in the middle of it?

115
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:26,920
Why would you do that?

116
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,004
Look, I don't want to get
into it right now, Donna.

117
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,255
Okay.

118
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:32,041
But, Harvey, if you really did
do that to her,

119
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:34,844
coffee isn't gonna cut it.

120
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:41,468
For the record,
this was not my goal.

121
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:44,837
Mr. Litt.

122
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,056
Sorry, Your Honor.
Sorry I'm late.

123
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,674
Are you ready
for closing arguments?

124
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:52,529
Yes, I am.

125
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:55,198
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

126
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:58,368
opposing counsel has accused my
client of a great many things.

127
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:00,353
But you see,
here's the problem.

128
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:05,291
They don't have one single fact
to back up their claim.

129
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,043
I mean, not one.

130
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,828
So you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna challenge you.

131
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,296
Actually, no, scratch that.

132
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:12,665
I'm gonna dare you
to find dispute

133
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:15,552
with the facts of this case
as we presented them.

134
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:16,886
'Cause are you a good person?

135
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,304
Yes.

136
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:21,140
Are you a good person?
Yes.

137
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,676
Are you--actually, you took
notes, so I can see you care.

138
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:27,430
You see, this is the kind
of jury that they teach about.

139
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:30,567
This is the kind of jury
that's gonna hear me

140
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,185
when I say these four words.

141
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:33,719
Do you know
what those four words are?

142
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,322
Because I want you
to remember these four words

143
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,907
to your dying breath.

144
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:41,411
He didn't do it!

145
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,895
He didn't do it.

146
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,540
Mr. Litt, are you okay?

147
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:57,343
I'm all right.
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,820
Well is that it?
Are we done.

160
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,270
Harvey, you've signed
three checks.

161
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,272
And?

162
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:48,075
Just go.

163
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,977
Oh, by the way,
how's Mike Ross doing?

164
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,196
What are you talking about?

165
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,330
He just came up
with the huge Stemple solution.

166
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,832
He's doing great.

167
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,501
So I guess he didn't tell you
about our little conversation?

168
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,486
What conversation?

169
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:00,487
The one where he ran
into the fact

170
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:02,039
that he has a glass ceiling.

171
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,323
Mike knows he has
a glass ceiling.

172
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:06,677
He knows,
but he didn't <i>know.</i>

173
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,713
We have a problem
with William Beck.

174
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:10,964
Who's William Beck?

175
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,500
Division head
of Coastal Radiance Sunscreen.

176
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:15,352
He's trying to break
his contract.

177
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,354
I assume he has
a non-compete.

178
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,673
No, Harvey, I was dumb enough
to let him do whatever he wants.

179
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:20,674
Why is he trying to leave?

180
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,025
He has some ideas

181
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,895
about the product line
that we're not implementing.

182
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,179
Does he have another offer?

183
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:27,698
- Neutrogena wants him.
- They can't have him.

184
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,262
He can go work at Starbucks, but
he's not touching this market.

185
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,703
Excuse me,
but maybe there's a solution.

186
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,906
Coastal Radiance is a division
of Pure Moisture Skincare.

187
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,023
Spin them off.

188
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,159
Beck gets to run
his own company,

189
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,378
both stocks go up,
everybody wins.

190
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,496
If I had wanted
the junior associate

191
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,067
to come up with an idea,
I'd have asked

192
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:46,917
the junior associate
to come up with an idea.

193
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,919
Tony, he's not wrong.

194
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,755
Coastal Radiance is undervalued,
and this fixes that.

195
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,057
Beck has been with us
for ten years.

196
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:56,222
Maybe it's worth running
the numbers on the spin-off.

197
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,978
I don't want
to run the numbers.

198
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,546
I want him out now.

199
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,932
So have your boy work up
the exit paperwork.

200
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,383
Jonathan will sign off.

201
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:05,402
Your company, your call.

202
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,325
You want to talk about
what just happened in there?

203
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:13,059
Not particularly.

204
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:14,745
Look, it was a good idea.
He should've listened to it.

205
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,113
I know it was a good idea.

206
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:17,230
What I don't know
is why you didn't push back.

207
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:19,783
Were you in there?
I did push back.

208
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,952
When you push back,
you change people's minds,

209
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,837
which means either
you didn't agree with me

210
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,572
or you don't care enough
to change his mind.

211
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,791
Look, I know when it's time
to change someone's mind

212
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,209
and when it isn't,

213
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,877
and all pushing harder
in that meeting would've done

214
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:32,045
was make him dig in.

215
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,097
We had an ally.
Jonathan agreed with me.

216
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,049
Yeah, and then he agreed
with his boss,

217
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,551
which is what we're gonna do,

218
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:38,719
because it's the way
the world works.

219
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,220
- Come on, Harvey.
- Mike.

220
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:44,274
This man goes through lawyers
like a hot knife through butter,

221
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,859
and I wasn't
about to get us fired

222
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,561
to protect some guy
I don't even give a shit about.

223
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:48,562
Now are you on board
with that?

224
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,063
I'm on board.
Can we move on?

225
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,065
- I have nothing to move on to.
- I do.

226
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,234
Have you called Scottie
and apologized yet?

227
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,285
Apologize for what?

228
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,737
What are you,
the apology police?

229
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,038
If you're the one
under investigation,

230
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,323
I'll sign up for that.

231
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:02,242
Jessica, if you need me
to sign any more checks,

232
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:03,443
now would be a great time.
It's Louis.

233
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:04,661
Let me guess.

234
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,129
Even though he didn't
show up to the meeting,

235
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:07,914
he's feeling left out
and throwing a hissy fit.

236
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:10,950
He had a heart attack
in court this morning.

237
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,341
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:18,842
He's okay.

239
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,628
I made a call, he's got the best
cardiologists at Mount Sinai,

240
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,797
and they say
he's going to be fine.

241
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,733
We should go see him.

242
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,402
He told Norma
he didn't want anybody to come.

243
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,971
That means he's embarrassed,
but he wants me there.

244
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:36,159
I'll be back
when I'm back.

245
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,414
We handle
all his cases personally.

246
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:43,000
Nothing with Louis' name on it
falls through the cracks.

247
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,419
No client finds out
this happened.

248
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,337
- Done.
- Done.

249
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:49,873
I'll send him flowers
from all of us.

250
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,425
No.

251
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:53,377
He's allergic.

252
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,379
To flowers?

253
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:56,880
All of them?

254
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,799
How do you even know that?

255
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,851
I used to send them
to his desk every day

256
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,335
when we were associates.

257
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:04,187
I know.

258
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:06,473
I'm an asshole.

259
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,026
Hey.
He's gonna be okay, right?

260
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:14,698
Oh, my God.

261
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,850
This is awful.

262
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:19,369
Yeah, I know.

263
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:20,854
All morning all I've been
thinking about is how

264
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:22,856
I don't want to talk to him
about the tuition, and now--

265
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:25,625
Hey, Rachel, Rachel.
Hey, come on.

266
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,193
Look at me.

267
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:29,296
He's gonna be okay.

268
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,048
He'll be back, and you guys
can have a lifetime

269
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:34,200
of working together,
going to the ballet,

270
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,586
having really awkward
conversations.

271
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:40,874
Rachel,
I'm gonna say the thing

272
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,041
that I know
you don't want to hear.

273
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:43,643
I don't care
about that right now.

274
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,595
It doesn't have to be
a big deal.

275
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,397
We've all got Louis' back
right now,

276
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,182
and Jessica handles
this stuff anyway.

277
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,485
Just talk to her.

278
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:58,191
You are never allowed
to have a heart attack.

279
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,611
Okay?

280
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,031
Understood.

281
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,839
Louis.

282
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,427
Is this heaven?

283
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:20,680
I can understand
why you would think that,

284
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:21,765
but no.

285
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,050
I don't know
how this can happen.

286
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:28,388
I...Treat my body
like a temple.

287
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,690
And you've also been
commuting every weekend,

288
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,838
and you let the associates
raise your blood pressure.

289
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,428
- It's because they're stupid.
- Okay, Louis, relax.

290
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,530
The doctors say
you're out of danger,

291
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:37,948
but you shouldn't
get worked up.

292
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,534
- The doctors need to let me go.
- You had a heart attack.

293
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:43,286
If my blood supply had been
cut off for a half-second less,

294
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:46,156
it would've been classified
as a minor cardiac event.

295
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,941
And what if it would have
lasted half a second more?

296
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:48,942
It didn't.

297
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,710
And I need to get to work.

298
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,046
Louis, I'm serious.
You have to cut back.

299
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,664
You could have died.

300
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:57,050
And if anything
were to happen to you...

301
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:06,510
Harvey would be a total mess.
Okay?

302
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:11,798
I'll cut back.

303
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,733
Good.

304
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:21,340
Excuse me.
It's Mike, right?

305
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:22,875
Yeah. Did you
still need something?

306
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,760
Because I haven't
finished yet.

307
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,961
I did. I've been
trying to find Louis.

308
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,212
He wasn't at the meeting.

309
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:29,348
- Louis isn't here.
- Where is he?

310
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:32,468
What did you need
to see him about?

311
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,436
I want to talk
about what happened.

312
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,856
Yeah, um, look,
I know that we both agreed

313
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:39,642
that a spin-off
was the better way to go, but--

314
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,860
I don't want
to talk about that.

315
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,028
I want to talk about me.

316
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:44,363
I want out.

317
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:45,568
You want to leave
Gianopolous

318
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:46,848
because of what happened
this morning?

319
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,283
What happened this morning
happens every day.

320
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,203
He keeps people down
when they reach a certain point,

321
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,155
and I'm pretty sure
I'm at that point.

322
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,540
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, you don't.

323
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:56,024
You don't. No.

324
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,210
In a place like this, your whole
future's laid out for you.

325
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,462
You'll be running
the place before 40.

326
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:05,250
Jonathan, we work
for Tony Gianopolous.

327
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:06,535
And I know I don't
have to tell you,

328
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,970
but you're working
under the same non-compete

329
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,421
that William Beck is.

330
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,924
But you work for me too.
Louis is my personal attorney.

331
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,058
I know.

332
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,760
But if there's
a conflict of interest,

333
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,929
we're gonna choose him.

334
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,847
I know
that you have a conflict.

335
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,881
I'm just asking,
is there any way

336
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,717
that you can help me
without...

337
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,719
Helping me?

338
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,655
I'm sorry.

339
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,890
Then where's Louis?

340
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:29,942
Louis is away
on business right now,

341
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:32,060
so he can't help you either.

342
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,579
Then I'll find
someone who will.

343
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:37,065
Let this serve as formal notice
I'm letting him go.

344
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:40,085
Michigan Court of Appeals.

345
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,454
What?

346
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,089
There was a ruling
a few years ago

347
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:48,460
that established a weak link
in the non-compete.

348
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,606
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Do you have a minute?

349
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,974
What can I do for you?

350
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:05,194
The timing on this
is terrible,

351
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,812
and I-I apologize for that.

352
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,598
What is it?

353
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,950
I need the first check
for my law school tuition.

354
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,435
Excuse me?

355
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,488
Maybe you don't remember, but
when I was wrongfully dismissed,

356
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,106
one of the terms
of my rehiring

357
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,958
was that the firm
pays for my law school.

358
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:21,794
I remember just fine.

359
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,328
And the only term
of your rehiring

360
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,297
was a 10% increase
in salary.

361
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:28,116
What?

362
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,670
No, I'm--I'm telling you this
was an agreed-upon term, and--

363
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,223
And I'm telling you
I know nothing about that.

364
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,459
And if I had heard about it,
I would have never approved it.

365
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,628
I was scapegoated
by this firm.

366
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,396
And when you agreed
to come back,

367
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,898
you were given a 10% raise.

368
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,066
That's standard.

369
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,734
My situation
was not standard.

370
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,904
In what way?

371
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,323
Louis accused me
of being disloyal.

372
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,242
And?

373
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,160
And he turned out
to be wrong.

374
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:56,495
The problem, Rachel,

375
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,200
is that you have no record
of what you're saying.

376
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:02,918
He agreed to it.

377
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,320
He is your agent.

378
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,339
You're bound by this.

379
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:08,757
I don't know that.

380
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,425
And the man just had
a heart attack.

381
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,011
And I'm not going
to call him and ask him.

382
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,713
I know that,
and I don't want you to.

383
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:17,549
Then this conversation
is over.

384
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,479
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

385
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,364
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

386
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,116
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sheila.

387
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,851
I'm so sorry.
You should be.

388
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,018
I don't know
why I had a heart attack,

389
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,620
but I promise
it won't happen again.

390
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,524
You think I'm mad
because you had a heart attack?

391
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,255
It's a sign of weakness.
You hate weakness.

392
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,648
No, I hate
that you're doing work.

393
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:47,079
- Sheila--
- No, Louis,

394
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,298
do you know what I was thinking
about the whole way down here?

395
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,533
I was thinking
that if you died,

396
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,368
I'd want to die too.

397
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,636
So you better start
taking care of yourself,

398
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,804
because I don't want to--

399
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,056
- Sheila--
- No. No more work.

400
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:59,207
Okay, but this isn't
what you think it is.

401
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,592
Don't fight me
on this, please.

402
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,060
- Okay, but I need that--
- Don't fight me on this!

403
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:06,214
"Sheila, as long
as I've known you, I've had a...

404
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,216
"I've had a feeling
of completeness.

405
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:13,155
Romeo and Juliet.
Antony and Cleopatra."

406
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,107
You crossed out
Jaime and Cersei Lannister.

407
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,032
I thought they were
too controversial a couple.

408
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,278
- Too controversial for what?
- A proposal.

409
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,997
What?

410
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,582
Sheila, I could've died.

411
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,585
And I don't want my life
to have ended without--

412
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:27,736
Louis, I don't want you to ask
me what you're about to ask me

413
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,237
because you're afraid
to die alone.

414
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,239
No.

415
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,258
It's not about that.

416
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:40,716
It's not about dying alone.

417
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,602
It's about living
without the woman I love.

418
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,692
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

419
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,979
you are the love
of what I hope will be

420
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:57,816
my very, very long life.

421
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:01,269
And I can't spend one more
second of it without you.

422
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,159
Will you marry me?

423
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,778
Yes.

424
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,998
Yes, I'll marry you.

425
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:26,127
Tony,
what can I do for you?

426
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,230
You screwed me over.

427
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,965
By figuring out how to fire
the guy you told us to fire?

428
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,134
By telling my number two
how to break his non-compete.

429
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,306
- I did nothing of the kind.
- Then it was Louis Litt.

430
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,190
No way.
That did not happen.

431
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,942
That's bullshit, Harvey,
we had a meeting.

432
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,810
Jonathan stuck around
for the paperwork.

433
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,413
Then suddenly he comes back
with his resignation

434
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,248
and some Michigan
Appeals Court precedent

435
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,649
for breaking our deal.

436
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,834
Well, he couldn't have
met with Louis

437
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,168
because Louis wasn't even
in the office.

438
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:51,503
Then it was someone else.

439
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:52,787
Tony, what exactly
do you want?

440
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,373
You want me to fire him
like we're firing Beck?

441
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:56,341
I'll tell you
a little secret.

442
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:59,094
I don't give a shit
whether Beck goes or not.

443
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,346
But can you understand
why I want him crushed?

444
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:03,215
Because you want
people like Jonathan Sidwell

445
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,100
to know what happens
when they try to leave.

446
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,101
Ah.

447
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,169
Finally my lawyer shows up.

448
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,356
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

449
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:13,358
You see it
how you want to see it.

450
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,727
But if you can't figure out
a way to make Jonathan stay,

451
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:18,647
you'll be the one who's gone.

452
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,065
Tony.

453
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,952
I'm gonna fix this,
but let's get one thing clear.

454
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,821
I'm not like the other lawyers
you've burned through.

455
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,823
So the next time
you go stomping around

456
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,709
like a four-year-old
throwing tantrums with me,

457
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:33,996
I'll be the one
getting rid of you.

458
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:42,020
 I guess you were
never really onboard after all.

459
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,545
What?
I did the paperwork for Beck.

460
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:46,710
I'm not talking about Beck.

461
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,247
I'm talking
about Jonathan Sidwell.

462
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,299
Michigan Court of Appeals
sound familiar?

463
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,869
Harvey,
he was gonna fire Louis.

464
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,038
If that's the advice
he was looking for from Louis,

465
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,373
he'd have fired him anyway.

466
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:58,725
And Jonathan would've
found that loophole anyway.

467
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,176
But instead
he got it from you.

468
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:02,227
What do you want from me?
Louis had a heart attack.

469
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:04,764
Jessica told us not to--
don't hide behind that shit.

470
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:06,149
Let's get
into what this is really about.

471
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:07,716
What the hell
are you talking about?

472
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:09,235
I'm talking about
your conversation with Jessica.

473
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,887
So that's why you were
telling me my idea was so good

474
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:15,408
after our Gianopolous meeting.

475
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:16,859
Yeah.
We had that conversation.

476
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,327
And yeah, it sucks.

477
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:20,329
But this has nothing
to do with that.

478
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:21,564
- Then prove it.
- Prove what?

479
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,166
He's unhappy
with his situation.

480
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:24,900
When people are unhappy,
they find a way out.

481
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,285
Which brings me
back to my point.

482
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,121
You weren't really on board.

483
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,256
I told you,
I took care of Beck.

484
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,624
Well, now you're gonna
do the same for Jonathan.

485
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,409
The Michigan ruling
clearly states that he has--

486
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,761
Don't quote precedent to me.

487
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,096
You figured out how he could
break the non-compete,

488
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:38,798
now figure out
how to enforce it.

489
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:40,266
- Harvey--
- Enough.

490
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,517
You're a pretty good lawyer
when you want to be,

491
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:44,637
so maybe try doing it
for our side this time.

492
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:54,480
Bad night?

493
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,783
Only if you call
figuring out a way

494
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,285
to crush
someone's hopes and dreams bad.

495
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,769
What about you?

496
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:04,207
You, uh, take care
of that awkward conversation?

497
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:09,078
Yeah, it wasn't awkward.
It was...

498
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:12,215
Humiliating.

499
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:13,833
Louis never
actually told Jessica.

500
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,385
What?
That's bullshit.

501
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:18,721
He made a promise to you.
He's an agent of the firm.

502
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,089
You know,
I never thought about that.

503
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,641
Maybe I should just
rush to his hospital bed

504
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:23,676
and get him to admit
that he screwed me over.

505
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,848
How could he
lie to me like that?

506
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:30,733
Rachel, why he lied
to you doesn't matter.

507
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,469
- It matters to me.
- Well, you said it yourself.

508
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,238
Do you really want
to upset him just to find out?

509
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:36,272
Of course not.

510
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:37,740
Then take the emotion
out of it.

511
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,910
- What are you talking about?
- It's a contract problem.

512
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:43,696
Figure out a way
to enforce the contract.

513
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,654
I have someone
here to see you.

514
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:54,874
Donna, I don't have time
to see anyone right--

515
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,878
oh, look who it is.
Where the hell have you been?

516
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:59,095
Harvey, don't be a dick.
He had a heart attack.

517
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:00,996
And you think
having a heart attack

518
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:03,883
gives you the right
to take the day off?

519
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:09,856
I'm alive.

520
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,858
Help me.

521
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:14,193
Hug him back.

522
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:20,316
I'm gonna let you two
be alone.

523
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:24,237
Okay, not that I'm not
enjoying this, but...

524
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:25,521
Shouldn't you be home?

525
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:28,023
No, the doctor cleared me
to come back.

526
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:29,492
Sheila's allowing me
half days.

527
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:31,711
The other half of the day...

528
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,212
I'm at home
planning my wedding.

529
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:34,697
You're engaged?

530
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,582
It's the happiest moment
of my life.

531
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,701
I'll send my condolences
to the bride-to-be.

532
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:40,169
That kind of sense of humor

533
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,420
is exactly what I want
of my best man.

534
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:43,145
Louis, are you asking me
to be your best--

535
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:45,708
Harvey, before you answer,

536
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,210
I am sorry my fight with Scottie
put you in a bad situation.

537
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:50,396
And I know calling in
my chit with you

538
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,801
jeopardized our friendship,
but...

539
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,215
- Louis--
- Let me just finish.

540
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:56,319
You said I can't
have it both ways, but--

541
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:58,487
I'd be honored.

542
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:02,558
Thank you, Harvey.

543
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,777
You're welcome, Louis.

544
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,922
- Mr. Kovacs.
- Yes?

545
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:18,507
Mike Ross.
Pearson Specter.

546
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:19,842
Do we have business
together?

547
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:21,427
Jonathan Sidwell.

548
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,832
I understand
you made him an offer

549
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:24,347
to run
your investment division.

550
00:22:24,414 --> 00:22:27,516
Jonathan reached out to me
with a proposal, and I liked it.

551
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,517
Did he happen
to mention the fact

552
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:29,518
that he's under a non-compete?

553
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:30,586
Yes.

554
00:22:30,637 --> 00:22:31,854
He also mentioned that

555
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:33,401
the Michigan Court
of Appeals decision

556
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:34,923
makes his contract breakable.

557
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:37,109
I had my lawyers look into it.
He's right.

558
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:38,427
Did you also have
your lawyers

559
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,429
look into the theft
of intellectual property?

560
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,614
What are you talking about?

561
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:43,098
I'm talking
about the algorithm

562
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,367
that Jonathan developed
to identify

563
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:45,785
companies ripe for takeover.

564
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,037
- My employee, my algorithm.
- Wrong.

565
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:50,156
Jonathan developed it
while under contract

566
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,777
with Tony Gianopolous,
which makes it his property.

567
00:22:54,828 --> 00:22:57,496
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

568
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,614
I just came down here

569
00:22:58,665 --> 00:22:59,966
to let you know
you can go ahead

570
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,334
and do whatever you care to
with Jonathan Sidwell,

571
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:03,552
but if you use
his algorithm,

572
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,506
we're gonna sue you for
every penny that comes from it.

573
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:16,983
- Hi.
- Hi.

574
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:18,300
I heard you were back.

575
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:20,302
Should you be doing that?
Prescribed.

576
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:23,022
Light walking.
Need to get the blood flowing.

577
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:24,857
Okay.

578
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:26,742
Good.

579
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,411
Look, Louis, I am--

580
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:30,363
I'm sorry about what happened.
I really am.

581
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,531
Well, I'm gonna
be fine, Rachel.

582
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:33,866
Good.

583
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,669
I actually wanted to talk to you
about a contracts issue.

584
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:39,488
- Shoot.
- Okay.

585
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,419
A friend of mine
entered into a verbal agreement

586
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,660
with an agent for a corporation,
and now he's reneging on it.

587
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:46,045
Wait a second, why verbal?

588
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:47,380
Why not?

589
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:48,881
Verbal contracts are binding,
and she knows it.

590
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:50,933
She have it on tape?
No.

591
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,502
Well, then he can lie about
it, or he can argue the wording.

592
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,221
No, he made a clear promise.

593
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:57,172
Well, maybe it was
a promise to try,

594
00:23:57,224 --> 00:24:00,359
or maybe it was a suggestion.
No, it wasn't.

595
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,779
What's the contract?

596
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:05,531
Employment bonus.

597
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:07,116
Lump sum
or payable over time?

598
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:09,184
- Three-year term.
- Well, then verbal ain't shit.

599
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:12,705
If it's paid over a year
or more, it has to be written.

600
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,540
My friend made life decisions
based on this promise.

601
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:16,692
She could sue
for promissory estoppel.

602
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:17,693
Well, she could sue
the dick who made the deal,

603
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:19,078
but she can't sue the company.

604
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:21,247
- She doesn't want to do that.
- Let me ask you this.

605
00:24:21,331 --> 00:24:24,050
Why wouldn't she get it
in writing if it was legit?

606
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:26,702
Because she trusted him.

607
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:28,804
She doesn't know
why he would lie to her.

608
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:30,423
He did because he could.

609
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,725
He wanted what he wanted
when he wanted it,

610
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,977
and it cost him nothing.

611
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:36,479
You know?
Yeah.

612
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:39,315
Maybe she should go after him.
She could try.

613
00:24:39,382 --> 00:24:40,516
But I mean, realistically,
she'll lose, and she should,

614
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:43,069
because stupidity
shouldn't be rewarded.

615
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:46,221
So glad you came to see me.
You really got my juices going.

616
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:47,239
Make me feel glad to be back.

617
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,416
- This is nice, fiance.
- It is nice, betrothed.

618
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,735
So where should we do it?

619
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:02,588
Sheila, are you serious?
I just had a heart attack.

620
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:05,174
I'm talking
about the wedding.

621
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:07,009
I say we do it here.

622
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:09,595
Get married in New York?

623
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,214
It's where
our relationship began.

624
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:15,518
I think it's only fitting
that we tie the knot here.

625
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:17,970
I love you.

626
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:20,222
Good, then it's decided.

627
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:21,590
We'll do it here

628
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,359
and then move
straight to Boston.

629
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:24,810
What do you mean
move to Boston?

630
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:26,278
I'm not moving to Boston.

631
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:29,198
You have to. You know
what Harvard means to me.

632
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:31,617
You know what
Pearson Specter means to me.

633
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:32,952
Okay, Louis,
there are a dozen firms

634
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:34,637
that would snap you up
in a second there.

635
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:36,104
Same goes
for law schools here.

636
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:38,774
Yeah,
but they're not Harvard,

637
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:42,628
which means
they're second tier.

638
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:44,964
You seriously expected me
to drop everything

639
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:46,215
and move to New York?

640
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:48,050
Yeah, I did.

641
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:50,136
Okay, well, I think
that's a little presumptuous.

642
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,137
Me?

643
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:52,621
What about you?

644
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:54,507
You're the one who has us
buying a place on Bacon Hill.

645
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:57,676
Okay, it's "Beacon Hill,"
and I thought you liked it.

646
00:25:57,761 --> 00:26:00,763
To visit.
I mean, not to live.

647
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,431
And what are you talking about,
our law schools are second tier?

648
00:26:02,482 --> 00:26:03,516
Your city is second tier.

649
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,968
Well, maybe my city
is second tier.

650
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,488
But it's also the home of
the woman you supposedly love.

651
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:12,441
Oh, Sheila,
come on, please.

652
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:14,160
I mean, everything I have
is in New York.

653
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:17,746
Everything except me.

654
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:30,201
It's usually easier
if you look at the screen.

655
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,036
With your eyes.

656
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:34,488
I'm...I'm sorry.

657
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:38,542
It's just been
one of those weeks.

658
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,711
You know Louis
is gonna be okay, right?

659
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:44,548
Yeah, I know
he's going to be okay.

660
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,168
But at the moment,
I hate his guts.

661
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:58,796
I hear congratulations
are in order.

662
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:01,399
Jessica.

663
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:05,603
Another eligible bachelor
bites the dust.

664
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:08,155
Yeah.
I mean, no, it's--

665
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,407
It's amazing.

666
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:10,858
How are you feeling?

667
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:13,361
Better, thanks.

668
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:17,815
I wanted to get you
a little welcome-back something.

669
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:20,368
It's not much.

670
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:26,207
You know, you gave me
quite a scare this week.

671
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,008
I love it.

672
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:30,211
The Pearson Hardman retreat
five years ago.

673
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:33,664
And do you know what I
remember most about that night?

674
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:36,100
What an amazing dancer
you are.

675
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:37,468
Five years,
Long Island School of Ballet.

676
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,337
You weren't
dancing ballet that night.

677
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:43,173
Well, they say ballet is
the foundation for everything.

678
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:46,727
Well, sir, you have
an amazing foundation.

679
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:50,114
I just thought you could
add that to your collection.

680
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:53,951
Somewhere between you and...
Bruno.

681
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:03,210
It means so much to me
that you...

682
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:05,996
Louis.

683
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:08,866
Come on.

684
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:12,035
After everything
we've been through...

685
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:15,706
You're family.

686
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,064
- Holy shit.
- I know.

687
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,817
He betrayed me.
Maybe, but, Rachel,

688
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:29,437
you didn't even give him
a chance to explain himself.

689
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,071
I didn't want to upset him.

690
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:33,741
Even if he was
bullshitting you back then,

691
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:36,660
the Louis I know
is a man of his word.

692
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:38,446
And if you went to him
honestly--

693
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,030
It wouldn't matter.

694
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:41,231
He would just say
he agreed to it,

695
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:42,666
and Jessica
would still say no.

696
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,401
He might offer to pay.

697
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:46,570
Absolutely not.
I wouldn't let him.

698
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:48,005
And you know what,
that's not the problem.

699
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:49,290
What is the problem?

700
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:50,695
The problem is
he made me a chump.

701
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,676
- Rachel--
- Donna, I went in there

702
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:55,913
as a paralegal trying
to negotiate with Louis Litt,

703
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:58,933
and I left with the money
to become a lawyer,

704
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:00,184
and for the first time
in my life,

705
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:02,436
I felt like
I could actually be one.

706
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:06,223
And now I realize that...

707
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:07,975
When I left that room,

708
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,278
he was probably laughing about
how he pulled one over on me.

709
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:12,813
Maybe you're right.

710
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:15,699
But I'm telling you, the Louis
of today would never do that.

711
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,068
Well, the Rachel of today
certainly wouldn't

712
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,436
let him get away with it.

713
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,456
And the Donna of today
is a genius.

714
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,441
Well, the genius of Donna
is every day.

715
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,378
What are you saying?

716
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:29,129
Just because
you can't go after Louis

717
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:33,968
doesn't mean you can't
still make your case.

718
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:37,338
What the hell
is wrong with you?

719
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:38,672
You gave me the map to escape

720
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:39,924
and told the guards
where I'd be.

721
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:41,642
- Jonathan--
- Kovacs rescinded his offer.

722
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:43,460
He said I'm not worth it
without that algorithm.

723
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:46,063
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

724
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,148
You gave me that advice
in the first place.

725
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:49,713
Because you threatened
to leave Louis.

726
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:51,068
Bullshit.

727
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,520
You did it because you knew
what I was up against,

728
00:29:52,604 --> 00:29:53,938
and you were
trying to help me.

729
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:55,239
Whether that's true or not,

730
00:29:55,306 --> 00:29:56,740
that advice was
off the record,

731
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:59,860
and it turns out that on the
record it's my job to stop you.

732
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,862
Well, congratulations.

733
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:04,031
You ripped away
the thing I value the most.

734
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:06,333
That algorithm--it took me
ten years to develop it.

735
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:08,035
It's how I look
at valuing companies.

736
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,086
It's how I look at the world.

737
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:11,872
If I can't take it with me,

738
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:13,374
even if someone thinks
I'm worth something, I'm not.

739
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,325
- Jonathan--
- Please.

740
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:17,011
You did your job
on the record.

741
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:21,015
Now off the record,
what do I do?

742
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:23,667
It was my job to make sure
there's nothing you could do.

743
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:27,104
Then check in with me
in ten years.

744
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:28,689
'Cause I promise you
I'll be at the same desk

745
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:30,674
punching the same clock.

746
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:32,443
Can't move up,
can't move out.

747
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,063
It's on you.

748
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:50,694
You were right.

749
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:55,416
This isn't about William Beck
or Jonathan Sidwell.

750
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,917
It's about me.

751
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:58,886
- Mike--
- I want to go legit.

752
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,804
- You can't.
- Harvey, listen--

753
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:02,339
Do I need to state
the obvious?

754
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,708
I can go to law school now,
all right? Get a real degree.

755
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,976
Even if it didn't matter

756
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,227
that you've already
presented yourself

757
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:08,512
as having gone to Harvard law,

758
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:09,880
you'd have to take
the bar again.

759
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,231
Okay, I passed it once,
I'll pass it again.

760
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:12,483
Not under your own name.

761
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,851
And if you take it now,

762
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:15,886
you'll draw attention
to yourself in a major way.

763
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:17,655
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

764
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,773
and just put me in there,
just like she did with Harvard.

765
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:20,941
Are you insane?

766
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:22,693
Hacking into the bar
is twice the crime

767
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:23,894
you've been committing.

768
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:24,995
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

769
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:26,413
you don't move
the goddamn body.

770
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:27,898
You do if they're
about to find it.

771
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:29,070
They're not
about to find it.

772
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:31,118
They're always
about to find it!

773
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:34,788
Mike, committing another fraud
to cover your fraud

774
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:36,239
isn't going legit.

775
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,459
It's just covering your ass,
and it doesn't undo

776
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:40,243
the fact that you've already
committed the crime.

777
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:43,514
You think I haven't thought
about all of this?

778
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,135
Harvey, I'm stuck.

779
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:51,689
There's no way up,
there's no way down.

780
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:57,928
I can't live
my whole life like this.

781
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:06,103
Okay.

782
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:08,789
You want to be legit,

783
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:10,290
there's only one way.

784
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,910
You go to a small town
in Iowa

785
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:15,129
where nobody's ever heard
of Harvey Specter,

786
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,964
Jessica Pearson,
or anybody else,

787
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:20,584
you go to law school,
hang out your shingle.

788
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:23,087
Nobody will ever know.

789
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:25,055
I guarantee you'd be
king of the hill.

790
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:28,625
But you could never
come back to the mountain.

791
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:32,262
Not here in New York,
Chicago, or L.A.

792
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:34,982
Someone'll know someone,

793
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:38,018
and it'll all be for nothing.

794
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:41,638
I can't do that,
and you know it.

795
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,323
I do know it.

796
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:46,694
Mike, you're in
the major leagues,

797
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:49,479
and you get to go toe-to-toe
with the best there is.

798
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:53,333
And I can't tell you
if that's enough for a lifetime,

799
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:56,754
but if you want to stay,
there's nothing more you can do.

800
00:32:56,821 --> 00:33:00,424
My advice is hold on tight
and enjoy the ride.

801
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:14,105
What are you doing here?

802
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:15,473
I'm here to help you.

803
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:17,391
You said there was no way
to stop what you did.

804
00:33:17,476 --> 00:33:20,645
This isn't a legal solution.
It's a business solution.

805
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:23,531
One where everybody wins.
Everybody wins?

806
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:24,782
That's what you said
about Beck.

807
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,200
So you want me
to spin off my own company,

808
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:27,201
I run it, he owns it?

809
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:29,853
I never said that.

810
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:31,405
Well, he didn't
go for it with Beck.

811
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,291
Why would he go for it
with me?

812
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:37,411
Because he doesn't give
a shit about William Beck.

813
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:40,498
What are you saying?

814
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,383
You develop your algorithm
every day.

815
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,384
Of course.

816
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:44,535
It's useless if I don't.

817
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:45,720
Right, but that's not
why you do it.

818
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:46,804
You do it because you love it.

819
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:48,389
Well, he can
force me to stay,

820
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,141
but he can't force me
to love it.

821
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,542
And that's exactly
where your leverage is.

822
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:55,313
If you don't love what you do,
it costs him a fortune.

823
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,264
And he knows it.

824
00:33:57,349 --> 00:33:59,233
This isn't a sure thing.

825
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:00,318
Which is why
I'm trusting he won't know

826
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:02,103
it came from me
if it doesn't work.

827
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:05,439
Why are you doing this?

828
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:09,860
Let's just say
I love my job...

829
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:12,896
but I know what it feels like
to be trapped.

830
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,038
Donna said
you wanted to see me

831
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:23,341
about some more
managerial bullshit.

832
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:24,742
What?

833
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,627
Don't you think I learned
my lesson with the checks?

834
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:30,247
- Then why am I here?
- You're here to listen to me.

835
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,850
Do you know
what this is about?

836
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,085
Yes.
And I already told you--

837
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:37,888
I am not here to ask you
to honor Louis' contract.

838
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:41,308
I am here to ask you
to make a new one with me.

839
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,526
Our contract with you

840
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:43,861
is a promise of a job
when you get out,

841
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:46,063
not paying for you
on your way in.

842
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:47,948
I have a list here
of the signing bonuses

843
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:51,485
of the top three associates
who have come into this firm.

844
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,937
Give me an advance on mine.

845
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,956
The last time we negotiated,
you said,

846
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,626
"never sign something without
getting something in return."

847
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,578
What you're getting
in return

848
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:03,164
is that I keep working here
part-time.

849
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:06,617
The advance, plus my salary,
will cover my tuition.

850
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:09,086
Paralegals
don't make that much.

851
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:10,471
Those numbers don't add up.

852
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:12,339
I'm not proposing
being a paralegal.

853
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:14,759
Summer associates
work as lawyers,

854
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,126
and I can do the same.

855
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:19,129
You came up with that
pretty fast.

856
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:20,731
It's almost
as if you wanted me

857
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,483
to ask you
what I get in return.

858
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:25,019
- Do we have a deal?
- One problem.

859
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:28,105
You already asked me
to break precedent once

860
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:30,741
when I waived
the Harvard rule.

861
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:33,143
I'm not breaking it again
to pay for law school.

862
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:35,663
I'm not asking you
to break anything.

863
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:40,367
You already established
precedence, with him.

864
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:43,454
When you paid
for his law school.

865
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:45,155
That is not
common knowledge.

866
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,675
No, it's not.

867
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:49,543
That's why
she wanted me here.

868
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:51,429
I'm exhibit A.

869
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:52,630
You made an investment
in Harvey,

870
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:55,182
and I think
that turned out pretty well.

871
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,601
I could argue that point.

872
00:35:57,669 --> 00:36:01,188
No, Rachel's right.
I'm pretty awesome.

873
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:03,006
I assume you have this
in writing.

874
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:04,942
I wouldn't be worth it
if I didn't.

875
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:08,195
Let me guess.
He went for it.

876
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,848
He did.

877
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,654
You want me to set up
your new corporation?

878
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:19,523
I want you to join
my new corporation.

879
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:22,710
It's an offer letter.

880
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,161
I don't understand.

881
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:25,830
You said you know
what it's like to feel trapped.

882
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:27,498
Thought maybe
you'd like a way out.

883
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,867
- I also said I love what I do.
- Maybe.

884
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:33,036
But let me tell you
what I once told Louis Litt.

885
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:36,423
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.

886
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:38,425
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

887
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,263
Wait a second.

888
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:44,648
You're not asking me to be
your in-house counsel.

889
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,400
You kidding me?

890
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:48,819
Most people don't even know
what an algorithm is.

891
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:52,773
You used it to strong-arm me
and Tony Gianopolous.

892
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:54,608
You have a mind for this.

893
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:56,360
Jonathan...

894
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:59,747
You don't have
to answer right now.

895
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:01,499
Just think about this.

896
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:05,703
You're in
the minor leagues here.

897
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:09,924
I'm giving you a chance
to play in the majors.

898
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,312
I'm glad you came.

899
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:34,431
I hope you don't mind.

900
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,201
I thought you might like it.

901
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:42,606
- Sheila...
- It's just a gesture.

902
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:44,608
It's a beautiful gesture.

903
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:46,877
You're so...

904
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:49,112
You're everything.

905
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:51,298
Oh, no,
is this where you tell me

906
00:37:51,383 --> 00:37:55,920
that you're not gonna
move to Boston?

907
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,505
Not everybody sees me
the way you do.

908
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,960
Most people take a very,
very long time to figure me out.

909
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:06,897
It's taken me years and years
to get the people here to see

910
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:10,734
past my short temper
and my...

911
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:12,570
Weird obsessions.

912
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,238
Your love of mudding
is not weird.

913
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,658
Well, you see, I know that.

914
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:20,694
You know who else knows that?

915
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:21,812
Donna,

916
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:25,199
Jessica, Mike, Rachel,
and Harvey.

917
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:29,152
They appreciate me.

918
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:30,337
They're my family.

919
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:32,172
I'm asking you...

920
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:34,842
Please don't make me
leave my family.

921
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:40,163
I'll move to New York.

922
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,270
Yeah.

923
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:49,273
- You won't regret this.
- I know I won't.

924
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,675
I promise I'm gonna
give you the best life.

925
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:53,644
We're gonna be
a New York power couple.

926
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,178
Law by day,
love by night.

927
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,281
And when we have kids,
world, watch out.

928
00:38:57,348 --> 00:39:00,567
Sazs-Litts,
they're gonna be ridiculous.

929
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:01,869
Wait, what?

930
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,954
I mean, let's face it.
Our kids?

931
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:06,523
They hit the genetic lottery.

932
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:08,826
Louis, I don't want kids.

933
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,878
What?

934
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,796
They don't get me.

935
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:16,033
What? I mean, what--
what are you talking about?

936
00:39:16,084 --> 00:39:17,718
I don't like kids.

937
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:21,171
I like when they're 22
and going to law school,

938
00:39:21,222 --> 00:39:22,256
but I just...

939
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,341
Those would be adults.

940
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:27,645
Exactly.

941
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:30,431
No, no, no.

942
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:35,486
You may think that now,
but when it actually happens,

943
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:38,822
when--when they're yours,
it's so--

944
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,392
Louis, I'm never
gonna think that, ever.

945
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:47,397
- How can you--
- How can I what?

946
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,950
It's who I am.

947
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:54,755
Sheila,
I'm gonna be a father.

948
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,907
Louis, we're so happy.

949
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,242
We can be happy.

950
00:39:59,294 --> 00:40:01,411
Just us.

951
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:08,686
I was willing to give up
Harvard for you.

952
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,525
You can't give up
something for me?

953
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:45,866
Well?

954
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:16,230
Call her.

955
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:19,233
Call her and apologize.

956
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:24,258
