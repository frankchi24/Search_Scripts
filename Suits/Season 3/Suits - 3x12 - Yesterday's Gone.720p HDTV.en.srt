1
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:03,380
I got up early,
so I could figure out

2
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:07,184
if there's anything around here
that I could stand living with.

3
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:09,403
- You want to move in together?
- If the offer still stands.

4
00:00:09,437 --> 00:00:11,021
Are you kidding me?

5
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:14,741
You slept with Quentin
while he was married to me.

6
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:16,393
I asked you back then

7
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,163
if anything had started
before we were separated.

8
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:20,414
You said it hadn't.

9
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:21,728
'Cause I didn't want
to hurt you.

10
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:24,234
Here's
to your new partnership.

11
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,669
I fronted your buy-in.

12
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:27,171
How could you do that?

13
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:29,289
I did it
as a romantic gesture.

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,457
Yeah, well,<i>Pretty Woman</i>
may have been a romantic movie,

15
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:31,959
but Julia Roberts
was still a hooker.

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,710
How long have you known
Quentin had A.L.S.?

17
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:34,962
From the beginning.

18
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:36,773
And how long have you known
Quentin falsified

19
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:39,016
trial results to get
the drug on the market?

20
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,601
- He didn't lie.
- But you did.

21
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:42,719
I love him.
So what else could I do?

22
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:44,721
I am in this, Scottie.

23
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:47,107
Okay.

24
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,609
So am I.

25
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,227
I think Mike Ross
went to a subpar law school

26
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,728
and has been lying about it
the whole time.

27
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:53,030
Just call up Harvard
and ask for a copy

28
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:54,314
of his transcript.

29
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:56,066
Professor Gerard's
legal ethics class,

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,901
did you ever hear of anybody
ever getting an A-plus?

31
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:59,987
No, he's famous for never
giving higher than an "A."

32
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:18,589
Well, what are you
so happy about?

33
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:19,623
I made bubble-wrap slippers
this morning

34
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,642
while you were in the shower.

35
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:23,010
I specifically told you
the bubble wrap

36
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:24,478
is for the dishes.

37
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:25,729
I also made a hat.

38
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:26,963
Okay, I'm moving in
with a ten-year-old.

39
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:28,465
And you love me.

40
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:29,850
I do.

41
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:30,934
Hey, I was thinking,

42
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:31,935
what are we going to do
about our bed?

43
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,020
We already have two.

44
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:34,488
I know,
but, yeah, we do.

45
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:37,241
But don't you think a new
beginning deserves a new bed?

46
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:42,279
That...is incredibly sweet.

47
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:44,781
Yeah, not bad
for a ten-year-old, huh?

48
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:46,333
What kind of bed
were you thinking?

49
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,670
Whichever one we pick out
after we test them tonight.

50
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:52,873
And did you have
any particular test in mind?

51
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,324
Well, now I do.

52
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:55,325
See, I don't think
the store is

53
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:56,593
gonna let us run
that kind of test.

54
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,011
Yeah.
No, you're right.

55
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:00,130
We should probably just test
ours before we go out tonight.

56
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:03,166
Oh.

57
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:04,935
What are you doing?

58
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,437
I think that Louis
might have just seen us.

59
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:08,689
Come on,
what's the difference?

60
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,057
We're moving in together.

61
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:11,608
I think it's time
we stopped keeping it a secret.

62
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:13,977
But keeping it a secret
is sort of fun.

63
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,063
- Mm-hmm.
- And sexy.

64
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,364
And I am pro sexy--
I mean, I did make

65
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,366
those bubble-wrap slippers
and hat after all,

66
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,034
which is funny, 'cause...

67
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,153
That's not sexy,
it's just fun.

68
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:25,989
- It's something.
- Something.

69
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,358
- Something.
- I made you some too.

70
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,752
Hey, Harvey, she won't be back
for another week,

71
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,370
so I don't think you need
to start drinking just yet.

72
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:41,672
You want to make fun,
or you want to help me

73
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:43,590
figure out
where to put this?

74
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,925
A bottle of scotch?

75
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,843
You couldn't get her
anything more personal?

76
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:49,096
- She likes scotch.
- <i>You</i> like scotch.

77
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:50,480
She likes me.
Therefore...

78
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,149
Why don't you just attach
a card that says,

79
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,551
"Welcome,
generic senior partner"?

80
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,903
This is a $12,000 bottle
of scotch,

81
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:59,389
and this is one of three
left in the world.

82
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,224
That doesn't say generic,
that says--

83
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:02,743
You're one
of three very expensive things

84
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:03,910
I recently purchased.

85
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:05,895
We worked it out
about the buy-in.

86
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:06,997
And this is gonna
un-work it out.

87
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,248
You know, it's funny.

88
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:10,400
First it was too generic.
Now it's special.

89
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:11,835
What are you saying?

90
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,203
I don't think you have a
problem with my choice of gift.

91
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,756
I think you have a problem
with my choice of recipient.

92
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,741
Do you think Scottie
would even be here

93
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,742
if it wasn't for me?

94
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,211
No, I don't.

95
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,796
Harvey, I want this for you.

96
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:26,266
I want it to work,
and I'm just trying to--

97
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,584
Make sure
I don't screw it up.

98
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:29,219
Well, we both know
you're gonna screw it up.

99
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:32,139
I'm just trying to delay that
as long as possible.

100
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,425
You sure about this?

101
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:37,561
That bottle is the reason
I buy my own present

102
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:38,945
for secretary's day.

103
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,697
- There's a secretary's day?
- There is.

104
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:43,033
And you're very generous.

105
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:50,073
How you doing, Mike?

106
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:53,410
Are you excited or what?

107
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:55,328
Excited about what?

108
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,613
Didn't you get my email?

109
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:58,165
Oh, there it is.

110
00:03:58,216 --> 00:03:59,416
Why don't you read it?

111
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,550
Oh, actually, you know what,
never mind.

112
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:02,118
I'll just let you know
what it says.

113
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:03,336
It's so great.

114
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,222
You're gonna love it.

115
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:10,177
It says
I invited Henry Gerard here

116
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,895
to give a lecture
this Friday.

117
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,730
That's great.

118
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:17,651
You don't even know
who he is, do you?

119
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:19,436
Professor Henry Gerard,

120
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,822
author of the definitive text
in legal ethics

121
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:24,191
and chair of the department
for the last 20 years.

122
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:25,809
Yeah, I know who he is.

123
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:29,529
And do you also remember
what you got in his class?

124
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,781
It's pretty hard to forget
an A-plus.

125
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:32,315
Yeah, it's pretty hard
to forget a grade

126
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,584
that never happened.

127
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:39,172
No one gets an A-plus
in Gerard's class.

128
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,178
Yeah, well, no one can recite
an entire chapter

129
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:46,263
of his book from memory.

130
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:48,765
But I can and did.
Bullshit-.

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,184
You never got an A-plus because
you never took his class.

132
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:53,854
It's a required class, Louis.
Of course I took it.

133
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:54,971
Not if you never went
to Harvard.

134
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,005
Louis, that is insane.

135
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:57,390
I have a transcript
from Harvard.

136
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,142
I have a degree from Harvard.
That's because I--

137
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:04,064
Wait, let me guess.
'Cause you went to Harvard?

138
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:07,701
See, Mike,
here's the situation.

139
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:10,570
I don't believe you.

140
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,989
And I don't want to call
Gerard up and ask him

141
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,859
'cause I don't want
the world laughing at my firm.

142
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:17,694
But if he doesn't walk up
to you on Friday

143
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:21,030
and say, "Mike Ross,
my beloved student

144
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,133
"who I remember,
because he's the only one

145
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,634
I ever gave an A-plus to,"

146
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,671
well, then, I'm gonna know
you're lying.

147
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:28,722
And if you still
don't come clean,

148
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,557
I'm gonna launch
a formal investigation,

149
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,709
whether it makes my firm
look bad or not.

150
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,878
This is crazy.
There is nothing to investigate.

151
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:37,731
Well, I'd rather risk looking
crazy to root out an impostor

152
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:40,350
than to risk letting
that impostor poison everything

153
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:42,719
that I stand for.

154
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:45,405
It's over, Mike.

155
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,741
I'm on to you,

156
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:49,326
and I'm gonna expose you

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,363
for the lying piece of filth
that you are.

158
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:56,283
Don't forget to rinse
your mouth out

159

170
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:44,550
Do you remember when you said
if Louis knew, we'd know?

171
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,001
He knows.

172
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,019
What did he do?

173
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,520
He's bringing
in Henry Gerard

174
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,189
to give a lecture.
So what?

175
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,224
It'll only be the first time
you've had to suffer through it.

176
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,776
He's bringing him in
because he saw

177
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,144
I got an A-plus
in his class.

178
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:57,512
What? No one gets an A-plus
in Gerard's class.

179
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,865
- Welcome to the problem.
- God damn it.

180
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,183
Donna, get in here.

181
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,534
Why are you calling Donna?

182
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,853
Because she's the one
who found out that Louis knows

183
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,121
you don't have a file
in the Harvard file room.

184
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:07,122
How do you know that?

185
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:08,457
Because Louis's new girlfriend

186
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:09,625
is the queen
of that file room,

187
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:10,909
and she left him alone
in there.

188
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,544
You guys didn't think
to mention this?

189
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,046
I thought I handled it.

190
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,214
She did handle it.

191
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,082
She sent him to sniff out
your transcript.

192
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,751
Only she didn't realize
you gave yourself

193
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:20,219
an A-plus in legal ethics.

194
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,004
I didn't give it to myself.
Lola Jensen did.

195
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,505
I don't give a shit
who gave it to you,

196
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:26,058
unless it was Professor Gerard,
which it wasn't.

197
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,426
How many people take
the class?

198
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,395
I mean, maybe Mike will just be
another face in the crowd.

199
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,545
Louis is bringing him here

200
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,264
to see if he embraces
his star student.

201
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,883
The worst thing I can do is just
be another face in the crowd.

202
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,069
We need to make it
so that he doesn't come.

203
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,270
It's not gonna happen.

204
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,155
The man doesn't back out
of commitments.

205
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,908
His favorite quote is
"for the law to work,

206
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,994
there must be honor
in one's word."

207
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:46,528
- Who's he quoting?
- Himself.

208
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:47,663
Pompous prick.

209
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:49,498
Guy never practiced a day
in his life,

210
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:51,583
thinks he can write the book
on real-world ethics.

211
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,285
Okay.

212
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:55,788
I'm not panicking,
but what are we gonna do?

213
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,923
Right now,
you're gonna sit tight.

214
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,174
And what are you going to do?

215
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,961
I think it's time
to tell Jessica.

216
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:05,431
We need to talk.

217
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,582
- We do.
- You know?

218
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,387
No, but whatever it is,
it can wait.

219
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,639
This isn't something
that can wait.

220
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,144
Quentin died.

221
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:21,313
I'm sorry.

222
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:28,287
I knew A.L.S.
wasn't gonna be a picnic.

223
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:33,992
And I knew this was coming,
but it doesn't--

224
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:39,465
Look, if you need some time,
I can manage things here.

225
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:43,218
The truth is, Harvey,
I'd take it.

226
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:46,288
But Lisa's on her way in

227
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:49,508
to discuss Quentin's will
with us.

228
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,893
Us?

229
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:56,348
Quentin named you and I
co-executors of his estate.

230
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,966
You're her husband's ex-wife.

231
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,985
I doubt Lisa sees this
as just business.

232
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,353
No, I can't imagine
she does.

233
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,440
Can you see this
as just business?

234
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:05,858
You don't like her,

235
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,028
you don't trust her, and you
have good reason for both.

236
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,081
Quentin asked me
to do this.

237
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:18,787
Maybe he gave you
a co-executor for a reason.

238
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,672
You're saying
he was giving me an out?

239
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,624
No, I'm just saying
that I'm here,

240
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:25,260
and you don't have
to do this.

241
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,265
Harvey, he asked me,

242
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,518
and I'm not going
to let him down.

243
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,675
Mike, you can't just wait
for the ax to fall.

244
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,812
I didn't just wait.
I armed myself.

245
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:47,483
I learned everything there is to
know about Gerard and his class.

246
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:49,034
Harvey is right.
This guy is a prick.

247
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,185
He makes everybody read
his books

248
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:51,453
and then doesn't even test
on them.

249
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:52,905
Okay, but arming yourself
isn't enough.

250
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,573
We need
to actually do something.

251
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:57,326
Harvey told me
to sit tight.

252
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,044
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

253
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:02,197
Right, that's because
Harvey's life isn't on the line.

254
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,967
Ours is.

255
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,388
Ours?

256
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:12,508
Mike, I am not moving in
with you

257
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:16,061
because I need
a new place to live.

258
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,597
Okay, so what do you think
we should do?

259
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:21,150
What's gonna make him believe
that you went to Harvard?

260
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,901
Well, if my transcript,
diploma,

261
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,987
and the job you can only get
by having attended Harvard

262
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,822
aren't enough,
I'm not really sure what is.

263
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:28,657
Well, there's got to be
something you can say.

264
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,725
Look, Rachel,
you know Louis.

265
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:31,743
The more I try and deny it,

266
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,613
the more
he's gonna come after me.

267
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:36,248
I can't believe this.

268
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,749
He is not gonna be happy
until he has

269
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:40,919
a signed full confession
proving he was right.

270
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:46,875
You're right.

271
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:50,512
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna give him.

272
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:51,930
Come on.

273
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:53,348
It's all
fairly straightforward.

274
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:55,017
The company
shouldn't be affected.

275
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:57,219
Tim can continue
with the day-to-day

276
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,254
while this works
its way through probate.

277
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:03,358
Well, the day-to-day's
going to change.

278
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:06,028
- How so?
- We have an offer from Pryzen.

279
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:07,362
You want to sell
the company?

280
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:11,149
I want to accept an offer.

281
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:13,569
Well, that was fast.

282
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:14,953
Excuse me?

283
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:16,488
What Jessica is saying is

284
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,790
Pryzen didn't waste
any time swooping in.

285
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,993
No, what I'm saying is,

286
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,277
before we authorize anything,

287
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,496
we need to evaluate
if this is even a good idea.

288
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:25,998
I don't see why.

289
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:28,050
Our general counsel thinks
it's a good idea, and I agree.

290
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:31,620
And I'm the one who's inheriting
the majority of the company,

291
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:33,589
so it's my decision.
Actually, it isn't.

292
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:34,923
What are you talking about?

293
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:38,010
My job is to see that
Quentin's wishes are fulfilled.

294
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,678
Are you implying
that you know his wishes

295
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,346
better than I do?

296
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:42,797
I'm implying
he's not dead a week,

297
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,733
and you want to strip his name
off the door and into oblivion.

298
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,801
What I want to do
is put the drug

299
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,237
that he dedicated
his life to

300
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:51,657
in the hands of a company
with the resources to finish it.

301
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:54,693
And I was there when he worked
for companies like this.

302
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,829
And he hated them, which is why
he went out on his own.

303
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,197
You were there?

304
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:02,251
Well, that's not how I heard
the story.

305
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:05,871
All right,
we're not doing this.

306
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:08,156
You want to sell your shares?
No one's saying you can't.

307
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:12,010
But we have a responsibility
to evaluate it.

308
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,846
Remember when you said
you'd try to be conciliatory?

309
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:16,214
I never said that.

310
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,600
Well, you should have,
'cause you sure couldn't

311
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,185
keep the personal out of it.

312
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:21,353
I didn't think
they were gonna come at me

313
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:22,354
with all that stuff.

314
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:23,505
They weren't coming at you.

315
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,107
They were coming
with a proposal.

316
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:29,778
Do you really think
that offer came out of thin air?

317
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:31,563
I think it's possible
they waited to pounce.

318
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:32,847
It's also possible

319
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,900
that Lisa and Tim
put this in motion

320
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:36,985
while Quentin was lying
in his hospital bed.

321
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,871
And what if they did?
Is that really our business?

322
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,658
Jessica, I understand
how hard this is for you,

323
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,826
but his legacy is this drug.

324
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,079
It's not about whose name
is on the company that makes it.

325
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,197
You're saying
you agree with Lisa.

326
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:51,583
I'm saying to you now
what I tried to tell you before.

327
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:54,920
This is personal for you.
It's not personal for me.

328
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:58,924
So before we take another step,
let me evaluate this offer.

329
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:04,546
You're right.

330
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:07,849
I lied to you.

331
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,985
I lied to everyone.

332
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,069
I cheated to get here,

333
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,554
and if you put me in front
of Henry Gerard,

334
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:13,905
he's not gonna
remember me.

335
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,223
'Cause you never took
his class.

336
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,441
Because I never went
to his class.

337
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:17,526
'Cause you never went
to Harvard.

338
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,944
- That's not true.
- Bullshit.

339
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,529
Louis, please, look, I know
you have every right to be angry

340
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:21,663
with me.
I'm not angry.

341
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,898
Angry is just a flash
in the pan.

342
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,500
My outrage is here to stay,

343
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,953
and I will obliterate any
infection threatening my firm.

344
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:29,588
I'm not the infection
you think I am.

345
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:33,291
The only thing that's bullshit
is that A -plus!

346
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:40,349
What?

347
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:41,416
Louis, I went to Harvard.

348
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,969
I...

349
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,388
I just changed my grade.

350
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:48,890
You expect me
to believe that?

351
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,142
I have always been
the smartest kid

352
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:51,943
at every school
that I went to.

353
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,980
High school, college,
the first two years of Harvard,

354
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,314
I'd get "A"s
without studying.

355
00:13:56,366 --> 00:14:00,485
I'd ace every test
without going to class, but--

356
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:01,570
but that third year...

357
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,121
You had to take Gerard.

358
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:04,239
I could memorize his books,

359
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,657
but his tests weren't
about his books.

360
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,609
Yeah,
they're about his lectures.

361
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,995
The final exam--
I failed it.

362
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:11,713
I went to his office to beg
for a second chance.

363
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:12,781
He doesn't give
second chances.

364
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,584
- I had to try.
- He wouldn't do it.

365
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:17,753
He wasn't there.

366
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,621
I got to his office.
It was empty.

367
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,972
His computer was
just sitting there,

368
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,424
logged in
to the main system.

369
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,892
He was about to submit
his grades.

370
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:27,012
I only had a few seconds
before he came back, so...

371
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,765
I decided to save myself.

372
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,467
No, you decided
to give yourself an A-plus.

373
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:35,020
No, Louis.

374
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:37,138
You might not be able
to believe me

375
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:40,475
about anything else
ever again.

376
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:44,112
Believe this.

377
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:46,948
You have no idea how much
I wish I could do it over again,

378
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:49,668
because this time,
I would do it right.

379
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:52,704
I would go to every class, and I
would attend every lecture,

380
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:55,657
and I would feast
on what that place has to offer

381
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:57,592
like no one ever has.

382
00:14:57,627 --> 00:14:59,267
But you didn't do it right
the first time.

383
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,512
You cheated,
and now you're looking at me

384
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:01,847
to help you get away with it.
No, Louis-

385
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:03,665
Get out of my sight.

386
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:09,482
What a surprise.

387
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,640
Louis, please,
I just want to--

388
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:13,525
I know what you want to do--
you want to lobby me

389
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:14,910
on behalf of someone
who had the audacity--

390
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:17,646
I love him.

391
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:19,031
What?

392
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:20,582
We're moving in together,
and we're starting

393
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,834
a life together.
Rachel-

394
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:25,254
and I'm telling you this
because I know what he did

395
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:28,390
and I still love him.

396
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,559
Okay, here's the problem.

397
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,194
I don't.

398
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,429
- Louis.
- Rachel...

399
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:36,331
I respect you.

400
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,883
I care about you.

401
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:40,202
But this isn't about you.

402
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:43,438
This is about Mike
and what he did to me.

403
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:46,775
You know,

404
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,843
he came to me the night
that you asked him

405
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,729
to be your associate.

406
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,147
I told him to go with you.

407
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:53,815
Why?

408
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:54,866
Because he said he had
a connection with you

409
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,318
that he's never had
with Harvey.

410
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:57,703
- He said that?
- Yes.

411
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,871
Your shared love of the law.

412
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,873
- Yeah, I told him that.
- I know.

413
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:03,575
And I have
the same connection with you.

414
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:06,161
Rachel, you're asking me to--

415
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,196
Louis, he didn't do this
to you.

416
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,894
He did it so that
he can practice the thing

417
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,199
that we all love.

418
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:14,720
And if you don't let it go,

419
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:19,174
he's never gonna be able
to practice it again.

420
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,183
Thank you for coming alone.

421
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:31,103
I'm happy to help,
but Jessica and I are a team,

422
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,405
and asking to see me alone
doesn't change that.

423
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm not gonna cut her out
of the process.

424
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:37,492
Isn't that what
she's doing to me?

425
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:41,830
She's trying to kill
the sale.

426
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:43,248
That's not
what this letter says.

427
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:44,783
I'm not a lawyer,
but I'm not stupid.

428
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,569
It says all communication
goes through Pearson Specter.

429
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,838
- This doesn't kill the deal.
- It tells them that

430
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:52,073
they've been negotiating with
people with no power at all.

431
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:53,375
No, it tells them
they have

432
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,711
to negotiate with two entities
instead of just one.

433
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:58,964
It gives us more firepower.

434
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:00,682
What do you want, Lisa?

435
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,801
I want to know why your
signature isn't on that letter.

436
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,102
Because we came
to a consensus,

437
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,221
and she signed it
on both our behalves.

438
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:08,089
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

439
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,975
And if you can't handle us
notifying the buyer

440
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:11,360
that we're evaluating
this sale,

441
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:12,527
then it makes me question

442
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,146
whose judgment is
really clouded.

443
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,731
Now, if you'll excuse me,

444
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,949
I'm done meeting
behind my partner's back.

445
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:22,204
What the hell happened
to letting me

446
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,488
evaluate this offer?

447
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,440
I am letting you
evaluate the offer.

448
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,409
You sent this letter
to kill the deal.

449
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:29,578
I sent that letter
to buy you time.

450
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:30,796
Jessica, you put my name

451
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,881
on a document you knew
I wouldn't support.

452
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:36,385
You are on Lisa's side.
You want to sell.

453
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,004
This isn't about Lisa,
and I don't give a shit

454
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:40,505
whether this company
is sold or not.

455
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:43,341
This is about you and me and how
we're going to run this firm.

456
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:44,676
Didn't we just have
a conversation about that?

457
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:45,761
Yeah, we sure did.

458
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:46,928
And when it had to do
with Scottie,

459
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,980
you gave me a big speech
about trust,

460
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,899
about how I had to trust
you had rational reasons

461
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:51,900
for what you were doing.

462
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,985
- This is different.
- Exactly.

463
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,737
This time
it's not personal for me.

464
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:56,971
It's personal for you.

465
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,356
And you're not playing
by your own rules.

466
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,275
This deal is wrong,
Harvey.

467
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:02,644
And like it or not,
I'm still the managing partner.

468
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:03,829
Not on this.

469
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:05,580
On this,
you're a co-executor,

470
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:06,748
and you're not putting
my name on any more letters.

471
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:09,317
So I suggest you get
your head on straight

472
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:10,702
and look at this deal
rationally.

473
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,204
And if you can't do that,

474
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:15,791
I suggest you step aside.

475
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:18,043
Jessica, you loved him.

476
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:21,096
I know you're hurting.
So is she.

477
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,015
Whatever your history
with her,

478
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,967
so is she.

479
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:40,565
You're here late.

480
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,317
The life of an associate,
right?

481
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:45,403
Ah, yeah, I remember.

482
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:47,706
I used to live in this room,

483
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,541
work piled all around me,

484
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:52,711
surviving on coffee,
delivery,

485
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,497
and no sleep.

486
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,798
And the whole time,
wondering,

487
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,801
"man, is it ever gonna get
any easier?"

488
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:01,870
- Does it?
- No.

489
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:04,639
But you still love it.

490
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:07,175
And so do you.

491
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,376
Or else you'd be home
with the woman

492
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:13,565
who loves you,
not spending your night here.

493
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,818
- You know.
- She came to see me.

494
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,052
I didn't think
I could forgive you.

495
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,222
But then somehow,
she...

496
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,574
Made me realize I could.

497
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,229
Louis, I don't know
how to thank you.

498
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,231
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't thank me yet.

499
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,033
I'm not the one
you did this to.

500
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,335
What are you saying?

501
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,420
I'm saying you did this
to Henry Gerard.

502
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:37,339
And it's not my place
to let it go for him,

503
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:38,507
which is why you're gonna have
to come clean to him.

504
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,591
You said it yourself.

505
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,126
Gerard doesn't give
second chances.

506
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:44,296
What he does or doesn't do
is up to him.

507
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:47,549
That's his right, Mike,
as the person that you wronged.

508
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,917
Yeah, but he doesn't have
to know that I wronged him.

509
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:50,418
Listen to me.

510
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:53,188
You said that if you had it
to do over, you'd do it right.

511
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:55,757
I'm giving you that chance.

512
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,192
Take it,

513
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:00,228
or I'm gonna have to take it
for you.

514
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,061
What are you here
to do now,

515
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,864
take my house away from me?

516
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,316
I'm here to talk.

517
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,100
Well, the last time we talked,
you pretty much said

518
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,039
I don't care about my husband
enough to honor his wishes.

519
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,158
The last time we talked,

520
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,627
I was an asshole.

521
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,628
Pardon my French.

522
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,714
I don't mind your French.

523
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,950
It's come to my attention
that I may have let

524
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:56,287
our history affect
how I'm handling this situation.

525
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:57,455
It's funny.

526
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,791
Harvey brought that same thing
to my attention.

527
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,960
So...

528
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:03,979
Tell me this.

529
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,900
Why do you want to sell?

530
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,470
Do you know why I lied
about those A.L.S. trials?

531
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,774
Because I was desperate
for the research to continue.

532
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:19,077
But it didn't matter.

533
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,829
Lisa.

534
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,747
He wasn't supposed to die.

535
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,917
He wasn't supposed to live
as long as he did.

536
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,702
We weren't trying
to prolong his life.

537
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,656
We were trying
to find a cure.

538
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:34,325
And we failed.

539
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:36,511
You never cared
about the money.

540
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,798
The only money
I cared about is

541
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,934
the money to find the cure,
and we don't have the resources.

542
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,019
Pryzen does.

543
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,720
But they already
have an A.L.S. drug.

544
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,607
- It's not as good as ours.
- In profit margin, it's better.

545
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,442
Which means there's nothing
to stop them

546
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,562
from buying your company,
burying your drug,

547
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,564
and making a fortune.

548
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,065
What are you saying?

549
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,234
I'm saying
you didn't fail him,

550
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,903
but I know how it feels
to think that you did.

551
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,207
And I have a way to make sure
that neither one of us

552
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,492
feels that way again.

553
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,527
So your great plan
backfired.

554
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:11,195
Harvey, I'm sorry.

555
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,297
I don't need you to say
I'm sorry.

556
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,665
But the next time
I tell you to sit tight,

557
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,417
I need you to say you will.
Okay.

558
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,468
Good, because the next time

559
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,420
I tell you to sit tight
is right now.

560
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,754
Wait, what are you gonna do?

561
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,223
I'm getting on a plane
to Boston.

562
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,674
And doing what?

563
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,059
I'll let you know
when I get back.

564
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,144
Why are you going to Boston?

565
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,430
I have to see Marcus.
He's in trouble.

566
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,315
Anything I can do?

567
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,567
No, I'll handle it myself.

568
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,986
Since you're leaving,
I'm going to need you to draft

569
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,771
some language for the Sainz
pharmaceutical sale.

570
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,573
So you're in favor
of it now?

571
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,191
Well, not exactly.

572
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,110
But I heard what you said,
and I went to see Lisa.

573
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,361
She and I
are on the same page.

574
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,665
Do you have time to hear
what the plan is?

575
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,451
I trust you.

576
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,587
So what do you need me
to draft?

577
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,372
I need you to draft
a provision that guarantees

578
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,374
Pryzen will finish developing
that drug.

579
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,676
Consider it done.

580
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,595
He's not seeing his brother,
is he?

581
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,715
No, he's not.

582
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,084
- Care to elaborate on that?
- Not particularly.

583
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:08,887
You're saying
I should trust him.

584
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,723
I'm saying I do.

585
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,897
I'd ask how you're holding up,
but I can see the answer.

586
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:21,983
Not well.

587
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,868
I can only imagine
what these last couple of days

588
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,120
have been like for you.

589
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,938
But I'm telling you,
it's gonna be okay.

590
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:28,823
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

591
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,209
- But what if it's not?
- Well, then we're screwed.

592
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,128
But that's not gonna happen.

593
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,779
Look, Donna.

594
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:38,249
I am trying so hard
to be brave.

595
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,784
But what if Louis ends up
finding out

596
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:42,637
everything about Mike?

597
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,639
What if he ends up exposing him
and he actually gets arrested?

598
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:48,643
What if he actually--

599
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:49,761
God.

600
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:50,795
Rach,

601
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:52,333
Mike found out
that one of our partners

602
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,982
ordered multiple murders.

603
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,318
Harvey said he'd fix it.

604
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,469
Two days later,
that partner was in prison.

605
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:01,139
Stephen was a criminal.
This is an academic.

606
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:02,907
He hasn't done
anything wrong.

607
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,693
Well, what makes Harvey great
at his job is he knows

608
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,828
that everybody
has done something wrong.

609
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,832
Even the most esteemed
ethics professor in the country?

610
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,117
The cleaner they look,

611
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,452
the more dirt
they've swept under the rug.

612
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,588
I'm telling you,
Harvey's gonna walk in there,

613
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,956
he's gonna find the lump,

614
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,759
and Henry Gerard is not
gonna know what hit him.

615
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,462
Wednesday nights,
8:00 to 10:00,

616
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,330
it's like clockwork.

617
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:28,350
Consistency is nothing
to be feared.

618
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,502
I wasn't afraid of it.
I was counting on it.

619
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,521
Mr. Specter.

620
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,023
Professor Gerard.

621
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,308
Looks the same
as the last time I was here.

622
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,527
Can't say you look the same
as the last time you were here.

623
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,845
Yes, you can.

624
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,515
I see
you're as humble as ever.

625
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,701
We'll see who's humble
in a few minutes.

626
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,069
And for the record,

627
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,038
you were wrong
about how I'd turn out.

628
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,539
I know how you turned out.

629
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,709
More settlements than
any other lawyer in New York.

630
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,661
More closings than
any other lawyer in New York.

631
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,713
And settling is what it takes
to get the job done

632
00:24:58,748 --> 00:24:59,998
in the real world.

633
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,873
I know what it takes for you
to do what you do,

634
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:04,035
and compromising your way
through life

635
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:07,038
is no way to go
about the law.

636
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:10,508
I see
you're as pompous as ever.

637
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,844
What did you come here for,
Mr. Specter?

638
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,379
- I came to ask for a favor.
- The answer is no.

639
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:16,598
You don't even know
what it is.

640
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,066
I know you're the one
who's asking.

641
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,186
I figured you'd say that,
which is why I brought this.

642
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,390
I don't consider blackmail
a favor.

643
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,226
I doubt the trustees
will care about semantics

644
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:29,894
when they see that.

645
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:32,396
Well, I doubt the trustees
are gonna see anything at all.

646
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:34,332
Because that envelope is full
of blank paper

647
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,118
or your dry cleaning receipts.

648
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,587
You think I'm bluffing?

649
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,039
I know you are.

650
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,091
If you think that envelope
is meaningless.

651
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,486
Why don't you go ahead
and open it?

652
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,795
Your poker face
has gotten much better,

653
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:47,796
I'll give you that.

654
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,214
A lot of practice,
you know,

655
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:52,183
compromising my way
through life.

656
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,604
- You know.
- I know.

657
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,640
And you talk a big game,

658
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,275
but you're just as human
as everyone else,

659
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,694
you smug son of a bitch.

660
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,231
What's your favor?

661
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,950
Find a reason to cancel
your trip on Friday.

662
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,369
And if Louis Litt ever tries
to contact you after that,

663
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,937
don't take his call.

664
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:15,657
- Seems easy enough.
- It is.

665
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,910
Have a good night,
Professor Gerard.

666
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,330
Here's the problem,
Mr. Specter.

667
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,333
I don't only talk a big game.
I walk it.

668
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:29,921
And ethics is not about
never doing anything wrong.

669
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,224
It's about making choices.

670
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,178
And I'm not going to let you
make my choice for me.

671
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,983
So go do
whatever you're gonna do,

672
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,068
but I'm not canceling
my trip.

673
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:02,074
- You didn't get it done.
- How'd you know?

674
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:04,109
Because I know you would call
to tell me if it's okay.

675
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:06,412
And you didn't call,
so it's not okay.

676
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:08,631
Then why are you so calm?

677
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:09,632
Because you've taught me
enough to know

678
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,117
that it's going to be okay.

679
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:14,970
- It's not.
- What?

680
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:17,840
It's not gonna be okay.
I don't see what we're gonna do.

681
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,291
What do you mean you don't see
what we're gonna do?

682
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,476
You're Harvey Specter.

683
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,477
What's that
supposed to mean?

684
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:22,645
It means there's a gun

685
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:23,679
pointed at our heads.

686
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,964
There's 146 things
that we can do.

687
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,483
We just have to put our heads
together and figure it out.

688
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:28,817
What the hell do you think
I've been doing

689
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:30,019
all goddamn night?

690
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,237
Louis has us,
he's not gonna let it go,

691
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:33,939
and there's nothing
we can do to stop it.

692
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:35,357
- There has to be something.
- There isn't.

693
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:37,192
Well, I refuse
to believe that.

694
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:38,477
I don't give a shit
what you believe.

695
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:40,079
Get it through your head.
I'm not superman.

696
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:43,649
I failed,
and I don't know what to do.

697
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,868
Mike.

698
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:09,858
Tim, I thought
I was meeting with Lisa.

699
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:11,560
And I thought
you were above board.

700
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,028
I see you've read
our amendment.

701
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:15,364
You drafted a provision
that if they didn't spend

702
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:17,015
$100 million
finishing that drug,

703
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:19,034
they'd have to pay us
an extra $100 million.

704
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,869
I drafted a provision
to see

705
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:22,854
if they'd put their money
where their mouth is.

706
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:24,022
What you did was
what you always wanted to do--

707
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,324
tank this deal.

708
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:27,710
- They pulled the offer.
- They yanked the offer.

709
00:28:27,744 --> 00:28:30,245
Then the deal wasn't worth
anything to begin with.

710
00:28:30,296 --> 00:28:31,246
What wasn't worth anything

711
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:33,382
was the document
you had Quentin sign

712
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,300
making you executor
instead of me.

713
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:37,836
I didn't have Quentin
sign anything.

714
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,055
Well, maybe you didn't
have him sign it,

715
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,174
but I know
when he signed it,

716
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,559
and it's not gonna hold up.

717
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:45,594
It'll hold up just fine.

718
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:47,212
We'll see.

719
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,149
This is a subpoena.

720
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:54,019
So the next time
we have this conversation,

721
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:56,572
you'll be under oath.

722
00:29:06,065 --> 00:29:07,449
What exactly
is he claiming?

723
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,284
He's saying Quentin
wasn't competent

724
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:10,736
when he made me executor.

725
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:11,920
So let him say it.

726
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:14,039
I don't see
where there's a problem.

727
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:16,241
Yes, you do.

728
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,376
No, I don't.

729
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,511
Just get up on the stand
and testify that Tim

730
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:20,846
doesn't know
what he's talking about.

731
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,080
But he does.

732
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,766
Quentin knew
what he wanted.

733
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,917
They're not going
to ask me that.

734
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,020
They're going to ask me
about his condition.

735
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:30,639
I saw him, Lisa.

736
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,191
I know what he was like.

737
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:35,093
Quentin knew
what he wanted.

738
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:37,763
He was also medicated,
could barely speak,

739
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,898
and he was
in a lot of pain.

740
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:42,284
But you don't have
to say those things.

741
00:29:42,318 --> 00:29:45,287
I'm going to have to swear
to this under oath.

742
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:47,790
If making you executor
wasn't legally valid,

743
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:49,374
then why didn't you say so
when he did it?

744
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:51,210
Because I didn't think
it would be challenged.

745
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:53,462
And thinking something
might not hold up

746
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:54,817
and keeping that thought
to myself

747
00:29:54,831 --> 00:29:57,616
is not the same
as lying about it under oath.

748
00:29:57,634 --> 00:30:00,586
Well, those are
some fuzzy damn lines.

749
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,639
I didn't make them.
They came with the job.

750
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:07,459
You're gonna undo everything
he's ever worked for.

751
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:10,295
Maybe.

752
00:30:10,313 --> 00:30:12,964
But just because you and I
want the same thing

753
00:30:12,982 --> 00:30:15,517
doesn't mean that I'm willing
to perjure myself to get it.

754
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:20,489
Please.

755
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:23,075
You said you didn't want
to fail him again.

756
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,126
You didn't fail.

757
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:46,014
You don't need to make me
feel better.

758
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:47,099
I'm not trying
to make you feel better.

759
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:50,469
I'm just telling you
the truth.

760
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:54,106
You didn't fail because...

761
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,974
We were always playing
on borrowed time.

762
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:58,527
- Mike.
- Harvey.

763
00:30:58,561 --> 00:31:01,513
I wouldn't have
any of this without you.

764
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:06,401
I think it's time
I cut your exposure.

765
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:08,036
You don't have to do that.

766
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,072
It's all gonna come
crashing down anyway.

767
00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:12,407
I'm gonna go to Louis.

768
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,792
I'm going to resign,

769
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:16,194
and I'm gonna beg him
to let this whole thing go.

770
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:20,198
Then I'm going with you.

771
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:21,300
Harvey,

772
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:25,053
when Trevor went
to Jessica with my secret,

773
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:28,173
I felt betrayed.

774
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:32,177
I lost my closest friend
in the world.

775
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:34,546
And I know you don't like
to admit it,

776
00:31:34,564 --> 00:31:37,566
but we're friends.

777
00:31:39,903 --> 00:31:42,654
And I'm not gonna betray
my friend.

778
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:16,417
I used to hate
this kind of thing.

779
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,586
- What kind of thing?
- Guest lectures.

780
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:20,288
Hardman used to make us
sit through them.

781
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,909
Except he gave tests
afterwards.

782
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:29,747
Yeah, and if you didn't pass,
you got stuck on doc review.

783
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:31,248
Goddamn Hardman.

784
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:34,435
You remember
the Robinson case?

785
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,520
Sure do.

786
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,856
80,000 documents,
two years of prep,

787
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:40,475
and five months in court.

788
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:42,426
And the Friday
before trial started,

789
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:45,429
he assigned you and I
to proof everything.

790
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:48,232
You blew it off.

791
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,484
And you covered for me.

792
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,486
You did your half and mine,
then turned it in.

793
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,487
He would've fired you
on the spot.

794
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,205
Exactly, and I'm here

795
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,291
because you didn't sell out
a friend then,

796
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:58,293
but you're about to now.

797
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:00,945
- Mike.
- Me.

798
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:03,164
Friend?

799
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,282
Louis,
I may not ever say it,

800
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:06,834
but that's not
because we aren't.

801
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,119
We are.
You know it.

802
00:33:08,137 --> 00:33:10,555
I know it.

803
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,923
I just don't like
to say it.

804
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,142
Last time I asked you,
you said, "don't push it."

805
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,677
You knew I meant yes.

806
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,929
I did.

807
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:23,651
So Mike told you.
He did.

808
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:26,354
What'd you say?

809
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,822
Doesn't matter.

810
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:29,741
Bottom line is I forgave him
because I don't care

811
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,576
what some stupid piece
of paper says.

812
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,161
And I want you
to forgive him too.

813
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:34,946
Oh, Harvey,
I did forgive him.

814
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,647
I just can't cover it up
for him.

815
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:38,145
You covered it up
with Hardman for me.

816
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,417
What you did that weekend

817
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:43,204
is not the same as what he did
to Professor Gerard.

818
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,256
What's the same is
Hardman wouldn't have let it go,

819
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,824
and Gerard won't let it go.

820
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,126
You make Mike confess,

821
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,080
you might as well throw his life
down the toilet.

822
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:53,881
Harvey,
he didn't just betray us.

823
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,167
He betrayed the law.
He did.

824
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:58,136
- That's not right.
- It isn't.

825
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,171
But forgiveness isn't
about right and wrong.

826
00:34:00,189 --> 00:34:03,024
Louis, I know you value
the letter of the law,

827
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:04,475
but what about its spirit?

828
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,444
Because Mike embodies

829
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:08,696
that spirit
more than either one of us.

830
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:12,516
You said we're friends.

831
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:15,019
A friend would not ask me
to do this.

832
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:17,238
No, Louis.

833
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,191
A friend just won't hold it
against you if you don't.

834
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,438
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

835
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,523
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

836
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,025
I do.

837
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:58,029
But before we start,
I'd like to make a statement.

838
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,781
I am here to tell the truth,

839
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,398
but what I want you
to understand

840
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:03,501
is that truth is subjective.

841
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,169
The truth is the truth.

842
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,571
No.
The law is the law.

843
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:10,908
We can define
where a legal line is.

844
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:12,760
I'm talking about the truth.

845
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:26,107
The truth is
much more complicated.

846
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:28,109
By the letter of the law,

847
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:30,778
Quentin Sainz may
or may not have been competent.

848
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:34,649
I can't say what's true
with 100% certainty.

849
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,934
I just don't know.

850
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,536
But what I can say
with certainty

851
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,788
is that Quentin knew
what he was doing

852
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:43,407
when he trusted me to look
after his best interests.

853
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,959
How do you know that?

854
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,327
Because I knew him.

855
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:49,080
Just because someone
can't check off everything

856
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,948
on the list
that's required

857
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:52,950
to be competent
doesn't mean

858
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:56,804
they aren't better at whatever
they do than the rest of us.

859
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,006
And Quentin Sainz
was an amazing man

860
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:00,791
with an amazing mind.

861
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,560
And if he were here right now,

862
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,295
I'd still listen to him
on any subject

863
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:06,564
sooner than I'd listen
to anybody else.

864
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,649
That's all very touching,

865
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:11,319
but we're not here to talk
about the truth.

866
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:14,272
We're here to deal
with the letter of the law.

867
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,825
Have you never met someone
who by the letter of the law

868
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,777
shouldn't be able to do
what they do?

869
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,913
Who beat the odds?
Your honor-

870
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,165
We are talking
about a man's life.

871
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,501
We are talking
about his legacy.

872
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,619
And I dispute that those things
are less important

873
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,322
than the letter of the law.

874
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:41,215
Your honor,
what has to happen today

875
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,216
is very clear.

876
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,969
You have to undo
this injustice.

877
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:48,689
Yes.
This is about justice.

878
00:36:48,724 --> 00:36:51,342
But the issue isn't whether
Quentin Sainz was competent

879
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,178
when he made me executor,
but rather,

880
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:57,681
would it have been his intent
to do so if he were.

881
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:00,735
This man dedicated his life
to one thing,

882
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,187
and the circumstances
surrounding how he decided

883
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:06,690
to protect that thing
is not the question.

884
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,360
It's a question of law,
Ms. Pearson.

885
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:12,880
No, it is a question
of doing what is right.

886
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:14,715
Louis.

887
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,835
What the hell
are you doing here?

888
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,371
- I--
- I told you I needed

889
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:22,473
the Carell filings by lunch--
you didn't get that done,

890
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,725
so now you don't get to listen
to this lecture.

891
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,728
You do not get to listen to this
titan talk about legal ethics.

892
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:29,063
You know something,
you make me sick.

893
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,264
So do me a quick favor
and tell him you're sorry

894
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:33,217
and get the hell
out of here.

895
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:40,391
I'm sorry.

896
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:43,611
I accept your apology,

897
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,580
but I'm not
the aggrieved one here.

898
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:49,066
Louis is.

899
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:52,453
Louis...

900
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,956
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

901
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,968
It's not my pony.
Come on.

902
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,553
Motion to remove Jessica
Pearson as executor denied.

903
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:14,558
Well, you were right.

904
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,928
Quentin did know
what he was doing.

905
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:22,116
I know how hard
it must have been...

906
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,102
At the end.

907
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,071
I'm glad Quentin had you.

908
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,273
I'm glad he had you too.

909
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,132
He let it go.

910
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:10,581
I heard it all worked out.

911
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,917
Never a doubt.

912
00:39:15,871 --> 00:39:17,988
I've got a present for you.

913
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:20,007
Tiffany.

914
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,664
"D.J.S."

915
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:29,850
This is a present
for Scottie.

916
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:31,686
Which makes it a present
for you.

917
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,305
- Let's put this in her office.
- Great.

918
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,558
We can put it next to your
overpriced bottle of scotch.

919
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,143
So it was a great gift.

920
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,513
Now it is.

921
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:46,033
For the record,
her middle name is Victoria.

922
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:48,119
No, it isn't.

923
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,121
What is it?

924
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,356
Please, she never told me.

925
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:53,357
Julie?

926
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,408
- Seriously?
- Jessie?

927
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,659
- Oh, my God.
- Joy?

928
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,194
- You're pathetic.
- Jenny?

929
00:39:57,212 --> 00:40:00,697
Not telling.

930
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:03,200
I don't think
this is a good idea.

931
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:04,201
I don't care.

932
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:05,386
What are they gonna do,
fire us?

933
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,421
Mike, I haven't left
before 5:00

934
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,206
in the past six years.

935
00:40:09,224 --> 00:40:10,508
All the more reason
to do it.

936
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,009
Now what do you want to do?

937
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:15,229
See a movie, grab dinner,
get a drink?

938
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:20,884
I just want to go home.

939
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,941
Yeah.
Let's go home.

940
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:41,088
People seem to keep coming
in here lately.

941
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:43,874
I needed to hear some music.

942
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,960
And drink some scotch.

943
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:49,764
How often do you really
do one without the other?

944
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:57,271
Move over.

945
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:19,910
Did you take care
of your Marcus problem?

946
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,798
For the time being.

947
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:26,383
Good.

948
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,923
It wasn't really
a Marcus problem.

949
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,927
I know.

950
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,427
You want to hear the truth?

951
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:43,575
Not tonight.

952
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:45,909
That's why I didn't tell you
in the first place.

953
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:50,189
I know.

954
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:55,214
