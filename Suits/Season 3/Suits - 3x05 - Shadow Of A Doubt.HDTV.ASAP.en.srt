1
00:00:01,692 --> 00:00:03,676
I'm looking at a bribe,
plain as day.

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:05,093
That's exactly
what it is.

3
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:07,734
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video somehow.

4
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:09,203
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

5
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:11,538
You son of a bitch,
you leaked it.

6
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:13,323
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

7
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:15,159
- Not for long.
- Excuse me?

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,194
- This is my call.
- I'm afraid it isn't.

9
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,546
You'd like her to remove
herself from management?

10
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:21,799
I'm not going to stand
for losing this takeover.

11
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:24,718
Then don't,
but Ava isn't going anywhere.

12
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:27,037
I just got voted
out of my own company.

13
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:29,139
I stand by my decision,
and I'd do it again.

14
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:30,591
Don't tell me it doesn't
have to do with Darby.

15
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,977
You're the one who gave him
the 51% in the first place.

16
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:36,213
You can't stand
being number two.

17
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,100
Please tell me
you're calling me

18
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:41,485
because you've been kidnapped.

19
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:42,886
I'm not the one
who disappeared.

20
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,438
I told you I had a thing.

21
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,824
At 1:00.
It's 1:45.

22
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,492
And it's called
a lunch hour, Harvey.

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,895
60 whole minutes,
which my teeth deserve.

24
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:53,363
You fit the dentist in
at lunch?

25
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:54,898
He can be
surprisingly quick,

26
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:56,283
yet remarkably thorough.

27
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,285
Donna, Judge Atkins
is ready to hear

28
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,571
my motion for summary judgment,
which she won't do

29
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:03,240
if there aren't
two copies of that motion

30
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,092
in my hands
in ten minutes.

31
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:06,460
All right,
here's what you're gonna do.

32
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:08,345
Go to my computer
and press "print."

33
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:09,930
Pick the motions up
off the printer,

34
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,249
then walk over to the corner,
throw everything in the trash,

35
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,467
because there's already
two copies

36
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,302
on your desk
at this very moment.

37
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:18,188
So the trash can's
in the corner then?

38
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:20,590
Bye.

39
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:25,979
You had "a thing"?

40
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:27,764
Well...

41
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:30,067
Two things.

42
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,954
But who's counting?

43
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:36,740
What did he want anyway?

44
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,710
I thought we agreed
not to talk about work at lunch.

45
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:42,996
Yeah, we did, but we also
agreed to have lunch at lunch.

46
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,833
Yeah, you're right.

47
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:50,620
It's just that, uh,
I've always made it my business

48
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,890
knowing about things.

49
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:55,425
And you're good
at your business.

50
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:57,010
Mmm, business is good.

51
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:00,013
Ooh,
some might say booming.

52
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,433
Listen, we've only
got 15 minutes left,

53
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:06,469
so I'll endeavor
to be surprisingly quick.

54
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:09,856
As long as you continue
to be remarkably thorough.

55
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:16,530
Your Honor, you said
you would dismiss this case

56
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:18,115
if he couldn't
produce evidence

57
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,317
beyond the bribery tape.
Well, he couldn't.

58
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:22,085
We found five witnesses
that tied the man

59
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:24,314
that Ava Hessington bribed
on that tape to the murders.

60
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,340
And those witnesses
refused to come forward.

61
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:27,541
If we can't confront them,

62
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,658
then their statements
are inadmissible.

63
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,826
Just because
they won't come forward

64
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,211
doesn't mean
they don't exist.

65
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,546
He's right, their statements
may be inadmissible,

66
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,132
but I can't ignore the fact
that they were made.

67
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:38,435
Well, in that case,
we move for an expedited trial.

68
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,521
Ten seconds ago,
he was moving for a dismissal.

69
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:43,523
And in the ten seconds since,

70
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,842
public opinion of my client
has gone down even further.

71
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,194
She's a murderer.
How much lower can it go?

72
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,445
Well, you tell me.

73
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:50,032
You leaked evidence
to Tony Gianopolous

74
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:51,815
that lost her
her company.

75
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,150
You might leak it
to anyone.

76
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,701
Your Honor, we've been
down this road before.

77
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,453
It's called
bullshit highway.

78
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,206
All dragging this out does
is delay Ava Hessington

79
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,041
the opportunity
to vindicate herself.

80
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,494
It also conveniently gives me
less time to build my case.

81
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,213
But the case you just argued
was solid enough to go to trial.

82
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:08,048
You're letting your mini-me
make your arguments for you now?

83
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:09,049
Are you letting
your moustache--

84
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,300
Enough.

85
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,369
The trial starts
a week from Monday.

86
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,587
Get out.

87
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,538
You still haven't told
Harvey about Stephen?

88
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,758
I went to tell him,
but he was in a bad mood,

89
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:19,393
and then somehow
I ended up telling him

90
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,011
that I made some copies
for Stephen,

91
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:22,929
and he got
really pissed.

92
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,048
What's he gonna do
when he finds out about this?

93
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,651
Whoa, but I thought you said
that you two had never--

94
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:28,986
So?

95
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,237
So I get why he doesn't want
to share you here.

96
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,688
You're his everything here.

97
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,073
But what you're doing
with Stephen isn't here,

98
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:34,941
it's there.
Two completely different things.

99
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:37,227
Then why did you tell me
I had to tell him?

100
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:38,561
To let him know
that your there and his here

101
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,747
can coexist
in the same place.

102
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:42,416
I liked it better when
we talked about you and Mike.

103
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,450
I'm sure you did.

104
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:46,286
So are you two
going to keep--

105
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:48,789
Yes, it is some
of the best damn...

106
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:50,924
Yoga I've had
in a long time.

107
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,259
Well, sooner or later,
he's gonna find out,

108
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:54,378
because it is
all over your face.

109
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,578
Oh, please,
you're a woman.

110
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,798
Men are oblivious.

111
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:00,183
There's something
different about you.

112
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,551
What is it?

113
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:04,137
Yes, please tell the man
what it is.

114
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:05,272
Nothing, Louis.

115
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:06,690
I'm just--
been doing some yoga.

116
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:08,859
No, that's not it.

117
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,227
You're practically glowing.

118
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:12,095
Tell me your secret.

119
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:14,531
Ii don't think
that it's your cup of tea.

120
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,599
For that glow,
I'd tea.

121
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,452
I'm gonna have to keep this
to myself, Louis.

122
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:19,936
Okay, well, promise me
you'll keep doing

123
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,655
whatever it is you're doing.
I think she can do that.

124
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,490
No, I'm serious, Donna.
Morning, noon, and night.

125
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,158
Five times a day
if necessary.

126
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:26,209
I will do my best.

127
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:28,278
Mm.

128
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:34,801
- Well, we did our best.
- Our best?

129
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,120
Wait a minute,
you never expected this case

130
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,672
to get dismissed.

131
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,173
Then why would I ask for it?

132
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,642
Because she was more likely
to grant an expedited trial

133
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:44,127
after saying no
to a dismissal.

134
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:46,963
And now, Cameron's
got a shitty case to try

135
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:50,233
with no evidence and less
than two weeks to get any more.

136
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,235
Wait a second.

137
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:54,488
What if they didn't just have
to scramble for new evidence?

138
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,356
What if they had to scramble
for a whole new lawyer?

139
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,241
Any lawyer who got
assigned this case

140
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,577
with only two weeks to go
would drop the whole thing.

141
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,112
Unless they had
a personal beef with you,

142
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,646
which they wouldn't.
There's only one way

143
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:05,248
to get Cameron
thrown off this case.

144
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,867
Prove he colluded
with Gianopolous.

145
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:10,587
Turn bullshit highway into...
fact highway.

146
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:11,671
Fact highway?

147
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:12,989
Yeah, you know,
it's right next

148
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,542
to "I don't want to talk
about this anymore" lane.

149
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,627
We're gonna have to talk
about how to prove they colluded

150
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:20,163
because we have a chance
to get rid of this murder charge

151
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,831
once and for all.

162
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:58,161
Katrina said
you wanted to see me.

163
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:00,122
Hey, Simon, come on in.
I have a question for you.

164
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:02,815
Come on, you need
to see this.

165
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,483
Look at this.
This is so funny.

166
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:05,734
Is that
some sort of joke?

167
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,036
Nominal
in the first paragraph,

168
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,404
pagination
on the left-hand side,

169
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,456
Times New Roman's
stupid little feet

170
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,740
walking
all across the page.

171
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,659
And what's that word?

172
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,111
- "Shall"?
- Mm.

173
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:19,381
At this firm, we instruct,
we advise, we order,

174
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,884
we must,
but we do not "shall."

175
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,586
- That's not really a--
- Why must we "must"?

176
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,721
Because we thrust,
we don't parry.

177
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,756
Rewrite this.

178
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:30,092
I can't.

179
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:32,628
Excuse me?

180
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,929
Mr. Nesbitt has clearly
instructed us--

181
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,315
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This was Nigel's doing?

182
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,733
Per his most recent memo.

183
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,768
He's communicating
with you through memos?

184
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,820
You've been left adrift
on lady law's fickle ocean

185
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:43,239
with no rudder,
no captain?

186
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,973
He hasn't been
in the office

187
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,358
since he took over
the program,

188
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,564
if that's
what you're asking.

189
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:48,494
No, I think
I was perfectly clear

190
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,446
in what I was asking,
Simon.

191
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,530
Am I supposed
to respond to that?

192
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:52,781
Yeah, by going back

193
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:53,699
to your desk right now
and doing it correctly.

194
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:54,700
But--

195
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:55,918
Simon,
a memo from Nigel

196
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,002
is not gonna stick
its boot in your ass.

197
00:06:57,087 --> 00:07:00,005
A memo from me will.
Get out.

198
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:10,099
I told you,
not at the office.

199
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,000
You mean I can't see Harvey
at the office?

200
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,168
'Cause that's what
I'm here to do.

201
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,887
- Oh.
- Oh.

202
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:15,938
- What?
- You know what.

203
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,005
You haven't told him yet.

204
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,357
It's none
of his business.

205
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,560
He and I are here,
and you and I are...there.

206
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:22,678
I wish we were there.

207
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,063
I just told you,
not here.

208
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:25,281
Donna, what's going on
out there?

209
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,116
I think he means
out here.

210
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:29,485
You have a walk-in.

211
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:32,655
What are you doing here?

212
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:34,189
What I've always
been doing here,

213
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:36,041
representing
Edward Darby's wishes.

214
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,710
I lost Ava her company.

215
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:40,579
I assume my deal
with Edward is dead.

216
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:42,965
Well, Edward doesn't
see it like that.

217
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:44,166
You may have failed,

218
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,335
but Jessica took a shot
at her own team.

219
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:48,003
And the consequences of that
are what?

220
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:49,505
Deal stays in place

221
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,557
as long as you win
her murder trial.

222
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,143
What if my plan is
to not even have a murder trial?

223
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,877
Well, as long
as you don't accomplish that

224
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,647
by having Ava plead guilty,

225
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:00,349
you'll be
the next managing partner.

226
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,884
Good, because I'm going
to accomplish it

227
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,820
by getting Cameron Dennis
thrown off this case

228
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,822
for colluding
with Tony Gianopolous.

229
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,857
And how are you
going to accomplish that?

230
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,909
By suing
Tony Gianopolous.

231
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:11,944
For what?

232
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,279
For this...
or this...

233
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:16,782
And/or that.

234
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,046
- Yeah, that's good.
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:32,748
- It is.
- Yeah.

236
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,801
- But I can do better.
- No way.

237
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:37,970
$5,000 says I can.

238
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:41,190
$10,000 says you can't.

239
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:42,891
Excellent.

240
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,977
What's your idea?

241
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,695
Well, it requires you
to take me with you

242
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,731
to see Mr. Gianopolous.
Mike?

243
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,400
- Yeah.
- You're off the case.

244
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:52,985
What? You're gonna let him
get away with that?

245
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:54,236
I have to.
I just took a bet.

246
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:55,604
There's no going back
on a bet.

247
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:57,239
Okay, what if I bet him
that my idea's better?

248
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,240
Then can I come?

249
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,443
You gonna pony up
$10,000?

250
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:04,463
Best of luck, guys.
Hope it works out.

251
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:07,333
So you're off the case?

252
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,335
Yeah,
thanks to Stephen Huntley.

253
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,087
Well, doesn't he have his hand
in a lot of cookie jars?

254
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:14,723
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

255
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,975
Wait a second,
"nothing" never means nothing.

256
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,594
Sometimes
it means something.

257
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,462
Ah, do you want me
to force it out of you?

258
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:22,848
I may or may not need
plausible deniability.

259
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:26,101
- Rachel.
- Donna slept with Stephen.

260
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:28,187
Holy shit.

261
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:29,905
You cannot let her know
that you know.

262
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,156
- Does Harvey know?
- No, not yet.

263
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:32,574
Don't you dare tell him.

264
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:34,193
Yeah, like I'm gonna
touch that with a 10-foot pole.

265
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,144
But he's gonna care
that she didn't tell him.

266
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,650
So how are you gonna
get back on that case?

267
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,985
Um, I got
a different case.

268
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:45,287
Graham Stenton.

269
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:47,089
The accountant
who embezzled

270
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:49,792
$30 million from our client?
Yep.

271
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:52,294
And our job is to get
the money back, quietly.

272
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:53,629
Our job
as in Pearson Darby?

273
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,330
Our job
as in you and me.

274
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,349
I'm interviewing
his associate this afternoon,

275
00:09:57,434 --> 00:10:00,185
and I need your help.

276
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,855
You want me to be the Mike
to your Harvey.

277
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:07,142
I do want you to be
the Mike to my Harvey.

278
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:08,310
Yeah, well,
it's not really a thing.

279
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:09,778
It can be.

280
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:11,280
- Huh.
- Huh.

281
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:12,681
I get to ask
half the questions.

282
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:15,234
Oh, Harvey doesn't let Mike
ask half the questions.

283
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:16,568
Fine, 1/3.

284
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,287
Harvey doesn't
negotiate with Mike.

285
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:20,188
Mike doesn't have sex
with Harvey.

286
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,693
1/3 of the questions
seems reasonable to me.

287
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:38,424
Could you possibly keep
your thwacking to yourself?

288
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,509
This is a private club.

289
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,177
With a sister club
in London.

290
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,546
Courtesy mudding
privileges.

291
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:47,015
And, yes,
it's Turkish.

292
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,101
Outside mud is a clear
violation of club policy.

293
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,552
There are rules,
Nigel.

294
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,387
Just as there are rules
forbidding interference

295
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:53,772
with my associates.

296
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:58,193
Yeah, well, you don't give
a rat's ass about them.

297
00:10:58,244 --> 00:10:59,661
How dare you?

298
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,830
You know, let me tell you
something you may not know.

299
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:04,500
Associates,
they're like grains of sand.

300
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,118
They need pressure
and heat

301
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:08,069
to shape them
into Chihuly glass.

302
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,756
Memos from a distant land
don't shape shit into shit.

303
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,207
Nonsense.

304
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:14,910
I attended boarding school
from the tender age of four,

305
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:16,578
during which time
I received weekly memos

306
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:17,913
from my father.

307
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:19,348
Yeah, and look
how you turned out.

308
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:21,416
Graduating summa cum laude
from both Cambridge

309
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:23,435
and Harvard
is quite the failure.

310
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,939
Your parents' choice
to "homeschool," much better.

311
00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:28,256
Okay, that was only
till I was ten,

312
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,091
and my mother's science fair
was legendary.

313
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:33,278
You must be so proud of
your uncontested blue ribbons.

314
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:35,781
Okay, you know what,

315
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:37,699
I'm not gonna let you
shatter the glass

316
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,234
that I spent years blowing.

317
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,986
And I'm certainly not gonna
let the likes of you

318
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,438
tell me who I can
and cannot blow.

319
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:48,777
He's not gonna come.

320
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:49,778
He will.

321
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,463
You pushed his assistant?

322
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:52,548
I charmed her.

323
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:54,049
You didn't.

324
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:56,585
He's right,
you didn't.

325
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:59,505
She was irritated.

326
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,122
But I was curious.

327
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:02,474
Works for me.

328
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,594
You know what they say
about curiosity.

329
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,015
I get it.

330
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:13,018
I come after Hessington Oil,
you come after me.

331
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:14,686
Well, bring it on, boys.

332
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:15,854
I got a team of lawyers

333
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,523
just itching
to take your lunch money.

334
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:19,888
Well, unfortunately, you're
not gonna be able to use them.

335
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,309
He's not gonna
sue you here.

336
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,245
He's gonna sue you
in London,

337
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:25,030
where you have
countless holdings.

338
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,332
Where the burden of proof
isn't on the plaintiff.

339
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,867
It's on the defendant.

340
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:30,836
So instead of us
having to prove you're guilty,

341
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,704
you'll have to prove
you're innocent.

342
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,256
Doesn't look
very innocent.

343
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:35,490
So you guys think
I'm gonna run scared

344
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,510
at the prospect of losing
a little money.

345
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:41,713
I'm a corporate raider.

346
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:45,968
This is a $50,000 bond.

347
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,105
You see, I'm not in
this business for the money.

348
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,441
Money's just
about keeping score.

349
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:54,776
I'm in this business
to win.

350
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:56,061
Well, here's the thing,
Tony.

351
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:57,729
This trial's
gonna take a while.

352
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,481
You'll be going
to hearing after hearing,

353
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:01,400
deposition
after deposition.

354
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:03,364
You won't be able
to enjoy your business at all.

355
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:05,186
So even if you win,
you lose.

356
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:06,572
Or?

357
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:08,957
Well, I...
I could withdraw the suit.

358
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,160
And all that'll cost you
is the truth,

359
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:14,463
that you colluded
with Cameron Dennis.

360
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,248
Ah, but I didn't
collude shit.

361
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,716
Yes, you did,

362
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,168
when you let him leak you
that video of Ava Hessington,

363
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:24,506
then tried to use it
to take over Hessington Oil.

364
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,253
All right,
so how do we celebrate?

365
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,524
Celebrate what?

366
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,334
Our first case
as a couple.

367
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:37,669
We should go
to that French place you like,

368
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,054
get a bottle of wine,

369
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:40,622
a couple of things that
I don't know how to pronounce,

370
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:42,591
and then go back
to my place and celebrate.

371
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:44,059
That's what we're calling it
these days?

372
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,228
Well, "victory sex"
seemed less romantic.

373
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:47,395
- Well, I can't tonight.
- Why not?

374
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,181
I have dinner
with my parents.

375
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:50,982
Maybe I could
come with you.

376
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,734
Um...Yeah, I--

377
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,436
Unless you don't
want me there.

378
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,488
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

379
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:58,156
You don't want me there.

380
00:13:58,241 --> 00:13:59,608
Of course I do.

381
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:00,808
You don't look
like you do.

382
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,027
Is it because I'm white?

383
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,672
- That's not funny.
- Empirically it is.

384
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,447
No, it's not, and you're
acting like it's nothing.

385
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:07,415
Rachel, come on, look,
I know it's something,

386
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:09,003
but you're acting
like it's everything.

387
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:10,785
It is everything.

388
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,087
Wait a second.

389
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:15,207
Do you not want me to meet them
tonight or at all?

390
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,709
I don't want them
to find out your secret.

391
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:19,878
They're not
gonna find out.

392
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:22,013
- How do you know that?
- Because no one finds out.

393
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:25,050
You, Donna, Jessica,
you were all told.

394
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:27,519
Besides, I met your dad.
He didn't figure it out.

395
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:28,687
He met you as someone
that he wouldn't give

396
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:30,188
a second thought to,
Mike.

397
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:32,190
As my boyfriend,
he is going to put you

398
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:33,441
under the microscope.

399
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,227
- I can pass inspection.
- Well, what about me?

400
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:37,178
Because you might be experienced
at lying to the world,

401
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,697
but I'm not.

402
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:41,149
And it's not the world,
it's my family.

403
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,235
Okay, Rachel, you and I
have told each other

404
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:44,869
that we love
each other, right?

405
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:47,739
Did we mean that
or not?

406
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,574
If we did,
then at some point,

407
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,043
I am gonna have to meet
your parents.

408
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:55,463
Interview's in 20 minutes.
We should go.

409
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:03,421
Make yourself at home.

410
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:06,841
I wanted to talk to you
in here.

411
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:09,210
- Is this about your--
- No, no.

412
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:12,147
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

413
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,153
How'd it go
with Gianopolous?

414
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,054
Well,
he's not a pushover,

415
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,723
but I think we have
a good plan.

416
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:23,408
- So it went well?
- Yeah, it went well.

417
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:24,693
And since when are you--

418
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:27,779
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

419
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:29,948
I can see that.

420
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:31,232
You can see that?

421
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,585
That's all you have
to say?

422
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,370
Do you want me
to say more?

423
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:37,255
It depends
on what you would say.

424
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,791
I'd say, "when?"

425
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,343
Three days ago.

426
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,128
Why didn't
you tell me before?

427
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,629
I was going to,
but you got so upset

428
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:46,080
when you thought
I was working for him.

429
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:48,049
Because you work for me.

430
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,518
Well, I'm not working
for him.

431
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:52,253
Good.

432
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,590
So you're not upset.

433
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:56,941
No.

434
00:15:57,026 --> 00:15:59,093
What you're doing with him
is personal.

435
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,095
- And this isn't?
- Donna,

436
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,264
I don't wanna make this a thing.
I don't either.

437
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:05,200
I just want to make sure
that it doesn't become a thing.

438
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,036
It won't as long as you
don't let that affect this.

439
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:11,122
Okay.

440
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,158
Miss Clark, do you know
Graham Stenton well?

441
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:14,609
We've worked together
for a while.

442
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,328
And you handle the books
for his accounts,

443
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:17,412
is that right?

444
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:18,797
Yes, that's right.

445
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,632
We just need to know
when exactly you became aware

446
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:24,386
that Mr. Stenton
was manipulating the numbers.

447
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:27,839
I don't believe he was.

448
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,624
Well,
the auditors disagree.

449
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,726
Well, I disagree with them.
Graham's a good person.

450
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:34,035
I'm sure Bernie Madoff's
friends all said the same thing.

451
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:35,313
That isn't fair.

452
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:36,514
And Graham
isn't the only person

453
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,879
who had access
to those accounts.

454
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,967
Mr. Oxnard, Mr. Dipetro,

455
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,854
several individuals
from the controller's office.

456
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:44,806
I just have
one question for you.

457
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:47,742
How long have you
been sleeping with him?

458
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,194
What?

459
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,330
You smiled when you started
talking about him.

460
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:54,165
You called him "Graham."

461
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,785
You've referred to everyone else
as "mister" or "individual."

462
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:59,153
And when my colleague asked
you about sleeping with him,

463
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:02,123
you didn't seem offended,
you seemed caught.

464
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:03,375
I had nothing
to do with this.

465
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,926
That doesn't mean
you don't know anything.

466
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:07,595
Look, Miss Clark, we're trying
to make this go away quietly,

467
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:09,547
but if we can't, we're gonna
make it go away loudly,

468
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:11,433
which means putting you
on the stand.

469
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,501
Beth, you won't be able
to take the fifth

470
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:15,670
because you won't be
testifying against yourself.

471
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:17,222
And if you lie on the stand,
that's perjury.

472
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:19,674
Look, if you really
want to protect him,

473
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:22,343
just get him to give us
the money back now,

474
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:25,563
while we can still
take care of this quietly.

475
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,201
I can't.

476
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:31,686
That's it,
I'm calling the D.A.

477
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:33,238
I think we should give her
some time to think about it.

478
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:36,241
- I don't think so.
- Mike, it's a hard decision.

479
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:42,380
Fine.
She has until tomorrow.

480
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,844
Oh, what's going on?
Nothing.

481
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:58,263
Simon.

482
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:01,399
Mr. Nesbitt
gave us all gifts.

483
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:03,435
And they're funny?

484
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,820
I think
they're meant to be.

485
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:08,156
Well, you know,
he has trouble connecting,

486
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,358
but he's making an effort.

487
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,278
Maybe he took
my words to heart.

488
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:18,082
What'd you say to him?

489
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,706
Ah.
Turned out quite well.

490
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:27,258
- You crossed a line.
- I did no such thing.

491
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:29,043
You took a private feud,
and you made it public.

492
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:31,296
After you tried
to undermine my authority.

493
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,714
Because you don't know
what you're doing.

494
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,432
I knew what I was doing
when I took them from you

495
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:35,517
like biscuits
from a schoolboy.

496
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,051
All right,
you son of a bitch.

497
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:40,638
You better get yourself ready,
'cause I'm about to kick--

498
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:43,107
I know it's generally
against regulations,

499
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,692
but her nanny
fell ill, and--

500
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,644
No, no, no, no.
Say no more.

501
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,313
A father's love
knows no rule.

502
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:49,531
I didn't know
you were a cat man.

503
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:50,982
Do I have brains
in my head?

504
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,226
Do I have a heart
in my chest?

505
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:53,427
Who is
this stunning creature?

506
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:55,203
Her moniker
is "Mikado."

507
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,738
So does that mean
she enjoys--

508
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:59,491
Yes, whenever we travel,
I make sure she has

509
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,776
some Gilbert and Sullivan
playing in her sherpa.

510
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,628
Uh, do be careful,
she doesn't normally like--

511
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,715
My God.

512
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:09,167
What?
Oh.

513
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:10,618
Does she prefer
the left side?

514
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,387
She doesn't normally
let anyone touch her except me.

515
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:17,225
I happen to have a way with
those of the feline persuasion.

516
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,960
Do you have any cream?

517
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:29,237
You wanted to see me?

518
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,773
Yes.
I had some free time.

519
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,975
Oakwood Foods canceled
our 10:00 a.m. meeting,

520
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:38,580
as did Omni Holdings at noon
and Dunbar Securities at 4:00.

521
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,915
Sounds like you need
to work on your people skills.

522
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:43,034
You need to work
on your people skills.

523
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:45,987
Those meetings were canceled
because we just got fired.

524
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,672
And why is that
my fault?

525
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,824
They're not my clients.
I've never even met them.

526
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,826
No, but evidently,

527
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,161
you have met
their new owner,

528
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,514
Tony Gianopolous,
who bought them

529
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,600
for the sole purpose
of firing us.

530
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,767
Good.

531
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:01,519
I pissed him off.
That means it's working.

532
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,671
Oh, you mean
that plan of yours

533
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:05,043
you didn't think
to tell me about.

534
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:06,697
Oh, I thought about it,
and then I thought

535
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:08,726
you'd just go behind my back
and undo it.

536
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:11,446
So you went behind my back
and went to Stephen Huntley.

537
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:13,347
I told you,
I trust him.

538
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,617
Well,
you're the one

539
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,619
who likes to throw
Darby's name around.

540
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:20,955
So why don't
you and Stephen call him

541
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:23,791
and let him know that
you single-handedly lost us

542
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,359
more business in a day

543
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,078
than you've ever gotten
in a month.

544
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:29,196
And feel free
to use my phone.

545
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:30,748
Since you freed up
my afternoon,

546
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,584
I'm taking
the rest of the day off.

547
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:35,587
Did you see the look
on her face?

548
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:38,873
Are you kidding?
We put that look on her face.

549
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:41,092
- Ah.
- Good cop, bad cop.

550
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:44,312
- Uh, Mike, Harvey.
- So I guess it is a thing.

551
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,564
So we should have the money
back by this weekend,

552
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:47,932
and then,
we can celebrate.

553
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:50,602
I was thinking that we could
celebrate tonight...

554
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:53,605
After dinner
with my parents.

555
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,323
Do you want me to come?

556
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,076
That look
on Beth's face,

557
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,913
it didn't just say
that they slept together.

558
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:03,114
She loves him.

559
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:08,119
I told you I love you,
and I meant it.

560
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:11,673
That's not something
I want to hide from my family.

561
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:17,578
I actually made plans,
so I'm not gonna be able to--

562
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,746
Bad joke?

563
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:19,914
- No, terrible timing.
- Bad timing.

564
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:21,916
Okay.
I guessed.

565
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:29,691
I need your help
with Gianopolous.

566
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:31,609
Relax,
if he's making another run

567
00:21:31,694 --> 00:21:33,478
at Hessington Oil,
that's not gonna happen.

568
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:36,147
- Well, how can you know that?
- Because you just restructured,

569
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:37,982
and he can't force
another takeover vote

570
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,317
for at least six months.

571
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,869
Then why is he driving
my stock into the ground?

572
00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:44,906
- What?
- He's been dumping it all day.

573
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:47,458
I'll take care of it.

574
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:50,111
What did you do?

575
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:51,462
We picked a fight
with him.

576
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:54,048
We've just finished
a fight with him

577
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,217
that ended with me
losing control of my company,

578
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:58,336
so why in God's name
would you pick another?

579
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,122
To get you out of these
murder charges once and for all,

580
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:02,507
and after I do,

581
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,842
we'll figure out a way
to get you back in charge.

582
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:06,594
You see that you do,

583
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:09,564
because I would rather rot
in a cell

584
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:12,299
than let that man
take over my company.

585
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:19,985
So I tell her, it's not
my fault she might be early.

586
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:21,933
Man, I'm in the middle
of closing arguments.

587
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:24,414
And I tell him that if he's
not with me when she arrives,

588
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:26,250
the next case he'll try
is his own murder.

589
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,751
Then I walk in the room,

590
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,319
and she sees that I was right
outside the door the whole time.

591
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,320
I was not amused.

592
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:31,672
You weren't amused?

593
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:33,207
You actually didn't go
into labor for another week.

594
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,708
I lost that case.

595
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:36,343
Robert, you've had
enough potatoes.

596
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:38,595
She's trying to make me eat
that foodie bullshit.

597
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:40,047
Oh, I find that
hard to believe.

598
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:41,215
Made me a smoothie
this morning,

599
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,267
I got all excited.
It was green.

600
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:44,301
That's what healthy
looks like.

601
00:22:44,352 --> 00:22:45,352
Thank you, Rachel.

602
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:46,503
- You're not alone.
- What was that?

603
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:47,938
I'm bonding
with your father here.

604
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:49,339
- Speaking of which--
- Robert.

605
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,391
What? You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

606
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:52,976
I know the next six things
you're gonna say,

607
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,845
and you're not gonna say them,
because I told you,

608
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,780
Rachel doesn't want you
grilling this poor young man.

609
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:57,981
- What?
- Mom.

610
00:22:58,032 --> 00:22:59,366
You're not taking it easy
on me, are you?

611
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,851
- A little.
- You told me to rein him in.

612
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:02,142
I also told you
not to tell him.

613
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:03,570
That's not how we do things
in this family.

614
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:04,955
I'm not keeping things
from your father.

615
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:06,657
You kept it from me
when you scratched the car.

616
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:07,708
Robert,
eat your potatoes.

617
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:09,376
What's so funny?

618
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,044
She's not consistent
with the potatoes.

619
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:12,529
She's not consistent
with anything.

620
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,197
Okay, you're not getting
any potatoes.

621
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:16,216
Now what's so funny?

622
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,051
Uh, I see
where she gets it from.

623
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:20,804
Gets what?

624
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:22,256
You better shut up
and eat your potatoes.

625
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,424
Mmhmm.

626
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:31,849
She actually said
she'd prefer to rot in a cell?

627
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,767
Well, you've gotta give her
credit for that.

628
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:36,219
You do,
and she's right.

629
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:38,238
It's not making any sense.

630
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:41,108
If he's not making a run,
why is he dumping her shares?

631
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:43,560
- He's reacting.
- He's overreacting.

632
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:46,062
He may have money to burn,
but this isn't

633
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:48,165
tens of thousands,
it's tens of millions.

634
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:49,583
It's completely
out of proportion.

635
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:52,169
- Not exactly.
- What are you talking about?

636
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:55,622
I subpoenaed his daughter.

637
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:57,374
You what?

638
00:23:57,425 --> 00:24:00,076
He fired our client,
so I struck back.

639
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:02,512
And you didn't think
to run that by me?

640
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,014
No, I didn't think
you'd say no.

641
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:05,933
I'd say no
because I'm not an idiot.

642
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:07,417
Idiot?

643
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:08,802
We need this man
to help us.

644
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:10,637
You just made him
a permanent enemy.

645
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:12,556
Me?
We did this together.

646
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:14,858
- Don't put this on me.
- You're putting it on me.

647
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:16,226
Because you
goddamn did it!

648
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:18,357
You were going to go after him
no matter what I said.

649
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:19,363
I attacked his business.

650
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,981
You went after his family.

651
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:23,700
Don't tell me you've never
done the same thing,

652
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:25,101
and what's the difference
between me doing it,

653
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,454
other than
the fact that--

654
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:29,990
ah.

655
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:32,292
I see.

656
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:35,295
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

657
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,715
This is about me
getting personal with Donna.

658
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:42,953
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just say that.

659
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:45,339
Is that
because she's listening?

660
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:47,174
I don't give a shit
if she hears it or not.

661
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:49,142
You crossed a line
with Gianopolous,

662
00:24:49,227 --> 00:24:51,812
and you just crossed
another one with me.

663
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,398
You know, you've had it
in for me from the start.

664
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:56,683
And you've only been
with Donna for three days,

665
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,301
that should tell you
something.

666
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:00,270
Let me spell it out
for you, okay?

667
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,689
You don't work my case
without me,

668
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:05,094
and since you seem to be having
trouble understanding that,

669
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,276
you don't work my case
at all.

670
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:09,279
Now get out of my office.

671
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:24,661
- So, Michael--
- Mike.

672
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:27,047
So now you're gonna tell me
what to call you?

673
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,833
No, I-I--it's--
people usually call me--

674
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:31,018
I'm just messing
with you.

675
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:36,440
So where are you from?
I grew up in Brooklyn.

676
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:38,892
Brothers, sisters?

677
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:40,444
Only child.

678
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,345
Parents still there?

679
00:25:42,397 --> 00:25:44,031
They both died
when I was a kid.

680
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:47,517
Nah,
you're messing with me.

681
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:56,493
I just asked an orphan
about his dead parents

682
00:25:56,544 --> 00:26:00,247
and made a joke about it,
didn't I?

683
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:01,698
Does he like apple
or blueberry?

684
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:03,216
Mom, shh, I'm trying to hear
what they're saying.

685
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:06,053
Rachel, relax,
he can handle your father.

686
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:07,587
How do you know?

687
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:09,339
Because you wouldn't have
brought him here if he couldn't.

688
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:13,176
Besides, what are you so afraid
they're gonna say?

689
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:15,395
You're right.
Nothing.

690
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,732
Honey, what is it?

691
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:25,355
You don't have
to tell me.

692
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:27,691
But just tell me this,

693
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:30,610
do you love him?

694
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:35,749
As long as he hasn't killed
someone, it'll all work out.

695
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:41,505
Come on.

696
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:49,212
I thought you were taking
the day off.

697
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,014
That was the day,
this is the night,

698
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:52,682
and my name is
still on the door.

699
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,635
It is.

700
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:59,723
- What do you want, Harvey?
- You were right.

701
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:01,525
We've had a lot
of disagreements lately.

702
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:02,926
Which one
are you referring to?

703
00:27:02,977 --> 00:27:05,479
I'm not entirely sure
Stephen Huntley's judgment

704
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:06,930
is better than yours.

705
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:09,316
He went behind my back.

706
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,068
Going behind someone's back

707
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,269
doesn't seem like something
you have a problem with.

708
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:16,823
Maybe, but he hit Gianopolous
below the belt,

709
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:18,408
and now we have
a problem.

710
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:20,494
<i>We</i> have a problem?

711
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:22,579
You said your name
was still on the door.

712
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,549
I'm coming to you
for help.

713
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:30,887
What's our problem?

714
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:33,340
He's dumping
Hessington Oil shares

715
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:36,292
just to drive her
into the ground.

716
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,469
Well,
if we can come together,

717
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:47,854
maybe they
can come together.

718
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:50,157
- I'm listening.
- Tony Gianopolous

719
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:54,778
wants to own
Hessington Oil.

720
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,580
Ava wants to control it.

721
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:59,533
She sells him her shares,

722
00:27:59,617 --> 00:28:01,084
he gives her
the voting rights.

723
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,336
And he gives up
Cameron Dennis.

724
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:07,040
They get what they want,
and so do we.

725
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,658
You think
he'll still go for it?

726
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:12,045
He'll know we're coming to him
because he won.

727
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,047
He won't be the problem.

728
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:15,549
Ava said she'd rather rot

729
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,468
than see him
take over her company.

730
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,387
I'll take care of Ava.

731
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:24,024
Look, it seems like
you two get along,

732
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,509
and I like you.

733
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:29,563
So I'm gonna
ask you this straight.

734
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:31,481
She's worked her ass off
to become a lawyer.

735
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:32,849
I know.

736
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,780
Well, I don't want anything
to stand in her way.

737
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:36,019
I would never do that.

738
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,788
So what happens
when she gets into Stanford?

739
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:45,045
You didn't know
she applied there.

740
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:50,200
Looks like you two
have something to talk about.

741
00:28:57,722 --> 00:28:59,122
You're awfully
quiet this morning.

742
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:00,477
- Just tired.
- Still?

743
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:02,165
I mean, you went home
right after dinner last night.

744
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,334
Yeah,
trouble sleeping.

745
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:07,203
Is something wrong?

746
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:09,089
Hey, who the hell
do you think you are?

747
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:10,807
Mr. Stenton, I guess
you got our message.

748
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,310
Oh, I did,
and now I've got one for you.

749
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,062
Beth and I got married
this morning.

750
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:17,714
You married a woman
to protect yourself?

751
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:19,266
I married her
because I love her.

752
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,567
But you did it
to make any conversation

753
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:22,235
that the two of you had
privileged.

754
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,987
Says the lawyer
who threatened her.

755
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,740
Well, now you take this
to trial, she won't testify.

756
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:28,942
Well, it's too bad
spousal privilege

757
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:30,577
doesn't apply
to bullshit marriages.

758
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:32,279
Yeah, good luck
arguing that.

759
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:34,604
We offered the two of you
a chance to give back the money

760
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:36,366
and walk away, but
after we prove you did this--

761
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,251
Oh, you can't prove
I did a thing.

762
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:41,588
And now, you can't force her
to prove it for you either.

763
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,414
You never returned my call
last night.

764
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:52,933
Well, what could be different
about last night

765
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:55,769
than the night before?
Hmm?

766
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:57,771
Maybe the fact
that you went to Harvey

767
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,973
and you threw me
in his face.

768
00:30:00,057 --> 00:30:03,092
Um, I was just telling it
how it was.

769
00:30:03,144 --> 00:30:04,945
He's already
got it in for us anyway.

770
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,482
Well, that's my business
with him, not yours.

771
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:11,201
You're right.
I'm sorry.

772
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:14,654
I never wanted to make things
awkward for you and Harvey.

773
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:19,042
You made things awkward
for you and me.

774
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,127
- Donna--
- I like you, Stephen,

775
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:23,013
and I have enjoyed
our short-term arrangement,

776
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:24,831
but I don't enjoy
complications.

777
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:28,385
I don't either,
but it seems we have one.

778
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:32,722
Now, I'm affected by you
more than I thought,

779
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,725
and I'm finding I'd like
to extend our term.

780
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:42,632
I'll take your offer
under advisement.

781
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:54,828
I am not selling my shares
to that man.

782
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,580
I don't know you
that well, Ava,

783
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,314
and I won't pretend
that I do,

784
00:30:58,366 --> 00:30:59,916
but we do have something
in common.

785
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,084
What is that?

786
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,953
I merged
with Edward Darby

787
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:04,788
to save my firm
from being hijacked

788
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,590
by my piece of shit
ex-partner.

789
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,175
And what exactly
does that give us in common?

790
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,878
I know what it's like
to prefer rotting in the ground

791
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:15,549
than letting my enemy
take what's mine.

792
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,350
I said,
"rotting in a cell."

793
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:19,052
I wasn't
up on murder charges.

794
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:20,503
And you'd rather
have died?

795
00:31:20,555 --> 00:31:22,939
I was speaking metaphorically,
as I'm sure you were.

796
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,724
Was I?

797
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,193
You won't be able
to run your company from a cell.

798
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,178
My point is,

799
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,314
I didn't want to merge,

800
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:34,234
but I did what I had to do
to keep my company mine.

801
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:37,186
And how is that
working out for you?

802
00:31:37,238 --> 00:31:39,372
It has
its ups and downs,

803
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:41,858
but I wouldn't be
standing here in front of you

804
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:43,293
if I hadn't done it.

805
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,912
Not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

806
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:48,331
Ava...

807
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:51,534
Do this.
Get free of your murder charges.

808
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:54,504
Nobody is saying we can't try

809
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:58,475
to get you
out of this deal later.

810
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,760
I don't care what it takes,
I'm not losing to that guy.

811
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:02,596
We need to find a way
around spousal privilege.

812
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,880
I don't see how we can.

813
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:05,398
Stupid goddamn law.
Excuse me.

814
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:07,734
It's not entirely stupid.

815
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:09,436
Oh, what, so now,
you're on his side?

816
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,220
No, privilege exists
for a reason.

817
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:12,388
You don't want
to have to worry

818
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,323
about what you trust
your partner with.

819
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,407
That's assuming your partner

820
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:15,575
even trusts you
in the first place.

821
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,060
What is that even
supposed to mean?

822
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:20,664
It means, when were you gonna
tell me you applied to Stanford?

823
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:33,209
Okay, so that's why you've
barely said three words to me

824
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,679
since last night.
My dad told you.

825
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,027
No, no, he didn't tell me,
he asked me how I felt about it

826
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,529
because he assumed I knew,
like I know

827
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,551
about all the East Coast schools
that you applied to.

828
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:42,686
- Mike--
- First you didn't want me

829
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,220
to meet your parents,
and now this?

830
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:45,755
Yeah, and I changed my mind
about you meeting my parents,

831
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:48,274
which I'm now
beginning to regret.

832
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,976
Oh, why, because I found out
you hid something from me?

833
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,461
Like you never
hid anything from me.

834
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:53,480
I hid something from you,
it kept us apart.

835
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:56,099
What brought us together
was me telling you everything.

836
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,319
- I was going to tell you.
- When?

837
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:01,938
Before I went,
on Friday.

838
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:07,127
You're going there?

839
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:09,412
I got an interview.
I'm sorry.

840
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:10,714
I just didn't know
how to tell you, mi--

841
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:11,881
- I don't know, how about,
"Hey, Mike,

842
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,717
I might go to law school
3,000 miles away"?

843
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,264
I don't even know
if I'm gonna get in,

844
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,053
which is exactly why I didn't
want to have this conversation.

845
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,672
No, you didn't want to have it
because you might go there

846
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:22,342
and you're too afraid
to say it.

847
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:26,596
Okay.
I might want to go there.

848
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:28,898
I've said it.

849
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,079
You may enter.

850
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:46,149
I'm afraid I've got
a bit of a sticky wicket.

851
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:48,952
That sounds uncomfortable.

852
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:51,671
The Hong Kong office urgently
requires me for a few weeks.

853
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,289
Normally,
I'd bring Mikado, but--

854
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,708
Whoa, wait,
are you asking me to--

855
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,543
I can't get her papers
in time.

856
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:58,211
She'd be facing quarantine.

857
00:33:58,295 --> 00:33:59,328
She'd sooner die.

858
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,497
You already
understand her so well.

859
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,499
I do, yet a request
of this magnitude--

860
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:07,103
No, you're probably right,
it's too much to ask.

861
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,890
I'm sure there is
a suitable luxury feline hotel.

862
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:13,443
Don't play games, okay?
We both know there isn't.

863
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,447
- So you'll do it?
- N--yes, can I have her?

864
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,865
Do you have a minute?

865
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,400
I don't really feel like
talking about us right now.

866
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:22,869
It's not about that.
Our discussion gave me an idea.

867
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:25,021
Our discussion?

868
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:27,190
Can we please not fight
about what to call our fight?

869
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:28,458
What's the idea?

870
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,043
We don't do good cop,
bad cop anymore.

871
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:32,128
We do bad cop, bad cop.

872
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:35,031
The way I'm feeling right now,
yeah, I can do bad cop.

873
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:39,252
Since when
do you come out here?

874
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:41,471
Since they added
Asiago cheese.

875
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,507
Your reward of choice
for a job well done.

876
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:45,892
You remember that story?

877
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:48,094
First story you ever told me.
You think I'd forget?

878
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,729
That wasn't
the point of the story.

879
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:52,899
- I assume you got Ava to agree.
- Yes, I did.

880
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:54,651
Should I be buying you
an Asiago bagel?

881
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,903
Poppy seed.

882
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:58,387
The "good news, bad news"
bagel.

883
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,023
Gianopolous agreed
to the deal.

884
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:01,224
He gave up
Cameron Dennis.

885
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:02,575
What's the bad news?

886
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,160
Cameron
protected himself.

887
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,746
He never explicitly told
Gianopolous about the tape

888
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,414
and never actually
showed him the tape.

889
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:11,000
So what's
the good news?

890
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,203
He never explicitly
said anything,

891
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:18,258
but he left Gianopolous alone
in the room with that tape.

892
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,415
Late night?

893
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,534
No sleep at all.

894
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:34,708
The ulcer?

895
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:35,942
No, Nigel's cat.

896
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:38,045
You slept at Nigel's?

897
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,381
No, he's out of town.
I'm cat-sitting.

898
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:42,549
Mikado won't drink her cream

899
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,618
unless it's precisely
5.5 degrees celsius,

900
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,749
she turned her nose up
at Bruno's origami collection,

901
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:51,008
and she won't use her litter box
unless it's facing London.

902
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:52,843
Hate that damn thing.

903
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:54,561
You're loving every second
with her, aren't you?

904
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:57,681
All 86,400 of them.

905
00:35:57,766 --> 00:36:01,568
By the way, you don't have
that glow today, Donna.

906
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:03,070
You stop yoga?

907
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:04,655
I took
a couple nights off.

908
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:06,073
Is this
because of Harvey?

909
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,474
'Cause I don't care
what he says, Donna,

910
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:09,076
you can't let work
get in the way of that glow.

911
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:12,363
You know what, Louis,
you're right.

912
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:14,865
I'm gonna schedule
an extra long session tonight.

913
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:17,818
Ooh, can I come?

914
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:27,044
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

915
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:28,879
I'm here to tell you
that you lost.

916
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:30,881
I didn't lose.
I may not have much time,

917
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:33,717
but I still got--
That tape?

918
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:36,770
Not anymore,
unless you want to dispute

919
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,672
Tony Gianopolous'
sworn statement

920
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:41,675
that you left him alone
with it.

921
00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:51,702
I can fight this.

922
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:52,907
Chain of custody
is something

923
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:54,822
I know a little bit about,
thanks to you.

924
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:56,240
That tape is gone,
and so are you.

925
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:58,826
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Admit it, Cameron, I beat you.

926
00:36:58,877 --> 00:37:02,195
Save yourself the embarrassment,
and cancel this trial.

927
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:04,214
If you think
I would ever do that,

928
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:06,533
I taught you
even less than I thought.

929
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:09,536
This case was 50/50.
All you did was make it 80/20.

930
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:11,088
99 to 1.

931
00:37:11,172 --> 00:37:13,140
It could be a million to one
for all I care.

932
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:16,593
We're in the ring, I'm still
standing, and this isn't done.

933
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:20,147
Now get out of my face.
I got a trial to prepare for.

934
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,073
- What do you want?
- This is a request

935
00:37:30,158 --> 00:37:31,825
for charges to be filed
against Graham Stenton

936
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:33,393
for stealing $30 million.

937
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:35,565
The penalty for which
is 15 years in a federal prison.

938
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:36,730
If you had proof of that,
you wouldn't have

939
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,081
come after me
in the first place.

940
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,733
We have proof that you knew
something was wrong

941
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:41,401
and you didn't notify
your employer.

942
00:37:41,453 --> 00:37:42,736
Which is why
this is a request for charges

943
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:45,422
to be filed against you
as an accessory after the fact.

944
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:48,258
The penalty for which is
five years in a federal prison.

945
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:50,928
But you can avoid that
by testifying against him.

946
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:54,181
Even if I was willing to,
I can't.

947
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:56,099
We're married.
He'd stop me from testifying.

948
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:58,185
In New York,
not in Connecticut.

949
00:37:58,252 --> 00:37:59,686
Which is where the charges
will be filed.

950
00:37:59,754 --> 00:38:02,189
You're asking me
to turn against the man I love.

951
00:38:02,256 --> 00:38:03,807
Then go to jail
and trust him.

952
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:06,360
I'm guessing he's not gonna
be there when you get out.

953
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:09,279
Beth,
even if he waits for you,

954
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:12,232
he did this, and the fear
of him getting caught

955
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:14,284
is going to cast a shadow
over every moment

956
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:18,455
of the rest of your life
together.

957
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,458
He may not be able to see that,
but I know you can.

958
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:33,470
I'll get you
the money back.

959
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,394
What are you doing?

960
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:42,179
Just leaving a note.

961
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:45,966
By the way,
congratulations.

962
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,401
I hear you got the tape
thrown out

963
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:49,853
and Ava reinstated
as the CEO.

964
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:52,239
- In spite of you.
- Yeah, I know.

965
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:55,325
You went to Jessica
for help.

966
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,528
- You have a problem with that?
- No.

967
00:38:57,612 --> 00:39:00,981
I just think it's ironic
that she doesn't realize

968
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:04,317
she just helped me
dig her own grave.

969
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:12,376
It's me.

970
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,683
Money got wired
into the account.

971
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:22,002
Congratulations.

972
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:23,470
I don't think
she would've caved

973
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:26,356
if you hadn't broken script
and gone all good cop on me.

974
00:39:29,644 --> 00:39:30,978
Look, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry-

975
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:32,980
Rachel--
No, Mike.

976
00:39:33,031 --> 00:39:34,982
We're in a fight
because I made the mistake

977
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:38,184
of not telling you that I was
considering going to Stanford,

978
00:39:38,236 --> 00:39:39,352
but we're really
in a fight

979
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:41,855
because I'm considering
going to Stanford.

980
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:45,792
What you said to Beth,
was that really about me?

981
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,221
- Mike, come on.
- Because you said

982
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:49,880
the fear of him getting caught
was gonna cast a shadow

983
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:52,049
over every minute of the rest
of their life together.

984
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:55,419
If you're asking
if it's occurred to me

985
00:39:55,503 --> 00:40:01,174
that going to Stanford
could be a fresh start...

986
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:02,175
Yeah.

987
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:04,144
It has,
but the truth is

988
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,546
I may or may not
get into Yale or Columbia,

989
00:40:06,598 --> 00:40:08,599
and you were the one
that told me

990
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:11,401
that it'd be stupid
if I didn't just cover my bases,

991
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:15,322
so I just need to go
and see if I even get in or not.

992
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:17,524
I get it.

993
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:18,525
I get all of it.

994
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:19,616
I just can't stop thinking

995
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:22,279
about what will happen
if you do.

996
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,000
You came to the decision

997
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:29,953
to let me in on your secret
on your own,

998
00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:33,874
and I just need you
to give me the freedom

999
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:36,960
to come to this decision
on my own.

1000
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:42,749
I'm not one
for sentimental gestures,

1001
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,801
but I was thinking
about when Hardman came back

1002
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:48,254
and you and I got into it.

1003
00:40:48,306 --> 00:40:50,273
You got me
my tea set back.

1004
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:52,592
You here to thank me
for that?

1005
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:55,762
I'm here with a gesture
of my own.

1006
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,037
This isn't a tea set.

1007
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:07,624
It's going up on the wall
tomorrow.

1008
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,326
I asked for that
a while ago.

1009
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,794
You said I wasn't ready.

1010
00:41:10,878 --> 00:41:12,829
I also said
I wasn't just going to slap

1011
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:16,717
someone else's name up there
next to mine, but I did.

1012
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:21,088
And now you regret it.

1013
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:23,757
And you're playing chess
again.

1014
00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:25,425
What does that mean?

1015
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:28,011
It means, I want to know
if this is a gesture

1016
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:31,181
or if it's a move.

1017
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:35,902
What it is,
is my way of showing you

1018
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:39,305
that Darby's treating me
the same way I treated you,

1019
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:42,526
and I understand
how you felt.

1020
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,362
You don't like it,

1021
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:50,117
and this is your way
of getting me on your side.

1022
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:53,336
Harvey, I can't make you
believe me,

1023
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:55,956
but I don't want you
on my side.

1024
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:58,959
I want us to be
on the same side.
