2
00:00:01,504 --> 00:00:02,968
I'm bonding
with your father here.

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,661
- Speaking of which--
- You're not taking it easy

4
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:05,792
on me, are you?
A little.

5
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:07,351
You mean something to me.

6
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:09,270
You've always meant something
to me

7
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:12,140
and you always will mean
something to me.

8
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,442
What do you need, Harvey?

9
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:16,060
Ava Hessington.

10
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:17,945
I am not losing to him.

11
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,197
You.

12
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:22,066
Your blood feud
or whatever it is

13
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:24,067
you have with that man
is what put the target

14
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,546
on my back in the first place.

15
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:28,295
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

16
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:31,300
Harvey and Cameron made a deal
to take you down.

17
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:34,032
And part of that deal
was that I got to be the one

18
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,200
to tell you about it.

19
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:36,845
If he can't practice law
in the country,

20
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:38,132
he can't be a member
of our firm.

21
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:39,788
You set this whole thing up.

22
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:41,823
Jessica set
this whole thing up.

23
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,525
And, Edward,
we may be getting a divorce,

24
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,128
but I fully intend on keeping
ownership of the house.

25
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:03,728
Oh, come on, just because
I have to wake up early

26
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,230
doesn't mean you
should suffer.

27
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:06,435
Well, you know
what they say.

28
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:08,549
The couple
that wakes together...

29
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,985
Bakes together?

30
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:14,055
- Stays together.
- Yeah, that doesn't rhyme.

31
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,241
You're ridiculous.

32
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:20,895
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

33
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:22,563
I know.

34
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,832
You're amazing.

35
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:25,834
I know.

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,459
You have no intention of
letting me go to work, do you?

37
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:39,380
There once was a girl
from Nantucket.

38
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,217
I love you.

39
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,584
Oh, that doesn't rhyme,
you know?

40
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:44,936
What are you,
the rhyming police now?

41
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,305
- You started it.
- And I'm gonna finish it.

42
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:49,691
I love you too.
[Both chuckle]

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,320
You look happier
than you did last night.

44
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:04,322
I am.

45
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,575
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,377
I was thinking
I'd give you a ride.

47
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:10,912
You just gave me a ride
last night.

48
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:13,331
Yeah, this time
I thought I'd join you.

49
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,616
Harvey,
we put in 15-hour days

50
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,801
12 feet from each other.

51
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,406
You really want
to go to work together?

52
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,121
Who said anything
about work?

53
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,506
We have breakfast
at Nougatine

54
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,675
and an excursion to Hermes
that may or may not

55
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,459
involve a new handbag.

56
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,729
You've been needing
a new handbag.

57
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,463
You can never have
too many handbags.

58
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:30,836
You're a woman
after my own heart.

59
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,684
Well, in that case...

60
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:40,108
Harvey...
Why are you doing this?

61
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,660
Donna, we've all
been through a lot.

62
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,497
We deserve
a little celebration.

63
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,533
Well, in that case,
you have had it pretty rough.

64
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:50,835
We're gonna need to get you
more than one handbag.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,672
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

66
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,685
Jessica.

67
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,688
Louis, what can I do
for you?

68
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,140
Actually, I'm not here
about me.

69
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,274
I'm here about you.

70
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:15,860
How so?

71
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:20,698
[Sighs]
Um...

72
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,066
I want to handle
the dissolution.

73
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,785
So this is about you.

74
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:26,354
No.
Jessica...

75
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:28,957
I got Ava out
when you wanted her out.

76
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,708
I proved that I will do
whatever it takes.

77
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,194
And what's more,
I know Darby's assets,

78
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,246
and I will get you everything
that you have coming.

79
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,881
I can get everything
I have coming.

80
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,833
Maybe, but after
what Stephen Huntley

81
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:41,125
and Edward Darby did, you want
to exact a pound of flesh.

82
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:44,639
You want to kill them both.

83
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,040
What's your point?

84
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,011
My point is, is that you go
into that room angry,

85
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,178
you're gonna have blinders on.

86
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,180
And they're gonna lead you
any way they want you to go.

87
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,182
I get in that room,
I'm cool as a cucumber,

88
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,385
and I will lead whatever way
you want to go.

89
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,221
We just got Edward Darby's
proposed formula

90
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,889
for splitting our assets.

91
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,830
- Son of a bitch.
- I know!

92
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:10,782
He thinks he can dictate terms
after what he's done?

93
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:11,899
We need to crush him.

94
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,117
See?
Blinders.

95
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:14,619
What?

96
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:17,171
Louis was just suggesting
that he run the negotiations.

97
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,291
Louis also suggested the firm
adopt a badger as a mascot.

98
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,909
The badger is a noble
and fearsome creature,

99
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,795
but that's not the point.
I can beat them.

100
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,129
And the Washington Generals
think they can beat

101
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,598
the Globetrotters,
but they're not even

102
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,915
in the same league.

103
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,300
My father played
for the Washington Generals.

104
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:30,935
- See?
- So what are you saying?

105
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,470
I'm not in your league?
I'm saying you and I

106
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:33,921
don't even play the same sport.

107
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,858
Harvey...enough.
And Louis has a point.

108
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,759
You seriously want
to consider this?

109
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,894
This is a joke.

110
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:42,780
Louis, will you give us
a moment?

111
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,866
Please?

112
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:50,989
I am not a joke.

113
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,912
You can't do that anymore.

114
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,113
You mean make fun of Louis?

115
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:00,748
It's one of life's
great pleasures.

116
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,199
When the two of you
were colleagues,

117
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,285
that's fair game,
but you're a name partner now,

118
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,816
and you have to show him
some respect.

119
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,255
I am showing him respect.

120
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:10,958
I'm being dismissive
to his face.

121
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,428
Harvey, remember Kopelman?

122
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,513
Combovers like that
are hard to forget.

123
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,232
When I first started here,
he and I would fight

124
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,736
like cats and dogs every day,
toe-to-toe.

125
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:23,071
Then one day
he went too far.

126
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,323
He crossed a line,
and I'd had enough,

127
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:28,809
and I went in,
and I ripped him up.

128
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,478
You know what I did the day
after Daniel and I

129
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,697
took over the firm?

130
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:36,984
I went to Kopelman, and I told
him how much I valued him.

131
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,088
Kopelman never voted
against you

132
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:41,822
the whole time I knew him.

133
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,708
Exactly.

134
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,126
And by the way,
Louis is right.

135
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:48,296
Jessica, it's one thing for me
to show Louis respect.

136
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,932
But you want to put me
on the sidelines for him?

137
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,383
No.

138
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,769
I'm gonna put him in
at quarterback,

139
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:57,021
then snap the ball to you.

So let me get this straight.

150
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,561
You want to go after
their clients

151
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:31,937
so we get to count
those revenues.

152
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:34,611
Whoever has more revenue
is gonna determine

153
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,279
who gets what at the time
of closing.

154
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,764
Louis locks in
the settlement terms

155
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,316
while we tip the basis
for the settlement.

156
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,817
Exactly.

157
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,819
Some might say that's
negotiating in bad faith.

158
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,706
And I say Darby wasn't above
board when we got married.

159
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,608
Why should we be above board
when we're getting divorced?

160
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,993
And until the settlement
is done,

161
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:51,118
it's not stealing clients.

162
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,113
It's shifting
the attorney of record.

163
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,215
[Chuckles]
Wait a minute.

164
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,134
Did you think of this
all by yourself?

165
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,898
Why wouldn't I think of this
all by myself?

166
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,387
It as Jessica, wasn't it?

167
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,972
She thought of it
all by yourself.

168
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,790
The important thing right now
is to decide

169
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,258
which client to go after.

170
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,960
And to avoid my question
about whose idea it was.

171
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,679
- Exactly.
- Okay.

172
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,131
Well, if it's going to affect
the settlement calculations,

173
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,567
we're gonna need a big client
and we're gonna need a big one

174
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,985
who just took a loss.

175
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,903
Not necessarily.

176
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,322
You know who cries hardest
in the Miss America pageant?

177
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,191
- The runner-up.
- The winner...

178
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,243
Because she knows
she can't win again,

179
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,529
and winners always want
to win more.

180
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,698
Yeah.
That's not why they cry.

181
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,700
What's wrong with you?
Stay with me.

182
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:33,336
What we need is a huge company
that is still looking

183
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,671
to keep the crown.

184
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:36,707
[Sighs]

185
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:39,843
Both:
Samsung.

186
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,095
- Get it going.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,997
Wait. Do you--
you actually watch

188
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,182
the Miss America pageant?

189
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,017
No, but I've celebrated
with the winner.

190
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:50,336
- Texas, Florida, New York?
- California.

191
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,689
Now, there's a question
you didn't want to avoid.

192
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:55,025
Exactly.

193
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,279
You wanted to see me?

194
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,782
- Yes, and it's important.
- What can I do for you?

195
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,984
Adjust the font
on the new business cards?

196
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:06,203
Order some pens?
I don't know.

197
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,788
If we don't have any pens,

198
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,906
what would you sign
the order with?

199
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,374
What do you want, Jessica?

200
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,709
I was just making
a little joke.

201
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:14,861
Oh, I thought I was
the only joke around here.

202
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,381
Louis, you are no joke.

203
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,750
And you're right.

204
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:23,053
You have been on the sidelines
far too long.

205
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:26,890
I want you to handle
the negotiations.

206
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,391
You won't be sorry.

207
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:29,593
You want a pound of flesh,

208
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:30,644
I'm gonna bring you
the whole carcass.

209
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,878
I believe you would,

210
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,230
but I'm going to ask you
to do something else.

211
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,348
- Anything you need.
- I need you to be fair.

212
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:41,404
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

213
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,824
- That's one way to go.
- It's <i>the</i> way to go...

214
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,243
Because I need them to think
that we're moving on,

215
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,745
when, in fact,
we're going after their clients.

216
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,564
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

217
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,200
You and Harvey are letting me in
on one of your missions?

218
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:55,669
This is Litt-tastic.
Louis, calm down.

219
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,870
Calm down?
No!

220
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:58,338
This is just like
<i>The Great Escape.</i>

221
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,840
You're recruiting me
to go behind enemy lines.

222
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,341
I'm Steve McQueen.

223
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,759
- You know <i>The Great Escape?</i>
- <i>Are you kidding?</i>

224
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:04,511
Charles Bronson grew up
in my grandmother's shtetl.

225
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,548
Then you know Steve McQueen
was the cooler king.

226
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:12,519
Louis, I need you to be
my cooler king.

227
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,855
Yeah, I am cool.

228
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,224
So you're authorizing me
to sign on your behalf?

229
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,093
Yes, but under
no circumstances

230
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,729
are you to lock in the existing
client allocations.

231
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,114
Please, I'd die
before that happens.

232
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,782
Let's hope it doesn't come
to that.

233
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:30,453
- Is that coconut water?
- Yeah.

234
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:31,938
I'm sorry.

235
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,269
I took some with me
this morning.

236
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:34,491
I hope you don't mind.

237
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,992
Why would I mind?
You needed the hydration.

238
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,245
You made me need
the hydration.

239
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,412
You're welcome.

240
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:41,965
[Chuckles]

241
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,788
- What?
- Nothing.

242
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,340
What?

243
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,592
Uh...

244
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,627
I just don't like
when you drink

245
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,513
from the bottles
in the refrigerator.

246
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,815
- But it's my bottle.
- The ones in my fridge aren't.

247
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,317
So you do mind
that I took it.

248
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:05,272
No, I mind that you drink
from the bottles in my fridge.

249
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:06,639
Okay.

250
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:11,194
And that you left your
coffee mug in the sink again.

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,696
I thought I was supposed
to put the mug in the sink.

252
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,698
Yes, on the right side.
The left side is for rinsing.

253
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,783
I can't rinse if there
are dishes piled on both sides.

254
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,484
I'll try and remember that.

255
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,821
You'd think a guy with your
memory wouldn't have to try.

256
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:23,874
- All right, let's hear it.
- Hear what?

257
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,508
- The list.
- What list?

258
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:26,793
Of things I do
that annoy you.

259
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:28,261
- I don't have a list.
- Everyone has a list.

260
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:29,846
- Do you have a list?
- This isn't about my list.

261
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,164
This is about your list.

262
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,133
No, it's about yours
because I just told you

263
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:34,500
everything that's on mine.

264
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,853
You're telling me
that the most meticulous woman

265
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:39,005
on the upper West Side
only has a list of two?

266
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,690
- That's not fair.
- No, what's not fair

267
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,442
is you making this
all about me.

268
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,561
I might not be perfect,
but neither are you.

269
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,613
So, excuse me, I have more
important things to do

270
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,450
than talk about where
I left my coffee cup.

271
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,985
- Fair?
- Fair.

272
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:55,705
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

273
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,458
I didn't even like playing
nice in the sandbox.

274
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,542
Someone has better sand toys,

275
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:00,827
you take 'em.
Exactly.

276
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:02,362
And you don't ask
Bolshoi ballerinas

277
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,580
to dance the tango.

278
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,225
[Scoffs] That would indeed
be blasphemy.

279
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,583
If Jessica wants compromise,

280
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,336
she should hire a mediator,
not a gladiator.

281
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:11,388
Except Jessica
doesn't want compromise.

282
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,840
She wants a stone-cold killer to
do one thing and one thing only.

283
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,258
And what is that?

284
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,894
Not to lock client allocations
till Harvey lands Samsung.

285
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:19,229
Then give me an order.

286
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,232
Your order is to not let
my inner gladiator

287
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:24,050
get past my outer negotiator.

288
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,069
That's not
gonna be easy, Louis.

289
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,873
You're like the Hulk--
once you get enraged,

290
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,322
there's no going back.

291
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,723
Though your description
of both my temperament

292
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,943
and physique is accurate,
the one thing that I have

293
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,245
on my side is that I have
no personal animus

294
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,330
against the other side.

295
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,039
Nesbitt.

296
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,958
Litt.

297
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,076
I see you're wearing
your checkered suit

298
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,577
with your crimson power tie.

299
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,213
You see correctly.

300
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:54,747
Looks like you came
to play hardball.

301
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,999
I didn't come
to play anything.

302
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,750
I came to win.
Well, I'm not here to win.

303
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,220
I'm here to make sure we
hammer out a fair agreement.

304
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:01,721
And to help you achieve that,

305
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,806
I see you've brought along
Tinker Bell.

306
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:05,635
You were so scared
of Tinker Bell,

307
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,391
you sent her to Barcelona,
for your cat trial.

308
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,135
During which time,
she worked closely,

309
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:11,120
with a different senior partner...

310
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:14,341
again and again.

311
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:17,227
[Groans]
Don't worry.

312
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:19,562
Dr. Banner's
not turning green today.

313
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,315
See, whatever you thought was
gonna happen to me here isn't.

314
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,651
So go ahead,
wind me up all you want,

315
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,186
'cause I ain't losing my cool.

316
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,304
Fine.

317
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,657
This is my initial proposal.

318
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,997
Those are letters
I wrote to Mikado.

319
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:39,165
Unopened.

320
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,700
You never read them to her?

321
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:43,152
- Not a single word.
- You son of a bitch.

322
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,505
You think you can rattle me?
I'm un-rattleable.

323
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,841
Really?

324
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:50,627
This portrait
that you sent her.

325
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,048
Get out!

326
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:57,050
- Louis--
- I said go.

327
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,141
Oh, yeah, you and I
are going to war.

328
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,110
Everything's
on the goddamn table!

329
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,779
Including the existing
client list allocations?

330
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:13,116
Did you hear what I just said?
I said everything!

331
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,691
You son of a bitch.

332
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,293
You knew
I'd come after Samsung.

333
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,662
I knew what suit
you'd be wearing.

334
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,998
I know Tiger Woods
wears red on Sundays.

335
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,332
It doesn't mean
I can beat him.

336
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:32,302
I'm not going to let you poach
our clients, Harvey.

337
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,203
You poaching our clients
is what led us

338
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:36,506
to this goddamn merger
in the first place.

339
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:38,808
That was fair game.
This is bad faith.

340
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:41,210
Bad faith?
I'm going after Samsung.

341
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:43,622
I'm not murdering anybody and
lying about it to my partners.

342
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,148
Don't you dare put me in
with them.

343
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,733
You put yourself in
with them.

344
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,384
Speaking of which,
what the hell you still doing

345
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,886
in bed with these people,
Scottie?

346
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:52,439
As you know, I don't always
have the best judgment

347
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:53,940
of who I get in bed with.

348
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,608
And as for why I'm still
in business with them--

349
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:56,826
Let me guess.

350
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,945
You beat me
on the dissolution negotiation,

351
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,163
you get your name on the door.

352
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,331
Yep.
Darby agreed to it

353
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:03,283
the second
that you pushed him out.

354
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,168
He only did that because
he knew when word got out

355
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:07,120
that his house was on fire,
he had to do something.

356
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,372
Well, he did.
He put me against you.

357
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:11,908
And as you just noted,
our house is on fire,

358
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,960
and I'm gonna fight tooth and
nail to put the damn thing out.

359
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:16,079
You can fight tooth and nail
all you like,

360
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,381
but it's never done a thing
for you against me before.

361
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:19,883
That's because I always
had something else

362
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:21,468
on my mind before,

363
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:24,387
but you've made it clear that
that's never going to happen.

364
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:25,755
So, if you think
you're gonna win this time,

365
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,524
you've got
another thing coming.

366
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:28,942
Say what you want, Scottie.

367
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm going in there,
and you're not gonna stop me.

368
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:33,763
[Cell phone chimes]

369
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:35,148
I'm afraid I already did.

370
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:36,783
Client list just got locked.

371
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,768
So you can go in there
and give it a shot,

372
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:39,986
but they're never gonna sign
with a guy

373
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:42,789
who just got played
on their front porch.

374
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,308
- Hey.
- Hey.

375
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,837
I got your message.

376
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,191
Thanks for meeting me.

377
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,610
It's not often I get invited
out to hear an apology.

378
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:05,146
I'm so sorry
I snapped at you.

379
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,317
I got defensive, and when I went
away to think about it,

380
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,536
I came up with why.

381
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,753
Why?

382
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:15,156
I feel like a guest
in your apartment.

383
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,509
And I think it's because
we spend all of our time

384
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:19,795
at your place and none
of the time at mine.

385
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:21,296
Yeah, but I told you,
when I'm at your place,

386
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:23,832
all I can picture is Tess
in a bedsheet.

387
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:27,002
I know.
And that's why we're here.

388
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,137
Come on, I want
to show you something.

389
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,027
Louis, we gave you one job,
and you blew it.

390
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:37,229
How the hell did you screw up
those negotiations?

391
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:38,513
Screw up? Come on.
What are you talking about?

392
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:39,531
I got us the corporate jet.

393
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:41,016
We keep
our first dividend checks,

394
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,234
and they pay
for our new letterhead.

395
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:43,535
So you know what?

396
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,120
You just put that in your pipe,
and you smoke it.

397
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,539
I don't give a shit
about the goddamn letterhead!

398
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:48,991
You don't think
I know that?

399
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:51,743
Nobody cares about
the goddamn letterhead, okay?

400
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,295
Nigel went after Mikado.

401
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:54,913
What the hell is Mikado?

402
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:56,415
Not "what," "who."
She's a cat.

403
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:58,050
He went after your cat?

404
00:15:58,134 --> 00:15:59,468
He went after his cat.

405
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:03,171
He tortured his cat?

406
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:06,642
He deprived her
of my letters.

407
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:12,147
Louis, you lost your shit
during a negotiation

408
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:14,549
because someone didn't read
your letters to their cat?

409
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:18,320
Harvey, please.
I'm sorry I lost my head.

410
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:20,722
I don't even remember
signing the agreement.

411
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,991
Well, you did!

412
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,610
And, Louis,
you've been asking Jessica

413
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:26,227
to give you the ball
instead of me

414
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,246
ever since the day I met you.

415
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,730
Well, she gave it to you,

416
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:32,334
and you just went and scored
a touchdown for the other team.

417
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,915
Oh, my God.

418
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,017
Your grandmother's apartment.

419
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:51,470
I still own it.

420
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:55,524
You kept it
this entire time?

421
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:57,809
I couldn't rent it.

422
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:58,977
I couldn't sell it.

423
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:01,113
I...

424
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:02,564
Couldn't even come here.

425
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:04,616
That means the last time
you were here...

426
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,952
We were here.

427
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:08,620
So you want to move in here?

428
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:10,622
I want us to move in here.

429
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,410
- Mike--
- Rachel.

430
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:17,913
I've only ever been here twice,

431
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:21,116
and both times were with you.

432
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,585
The first time we stood here,

433
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:26,955
and we pictured
living together.

434
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:29,508
I'll never forget that.

435
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,978
- Neither will I.
- And the second time...

436
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:36,148
Was one of the hardest days
of my life,

437
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:40,018
but I got through it
because we were together.

438
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:48,994
That's one the sweetest things
I've ever heard.

439
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:56,618
You don't have to answer
right now, okay?

440
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:00,422
I just wanted to show you
what we could have.

441
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:10,048
Goddamn Louis.

442
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,666
Let it go.

443
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:13,051
Let it go?

444
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:14,603
You don't say "let it go"

445
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,855
unless you already
didn't let it go.

446
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:19,474
You gonna take it out on me
for taking it out on him?

447
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,276
At the moment,
we don't have the time.

448
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,811
Good, because
I've already got Mike

449
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:24,696
looking for ways
to revise the agreement.

450
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,114
The problem
isn't revising it.

451
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:28,066
The problem is
Louis already signed it.

452
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,785
You're saying
we need to find a loophole.

453
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:31,036
I am.

454
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,654
Well, if we can't steal
from their clients

455
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,623
and the revenues from new ones
don't count,

456
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,158
what the hell
are we supposed to do?

457
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,793
There's only one thing
to do--

458
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,300
look at the money
we're already owed.

459
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,880
- I don't follow you.
- We're on a cash basis.

460
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:44,532
We can't count the revenues
we haven't collected yet.

461
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:47,368
But if we can entice someone
to pay us sooner,

462
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,388
we can get that revenue in
under the window.

463
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:51,039
Bad faith--
I like it.

464
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,931
The question is,
who still owes us enough money

465
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,375
to make a difference?

466
00:18:54,427 --> 00:18:55,543
Folsom Foods.

467
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:56,878
The second they pay
their settlement,

468
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,096
we get paid our fee.

469
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,564
You came to that
all on your own.

470
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:02,350
Yeah, about an hour ago.
Don't tell me I beat you to it.

471
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:04,402
Maybe. But you didn't have
Harvey slowing you down.

472
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,271
- That's a fair point.
- Okay, I'm right here.

473
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,056
Well, your idea is no good,

474
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,574
because it'll be
a cold day in hell

475
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:12,110
before Daniel Hardman lifts
a finger to help this firm,

476
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:14,279
and I'd rather lose
this negotiation

477
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,083
than to cut a deal
with that son of a bitch.

478
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:18,233
You don't have to.
Hardman was running point.

479
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:20,902
Folsom's not his client.
They're Robert Zane's.

480
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,538
- He's no fan of us either.
- Maybe not.

481
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:27,125
But we can handle
Robert Zane.

482
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:31,246
You caught on
to my plan there.

483
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:33,248
You mean the most obvious
plan in the world?

484
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,379
I mean the plan that
I thought of and that you didn't

485
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,252
and that I'm the perfect
person to implement.

486
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:39,354
You really think
you can handle Robert Zane?

487
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,722
I have a relationship
with him.

488
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,090
Yeah. You're sleeping
with his daughter.

489
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,608
I'm sure
he's your biggest fan.

490
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,778
Okay, it's not like that.
I had dinner at the man's house.

491
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,146
I had dinner
at the White House.

492
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:49,764
They're not gonna make me
Attorney General.

493
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:51,432
Okay, first of all,
bullshit.

494
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:53,085
Second of all,
do you have a better idea?

495
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,435
No, I don't.

496
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:56,371
But are you ready to use
your relationship with Rachel

497
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:57,789
to get her father to turn?

498
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,791
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not gonna do that.

499
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:01,910
I'm just gonna use it
to get him to hear me out

500
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:04,663
in the first place.
Good luck with that.

501
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:08,667
Hey, how'd you know that
White House thing was bullshit?

502
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:19,127
Mike. I was wondering when
I was gonna get you out here.

503
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,461
Ah, golf isn't really
my thing.

504
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:22,597
What is your thing?

505
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,799
- Sports.
- You're telling me

506
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,818
you're one of those guys
that doesn't think

507
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,353
golf is a sport?
Of course not.

508
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,323
I can tell you're an athlete
just by looking at you, sir.

509
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:33,692
With an attitude like that,
you must be here on business.

510
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,160
- Folsom Foods.
- Ah...

511
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:37,312
You're gonna stick that loss
in my face?

512
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,531
No, I'm here to make
that loss sting a little less.

513
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,983
You move up your payment
by one fiscal quarter,

514
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,503
we'll take a 10% haircut
on our fee.

515
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:46,922
- 10% is a little light.
- All right.

516
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:49,341
I'll cut right to it.
I can go as high as 20%.

517
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:50,491
Are you saying 20%?

518
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:52,327
Yes.

519
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,829
Then I'm saying no.

520
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,516
Sir, this...
This is a win for you.

521
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,768
No, this isn't shit
for me.

522
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:02,437
This is about Harvey Specter
and Jessica Pearson

523
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:04,005
and their divorce negotiations.

524
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,341
And you don't go
to the one you didn't marry

525
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:08,059
to stick it
to the one you did.

526
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,178
We could go
straight to your client.

527
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,846
By the time
they accepted the offer,

528
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,398
it'd be too late.

529
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,350
You just gave that away
when you went straight to 20%.

530
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:17,702
I went straight to 20%
out of respect.

531
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:20,739
Now you're repaying me
by being a--

You don't have the balls
to say it.

I will.

A dick.
I'm being a dick.

536
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,698
The question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

537
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:35,003
I'm not gonna do
anything about it.

538
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:36,888
I just wonder
what your daughter's gonna think

539
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:38,807
when she finds out
you screwed over your own client

540
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:40,592
just to stick it
to the man she loves.

541
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,543
She loves Harvey Specter.

- I never heard back from you.
- About what?

549
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,240
About anything...

550
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,960
Especially what we're going
to do about negotiations.

551
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,762
There's no more negotiation.

552

It's football.

Harvey said it.

They gave me the ball.

558
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:31,893
I scored a touchdown
for the other team,

559

it's the eighth inning,

560

and there's no more time
left on the clock.

561

I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

562
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:38,432
It's the fact.
There's nothing we can do.

563
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:39,617
I signed the agreement,

564
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:41,202
and Nigel's
never gonna reopen it.

565

a good thing I found a loophole.

What are you talking about?

We can't steal
their clients,

but we can still increase
our revenue.

No. New clients
don't count.

I'm not talking
about new clients.

I'm talking about new revenue
from clients we already have.

out of the room.

629
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:31,872
That's a check
from Folsom Foods.

630
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,041
It's the remainder
of what they owe us.

631
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:36,877
Holy shit.
That's all of it.

632
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:39,547
It's hard to believe that
you could get Zane to do this

633
00:25:39,614 --> 00:25:41,134
without using
his daughter against him.

634
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,783
Maybe I'm
an excellent negotiator.

635
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,385
If you're
an excellent negotiator,

636
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:46,453
this wouldn't include
a 20% haircut.

637
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,506
It would be 10%,
like I would have gotten.

638
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,391
You? He wouldn't have
even talked to you.

639
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:53,127
Like you're not talking
to me right now?

640
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,062
What'd you say to Zane?

641
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,632
Let's just say we may have
gotten what we wanted, but...

642
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:01,102
My girlfriend's dad's gonna be
pissed at me for a little while.

643
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:03,521
Then you're a better
negotiator than I thought.

644
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:24,375
I never should have
given you my key.

645
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,177
And I never
should have forgotten

646
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:28,495
that you'll stop at nothing
to beat me.

647
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:29,997
No, you shouldn't have.

648
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,348
Harvey...

649
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,267
The man that I knew
may have fought to the death,

650
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,636
but he always operated
in good faith.

651
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:38,189
I told you, I am not bound
by good faith on this deal

652
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:39,724
after what your boss did.

653
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,892
It's not just Edward's firm.

654
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,110
What does that
have to do with it?

655
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:44,499
What does that
have to do with it?

656
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:46,363
You shrunk the whole pie
for the sole purpose

657
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:48,115
of getting a bigger piece
for yourself,

658
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:49,623
and it screwed me,
along with Edward.

659
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,786
What do you want, Scottie?

660
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:53,788
I want you to exclude
the Folsom Foods payments

661
00:26:53,855 --> 00:26:55,906
from the settlement
calculations.

662
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,076
And why would I do that?

663
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,661
Because I need you to.

664
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:03,464
I'm afraid that's not enough.

665
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,918
You, uh--
you came to me.

666
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,420
You needed help
with Ava Hessington

667
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,589
after you sent me back
to London.

668
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,153
You said that I mean
something to you,

669
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:16,260
that I'll--I'll always
mean something to you.

670
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,395
Was that bullshit or not?
It wasn't bullshit,

671
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,181
and if you're in trouble
personally--

672
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:22,683
I am in trouble personally.
You said so yourself.

673
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:26,220
Our house is on fire,
and it's my job to put it out.

674
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,905
If you crush me...

675
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,690
I'll have nothing.

676
00:27:29,741 --> 00:27:31,659
That's not personal.
That's business.

677
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:33,410
Okay,
let's talk business.

678
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:36,580
You made a career out
of putting I.O.U.s in the bank.

679
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:38,415
Do the same thing right now.

680
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,168
Put an I.O.U. in with me.

681
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:42,402
And what's to stop you

682
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,923
from still trying
to screw me after that?

683
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:47,875
My word that I won't.

684
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,301
He asked you
to move in together?

685
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,919
- I know. It's...
- Quick?

686
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:04,864
I was going to say
that it's a-a big step,

687
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:06,166
because it's not
really that quick.

688
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,717
We've known each other
for a while.

689
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,170
Yes, but you only
just started dating.

690
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,088
So I guess that means
you're against it.

691
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:14,390
Rachel,
I'm not against it.

692
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,808
You told me that you love him,

693
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,594
and I couldn't be happier
for you.

694
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:20,680
But you got a lot
going on right now.

695
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:22,932
You don't even know where
you're gonna go to law school.

696
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:24,383
I'm just saying

697
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:27,020
maybe you don't want to rush
into this so quickly.

698
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:29,355
Rush into what?

699
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:37,447
Well, Mike asked me
to move in with him.

700
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:39,449
[Chuckles]
Move in with him?

701
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:41,951
Shit, what's he gonna
do to me then?

702
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:44,704
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't hear?

703
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:46,256
He came to me
on the golf course.

704
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,790
To ask for permission?

705
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,261
[Chuckles]
No, he didn't ask for shit.

706
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:53,746
I got to hand it to him.
The boy's got some balls.

707
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:55,632
- What?
- He kicked my ass.

708
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:57,550
Didn't even have the courtesy
to give me a--

709
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:58,885
- Robert!
- Oh, come on.

710
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:01,387
She's gonna be a lawyer.
Gonna hear a lot worse.

711
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:03,439
Dad, what are you talking
about--what happened?

712
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:06,226
He wanted an advance
on the Folsom settlement.

713
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,361
And he put the screws to me
to get it.

714
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:10,863
He put the screws
to you how?

715
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:12,732
[Knock at door]

716
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,738
Rachel.
This is a surprise.

717
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:21,241
What happened to--
Tess in a bedsheet?

718
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:25,111
It was replaced by the image
of you manipulating my dad.

719
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:26,946
Okay, I did not manipulate
your dad.

720
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,665
How exactly
would you describe it?

721
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:31,134
I didn't go there
to manipulate him, all right?

722
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:32,579
He--he was about to make
a decision

723
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:34,420
that was going to affect him,
us, and his client,

724
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,672
and I just pointed that out
to him.

725
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:37,223
And then when
that didn't work,

726
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,624
you pointed out
that I wouldn't approve.

727
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,642
He was bullying me.

728
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,729
So you used me
to bully him back.

729
00:29:42,796 --> 00:29:45,348
I was talking to my mom
about moving in with you

730
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:48,101
when I found out about this.
Okay, Rachel...

731
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:50,603
I'm sorry, all right?

732
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:52,488
Let me call him right now.
I'll apologize to him--

733
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:53,740
Him?

734
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:55,692
He loved it!
He did?

735
00:29:55,776 --> 00:29:57,610
Yeah, he thought
you had balls.

736
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:59,779
- So then what's the problem?
- Are you not listening to me?

737
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,647
I was thinking
about moving in with you,

738
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,866
and then I find out
that you go to my dad--

739
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:05,335
Wait, wait, wait.
Are--

740
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,670
are you saying
this changes everything?

741
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:10,039
- It's complicated.
- What's complicated about it?

742
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:11,657
Forget--I don't even want
to get into this

743
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,209
with you right now!
Rachel, if you don't want

744
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:14,660
to live with me,
why don't you just tell me

745
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,880
you don't want to live with me?
I didn't say that.

746
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:19,799
Well, do you?

747
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:28,057
You said I could have
some time, so...

748
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:32,895
I just need some time.

749
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,162
[Footsteps approaching]

750
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:51,914
You excluded
the Folsom Foods payment

751
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,699
from the revenue totals
on this.

752
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,835
It's a draft document.
I haven't showed it to anyone.

753
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:57,203
I just wanted
to run it by you.

754
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:59,172
Well, what reason
could you possibly have

755
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,923
for wanting to do it at all?

756
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,592
Because Scottie
came to me and asked,

757
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:04,227
and I think
it's good business.

758
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:05,551
Well, your idea
of good business

759
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:06,879
is different from mine,

760
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,515
because we already took
less money from Folsom Foods,

761
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,651
and now you want us to take
less money from Darby.

762
00:31:11,718 --> 00:31:14,220
Jessica,
if we screw him over,

763
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:15,905
he's gonna come back at us.

764
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,223
It might not be tomorrow.

765
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:18,775
It might not be six months
from now,

766
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,526
but he's gonna find a way.

767
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:22,779
- You mean she'll find a way.
- That's exactly what I mean.

768
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:24,414
And maybe she will.

769
00:31:24,498 --> 00:31:26,732
But I've never known you
to run from a fight before.

770
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,734
My name was never
on the door before.

771
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,870
You said it yourself.

772
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:34,207
I have to think differently
now that I'm in this position.

773
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:35,908
I did say that.

774

And it's not just gonna
be one fight.

775

It's gonna be the Hatfields
and the McCoys all over again.

about your history with her?

- She could just be playing us.

She could, but...
I trust her.

it's time to turn the page.

Well, I don't want
to turn the page.

Tell her we'll exclude
the payment and honor our deal.

783
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:13,296
Louis, I know it didn't go
exactly as planned,

784
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,332
but you need to pick yourself up
and dust yourself off.

785
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,117
Exactly as planned?

786
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:20,336
I utterly failed.

787
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:22,288
I don't even deserve
this stupid mug.

788
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:24,090
"Litt Up"?
It should say "shit up."

789
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:25,641
You didn't fail.
You impressed him.

790
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:28,845
Yeah, that and $45 will get
my cat a Brazilian bikini wax.

791
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:30,179
You got a new cat?

792
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:31,797
Fostering.

793
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,900
Louis...enough.

794
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,436
You need to go to Harvey.
[Scoffs]

795
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,988
You mean tell him that I'm
even more of an embarrassment

796
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:40,639
than he says I am?

797
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:42,442
You're not an embarrassment.

798
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,444
You may need Harvey
to put the ball in the end zone,

799
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,028
but you had the idea,
you set it up,

800
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:48,481
and you drove the ball
down to the one-yard line.

801
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,366
No, I didn't have the idea.

802
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:51,868
You had the idea!

803
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:53,920
And you executed it.

804
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:55,538
But you're giving me credit.

805
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:57,823
If Harvey executes this,
he'll give you credit.

806
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,509
No, he won't.
He never does.

807
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:01,210
Louis, he might.

808
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:03,513
You want him to see
a different side of you,

809
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:05,664
give him a chance to show
a different side of him.

810
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:07,550
You know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.

811
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:09,469
Harvey doesn't need
my help anymore.

812
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,337
It's too late.
No, it isn't.

813
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:13,139
Haven't you heard?

814
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,391
Heard what?

815
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:25,034
[Sighs]

816
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,376
Harvey,
I have some bad news.

817
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,578
- What is it?
- I think you should sit down.

818
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:38,047
Donna, unless someone died,
I don't need to sit down.

819
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:41,384
Just tell me.
Hessington Oil just fired us.

820
00:33:48,475 --> 00:33:50,710
- Scottie betrayed me.
- You don't know that.

821
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,845
One plus one equals two,
Donna.

822
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,564
And I know
how to goddamn add.

823
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:55,898
I didn't count
the Folsom money,

824
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:58,067
and suddenly
our oil revenues are gone

825
00:33:58,151 --> 00:34:00,236
and her piece of the pie
just skyrocketed.

826
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,221
Harvey, please,
don't do anything rash.

827
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:04,223
What the hell
are you saying?

828
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,442
- I'm saying call her.
- How would that go?

829
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,244
"Hey, Scottie,
thanks for dicking me over.

830
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:09,579
Could you please
take it back?"

831
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:11,197
You don't know
how it would go.

832
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,416
And you could find out
if you would drop your pride

833
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,180
and just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

834
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:17,236
You gave someone
the benefit of the doubt,

835
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:18,838
and look how that turned out.

836
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,042
You think just because
you bought me a handbag,

837
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:26,012
you can say that to me?

838
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,713
Okay, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

839
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,298
But I just got played,

840
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:32,134
and I'm not about to call
Scottie and cry about it.

841
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,220
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna figure out

842
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:36,806
how to do to her
what she just did to me.

843
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:46,059
- Harvey.
- Not now, Louis.

844
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,591
Yes, now, Harvey.
I've got the answer.

845
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:48,913
- The answer to what?
- To shoving

846
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,928
the Hessington Oil firing
up Edward Darby's ass.

847
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:52,882
Harvey.

848
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,583
Harvey!

849
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:57,854
Tony Gianopolous.

850
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:00,523
He can triple the revenue
we lost with Hessington Oil.

851
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,925
And they're technically
not a new client.

852
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,944
So there's nothing
Scottie can do.

853
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:06,446
Well, what makes you think
he's gonna go for it?

854
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,931
Because I went there,
and they are primed to say yes.

855
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,784
They just won't...

856
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:14,737
They just won't
say yes to me.

857
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:18,157
Give him this.
They'll say yes to you.

858
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,581
Louis, this is brilliant.

859
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:28,251
And if you hadn't had the balls
to come to me,

860
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,752
we'd have nothing
right now.

861
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:31,220
Harvey, no.

862
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:32,672
I should have come
to you sooner,

863
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,623
but I didn't because I just--
Louis.

864
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,426
I've told you this before,

865
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:39,128
but it's always been when
I needed something from you.

866
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,964
And I don't need anything
from you right now,

867
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,466
because you just gave it to me.

868
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:46,936
So maybe you can hear it
when I say it--

869
00:35:46,987 --> 00:35:50,273
I respect you.

870
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:52,141
You're an excellent attorney,

871
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,028
a valuable member
of this firm.

872
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:58,498
And a friend?

873
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:00,316
Don't push it.

874
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,984
[Laughs]

875
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,486
Sorry.

876
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:07,373
Seriously, Harvey,
I just have to say, um...

877
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,461
It means so much
when you say all that.

878
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:12,879
Do you need a tissue
or something?

879
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,014
- Can I use your pocket square?
- Under no circumstances.

880
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,433
I'll be fine.
And you and Jessica

881
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,852
need to take that over
to Gianopolous right now.

882
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:22,838
Screw that.
I'm going over there with you.

883
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,230
He's not there.

884
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,482
What?
Where is he?

885
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,683
He went to see
Tony Gianopolous.

886
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,736
- By himself?
- No, with Louis.

887
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,988
With Louis?
What, is he mad at me?

888
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,040
Rachel's the only one
who's mad at you.

889
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:43,910
- She told you.
- She didn't have to.

890
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,411
What were you thinking,

891
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:46,879
pulling all that shit
with her dad?

892
00:36:46,964 --> 00:36:48,548
I didn't think
it would come to that.

893
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:50,083
He didn't mind.
Why should she?

894
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,586
Anyone who understands women
in any way

895
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,888
would know that was
a bad idea from the start.

896
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:58,057
- Harvey liked it.
- Proving my point.

897
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,062
I asked her
to move in with me.

898
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:04,380
[Softly]
I know.

899
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,548
She told you?

900
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,049
[Sighs]
Of course she did.

901
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,218
I can't intuit everything.
What am I, the Dalai Lama?

902
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,437
Donna, you should have seen
her face when I asked her.

903
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:13,523
She was so happy.

904
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:15,224
I'm sure she was.
It was very romantic.

905
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,443
How could she be so happy
and then just not want to do it?

906
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:19,895
Who says
she doesn't want to do it?

907
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,730
I told her to take her time,

908
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,732
but I-I didn't think
she'd need it.

909
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,585
Why wouldn't she need it?

910
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:27,670
Just because you made
some romantic gesture

911
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,922
doesn't mean that all reason
goes out the window.

912
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,674
I've had a pit in my stomach
since last night.

913
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:33,176
I...

914
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:35,211
I need to do something.

915
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:37,746
You need to look
in the mirror.

916
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,215
What?

917
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:42,237
I just jumped into
a relationship with a man

918
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,603
who, it turns out,

919
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,438
was pretending to be
something he wasn't.

920
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:46,939
Rachel already knows

921
00:37:47,024 --> 00:37:49,609
that you're pretending to be
something you're not.

922
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:51,444
All you need to do
is just give her time

923
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:52,928
to figure it all out.

924
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,866
What if she says no?

925
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,818
Then she says no.

926
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,538
But pushing her isn't going
to stop that from happening.

927
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,124
If you're here to complain
about Hessington Oil,

928
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:10,329
I had nothing to do with it.

929
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,581
I'm just
the majority shareholder.

930
00:38:11,632 --> 00:38:13,800
I don't get involved
in day-to-day stuff.

931
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:16,335
- We're not here to complain.
- We're here to bring a gift.

932
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,970
The question is,
what do you get a man

933
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:19,839
who can burn a $50,000 bond?

934
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,475
Something money can't buy.

935
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,463
- This isn't public.
- It will be in 48 hours.

936
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,798
And it's legal now.
How do you know that?

937
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,317
Because I structured it
that way.

938
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:34,103
I can do more of the same
for you, but he didn't tell you,

939
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:36,138
because I wasn't enough
of a name.

940
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,441
- You're not.
- But I am.

941
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:40,976
Well, you are, as a man
who shoots from the hip,

942
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,161
which I like, but--

943
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:44,113
You also need
a stabilizing influence.

944
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:46,866
- Not a football player.
- But a fan of the ballet.

945
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,035
- Muscle.
- And finesse.

946
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,254
And you guys think
that I'm not aware

947
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:53,372
that this is all
about your merger negotiations.

948
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,757
Oh, I was counting on you
being aware of it.

949
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:56,008
Because then
you'll also be aware

950
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:57,460
that we can be very flexible
in our billings.

951
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:59,178
As long as I pay
enough up front

952
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:00,930
to tip the scales
in your favor.

953
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:02,465
We'll structure
a schedule that results

954
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:04,166
in you getting a substantial
financial benefit.

955
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,801
Which is his specialty.

956
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:07,303
Go ahead.
Tell him.

957
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:09,272
He's a badass.

958
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:13,526
What do you say we celebrate
our new association

959
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,395
over dinner in Chicago
with Michael Jordan?

960
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,197
We can take my private jet.

961
00:39:18,282 --> 00:39:20,199
Hey! Which will allow us
to pay for it

962
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:21,850
and for you to write it off.

963
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:37,250
Hey.

964
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,701
Hey.

965
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,753
I know you're probably
busy...

966
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,505
I'm actually not.

967
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,214
Rachel, I...

968
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,016
I know that dating me
is complicated--

969
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,518
- Mike--
- I just--

970
00:39:57,721 --> 00:40:00,856
I just want you to know you can
take as much time as you need.

971
00:40:03,744 --> 00:40:06,195
I love you.

972
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:11,667
I love you too.

973
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:19,908
I got into Stanford.

974
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,272
What the hell
is wrong with you?

975
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:35,257
I see you got
my little gut punch.

976
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,760
I came to you hat in hand,
and this is what you do--

977
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,395
stack the numbers?
- Hat in hand?

978
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:41,314
More like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

979
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,950
- What are you talking about?
- Hessington Oil.

980
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:45,284
I had nothing
to do with that.

981
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,320
Something dropped
from the sky,

982
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:48,704
tilted everything
in your favor

983
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:50,990
right after I cut you a break?
I don't think so.

984
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,659
Harvey, I gave you my word,
and I honored it.

985
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,110
Bullshit.
You're saying saying that

986
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,402
because I've got
the upper hand.

987
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,747
This is not
about the upper hand.

988
00:40:57,798 --> 00:40:59,159
You're always
about the upper hand!

989
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,949
Harvey, stop.

990
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,669
I came to you
and asked for mercy.

991
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:05,671
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

992
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,090
And then for me to turn around
and use that to dupe you--

993
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,092
how could you think
I would do that?

994
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:11,344
Well, what would you
have thought?

995
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,179
I don't know,
but you could have called me.

996
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,963
- And say what?
- And asked me

997
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,599
to exclude the firing
from the calculations.

998
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,633
I'm not gonna do--

999
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,134
What?
You're not gonna do what?

1000
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,826
Not gonna give me
the benefit of the doubt

1001
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,572
and be vulnerable--
expose yourself?

1002
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,808
I already did that
when I trusted you.

1003
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:29,362
That was mercy, which is
from a position of strength.

1004
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,498
Being vulnerable is
from a position of weakness.

1005
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:34,500
Well,
I'm not gonna do that.

1006
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:37,986
[Sighs]

1007
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,006
Well, then I guess
I'm not going to either.

1008
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,824
Meaning what?

1009
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,844
Meaning that I am not going
to dissolve this merger.

1010
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:46,512
You already signed
the agreement.

1011
00:41:46,596 --> 00:41:48,180
Then sue me.

1012
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:50,332
You're gonna totally
shaft me anyway.

1013
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:51,500
What's my downside?

1014
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,886
In the meantime,
you'll have a name partner

1015
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,171
who can't practice in America,
whose reputation is shit,

1016
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,303
and who's gonna tie up
all your profits in litigation

1017
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,525
for the next five years.

1018
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:01,477
You're willing
to do all that

1019
00:42:01,528 --> 00:42:03,696
and expect me to believe
you weren't behind

1020
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,531
us getting fired
in the first place.

1021
00:42:05,615 --> 00:42:07,015
She's telling the truth,
Harvey.

1022
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,547
- What?
- Scottie didn't get us fired.

1023
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:10,352
Ava Hessington did.
That doesn't mean anything.

1024
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:11,854
Scottie
could have arranged it.

1025
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,322
Well, she didn't,

1026
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:14,907
because Ava
didn't just fire us.

1027
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,693
She's suing all of us...

1028
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,695
for malpractice.
