1
00:00:01,384 --> 00:00:02,752
I lost Ava her company.

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,100
I assume my deal
with Edward is dead.

3
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:06,971
As long as you win
her murder trial,

4
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:09,107
you'll be
the next managing partner.

5
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:10,642
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

6
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:12,644
I can see that.

7
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,479
So you're not upset?

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,865
No.

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,483
I got an interview.

10
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:19,651
Look, I'm sorry, I just didn't
know how to tell you, Mike.

11
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:21,002
I don't know,
how about,

12
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,788
"hey, Mike, I might go
to law school 3,000 miles away"?

13
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,425
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

14
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:29,344
This is about me getting
personal with Donna.

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,162
Chain of custody is something
I know a little bit about,

16
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:32,214
thanks to you.

17
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,348
Save yourself
the embarrassment

18
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,666
and cancel this trial.

19
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:36,601
We're in the ring,
I'm still standing,

20
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,969
and this isn't done.

21
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,838
It's going up
on the wall tomorrow.

22
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:42,006
And this is your way
of getting me on your side?

23
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:44,309
I don't want you
on my side.

24
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,478
I want us to be
on the same side.

25
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,703
- You look happy.
- Do I?

26
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:56,705
Why?

27
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,375
Um, I don't know, Donna,
it's hard to explain.

28
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,743
All right,
I'll tell you.

29
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,468
Mikado finally slept
in my bed last night,

30
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,736
and when I woke up
this morning,

31
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:06,047
it felt like the whole world
was hugging me.

32
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,699
I lost 9 ounces.

33
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,084
My teeth whiteners
are working.

34
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,002
I found five new hairs
on the top of my head.

35
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:12,671
And to top it all off,
I just found out

36
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:15,206
that Esther broke her foot
in three places.

37
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:16,224
Your sister?

38
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,709
Yeah, crutches
for seven months.

39
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,212
Serves her right.
Dad's favorite.

40
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:27,719
Mm.

41
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,908
I need a day.

42
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,035
Dom Perignon's on ice

43
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:45,454
and Bloomberg's
closing Broadway

44
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,905
for the ticker-tape parade.

45
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:48,757
You saw the sign?

46
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,592
Yeah, dream come true
for any lawyer.

47
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,911
I don't have dreams.
I have goals.

48
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,914
Now it's on
to the next one.

49
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,471
When did you find out?

50
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,555
Last night.

51
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:04,973
Why didn't you tell me?

52
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:06,691
I shouldn't have to.

53
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,109
Meaning?

54
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,812
Meaning your focus hasn't
been where it usually is.

55
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,777
Okay, meaning that my focus
has been on Stephen.

56
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:15,534
If that's what you mean,
then just say it.

57
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,768
Just admit that it bothers you
about me and him.

58
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,269
I'm not admitting anything

59
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,871
because there's nothing
to admit.

60
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,290
And Stephen or not,
you know as well as I do

61
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,792
I've never had
to tell you a thing.

62
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,211
You've always just known.

63
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,799
- You've had too much coffee.
- What are you talking about?

64
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,167
After two cups,
your signature slants.

65
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,301
After three,
it scrawls.

66
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,886
And after four,
it's chicken scratch.

67
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,154
They're not gonna
accept these.

68
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,222
You're crazy.

69
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,139
How many cups
have you had today?

70
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,958
Five.

71
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,793
How'd you do that?

72
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,144
It's what I do.

73
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,631
I read, I analyze, I fix.

74
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:48,934
Bullshit.

75
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:51,820
You're wearing
a blue shirt,

76
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,488
which means you won big
in poker last night.

77
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,940
You missed a spot shaving,

78
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,775
which means you had
less than five hours of sleep.

79
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,109
And your left wrist,

80
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,279
which you claim you sprained
playing basketball,

81
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,998
still hasn't healed
because your loud tie is hanging

82
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,367
ever so slightly
to the left.

83
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,119
Loud, by the way, because
you won big in poker last night.

84
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,337
For your information,

85
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,322
I didn't lose sleep
just because of poker.

86
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,658
Yeah, you did.

87
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,876
Melanie's not
in the picture anymore.

88
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,845
- You knew about Melanie?
- And Charlotte.

89
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,630
And Nadia.

90
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:20,599
Okay, I don't want you
working for me anymore.

91
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,834
Harvey, stop playing
footsie with your secretary.

92
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,436
Mackenzie brothers
are here.

93
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,221
We need to get
these assholes to cave.

94
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:29,340
I had an idea.
Nite owl murders.

95
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,476
We're not using an idea
you got from <i>L.A. Confidential.</i>

96
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:33,562
How is that different
from you shooting a dead guy

97
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,730
just because Sean Connery
did it in <i>The Untouchables?</i>

98
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,682
What are you prepared to do?

99
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,618
Is that supposed
to be Sean Connery?

100
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:42,487
Don't even think that you
can do Connery better than me.

101
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:45,323
Junior.

102
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,708
He's a lying member

103
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,710
of a no-good race.

104
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,579
Ease up, James Bond.

105
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,830
So you gonna come out
and say it?

106
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,831
Say what?

107
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:55,250
All those observations.

108
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,252
You're into me.

109
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,006
I'm not into you.
I'm Donna.

110
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,340
What's that
supposed to mean?

111
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:03,258
It means I could do
the same thing with Bertha

112
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,542
that I did with you.

113
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,428
All that means is that
you're into Bertha too.

114
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,596
Ooh, what if I am?

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,380
We can have
a threesome.

116
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,183
Trust me, if you were ever
lucky enough to have me,

117
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:15,186
you wouldn't want to share.

118
00:04:22,945 --> 00:04:24,946
Dude, you gonna share
that shit with me or what?

119
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,615
Negatory.

120
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,949
Mmhmm.

121
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,784
All right, you can have some,
but take it easy.

122
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,419
It's gotta last
until tomorrow.

123
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,071
I thought you had
3 ounces.

124
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,740
I sold it.
Daddy's gotta eat.

125
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,758
Wait a minute,
you're dealing now?

126
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:37,959
Friends and family,
asshole.

127
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,711
What are you, AT&T?

128
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,096
What are you, the FCC?

129
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,264
You don't even know
what that is.

130
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,549
- Yes, I do.
- Really?

131
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,552
Tell me what they do.
I'll give you $500.

132
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:48,937
You're a dick.

133
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,772
A dick who just got
a hundred on his Calc midterm.

134
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,941
You got the results back
already?

135
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,392
No, but trust me,
hundred.

136
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:55,894
You know who else
thinks you're a dick?

137
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,261
That math test.

138
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,930
Well, that's fine,
because I just made it my bitch.

139
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:02,100
Up top, mother flecker!

140
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,818
Whoa, you're gonna
leave me hanging?

141
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,906
Like you're gonna
leave me hanging?

142
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,041
You got into Harvard,
dickhead.

143
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,080
They accepted
my transfer?

144
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,581
Yeah, they did.

145
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,416
Holy goddamn shit.

146
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,469
Wait a minute,
you read my mail?

147
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,671
What's the point
of going through it

148
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,472
if I'm not gonna read it?
I hate you.

149
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,458
Yeah, mother flecker!

150
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,927
Holy shit, dude.

151
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:32,013
We gotta celebrate.
Yeah.

152
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,265
Those douche bags over
at A.E. Pi are having a party.

153
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:35,299
It's on.

154
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,735
It's still on.

155
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,019
There's a reason Cameron
hasn't raised the white flag

156
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,270
with Ava yet.

157
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:40,572
What is it?

158
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,306
I was filing our motion
to dismiss

159
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,109
when I noticed his office
faxed the court

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,326
from the Waldorf Astoria.

161
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,495
He's been booking rooms
all over Manhattan.

162
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,114
And turns out

178
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,663
Rachel, come on,
let's just sit down,

179
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,461
for ten minutes, please.
This is ridiculous.

180
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,771
I can't.
I don't wanna miss my flight.

181
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,822
You're not gonna
miss your flight.

182
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:40,440
It doesn't leave
for another three hours.

183
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:41,825
And you're supposed
to be there two hours before,

184
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,143
and the airport's
an hour away.

185
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,528
And you know what, instead
of giving me a hard time

186
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,313
about my travel habits,

187
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,615
it'd be nice if you'd just
come with me to the airport.

188
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,317
Rachel, you know the case
I'm working on,

189
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,502
you know the deadline,
and you know the stakes.

190
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:53,987
What I know is you don't
want me to visit Stanford

191
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,672
because you don't want me
to go to Stanford.

192
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,507
I never said that.

193
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:59,176
I just said I wish you had
told me that you had applied.

194
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,044
Well, I did,
and now you're being shitty

195
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,369
because you don't
want me to go,

196
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,714
and you won't even
just admit it.

197
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,165
Look, do you really want this
to be easy for me?

198
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,134
All I wanted is for you
to tell me

199
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:10,170
to have a good trip
and to mean it.

200
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,946
Have a good trip.

201
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,460
Okay, you're telling me
that if I can guess

202
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:38,165
your exact birthday,
you will kiss me right here.

203
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:41,385
If you can guess
my birthday,

204
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:42,669
I'll kiss you...

205
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,206
Wow.

206
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,308
That is very detailed.

207
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,510
All right,
I'm ready to get started.

208
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:52,095
Uh, I need 360--

209
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,781
I'm sorry, I gotta borrow
my friend here.

210
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,349
I need to borrow my friend
just for a second.

211
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,716
No, no, Trevor, 'cause we're
right in the middle of a thing.

212
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,268
I'm doing the birthday thing.
What are you doing?

213
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,073
I just found out
behind that door over there

214
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,722
is a poker game filled
with drunk A.E. Pi brothers.

215
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,241
No way!
Yeah, that's a great idea.

216
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,393
I should totally not pursue
this hot girl.

217
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,828
Dude, whatever,
you're always telling me

218
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:08,912
you're Mr. <i>rounders.</i>

219
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:10,080
Let's go take
their money.

220
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:11,231
Come on,
we're here to drink booze

221
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,565
and hit on chicks,

222
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,868
not sit in the dark
and play with a bunch of dudes.

223
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,954
Come on, now where was--

224
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,122
what?

225
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,590
Totally not cool, man.

226
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,759
- Of her or of you?
- Whatever.

227
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:25,245
Whoa, hey, excuse me.

228
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,214
Our house, our rules,
asshole.

229
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:28,465
Oh!

230
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,716
Douche bag.

231
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,101
Man, forget him.

232
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,969
Nah, I can't.

233
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,422
First week freshman year,
I was playing basketball.

234
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,423
He showed up with three
of his buddies.

235
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,191
I go up for a lay-up,

236
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,527
he comes in,
lays me out.

237
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:41,945
Stands over me and says,

238
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,431
"What are you gonna
do about it?"

239
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,267
I let it go.

240
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,769
I'm not letting it go
this time.

241
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,238
Let's roll.

242
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:53,990
You wanted to see me?

243
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,244
Mackenzie brothers.

244
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,280
I got 'em 25 years apiece.

245
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,614
You?

246
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,450
You wouldn't have gotten shit
without me.

247
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,669
Nite owl murders, baby.

248
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,137
Oh, don't do that.

249
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,473
What kind of person doesn't
high-five another person?

250
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,174
A person
who's not ten years old.

251
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,126
Oh, so you mean
like a dick.

252
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,096
No, I mean, like the guy
that can fire you on the spot.

253
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:19,015
Nite owl murders, baby.

254
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,901
All right, okay, okay.

255
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:24,471
All kidding aside,
great job.

256
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,689
Thank you.

257
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,690
That's not
why I called you down here.

258
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,142
Look, Harvey,

259
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,078
you're killing it,
and you've been killing it,

260
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,812
and I think it's time
that you got rewarded for it.

261
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,414
Head litigator.

262
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:37,200
Look, I know you got a deal
with Jessica to come back,

263
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,286
but I'm telling you,
in ten years, you could be me.

264
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:41,371
You think about it.

265
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,791
In the meantime,
celebrate the win.

266
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,515
Just stay away
from my scotch.

267
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,935
Well, I guess
I win again.

268
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:57,521
You guys are really
behind the times.

269
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,005
You ought to be playing
hold'em.

270
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,507
Don't give a shit
about moneymaker

271
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,808
and his bullshit game.

272
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,310
We're old school.
We play stud.

273
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,677
You lose at stud.

274
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,696
Not to you, asshole.

275
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,983
No, no, no, no,
you lose to me.

276
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:13,036
Come on, hurry up, old school.
Deal the cards.

277
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,525
Compliments
of Cameron Dennis.

278
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,664
Harvey, this isn't
just winning a case.

279
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,550
This is head litigator.

280
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,801
Scotch isn't good enough.

281
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,702
We need, like, a ritual
or something.

282
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,505
What did you have in mind?

283
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,673
I don't know.

284
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:34,891
I have an idea.

285
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:36,676
I'm listening.

286
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:38,727
It's not something
a gentleman should say out loud.

287
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,148
Oh, well,
then I'm willing to pretend

288
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,683
that you're a gentleman.

289
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:50,574
Okay, you are definitely
not a gentleman.

290
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:52,943
What would we even
do it with?

291
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,394
Whipped cream.

292
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,897
Enough about
this conversation.

293
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,783
I want to revisit
our earlier one.

294
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,786
This is our earlier one.

295
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,539
Come on, you know
you've thought about it.

296
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,407
Yeah, I think
about a lot of things.

297
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,543
And you would.

298
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,012
But I won't.

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,580
You're afraid
you'd fall for me.

300
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,391
Oh, please, if anybody's
falling for anybody,

301
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,933
it would be you for me.

302
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,935
Sounds like a challenge.

303
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,604
One you are never
gonna get to take.

304
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,305
Why not?

305
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,641
'Cause I don't get involved
with men that I work with.

306
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,309
Okay, then you're fired.

307
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,760
'Bout time.

308
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,229
What did I ever
do to you?

309
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,731
Nothing.
I get your chair.

310
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,533
Bertha, what are you
doing here so late?

311
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:34,818
Don't get all up
in my business

312
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,153
just because I interrupted you
hitting on red.

313
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,905
How do you know
I'm hitting on her?

314
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,157
Two glasses of scotch
and you.

315
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,994
I found a Mackenzie file
in the MacAllister box.

316
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,579
You're welcome.

317
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,048
And you better get
Dennis his scotch back.

318
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,634
He won't like that.

319
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,118
Shit.

320
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,336
What's wrong?

321
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,505
We left out
a piece of discovery.

322
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,590
Will it screw us?

323
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,958
It just did.

324
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,961
Well, I raise.

325
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,396
500.

326
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,686
Call and raise
another 500.

327
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,189
I don't have
another 500, so...

328
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,692
Wait a second.
He might.

329
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:18,811
I have another thousand
on me.

330
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,196
How do you have
another thousand?

331
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,314
From the weed.

332
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,166
I told you,
I got rid of it.

333
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:26,920
Now do you have this guy
or not?

334
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,371
I got kings full of 2s.

335
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,040
He's got no aces showing,

336
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,825
and <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>
folded one on first street.

337
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,993
The only way he beats me

338
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,662
is with trip 3s or trip 4s
under there,

339
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,464
and Limp Bizkit
folded two 3s,

340
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:40,050
and Dickcheese over here
had a 4.

341
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,519
So he's got a...

342
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:43,853
- A straight.
- Straight.

343
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:44,888
Or he's bluffing,

344
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,139
but either way,
I got him.

345
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,474
Hey, do you always get
your girlfriend's advice

346
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:48,725
on everything?

347
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,677
Oh, this guy.

348
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,196
Well, let's raise
another 500.

349
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:54,481
Hmm.

350
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:57,067
Don't ask for more
unless you wanna lose it.

351
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,192
Call.

352
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,662
Full house.

353
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,416
Four 4s, asshole.

354
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,085
Whoa, wait.
Wait, that's not possible.

355
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,202
He had--

356
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,138
he's cheating.

357
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,676
And what are you
gonna do about it?

358
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,877
You're not gonna get away
with this.

359
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,546
Well, I guess
your only option

360
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,765
would be
to call the police.

361
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,210
Of course,
I haven't been drinking,

362
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:32,352
'cause, you know,
I'm underage, like you boys.

363
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:33,353
You set us up.

364
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,522
Yeah.

365
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,190
See, I remember you.

366
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,742
First week,
you come into class,

367
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:40,893
Mr. "Oh, I got
the whole textbook memorized."

368
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,529
Made the rest of us
look like chumps.

369
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,280
No, you did that
all by yourself.

370
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,665
Yeah, well,
I don't need a super brain

371
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,283
to remember some guy who thinks
his shit don't stink.

372
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,284
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.
- Hey, back up.

373
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,502
Now get the hell outta here

374
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,255
before we put you
out of here.

375
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,378
Congratulations Harvey.

376
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:07,468
I had no idea
Jessica was planning this.

377
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,946
What do you want, Stephen?

378
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,232
I hear Cameron
got a witness.

379
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:13,768
He did.
What do you want?

380
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,019
I'm just checking to see

381
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,270
if there's anything
I can do to help.

382
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,722
There isn't.

383
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,576
Cheers.

384
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:24,362
What do you got?

385
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:25,446
I couldn't find out

386
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,081
where Cameron's
got his witness hidden,

387
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,084
but I figured out
who it is.

388
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,071
What?

389
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,840
So now I know
why you wanted to meet me

390
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,875
at the elevator.

391
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,377
Pretty awesome.

392
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:40,845
Yeah, it is.

393
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,847
What are you gonna do
about Jessica?

394
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,849
I don't know.

395
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,644
Nothing ever changes
around here.

396
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:59,197
It's good to see you too,
Harvey.

397
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:02,567
Now what was so important
that you just had to see me?

398
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,768
I wanna talk to you
about extending my time

399
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,322
at the D.A.'s office.

400
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,491
Come with me.

401
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,377
Now what's Cameron Dennis
offering you?

402
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,080
Why does he have
to be offering me something?

403
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:19,834
Because he knows, if you wanna
keep someone in your house,

404
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,803
offer them
a better room.

405
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,139
Head litigator.

406
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,642
Do you wanna stay there
because it's a step up

407
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,761
or because you can see yourself
there in ten years?

408
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:32,180
Why do you wanna know?

409
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,599
Because I have a promotion
ready for you right here.

410
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,300
What are you talking about?

411
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,903
Daniel Hardman and I

412
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,989
are taking Gordon, Schmidt,
and Van Dyke down.

413
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,774
That's why we're up here.

414
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,693
Did you think
we were gonna make out?

415
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:48,079
Man can hope.

416
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,364
What?

417
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,833
Are you sure you wanna
take control in the night?

418
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,835
Nighttime's
when they're sleeping.

419
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,787
Telling them you're coming
shows them respect.

420
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:59,123
Not telling them
shows them more.

421
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,291
What about honor?

422
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,261
Harvey, we're lawyers.

423
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:06,514
We're not
in the honor business.

424
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,218
What did I always tell you
when you were here?

425
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,687
Don't judge a man till you've
walked a mile in his shoes.

426
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,939
Well, if you're ever
in these babies,

427
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:19,610
we'll see if you feel
the same way.

428
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:25,846
It's a little early
for batting cages,

429
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,867
don't you think?

430
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:27,985
I'm not going
to the batting cages,

431
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,019
and you know it.

432
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,071
Trevor, let it go.

433
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,706
I can't.
I need that money back.

434
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,190
What did you do?

435
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,626
I haven't paid
for the weed yet.

436
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,364
You took a loan
from a drug dealer?

437
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:41,699
It's called consignment.

438
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,534
Did you ever learn about
free enterprise in Econ 1a?

439
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,419
No, but I read about
not betting money I don't have

440
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,587
in Econ 1a.

441
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,389
You told me you had him,
smart guy.

442
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,091
I did have him,
and you know I did.

443
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,760
Well, I need
a thousand dollars by Monday,

444
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,512
or Omar's gonna beat
the living shit outta me.

445
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,597
Trevor,
him kicking your ass

446
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,266
doesn't get him
his money any faster.

447
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,550
He's not gonna
see it that way.

448
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,769
Okay, then we will think
of something else.

449
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,321
I've been thinking,

450
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,439
and the only thing
I came up with

451
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,574
you're not gonna like.

452
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,058
Why do I
have to like it?

453
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,696
Because I can't do it.

454
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:12,747
I told you before,

455
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,699
I'm not selling
any test answers.

456
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,900
It's not any test.
It's the test you just aced.

457
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,453
It's not out there yet.
Nobody has it.

458
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,957
I can make us 1,000 bucks
in one shot.

459
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,292
Tell me you haven't memorized

460
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,379
every question
and every answer, Harvard boy.

461
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,747
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

462
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,766
So what if it is?

463
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,883
Look, you're bolting,

464
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,418
and you're using
your brain to do it.

465
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:35,586
I'm just asking,

466
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,422
before you go,
use it to help me.

467
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:42,259
Please.

468
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,734
What the hell is this?

469
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,319
It's the paperwork
for the Mackenzie deal.

470
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,570
Type it up
and get it out.

471
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,538
No, that report was
supposed to be disclosed

472
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,623
during discovery.

473
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,291
If you type up
what I gave you,

474
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,126
you'd know
I'm disclosing it now.

475
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,445
No, you're sticking it
in there now

476
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,830
as if it's always been there.

477
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,632
It's called bluffing.

478
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,334
Okay, it's what I do.

479
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,918
That's how I got the confession
in the first place.

480
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:10,304
It's called bullshit,
it's what bullshitters do,

481
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,473
and it's how innocent people
sometimes end up in prison.

482
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,225
- Watch yourself.
- Excuse me?

483
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,093
That toxicology report
doesn't change the fact

484
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:17,812
that those two assholes
killed that woman.

485
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,263
And you being
an asshole to me

486
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:21,015
doesn't change the fact
that you are breaking the law.

487
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,516
I'm not breaking the law.

488
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,018
I put the goddamn thing
in there.

489
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,020
They can find it
if they can think to look.

490
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,472
Harvey,
you are making a huge--

491
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:30,641
That's enough!

492
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,526
I'm here.
You're here.

493
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,779
Do your job.

494
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,091
We know you have a witness.

495
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,542
Surprised it took you
that long.

496
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,877
And we know who it is.

497
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,380
The man from the video,
Colonel Mariga.

498
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,997
I don't have any prizes,

499
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,384
so you'll just have to accept
a pat on the back.

500
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,709
That's okay, Tom Selleck,
I don't need a pat on the back.

501
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
I just need to know
what bullshit story

502
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,472
he's gonna tell in court.

503
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:02,640
It's not bullshit.

504
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:03,891
He's gonna say
that Ava Hessington

505
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,309
paid him to kill
those people.

506
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,560
We're getting access
to him.

507
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,562
No, you're not,
because I'm gonna say

508
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,114
if she finds out
where he is,

509
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:11,982
what's to stop her
from killing him too?

510
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,351
You're not gonna bribe him,
you're not gonna threaten him,

511
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,820
and you're not gonna
talk him out of it,

512
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:18,906
because you're not gonna see him
until he gets on the stand.

513
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,825
But what I will do
is allow you

514
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:22,576
to take an offer
to your client.

515
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,412
15 years, no parole.

516
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,880
You're bluffing.

517
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,581
He's not gonna say she knew
about the murders,

518
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,867
because she didn't.

519
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,552
I'll tell you what.

520
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:34,755
Ten years with parole.

521
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,340
Ah, make it nine.

522
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:39,376
After all,
we used to work together.

523
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,937
- How'd it go?
- Don't.

524
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,500
- Was she hot?

525
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,416
I sold her a math test
for $1,000.

526
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:55,667
I wasn't thinking
of whether she was hot or not.

527
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:57,318
Okay, I get it,
so, like, an eight?

528
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,154
No, a ten wouldn't even
do her justice.

529
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,756
- So six.
- Mm, she's a four.

530
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:03,008
But she paid me $1,000,
so I bumped her up to a ten.

531
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:04,159
Got it.

532
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,178
Thank you, Michael.
Came through.

533
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:07,679
Not yet.

534
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,181
I'm coming with you
to Omar's.

535
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:10,532
No, no, no, no,
you can't.

536
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,517
Yes, I can.

537
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,054
What's going on?

538
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:17,472
I owed him the money
yesterday.

539
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,007
How could you not
tell me that?

540
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,776
Because I couldn't make the
test thing happen until today.

541
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:22,043
I didn't want you
freaking out.

542
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:23,445
Well, I'm definitely
coming with you now,

543
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,782
and the only way you can
stop me is with that bat.

544
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,869
You wanted to see me?

545
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:32,988
What the hell is this?

546
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,706
- It's the Mackenzie file--
- I know what it is.

547
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,025
What the hell did you put
in the fine print?

548
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,493
You too?

549
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,864
You're gonna give me shit about
not disclosing this report?

550
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,997
Not disclosing it?

551
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:43,999
You gave it to 'em
on a silver platter.

552
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,084
I don't understand.
You want me to take it out?

553
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,053
I don't want you to do shit.
I've already taken it out.

554
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:49,754
And if I'd wanted it disclosed,

555
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,556
I wouldn't have misfiled it
in the first place.

556
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:52,674
You buried it?

557
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:53,892
Damn right I did.

558
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:56,311
Cameron, look,
I'm all for skirting the law,

559
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:57,896
but this is
breaking the law.

560
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,181
So was killing that woman,

561
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:01,049
and I'm not gonna let
those two assholes walk

562
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,052
because our eyewitness had
a few beers at the ball game.

563
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:05,887
They won't walk. That's why
I put it in the fine print.

564
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:07,739
You think you're the first guy
to have this idea?

565
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:09,691
Nobody does it
because it doesn't work.

566
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:11,193
Well, that's exactly
why it can work.

567
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:12,828
They won't think
to look at it

568
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:14,779
because nobody
has the balls to do it.

569
00:21:14,864 --> 00:21:16,397
And what if they do

570
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,750
and these guys get out
and they murder your brother

571
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:20,118
or your father
or your cousin?

572
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:21,336
'Cause I'll tell you
right now,

573
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:23,738
they're gonna
murder someone's.

574
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,423
I don't feel comfortable
with this.

575
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,209
I don't give a shit whether
you feel comfortable or not.

576
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,877
This is my case.
We're not disclosing it.

577
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:30,345
It's done.
Cameron-

578
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:32,264
I told you this before.
Don't make me tell you again.

579
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:33,932
I'm here.
You're here.

580
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,268
Do your job.

581
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,475
- Keep the change.
- I need to speak with you.

582
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,310
Okay, let's talk
on the way up.

583
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,095
No, I prefer
to speak out here.

584
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,614
I know that Cameron's
offered Harvey a deal.

585
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,399
All right, I'm not going
behind Harvey's back.

586
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,068
I don't want you
to go behind his back.

587
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,619
I want you to go
to his face.

588
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:55,770
And do what?

589
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:56,938
It wasn't a deal.
It was an insult.

590
00:21:56,989 --> 00:21:58,273
It was an opening.

591
00:21:58,324 --> 00:21:59,491
Now he wouldn't
have offered anything

592
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:00,909
if he wasn't willing
to negotiate.

593
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,078
Maybe we can get him
down to five years.

594
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:04,296
That's exactly
what he wants,

595
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,630
to put Ava
in a position

596
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,448
where she has to choose
between five years and life.

597
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,000
That's a better position
than she's in now.

598
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:10,646
He wouldn't have offered
anything at all

599
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,786
if he wasn't bluffing.

600
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:13,138
We're not gonna fall
for that bluff.

601
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:14,662
Well, then Harvey's
making a mistake.

602
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,591
Then take it up
with Harvey.

603
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:18,793
You know as well as I do
Harvey is not interested

604
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:20,661
in anything I've got to say
at the moment.

605
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:22,130
You think Harvey's
making this call

606
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,998
because of what's going on
between you and Donna?

607
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:26,351
- It's clouding his judgment.
- Not about this.

608
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:28,002
Right now
Harvey cannot see reason

609
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:29,304
with respect to Cameron.

610
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,189
He can't hear reason
with respect to me.

611
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:32,713
Now you have a chance
to convince him

612
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:33,975
to make a deal, Mike.

613
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:36,311
Put yourself
in Ava Hessington's shoes.

614
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:38,947
Would you want that choice
or not?

615
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:44,852
Okay, whatever happens,

616
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:47,705
just be quiet
and be cool.

617
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,824
Okay.

618
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:57,832
Who this?

619
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,034
My friend.

620
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:02,053
Hi.

621
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,229
Inside.

622
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:18,937
Don't move.

623
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:21,556
Where's Omar?

624
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:22,890
That's Omar.

625
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,392
How is that Omar?

626
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:26,161
He's obsessed
with <i>The Wire.</i>

627
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:29,564
Are you kidding me?
Come on.

628
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:31,249
I'm telling you,
he's no joke.

629
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,093
Yeah, well, I know
I'm supposed to be scared,

630
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:34,235
but I'm really not.

631
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:36,337
Don't touch anything.

632
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:39,924
Now unless my calendar
is messed up,

633
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,259
today be Monday.

634
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:42,677
- Omar--
- Shut up!

635
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:44,295
Okay, I'm trying to decide
why I shouldn't call

636
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,964
a couple of hard,
pipe-hitting negroes

637
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:47,182
to come and work on you

638
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:49,083
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

639
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,270
I'm--I'm sorry, Omar.

640
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:53,721
I don't have a reason,

641
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,307
but I think the word
you be looking for

642
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,476
isn't "negro."

643
00:23:58,561 --> 00:23:59,978
If you're gonna quote
<i>Pulp Fiction,</i>

644
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:01,980
at least have the balls
to quote <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

645
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:04,816
- Omar--
- Shh, shh, shh.

646
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,488
You know what they call
a quarter pounder with cheese

647
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:11,573
in France?

648
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:15,793
A royale with cheese,
mother flecker.

649
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:18,129
- I love this negro!
- Yeah.

650
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:19,797
Trevor,
you're off the hook.

651
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,616
Never again.

652
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,968
This be for you.

653
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:26,554
Not white boy.

654
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:27,839
Go in peace.

655
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,457
- Oh, uh, okay.
- Thanks.

656
00:24:29,508 --> 00:24:30,925
Hey, thank you.

657
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,060
Mmhmm.

658
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:33,961
Who touched my alien?

659
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:37,398
What the hell
is wrong with you?

660
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,986
Come on,
it's nothing that some of this

661
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:40,985
and a royale with cheese
can't fix.

662
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,604
You do not know
what we just avoided.

663
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:45,240
Just call me the wolf.
I'll be over there directly.

664
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:46,908
Oh, you sending the wolf?

665
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:50,995
Oh, shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

666
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,113
Yo, put that away.

667
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:53,164
What?
Put what away?

668
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,832
If they find it,
it's mine.

669
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:55,917
Trevor Evans?

670
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:57,201
Yes, officers.

671
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:58,319
Come with us.

672
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,621
Hey, what's going on?

673
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,155
Your friend here
seems to be involved

674
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:04,825
in selling the answers
to a stolen test.

675
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:07,545
The Mackenzie deal
came back.

676
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,880
Two murderers down.

677
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:10,924
Don't you wanna ask me
if they saw the fine print?

678
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:13,351
Oh, no, of course you don't.

679
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:14,835
Because you know they didn't

680
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,354
because that report wasn't
in the fine print anymore.

681
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:17,555
Donna--

682
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,057
Cameron made you take it out,
didn't he?

683
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:20,191
How'd you know?

684
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:21,442
When I do my Donna shit
with you,

685
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,478
it's not just for fun.
It's my job.

686
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:26,064
Now why don't you tell me
why you didn't tell me?

687
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:28,066
Because you hated me
when I was working in the gray.

688
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,351
This is the black.
I didn't hate you.

689
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:32,820
I was trying to stop you.

690
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:34,522
And the truth is
what you were doing

691
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:35,957
was right on the line.

692
00:25:36,024 --> 00:25:38,376
What he is making you do,
that's illegal.

693
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,045
It's one time,
and it's not my case.

694
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,246
It might not be your case,

695
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:45,416
but it's definitely
not just one time.

696
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:48,002
I was here all night
going through his past cases.

697
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:49,837
How many?

698
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:52,724
Too many.
And I'll tell you another thing.

699
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:55,209
I bet his first time he thought
would be his last time.

700
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,427
Donna.

701
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:57,812
If you want somebody
to just sit at her desk,

702
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,213
answer your phones,
and pick up your dry cleaning,

703
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:02,483
then put out a want ad,
because that's not me.

704
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:03,901
I'm gonna tell you
what I think.

705
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:08,573
And what I think is,
if you do this,

706
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:11,859
you're gonna keep doing it.

707
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,946
Donna, I need you to--

708
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,247
where the hell's Donna?

709
00:26:16,332 --> 00:26:18,616
I don't know.
I was waiting for her myself.

710
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,535
Wait somewhere else.

711
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:22,754
- Harvey, listen--
- No, don't "Harvey" me.

712
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:25,540
You went to my guy
about my case behind my back.

713
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:28,543
So what you need to do now
is stay out of my face.

714
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,967
They told me this is
where I'd find women's softball.

715
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,687
It is now.

716
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:50,724
All right, old man,

717
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,259
stand back while I knock
the cover off a few balls.

718
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,196
Easy, Reggie Jackson.

719
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,617
I think you're maybe
forgetting I hit .385.

720
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:05,956
Who doesn't hit
at least .350 in high school?

721
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,375
Marcus didn't.

722
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:09,876
Don't give
your brother shit.

723
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:12,129
He's not here
to defend himself.

724
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,715
Pussy.

725
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:17,834
Hey, if he's not here
to defend himself...

726
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,088
Yeah, he's not here
to hear it.

727
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,591
Cheers.

728
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,810
So what's going on?

729
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:28,962
I don't know what to do.

730
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,898
Well, breaking the law
isn't worth it

731
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:33,266
no matter what the guy did.

732
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:34,651
How'd you know?

733
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,137
You're a prosecutor.
You told me you had a problem.

734
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,822
Well, it's not
that simple, Dad.

735
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,586
It's not just me,
and if I don't let it go,

736
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:41,808
I'll get fired.

737
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,360
If you do?

738
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:45,162
I tell him
I'm only doing this once,

739
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,313
and I'm only doing it
because it's his case,

740
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,149
and I'll never do it
on one of mine.

741
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,785
And then I keep knocking
the covers off the bad guys,

742
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,986
which is what I do,

743
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:56,206
and I don't bat .385,
I bat a thousand.

744
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,291
All right.

745
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,262
You know, I'm gonna
tell you something

746
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:03,680
I never told you before.

747
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,182
You might not wanna
hear it now,

748
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,167
but you know what
your grandmother said to me

749
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,219
when I told her I was gonna
ask your mother to marry me?

750
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:10,720
What?

751
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:13,339
Don't, because if she'll cheat
on someone else with you,

752
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,341
she'll cheat on you
with someone else.

753
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,676
We had a huge blowout.

754
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:18,845
I told her
to shove it up her ass.

755
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,197
Lily wouldn't do that.

756
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,699
She'd be different with me
because Lily loved me.

757
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,201
- Dad--
- No, no, let me finish.

758
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,535
Then, years later,

759
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,539
I found out the other guy
thought the same thing.

760
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,541
What I'm trying to say is,

761
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,994
even if Cameron believes

762
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,047
that he'll never
make you do it again,

763
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:39,466
he will.

764
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,594
Okay, out with it.
Drop the hammer.

765
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:53,563
They know Trevor
isn't in the class,

766
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,432
so they know
he couldn't have been the one

767
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:57,067
to steal the test.

768
00:28:57,151 --> 00:29:00,904
And they won't expel him
if he gives you up.

769
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:02,272
How do you know that?

770
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:05,525
I watch <i>Law & Order.</i>
I'm not an idiot.

771
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:09,579
He'll never turn me in.

772
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,616
- But you feel guilty.
- I am guilty.

773
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,751
So you wanna
turn yourself in?

774
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,237
They'll fail me.

775
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,039
But I still have a 3.8.

776
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,374
You know, there's no way Harvard
rescinds my acceptance.

777
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,545
That goddamn kid.

778
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,048
I guess I know
where you come down on this.

779
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,100
Oh, he's an asshole
in the making,

780
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:33,720
no question about it.

781
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,273
But?

782
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,976
After you lost
your mom and dad,

783
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,262
the Evanses offered
to take you in.

784
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,898
They offered
because that little boy

785
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,567
cried all night
for a month.

786
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:48,985
He begged them.

787
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,289
I'm not saying
he's the same kid anymore,

788
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,958
but that kid
is in there.

789
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,884
Harvey, just the man
I wanted to see.

790
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:05,118
Why is that?

791
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,786
'Cause I wanted you
to be the first to know.

792
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,755
I'm looking
at my new head litigator.

793
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:11,675
I'm afraid you're not.

794
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,126
And why is that?

795
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:16,296
Because after I show you this,
you're gonna demand this.

796
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:20,267
You disclosed that report.

797
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,136
That affidavit
says I made a mistake,

798
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:24,688
an honest mistake.

799
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:27,473
And this one says,
as my penance,

800
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,693
I'm resigning.

801
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:32,145
So you're just gonna put
two killers back on the street.

802
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:34,197
If you're half the prosecutor
you say you are,

803
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,865
you can still
put 'em away.

804
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,167
And I don't give a shit

805
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:38,668
whether you feel comfortable
with that or not,

806
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,253
because you said
it was your case,

807
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:41,988
but you made it my case.

808
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,823
I made it our case,
because I thought

809
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,658
you were about putting
bad guys behind bars.

810
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,877
Cameron, you asked
what if they got out

811
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,045
and killed my father?

812
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,847
Well, I think
the question is:

813
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,383
What if my father found out
what I did to put them in?

814
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:57,503
You goddamn pussy.

815
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,056
The only thing
that makes me a pussy

816
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,359
is that I didn't send
that affidavit in

817
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,278
the second I found out.

818
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:16,573
Sir, I know you
offered Trevor Evans

819
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:20,460
a way to avoid expulsion.

820
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:22,195
Well, the reason
he didn't take it

821
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:24,664
is he was trying--

822
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,416
he was trying
to protect me.

823
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,386
He's the one
who sold the test,

824
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,806
but I'm the one
who took it.

825
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:34,040
So please,

826
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,376
do not punish him
for his loyalty to me.

827
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,712
Truth is,
with the way his grades are,

828
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,898
I don't think
it'll matter anyway.

829
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,484
So I'll tell you what,

830
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,052
I'm not going to expel
your friend.

831
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:49,489
Oh, thank you, sir.

832
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:51,741
There's just one thing.

833
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,610
You're his roommate.

834
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:56,413
And you scored perfectly
on that test.

835
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,665
I knew it was you.

836
00:31:58,732 --> 00:32:00,617
I also know you're only
sitting here in front of my face

837
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,902
because you think whatever
I do to you won't matter.

838
00:32:02,953 --> 00:32:04,254
No, sir,
that's not true.

839
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,873
Well, let me tell you
what is true,

840
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,125
you little piece of shit.

841
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,878
The young woman you sold
the test to was my daughter.

842
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,014
They're demanding
my resignation.

843
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:16,049
And as my last official act,

844
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,268
I'm expelling you
from this school,

845
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:22,472
and then
I'm gonna call Harvard.

846
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:23,923
Believe me when I tell you,

847
00:32:23,974 --> 00:32:26,109
you're never going there.

848
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,739
I decided what kind
of attorney I want to be.

849
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,607
I heard.
You quit.

850
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,627
Did you hear I also turned
over the toxicology report?

851
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,080
You didn't.

852
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,299
Thought you were
supposed to know everything.

853
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:51,584
How'd you not know this?

854
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:53,253
Well, I knew that you were
either gonna take that promotion

855
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,620
or you were gonna quit.

856
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,840
And either way, I wasn't
sticking around to find out.

857
00:32:56,924 --> 00:32:59,125
- You quit?
- Damn straight.

858
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:01,344
I'm not working at a place
headed by a viper.

859
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:03,513
Donna, I can't get you
another job.

860
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:06,433
Oh, well, that's gonna make
my decision easier.

861
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,984
What does that mean?

862
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,969
I'm choosing
between Bratton Gould,

863
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,855
Skadden Arps,
and O'Melveny & Myers.

864
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,639
If I had another one,
I don't know what I'd do.

865
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,493
You know,
it just occurred to me

866
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,945
that you and I
don't work together anymore.

867
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,114
Yeah, that didn't
just occur to you.

868
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,649
No, it didn't.

869
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,952
Do you know
how I know that?

870
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,337
'Cause you knew
I'd show up here

871
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:28,872
the second
you heard I quit?

872
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:30,673
Why do you think
I have this in my hand?

873
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,042
What are we waiting for?

874
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:35,167
For you to figure out
that it's time to come inside.

875
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,174
So let me get this straight.

876
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:51,578
You turned me down before,

877
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,463
and now you're saying
you want to come back?

878
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,781
Yes.

879
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:56,399
And it has nothing
to do with our coup?

880
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,834
I didn't even know
you did it

881
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,285
until I saw your name
on the wall.

882
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,420
You got it up there fast.

883
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:01,504
Don't tell 'em
you're coming,

884
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,456
and slam the door
behind them.

885
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,376
Now why should I take someone
who waited for me to win?

886
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:07,377
Because I'm someone
you trusted with the news

887
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,878
in the first place.

888
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,848
I also trusted
all the people who voted for me.

889
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:15,101
Come clean, Harvey.
What changed your mind?

890
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,386
Instead of thinking

891
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:18,555
about what I wanna be doing
in ten years,

892
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:22,475
I started thinking about
who I want to be doing it with.

893
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,811
Me over him.

894
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,532
Terms are nonnegotiable.

895
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,234
You get what I give you.

896
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:34,270
Fine by me, but I'm getting
my own secretary.

897
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:35,938
Associates don't get
their own secretaries.

898
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,607
This isn't
about the associate.

899
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,275
It's about the secretary,

900
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:40,827
and I'm not coming here
without her.

901
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:43,463
She must be very special.

902
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:45,965
She is.

903
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,169
Difference comes out
of your pocket.

904
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,837
As long
as she never knows.

905
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,755
Welcome back, Harvey.

906
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,175
You start Monday.

907
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,176
Give it up.

908
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,344
Oh, no.

909
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:06,486
So what was so important

910
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,305
that you just had to see me?

911
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:10,490
I don't know how to say it,

912
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:11,608
so I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

913
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:14,143
But I don't want
to lose you.

914
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,615
Come work for me.

915
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:19,616
What?

916
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,917
Don't go to Skadden.

917
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:23,586
I took a job
at my old firm.

918
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,090
I was hoping
you'd be happy.

919
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:28,324
What? I am.

920
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,325
If this is
about your rule--

921
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:30,660
No, it's not about that.

922
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,428
Because if I had known
that this was gonna happen,

923
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:35,265
I never would
have come over.

924
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:37,333
Why didn't you know
that it was gonna happen?

925
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:40,470
Because I hadn't thought
about taking another job before.

926
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:43,056
And when I did...

927
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,694
I thought about who I wanted
to take it with.

928
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,012
Look, I don't wanna find out
what kind of lawyer

929
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,181
I'd be without you.

930
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:03,660
Okay, I will come work with you
on two conditions.

931
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:06,079
First, we put it
out of our minds,

932
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,715
and we never
mention it again.

933
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:13,336
Second?

934
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:16,472
You're giving me
a huge goddamn signing bonus.

935
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:20,727
How do you know
that's enough?

936
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,931
Because you're the one
who's gonna fill in the amount.

937
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,899
Oh, my God,
you really do need me...

938
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,850
To stop you
from doing shit like this.

939
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:28,851
Oh, well...

940
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:30,886
In the future.

941
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,057
Hmm.

942
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,726
What?

943
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,994
We're gonna need
a new ritual.

944
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:40,563
Well, maybe we can think
of something to do

945
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:43,032
with a can opener.

946
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:46,002
Harvey, that's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

947
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:48,204
Jeez.

948
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:52,342
Actually...

949
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,215
What are you doing here,
Harvey?

950
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,750
It's 7:00 a.m.

951
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,135
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

952
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,686
I love this place.

953
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:04,887
Really?

954
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:06,940
You've only ever been here
once before.

955
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:07,974
How'd you know that?

956
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,360
I know.

957
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:14,480
You and Stephen,
it bothers me.

958
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,866
I know it's not fair,
but it does.

959
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,151
Good.

960
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:19,156
What do you mean, good?

961
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,936
I mean,
we both knew it.

962
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,272
It's good that you finally
were able to say it.

963
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,241
You realize just
because it bothers me,

964
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,626
it doesn't mean
that I want us to be--

965
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,628
I know.

966
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:30,630
Jeez.

967
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,117
You know this is exactly
why I had that policy.

968
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,953
Well, then why did
you change it?

969
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,176
Because I have to live
my life, Harvey.

970
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,294
I've never apologized
for who I am,

971
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,796
and I'm not gonna
start now.

972
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,598
You don't need
to apologize for anything.

973
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:51,684
I know.

974
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,653
But you do.

975
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,408
For taking so long
to say that it bothered you.

976
00:37:58,475 --> 00:37:59,692
Jesus.

977
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,912
And let's just
put an order in

978
00:38:02,979 --> 00:38:04,998
for the valet
to hold my suit jackets,

979
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,783
and then we c--
Harvey.

980
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,084
Louis.

981
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,318
What are you doing here?

982
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,670
You're not due back

983
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:11,838
for another two years,
three months, and five days,

984
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,039
not that I'm keeping track.

985
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,041
Change of plans.
I'm back today.

986
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:18,628
Who's your girlfriend?

987
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,513
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

988
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,382
I'm his girl Friday.

989
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,133
Associates
don't get secretaries.

990
00:38:24,184 --> 00:38:25,835
I'm not like
other associates,

991
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,220
and she's not like
other secretaries.

992
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:29,972
- Bullshit.
- Donna?

993
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:31,691
Okay, listen, <i>Rain Man,</i>
you wear lifts in your shoes,

994
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:33,359
you want braces,
but you don't have the balls,

995
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,861
and you have a cat

996
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:38,514
that you love
more than it loves you.

997
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:40,483
- Good to see you, Louis.
- Mm.

998
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:43,703
I need a day.

999
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:46,873
You going down?

1000
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,208
All the way up, asshole.

1001
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,026
I'll take the ride.

1002
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:58,051
Hey.
Hey.

1003
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,589
What's that?

1004
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,207
This is my way
of showing you

1005
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,677
that no matter
what you choose,

1006
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:09,896
I support you.

1007
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,848
And if your dream
is to go to Stanford,

1008
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:14,901
then that's my dream
for you too.

1009
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,693
How does it look?

1010
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:26,696
I have to admit,
it looks pretty good.

1011
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,867
So what changed
your mind?

1012
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,382
You got into Harvard?

1013
00:39:46,433 --> 00:39:48,851
It's a--
it's a long story,

1014
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,419
but I have to go
right now.

1015
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,639
I wanted to be here
when you got home.

1016
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,857
But if you let me,

1017
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,425
I'd like to come
straight back here

1018
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,727
and tell you
the whole thing.

1019
00:39:57,778 --> 00:39:59,445
Okay.

1020
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,697
Okay.

1021
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:13,984
Any progress
getting to Mariga?

1022
00:40:14,035 --> 00:40:15,298
Cameron's not just bluffing

1023
00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:17,050
about what Mariga's
gonna say.

1024
00:40:17,135 --> 00:40:18,135
He doesn't even have him.

1025
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:19,136
That means we--

1026
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:21,504
We win.
It's over.

1027
00:40:23,474 --> 00:40:26,560
Ah, it's gonna be fun
telling Cameron that.

1028
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:28,028
It's gonna be fun for Mike.

1029
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:30,480
I've got
something else to do,

1030
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:32,816
and it's not
gonna be fun.

1031
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,735
Is that
why we're up here?

1032
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,686
You remember
when you told me you decided

1033
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:39,856
to take Gordon, Schmidt,
and Van Dyke down?

1034
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:42,125
I guess that is
why we're up here.

1035
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:43,577
You said,
take them in the night

1036
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,361
because nighttime's
when they're sleeping.

1037
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:46,713
And you thought
I was wrong.

1038
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:49,249
And then you said
if I were ever in your shoes,

1039
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:53,053
I might think differently.

1040
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:54,838
What'd you do, Harvey?

1041
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,207
I made a move
in the night.

1042
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,478
I get Ava Hessington
acquitted...

1043
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:05,548
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

1044
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,727
I guess congratulations
are in order.

1045
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:19,539
I'm here to tell you
I don't want it anymore.

1046
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,415
Get out of my sight.

1047
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:45,889
You look ready
to attack.

1048
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,058
Does Harvey know his puppy's
off his leash?

1049
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:49,926
Harvey said he didn't need
to waste a trip down here

1050
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:52,595
just for me to tell you
I have my eye on the ball.

1051
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,865
I'm afraid
I don't follow you.

1052
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:56,266
Mariga.

1053
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:58,201
You weren't lying
about what he would say.

1054
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:00,270
You were lying about having him
in the first place.

1055
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,041
This whole thing
was designed just to get us

1056
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:04,574
to sign your bullshit deal.

1057
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,709
You're right.

1058
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:07,377
We didn't have him,
but we do now,

1059
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:09,329
and he's on a flight
as we speak.

1060
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:11,581
So you do me a favor,
and you tell Harvey

1061
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:13,793
he can take that bullshit deal
and shove it up his ass,

1062
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:14,968
'cause we're going
to trial.

1063
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:16,136
No way.

1064
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,287
If you didn't have
Mariga yesterday,

1065
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:18,621
you don't have him today.

1066
00:42:18,673 --> 00:42:21,141
Why don't you ask
your friend Stephen Huntley?

1067
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:24,261
He's the one who led me
right to him.
