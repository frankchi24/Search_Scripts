1
00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:02,765
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,144
will you marry me?

3
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:06,180
Yes, I will marry you.

4
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:07,448
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.

5
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:09,383
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

6
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,452
and just put me in there,
just like she did with Harvard.

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,053
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

8
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:14,655
you don't move
the goddamn body.

9
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:16,523
Harvey, I'm stuck.

10
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,759
I can't live my whole life
like this.

11
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:20,794
You want me to set up
your new corporation?

12
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:23,163
I want you to join
my new corporation.

13
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,699
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.

14
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,668
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

15
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,737
Scottie, I need you to give
Louis his transaction back.

16
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:33,640
Does this have something to do
with that favor he did you?

17
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,710
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.

18
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:37,978
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing

19
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:39,646
everything with each other
after all.

20
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:40,881
- Scottie.
- You can't have it

21
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:42,382
both ways, Harvey.

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,718
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?

23
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:46,253
I don't like kids.

24
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,156
I was willing to give up Harvard
for you.

25
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:51,592
You can't give up something
for me?

26
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:00,534
I understand.
Can I just say something please?

27
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,805
I know you keep saying that
I won't feel this way forever,

28
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:08,041
but why is it
when the guys shows up

29
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,810
with chicken vindaloo
40 minutes late

30
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:12,813
with no naan
and no silverware,

31
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:14,848
instead of throwing the chutney
in his face,

32
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,818
I'm thanking him
and I am tipping him $20?

33
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:21,922
Do you want to tell me
why that happens?

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,491
I don't care.
I hate myself.

35
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,326
I hate my life.

36
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:28,595
The woman I love is gone,
my heart is broken,

37
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:30,130
and I really--
to be honest with you,

38
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:31,965
I just don't have
the will to live.

39
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:37,838
Hold on.
It's my associate.

40
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:38,906
Katrina.

41
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,908
Louis, it's 7:55.

42
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,309
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.

43
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:44,845
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything,

44
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:47,080
and unless the building
is on fire and Sheila's in it,

45
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,982
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?

46
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,183
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

47
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,351
My heart's been shattered

48
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,659
into a thousand million pieces,

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,154
and if I can't put my heart
into my work,

50
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:56,557
then I'm not gonna do
any work at all, so...

51
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:58,392
How long do you think
you'll be out?

52
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,993
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow,

53
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,495
the rest of the year.

54
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:02,763
You know,
just don't call here again

55
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,966
because I'm not gonna answer
the number.

56
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,735
Doc?

57
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:11,338
Dr. Lipschitz?

58
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,974
Hello?

59
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,977
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.

60
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,827
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.

61
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,229
I called you three times.
I had to do something.

62
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,432
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.

63
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:42,636
What for?
You're just doing your job.

64
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,138
Scottie, I'm sorry.

65
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,841
What happened with Louis,
I didn't like doing it.

66
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,043
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now

67
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:51,678
is asking you to let it go.

68
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:53,447
Harvey, it's not that you
picked Louis over me.

69
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:54,881
It's that you wouldn't
tell me why.

70
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,784
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.

71
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:03,056
And I'm asking you
to trust me.

72
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:05,626
Okay.

73
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,695
I can let it go,
but keeping things from me

74
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:12,499
just can't keep happening,
okay?

75
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,635
I can't tell you
whether or not that's okay,

76
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:19,339
and I definitely
can't tell you why.

77
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,074
Too soon?

78
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:22,776
What are you going to do
to make it up to me?

79
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,311
Nothing right now.

80
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,813
I'm taking Mike
to the marathon footwear brunch.

81
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,442
You're taking a date
to an I.P.O. event?

82
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,050
That's so cute.
It's not a date.

83
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:31,485
He's never gonna put out.

84
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:32,886
Well, it's too bad
that you're not taking me

85
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:35,789
because I was thinking
of letting you...

86
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:47,067
Mr. Specter.

87
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:48,468
James Quelling.

88
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:50,337
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
Mr. Quelling.

89
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,839
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.

90
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:55,676
Yeah, you do, unless you want
Friday's headline to read,

91
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,679
"Marathon Footwear builds
playgrounds that kill children."

92
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,480
My client builds playgrounds
that help children.

93
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:03,583
And uses a synthetic
full of toxins to do it.

94
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:05,686
Look, I don't know
who you are,

95
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:08,153
but I know what you're trying
to do, and it isn't gonna work.

96
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:09,589
Look,
I'm a reasonable man.

97
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,558
This is a huge moment
for your client.

98
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,760
I won't file this
before Friday.

99
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,129
You think I'm gonna let you
extort my client?

100
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,732
No, I think you're gonna
protect your client

101
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
from a claim
that could ruin them.

102
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,706
In fact,
I'm counting on it.

103
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:28,041
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.

104
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,879
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit. From who?

105
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:34,514
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.

106
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:36,516
But I thought Louis
was his lawyer.

107
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,652
He doesn't want me
to be his lawyer.

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,322
He wants me to be a partner.

109
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,491
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.

110
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,859
- And?
- I don't know.

111
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:47,127
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

112
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,863
What do you think?
I think that I love you,

113
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,834
and what you want to do
is what I want you to do.

114
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:55,902
I don't know what to do.

115
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,438
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?

116
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,307
If I do that,
all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,

117
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:01,441
"thanks for doing everything
for me.

118
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,276
I'm thinking about quitting."
Well...

119
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,778
No, but you said
that you don't think of him

120
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,613
as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.

121
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,682
- So?
- So if he can't have

122
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,952
an honest conversation with
your best interests in mind,

123
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,856
he's not your friend, and--
and he shouldn't be your boss.

134
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:54,184
I have to talk to you
about something.

135
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:57,620
Well, unless its value
is in excess of $575 million,

136
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:58,822
it can wait.

137
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,190
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.

138
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:02,525
Good because our I.P.O.
is in jeopardy

139
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:05,028
unless we can deal
with this.

140
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:07,831
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.

141
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:09,365
This is a bullshit claim.

142
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,834
Maybe, but a bullshit claim

143
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:13,421
on the right day is better than
a great claim on a bullshit day.

144
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,271
Did you come up with that
all by yourself?

145
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,473
My grandmother
taught it to me.

146
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,242
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find

147
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,350
everything there is to know
about this Quelling guy.

148
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:24,314
Harvey, why don't you
just pay him off?

149
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,448
Protect the I.P.O.?

150
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:26,950
I worked my ass off
for this day.

151
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,017
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted

152
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,453
by some piece of shit
I've never heard of.

153
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,755
Okay. On it.

154
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:34,691
Jessica.

155
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,392
Donna,
what can I do for you?

156
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,127
I was just walking
by reception,

157
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:39,662
and I thought you might
like to know--you know,

158
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,431
because it's your firm and--
Donna, get to it.

159
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:43,867
Charles Van Dyke
is in the lobby.

160
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:46,336
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.

161
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:47,537
You were right
to come to me.

162
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:48,872
Would you like me
to send him on his way?

163
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,007
I prefer to take care
of Charles Van Dyke myself.

164
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:53,009
Excellent.

165
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:59,616
You can stare at it
all you want, Charles,

166
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,184
but it's not going to change.

167
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:02,485
I was just thinking,

168
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:04,787
"I can't believe you put
the mailroom boy's name

169
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:06,389
on the wall."
I think what you mean is

170
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:08,591
that you can't believe
yours was ever taken off.

171
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,093
I put that behind me
years ago.

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,440
What are you doing here,
Charles?

173
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:15,131
I suggest we go
in your office and talk.

174
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,134
Right here is just fine.

175
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,369
What do you want?

176
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:21,638
I want a 30% increase
in my dividend check.

177
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:24,807
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.

178
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,377
This is formal notice of
my demand to audit your books.

179
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,545
You have until Friday
to comply.

180
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:32,482
You gave up this right
when we ran you out of town.

181
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,984
I think you're forgetting
I retain that right

182
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:37,987
in the event of any
material change in my dividend.

183
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:39,622
Your dividend went up.

184
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,559
Materially.

185
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,395
You think
we're hiding profits.

186
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:48,631
From what I know of you,
you're always hiding something.

187
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:53,603
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.

188
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:54,971
That's not what your ex-wife
calls you.

189
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,139
She calls you Jim.

190
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,107
That's one of the nicer names
she uses.

191
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:00,143
She's been calling you
a lot these days.

192
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,011
Wow, you found out
I'm divorced.

193
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,880
Well, I'll withdraw
the lawsuit.

194
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,115
It's not the divorce, Jimbo,
it's the huge wall

195
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:08,518
of mounting debt
that's closing in on you

196
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:10,320
since you tanked
the tobacco litigation.

197
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,221
I didn't tank it.
I lost.

198
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,556
You didn't just lose.

199
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:15,425
You had an offer that
would have set you up for life.

200
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,360
Instead, you rolled the dice,
went to verdict,

201
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:18,728
and now you got nothing.

202
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:20,396
Which is why your wife
left you,

203
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:23,466
and now you're coming after us
with a fabricated claim.

204
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,935
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.

205
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:28,538
You've got one report
of possible toxins

206
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,873
in the playground material.
And not one sick child.

207
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:32,842
And you have an I.P.O.
on Friday,

208
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,011
and if this suit appears
in the <i>Journal</i> that morning,

209
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,479
what do you think
the stock price is gonna be

210
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:40,650
when they ring that bell?

211
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:43,119
Got me.
Give me your number.

212
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:46,756
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.

213
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:50,259
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.

214
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,662
But one thing,
this precludes you

215
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,432
from representing any other
plaintiffs with the same action.

216
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,603
You got me.

217
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,905
I have 100 other plaintiffs
waiting in the wings.

218
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:06,009
That's a $10 million hit
you just avoided.

219
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,243
I tell you what.

220
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:09,412
Give me a million,
and we're really done.

221
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,615
James, this covers your debts
and gets you out from under.

222
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,654
You think that means I'm gonna
take less than it's worth?

223
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:21,791
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.

224
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,794
You know where to reach me.

225
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:28,398
Thought you said
you were willing to go

226
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,233
as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before

227
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,602
I realized
what we were dealing with.

228
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:35,838
This guy doesn't owe money
'cause he got divorced.

229
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,373
He got divorced
'cause he owes money.

230
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,282
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.

231
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,877
How does that help us?

232
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:42,879
He doesn't know I'm one.

233
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,821
Where's Louis?

234
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,556
- Jessica.
- Where is he?

235
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:57,026
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.

236
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:58,694
The thing is
I don't know if he--

237
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:01,664
Katrina,
your job as gatekeeper

238
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:04,167
does not apply to me,
so I'm going to ask you

239
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,234
one more time.

240
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:08,237
Why isn't Louis
in the building?

241
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:09,539
He must still be in court.

242
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:11,808
Is there something I can do?
What you can do

243
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,976
is find Louis and have him
come up with a way around

244
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:16,079
this demand
to look at our books.

245
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,507
When should I tell him
you need it?

246
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:20,917
Yesterday.

247
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,619
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.

248
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,955
- What night?
- Every night.

249
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:28,184
Well, I hope you know where
tonight's game is because--

250
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:32,895
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:36,299
You and I are going.

252
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,734
- Um...
- What?

253
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:45,975
I got a job offer,
Harvey.

254
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:48,478
Supposed to go have drinks
to talk about it tonight.

255
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:51,214
I can move it,
it's just, that's...

256
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:54,517
that's why I hesitated.

257
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,652
- When?
- When what?

258
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,987
When'd you get
the job offer?

259
00:10:58,055 --> 00:10:59,896
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.

260
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:00,957
I didn't know
what I thought.

261
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:02,625
- And now you do?
- No. It's--

262
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:05,895
Who?

263
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:08,264
Jonathan Sidwell.

264
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:09,432
The spin-off idea?

265
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,033
- Yeah.
- I should have known.

266
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,969
He wants you to be
his general counsel?

267
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:17,340
No, he wants to make me
an investment banker.

268
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:22,778
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.

269
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,848
What? Why?

270
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,750
Because you can compete there
like you do here

271
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,519
with nothing hanging
over your head.

272
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,053
What if I don't want to stop
being a lawyer?

273
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,281
Well, then don't
take the job.

274
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:33,589
I mean, what do you want
from me?

275
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:35,258
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.

276
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,927
No, you told me
what you would do.

277
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:39,929
I want to know what you think
I should do.

278
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:42,498
Mike, last week,
you said you'd do anything

279
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:47,603
to stop being a fraud,
so my advice is take it.

280
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,406
Still be in the majors,
just be a different sport.

281
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,475
Excuse me,
do you have a minute?

282
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,995
Look, you and I have never--

283
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:08,798
No, we haven't.

284
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,032
I need your help.

285
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,867
You must be scraping
the bottom of the barrel

286
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:13,969
if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.

287
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:17,273
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.

288
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,108
It's worse than awful.

289
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,910
Jessica needs him on a case
right now.

290
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,546
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.

291
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:24,547
Then I'll just go over there
right now.

292
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:25,848
That won't work.

293
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,683
Even if it did,
we don't have time.

294
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:30,720
So then why are you here?

295
00:12:30,787 --> 00:12:31,868
Rachel, you don't trust me.

296
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:35,491
I get that,
but Louis asked me

297
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:38,194
to cover for him, and that
is what I'm going to do.

298
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:43,466
You're the best paralegal here,
and you're his friend.

299
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,836
So will you help me or not?
I will.

300
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:53,309
So...I figured out
what you can do

301
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:55,311
to make it up to me tonight.

302
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:56,812
I thought we were good.

303
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,382
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling
some residual anger.

304
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,218
Scottie, I'm kind of busy
right now,

305
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:03,419
and I have plans tonight.

306
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,154
Taking Mike
on another I.P.O. date?

307
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:06,822
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.

308
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,923
Sounds mysterious.

309
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,658
Bet you can't tell me
what it is.

310
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:11,794
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?

311
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:14,396
Can I come?
It's a work thing.

312
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,665
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.

313
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,401
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?

314
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,337
- What got into you?
- Nothing.

315
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:25,107
Sometimes at the office,
I'm working.

316
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:28,244
Fair enough, boss.

317
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:38,187
Are you sure that's how
you want to play that?

318
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:40,156
Play what,
the fact that I'm busy?

319
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,791
The fact that you
just snapped at her

320
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,592
when we both know what
you're really angry about.

321
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,829
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.

322
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:48,377
You're angry
that Mike wants to leave,

323
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:49,665
and you just
took it out on her.

324
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,434
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt,

325
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:56,639
and the anger covers the hurt,
but I knew you didn't know that.

326
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,074
I was annoyed
about the interruption

327
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,577
just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.

328
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,479
You're feeling
exactly what I'm feeling.

329
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:05,748
The idea of Mike leaving sucks,

330
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:07,283
and the sooner you get
your brain around that,

331
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,786
the sooner you can maybe
do something about it.

332
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:12,154
Can I get back to work now?

333
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,990
You can get back to work
whenever you want.

334
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:17,159
But if all you're gonna do
is stick your head in the sand,

335
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:19,328
then you're not going to have
an associate or a girlfriend

336
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:24,066
to get back to work from.

337
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:26,268
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.

338
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:27,870
She suspect anything?

339
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,973
I wouldn't be standing here
if she did.

340
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,909
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.

341
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,411
Well, she should.

342
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:37,012
Louis didn't just
come up with a way

343
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,148
to keep Charles Van Dyke
out of our books.

344
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:43,052
Louis came up with a way
to blow him out of the water.

345
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,022
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.

346
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,026
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.

347
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,600
Don't get used to it.

348
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,001
Don't worry.

349
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:00,636
I'm not looking
to work here again.

350
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:02,571
Not here,
but you are looking to work?

351
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,442
I've always been able to see
through your bullshit, Charles.

352
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:11,347
Which is why I'm offering you
these, five cases.

353
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:14,483
We're co-counsel,
split the profits 50/50.

354
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:17,152
It announces to the world
that you are back in business,

355
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,787
which is what you really want.

356
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:22,658
You came to me
bearing gifts.

357
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,893
I still have the card.

358
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,297
"To the man who hired me
for all you've done."

359
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:30,599
Two days later,
you shoved me out.

360
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,736
I take this to mean
you're passing on my offer.

361
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:35,170
I'm shitting on your offer.

362
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,106
Okay, Charles.
You were right.

363
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:40,943
Your dividend check did have
the wrong amount,

364
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,111
but from now on,
it's going to have

365
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,246
the right amount, zero.

366
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,215
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm

367
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:51,220
you had your exit agreement with
no longer exists.

368
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:54,056
We became Pearson Darby,
then Pearson Specter,

369
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:57,326
which means
you're not entitled to a thing.

370
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,428
That's not in the spirit
of our agreement.

371
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:02,197
And neither is your claim.

372
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,166
There's only one problem.

373
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:06,468
You should have dug deeper
into the fine print.

374
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:08,270
The entity referred to
in our agreement

375
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,773
is defined in your bylaws
as "any partnership

376
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,544
in which the name partner
is Jessica Pearson."

377
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,314
You didn't know.

378
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:21,283
My number just tripled.

379
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,419
Your call.

380
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:26,355
Our hearing is Friday.

381
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:48,110
You guys playing cards?

382
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,180
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.

383
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:54,316
Why don't I give it a try?

384
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,385
Buyin is 25,000.

385
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:59,888
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.

386
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:03,092
Maybe I am out of my league.

387
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:16,271
Raise $45,000.

388
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,774
I'm putting you all-in.

389
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,542
I've seen guys like you
before.

390
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,012
You think if you bully me
with your big stack,

391
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,813
I'm gonna run and hide.

392
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:27,716
Here's the difference
between you and me, Jimbo,

393
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:31,153
I lose,
I pull out another 25 grand,

394
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,721
and another 25 after that.

395
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:36,025
You lose,
you've got nothing.

396
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:37,659
You're bluffing.

397
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,996
Then call
or get up and walk away,

398
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:45,501
but I've sat across from you
1,000 times before.

399
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,569
You won't walk.

400
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,262
Tough beat.

401
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,197
Take your winnings.

402
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,066
What winnings?

403
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:24,073
I thought maybe it was time
we do a little negotiating.

404
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,607
Well, you have my offer.

405
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,242
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.

406
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,211
I want a 50% increase
in base salary.

407
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,681
I want a guaranteed bonus not
tied to our investment returns,

408
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:37,419
a four-week vacation,
and I want a piece.

409
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:39,955
- A piece?
- A piece.

410
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:43,125
- No.
- No piece?

411
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:47,029
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.

412
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,130
You can't make up your mind,

413
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,032
so you want me
to make it up for you.

414
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,180
But I don't want someone
who's with me for the money.

415
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:53,469
I want someone who's with me

416
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:54,670
'cause they want to kick
some ass.

417
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:56,238
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take

418
00:18:56,306 --> 00:19:01,210
this job right now,
I will negotiate in good faith.

419
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:05,347
But you don't.

420
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:07,583
I don't yet.

421
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:12,287
Starting tomorrow,

422
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:13,956
I'll be interviewing
other people.

423
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:19,428
Once I find the right person,
job is gone.

424
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:26,235
I'm not dropping my suit when
you're going public in two days.

425
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:29,138
James, you've read
all about Hessington Oil.

426
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,140
The odds were stacked
against me.

427
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:34,710
I won anyway, because I win.

428
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:36,979
You won because Edward Darby
came forward.

429
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:38,313
You got lucky.

430
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:41,416
Guys like you always think
other people get lucky.

431
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,452
I don't get lucky.

432
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,953
I make my own luck,

433
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:48,123
and in this case,
it's bleeding you dry.

434
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:50,025
Right there.

435
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:53,962
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.

436
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,567
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.

437
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:02,004
It's the exact amount
of the deal we offered you.

438
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,439
Sign it.

439
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:07,809
We'll fix the paperwork
tomorrow.

440
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:14,650
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.

441
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:17,119
He doesn't play anymore
the rest of the night.

442
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,018
You didn't sleep well.

443
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:31,853
I didn't sleep at all.

444
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:34,656
It's a big decision.

445
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:36,592
You still haven't told me
what you think.

446
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,961
Mike, I can't make
the decision for you.

447
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:40,462
I don't want you
to make it for me.

448
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,097
I just want to know
what you think.

449
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:43,732
And I already told you
that I will support you

450
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,734
with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me

451
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:49,004
right now is by telling me
how you feel.

452
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:52,174
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?

453
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:53,508
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job,

454
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:54,816
but you're too afraid
to say it.

455
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,124
Okay, you want to know
the truth?

456
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,879
You already know
what you want to do.

457
00:20:57,947 --> 00:21:01,250
And if I try to change your mind
and it goes wrong,

458
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,197
then I'm afraid
you're gonna hold it against me.

459
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:05,220
Would you just say it?

460
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:08,790
Yes.
I want you to take the job.

461
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,296
Look, I know that you love
what you do,

462
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,404
but every day, you go into work
with the possibility

463
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:20,535
of being caught,
and it is eating away at you.

464
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:25,841
If you stay there,
that's just not gonna change.

465
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:33,181
- Jessica. How did--
- It go?

466
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:37,252
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.

467
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,087
What?
No, it was a good move.

468
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:40,322
Oh, it would have been

469
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,357
if our own bylaws
didn't supersede it.

470
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,026
Th--that's impossible.

471
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:46,495
It was convoluted
and buried in the fine print,

472
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:49,665
and something Louis Litt
never would have missed.

473
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:52,801
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm wrong.

474
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:55,270
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.

475
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,639
So when you came
into my office

476
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,741
and told me Louis
had come up with that move,

477
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:04,079
you were full of shit.

478
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:07,716
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.

479
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,464
Well, that kind of thing
only happens once.

480
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:13,188
You know how I know
it's not gonna happen again?

481
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,891
Pack up your shit.

482
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,928
I don't care what kind of deal
you have with Harvey.

483
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:21,930
You're done.

484
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,871
Why wouldn't you tell her?

485
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:32,240
I said I would cover.

486
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,743
I didn't say I would cover
when it suited me.

487
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,379
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you
to get fired over this.

488
00:22:37,447 --> 00:22:40,215
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.

489
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,249
Katrina--

490
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:42,818
Thank you for your help,
Rachel.

491
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:44,219
I really appreciate it,

492
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,288
but if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

493
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,348
He's not here.

494
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,217
Where is he?

495
00:23:15,284 --> 00:23:16,418
To tell you the truth,
I don't know.

496
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:18,153
All he said was he had
a late night.

497
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:21,256
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.

498
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:22,290
- I was just--
- You're taking the job,

499
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:25,093
aren't you?

500
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,194
I don't know.

501
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:28,029
Yeah, you do.

502
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:32,033
You just don't want
to admit it.

503
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:37,706
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.

504
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,945
God damn it.

505
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:51,720
Do you know what that man
has done for you?

506
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:54,189
Do you know what it took for him
to start trusting someone?

507
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:56,358
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.

508
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:57,893
So someone's dangling some money
in front of you.

509
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,395
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.

510
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:03,098
I'm gonna say what he won't.

511
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,499
He needs you.

512
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,701
You need this job,
and if you can't see that,

513
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,069
then you might as well
just leave right now.

514
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:11,373
Donna, someone's offering me
a way out.

515
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,708
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do,

516
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:16,311
but I also care about my life
with Rachel.

517
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,885
I don't want to live my life
like this anymore.

518
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:36,832
Then you better be the best
goddamn investment banker

519
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:39,768
this city has ever seen.

520
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:53,148
Scottie, I'm sorry
I was angry in your direction,

521
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,850
but it was really
about something else.

522
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:57,319
Let me guess, Donna explained
your feelings to you,

523
00:24:57,386 --> 00:24:58,787
and now you're here
to apologize.

524
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:01,122
Maybe.

525
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,358
What was the something else?

526
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:05,927
Mike got a job offer.

527
00:25:05,995 --> 00:25:07,496
And you don't want him
to do it.

528
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:08,497
No, I don't.

529
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:10,031
Well, if you want him to stay,

530
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,567
you know what's actually
a nice tactic?

531
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:15,537
Telling him
you want him to stay.

532
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,974
What?

533
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,842
Had I known "tell me
what's going on with you"

534
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,511
meant "I'm going to tell you
what to do,"

535
00:25:22,512 --> 00:25:23,979
I might not have
taken you up on it.

536
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:26,448
Oh, okay.
Mmm.

537
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:36,291
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.

538
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:41,263
You have that paperwork
for me?

539
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,632
Well, I got something for you,
but it's not that.

540
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:45,433
Didn't you learn your lesson
last night?

541
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,668
I learned to listen.

542
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:48,136
When you talked,

543
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:51,039
you mentioned Hessington Oil,
so I looked back into it.

544
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:53,408
Turns out you don't create
your own luck.

545
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:54,609
Your associate does.

546
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:56,077
What the hell
are you talking about?

547
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:57,879
He conspired
with Harold Gunderson

548
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,814
to file a lawsuit
against your own client

549
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:02,317
so you could bribe witnesses
not to testify.

550
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:03,818
We didn't bribe anyone.

551
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:06,221
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me

552
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:09,457
two rookie associates
who went to law school together

553
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:11,493
and started at the same firm
made this happen

554
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:13,094
without collusion.
I don't need to tell you

555
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,896
anything 'cause
there's nothing to tell.

556
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,965
Well, you're gonna
have to tell someone something,

557
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,634
because that suit was filed
one day, settled the next,

558
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:21,903
and those witnesses cancelled
their flights to New York.

559
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,338
That is a bribe,

560
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:25,340
and when I bring it
to the attention of the bar,

561
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,944
you and your associate
are going to be in deep shit.

562
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:31,046
Now who showed his tell?

563
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:33,348
Here's your money back.

564
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:37,252
And either I go to the bar,
or you settle for $2 million.

565
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,254
You have until tomorrow.

566
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:46,621
Where's Mike?

567
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,385
He's in there.

568
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:50,155
Harvey--

569
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,524
- Harvey.
- Not now.

570
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,759
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?

571
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:56,594
You need to get her
to hack into the bar

572
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:57,695
and put your name in.

573
00:26:57,763 --> 00:26:58,897
What the hell
are you talking about?

574
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:00,398
A week ago, you told me
that the number one rule

575
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:01,933
was not to move
the goddamn body.

576
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:04,002
A week ago, people weren't
sniffing around you.

577
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:07,038
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.

578
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:08,673
Quelling knows
about your bullshit lawsuit

579
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:09,774
with Harold Gunderson.

580
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:11,476
He turned me in?

581
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:13,845
No, but he will
if we don't cave.

582
00:27:13,913 --> 00:27:16,080
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.

583
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:18,616
He hands you in to the bar,
they look you up, we're done.

584
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:22,654
Not if I'm not here.

585
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:25,657
Oh, that's why
you're in here.

586
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:28,660
You're taking the job.
I am.

587
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,633
And you think
an addicted gambler

588
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:38,703
who lost his wife, his child,
and his house is gonna stop

589
00:27:38,771 --> 00:27:40,672
coming for you just because
you're not working here?

590
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,841
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar

591
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:44,375
is twice the crime
I've been committing.

592
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,511
I am telling you
Quelling is on the trail.

593
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:47,979
You don't do this,
we're gonna get caught.

594
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:49,414
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.

595
00:27:49,482 --> 00:27:50,815
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better

596
00:27:50,883 --> 00:27:52,923
figure something out fast,
because tomorrow morning,

597
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:55,753
we're done, and you quitting
isn't gonna change that.

598
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:08,399
You can't fire
Katrina Bennett.

599
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,368
I can fire
whoever I want to.

600
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:12,937
She was covering for Louis.

601
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:14,873
What are you talking about?

602
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,609
Louis's engagement is over,
and he's losing it.

603
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:19,344
He won't come in to work,
he won't pick up his phone,

604
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:22,080
and he just didn't want
anyone to know.

605
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:24,649
Then why are you
telling me?

606
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:29,454
Because I helped her
cover for him.

607
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:32,957
Are you saying
I should fire you too?

608
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:39,330
I am saying that...

609
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:42,000
We made a mistake,

610
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,202
but that we were just
looking out for Louis,

611
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,873
and I know how much
you value loyalty,

612
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,408
so I don't think
that should be the thing

613
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:55,313
that costs Katrina her job...

614
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:57,190
or mine.

615
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:01,786
- Jessica.
- I need you.

616
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:03,922
No, listen, I just need
a little more time.

617
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:06,758
And had you asked me for it,
I would have said yes,

618
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:11,262
but instead, you had Katrina
cover for you.

619
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,731
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?

620
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,967
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you

621
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:18,903
that she tried to pass off
her work for yours.

622
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:22,106
Louis, Van Dyke wants
to look at our books.

623
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:24,175
What?
We can't have that.

624
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:27,111
I know.
This was her fix.

625
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:31,349
Oh, no,
and you used this on him?

626
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:35,386
I did,
and then I fired Katrina.

627
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:37,522
- Jessica.
- I know.

628
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,657
I can't fire her
for being loyal.

629
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:42,927
But I can't afford you
sitting here licking your wounds

630
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:44,862
while I get my ass
handed to me.

631
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,297
Please, just listen to me,
okay?

632
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:47,799
I cannot see straight.

633
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:50,535
I cannot think straight,
and even if I wanted

634
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:54,505
to come and help you, I wouldn't
be any good to you, so...

635
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:58,543
Louis...

636
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:02,347
I know you loved Sheila,

637
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:06,217
but do you love your firm?

638
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:07,218
You know I do.

639
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:08,553
And when you love a woman,

640
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:11,756
can you stand the thought of her
being with another man?

641
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:14,425
- No.
- Well, Louis,

642
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:20,264
Van Dyke is trying to get
into Pearson Specter's pants.

643
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:23,267
What are you going to do
about it?

644
00:30:26,005 --> 00:30:27,939
I'm gonna put on
a goddamn chastity belt.

645
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:29,240
How?

646
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:31,476
'Cause Katrina actually
was on the right track.

647
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,912
Van Dyke's claim is gone
if the partnership is gone.

648
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,280
The bylaws say it's not.

649
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:39,884
No, it is
if we become an L.L.C.

650
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:42,887
We can't do that
by tomorrow.

651
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,355
We'd have to rewrite
every contract.

652
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,557
Boy, wow, Jessica, you
sometimes really surprise me.

653
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,726
You don't think I know that?

654
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,862
I have an army of associates
that I've trained

655
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:52,530
within an inch of their lives.

656
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:54,832
My name is
Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt,

657
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,735
and my firm is under siege,
so don't you tell me

658
00:30:57,803 --> 00:31:00,805
what I can and cannot do!

659
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:14,212
- Hey.
- Hey.

660
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,882
I don't want to interrupt,
but I was just wondering

661
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,083
what happened with Mike.

662
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,052
He's leaving.

663
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,292
I'm sorry.

664
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,895
It's fine.

665
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:34,599
Can I ask you something?

666
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:37,468
Did you tell him
that you wanted him to stay?

667
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:41,472
I didn't get around to it.

668
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,107
You--you didn't
get around to it?

669
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:46,678
I was gonna tell him, and then
he told me he was leaving,

670
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:48,579
and then other shit
came up, so...

671
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:50,348
So you just dropped it?

672
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,616
I told you other shit came up.

673
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,885
What other shit?

674
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,987
I mean, you had
an emergency case filing,

675
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:57,955
so you let your protege
walk out the door?

676
00:31:58,023 --> 00:32:00,291
- It's complicated.
- Okay.

677
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,295
Well...then share it with me.

678
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:10,334
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.

679
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,103
What?
That's bullshit.

680
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:13,171
You may have blurred some lines,

681
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:14,238
but you certainly didn't
cross any.

682
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:15,406
Fight him.

683
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:17,141
- No, I can't.
- Why?

684
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:19,343
Look, I don't want
to talk about it.

685
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:21,512
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off,

686
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,181
you get in the ring.
What are you saying?

687
00:32:23,248 --> 00:32:25,583
What I'm saying is that
you're not taking on Quelling,

688
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,151
but you're letting Mike
walk out the door

689
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,419
without trying to stop him.

690
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:29,754
I think one thing changed
the other,

691
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,789
and I want to know why.

692
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:34,525
Maybe what changed
is his desire to be here,

693
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:37,695
and maybe what I have to say
doesn't matter.

694
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:40,264
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?

695
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:42,266
Because it's sure as hell not
about some stupid case.

696
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:43,801
You know what?
God damn it!

697
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:47,972
For once, can't it just be
about what I said it's about?

698
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,708
You didn't say
what it was about.

699
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:05,690
Harvey, I'm really sorry

700
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:08,226
that the Mike thing turned out
this way.

701
00:33:08,293 --> 00:33:11,028
I am, but I can't say
that I didn't see it coming.

702
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:13,664
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What? It isn't what?

703
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:14,932
It isn't what it seems?

704
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,367
Because I don't know
what it seems.

705
00:33:16,435 --> 00:33:19,070
All I know is that any time
I ask you about anything,

706
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:22,039
all you say is,
"I can't talk about it."

707
00:33:27,946 --> 00:33:30,381
I'm just gonna stop asking.

708
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:31,649
Then we'll just
make up later,

709
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:34,819
and we can do it
all over again tomorrow.

710
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:59,577
Quelling can't hurt us
anymore.

711
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:02,713
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.

712
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:04,649
I wanted to find out
where all that money came from

713
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:05,917
to find all those clients.

714
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,385
He doesn't have the money.

715
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:08,553
And yet his rent gets paid,

716
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,555
and they don't turn off
his electricity.

717
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:18,429
Holy shit.

718
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:20,131
Guess you didn't have to see
Lola after all.

719
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,334
You think I got access to that
with a court order?

720
00:34:23,402 --> 00:34:24,635
So you did go see her?

721
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:25,736
You put the idea in my head.

722
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:30,074
I just came up
with a different agenda.

723
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:32,076
We got him.

724
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:38,149
No.

725
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:40,885
You got him.
What?

726
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:44,922
Your going-away present.

727
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,759
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.

728
00:35:09,348 --> 00:35:11,716
You have
my settlement check.

729
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:14,485
I don't have a dime
for you.

730
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:16,220
Then I guess the bar
is going to be hearing from me

731
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,555
first thing in the morning.

732
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:21,225
Well, then, they'll also
be hearing from me.

733
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:24,962
Disciplinary rule 5-107a,
"accepting compensation--"

734
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,264
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know

735
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,699
the penalty
is being disbarred.

736
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,487
You took money
from our client's competitors

737
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:31,802
to trump up
your bullshit suit.

738
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,471
You didn't come by that
legally.

739
00:35:33,538 --> 00:35:34,772
And they're not gonna care.

740
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,274
I don't know
if you've noticed,

741
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:38,009
but I don't have
a hell of a lot to lose,

742
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:40,912
so sign my deal or get
the hell out of my office.

743
00:35:40,979 --> 00:35:43,714
Well, here's the thing,
James.

744
00:35:43,782 --> 00:35:48,052
I don't either...

745
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,855
Because today is my last day
as a lawyer anyway.

746
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:53,157
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.

747
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:59,363
Good luck
in front of the bar.

748
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:06,370
I wasn't always like this.

749
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:12,009
I had tobacco in my sights.

750
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:13,511
They offered me a lot
of money.

751
00:36:13,578 --> 00:36:15,646
I could have made a fortune.

752
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:20,284
But $15,000 per client
for people with cancer?

753
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,420
I risked going to verdict
because I wanted

754
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:27,024
to get those people something
that could make a difference!

755
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:31,128
And I lost everything...

756
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:33,831
My clients, my wife, my kids!

757
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:36,233
You lost them because
you gambled them away, James.

758
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:38,235
I know that.

759
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:51,115
Please.

760
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:54,518
Being a lawyer is what I am.

761
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:56,988
It's who I am.

762
00:36:57,055 --> 00:36:59,857
And if you take that away...

763
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:06,263
It's up to you, James.

764
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:14,271
I'll drop the suit.

765
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:22,413
I promise.

766
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,281
Louis,
where the hell are you?

767
00:37:30,288 --> 00:37:32,156
You said
you could get it done.

768
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:35,626
I walk through those doors,
our books fly open.

769
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:39,530
Get here now.

770
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:44,135
Well,
this should be fun.

771
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:46,404
We've never been across
the aisle from each other.

772
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:48,672
Which is why you don't realize
that it won't be fun.

773
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,074
We'll see what we see.

774
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,677
Case 41432,
Van Dyke versus Pearson.

775
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:56,113
Look at that.
Game time.

776
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:59,850
Ladies first.
Ladies first.

777
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:03,020
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?

778
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:06,023
Were you being polite
when you hired me?

779
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:07,958
What does one have to do
with the other?

780
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:13,364
"To the man who hired me,
for all you've done."

781
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:17,234
Do you want to know what I meant
when I wrote that card?

782
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:19,670
The day you made me that offer,
I asked you,

783
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:22,473
"did it have anything to do
with gender or race?"

784
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,341
You swore it didn't.

785
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:26,710
You lied to me.

786
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:29,713
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.

787
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:33,150
You know, Daniel Hardman
may have used people,

788
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:35,019
but he didn't give a shit
about their gender

789
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:36,420
or their color.

790
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,023
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name,

791
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,258
an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."

792
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:44,695
Not second in my class.
Diversity.

793
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:46,630
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that,

794
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:48,833
but we both know the truth,

795
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,303
which is why I sleep at night
just fine.

796
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,872
Well, it doesn't change
the facts in this case, does it?

797
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,109
No. No, it doesn't,
but this will.

798
00:38:58,176 --> 00:38:59,844
Charles, you remember
Louis Litt?

799
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:00,945
Sorry, I couldn't run.

800
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:02,413
Doctor wanted me
to take it easy.

801
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:03,614
Hey, Charles.

802
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:05,616
Great to see you.

803
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,188
You told me that story
to stall.

804
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:13,457
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.

805
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:16,193
But this is for me.

806
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:19,463
When I saw that asterisk
next to my name,

807
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:23,000
it made me sick to my stomach,
because in one second,

808
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:25,936
I understood
how you will always see me.

809
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:27,905
So that card was a thank you,

810
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:29,907
because if I hadn't
have felt sick,

811
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:32,610
then I might not have worked
as hard as I did

812
00:39:32,677 --> 00:39:35,246
to get where I am today.

813
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:37,248
You woke the dragon,
Charles.

814
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:40,251
How do you like me now?

815
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:53,531
I know you're there.

816
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:57,401
You need anything?

817
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,403
No.

818
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:01,605
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.

819
00:40:01,673 --> 00:40:02,907
We go public Monday morning.

820
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:04,275
I wasn't talking
about the I.P.O.

821
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:06,076
I was talking about
how you're feeling about Mike.

822
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,046
I know.

823
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:14,818
Okay.

824
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:18,756
Good night, Harvey.

825
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:23,427
I'm gonna tell Scottie.

826
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:27,064
About Mike?
Are you crazy?

827
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:29,166
You can't have it
both ways, Donna.

828
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:31,569
You can't tell me to open up
and then keep my secrets.

829
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:34,371
You spent more than a year
covering it up.

830
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:36,674
You tried to get him to commit
another crime to cover it up,

831
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:38,141
and now--
You said I should tell her

832
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:39,643
what's really bothering me!

833
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:40,878
I meant your feelings.

834
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:42,112
I didn't mean
confess to a felony.

835
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,781
These are
my goddamn feelings!

836
00:40:43,848 --> 00:40:46,283
Donna, I did something
when I hired him.

837
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:47,818
It's caused all of this.

838
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:51,088
I can't tell her,
and it's driving me crazy!

839
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:55,492
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.

840
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,062
I hate that he's gone,
but the jeopardy's gone too.

841
00:40:58,129 --> 00:40:59,997
It's done.

842
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:04,802
And now you want to turn around
and tell someone who--

843
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:07,805
Someone who what?

844
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:12,276
Nothing.

845
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,945
No, you better
finish that sentence.

846
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:18,482
Someone who's pissed at you,
Harvey.

847
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,318
Someone who keeps finding
a reason to be pissed at you,

848
00:41:21,386 --> 00:41:23,420
and it's not the third time,
and it's not the fifth time,

849
00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:25,055
and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying

850
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:27,324
to help my relationship,
not shit on it.

851
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:28,926
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.

852
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:30,694
Because I know
you're not mad at me.

853
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:33,030
And I know you're only
telling me this stupid idea

854
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:35,232
because you want me to tell you
what you already know.

855
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,702
You can't, Harvey.

856
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:44,074
It's good that you want to,
but you can't.

857
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:51,482
Could I have a minute?

858
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:05,129
Congratulate me.

859
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:08,699
I'm officially
a member of the New York bar.

860
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,101
You went to Lola?

861
00:42:11,169 --> 00:42:15,510
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.

862
