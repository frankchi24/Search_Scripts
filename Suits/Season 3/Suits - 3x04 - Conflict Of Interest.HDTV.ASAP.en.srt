1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,999
Ava Hessington,
you're under arrest.

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:04,135
Conspiracy
to commit murder.

3
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:05,336
If you're looking
to ride

4
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:06,287
some partner's coattails,
you're gonna have

5
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:08,222
to look somewhere else.

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,757
Stephen Huntley,
senior partner, London office.

7
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:13,094
I want you to find out
what the hell that guy's up to.

8
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,429
I know about your deal
with Edward.

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,347
I don't need you
baby-sitting me on this case.

10
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,483
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video.

11
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:19,834
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

12
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:22,370
You told me
to take this deal.

13
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,188
I did,
and now here I am.

14
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:25,823
I didn't know
about these murders.

15
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:28,159
What you don't seem to believe
is neither did I.

16
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:30,120
You're not the fool anymore,
Louis.

17
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:31,738
Mike Ross is.

18
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,105
And I can't take it back.

19
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:34,908
Your future at this firm
is over.

20
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,760
This is everything I have
on Tony Gianopolous.

21
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:38,495
Welcome to team Litt.

22
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,998
We just admitted to each other
that we're defending a murderer.

23
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:44,167
It doesn't really seem
like cause for celebration.

24
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,318
It's not a celebration.

25
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:46,453
I made a deal with Darby

26
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,221
to take over the firm
from Jessica.

27
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:30,997
- You heard?
- I heard.

28
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,216
- Vote's in 48 hours.
- She's not losing that vote.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,019
- I'm getting my shit.
- I got my shit.

30
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:37,720
- Conference room.
- Five minutes.

31
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,810
What is she doing here?

32
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,311
She's my new associate.

33
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:46,846
So that's why you made
the video.

34
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:48,537
You seem upset
that she led you to believe

35
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:49,816
that she was trying
to befriend you

36
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:51,367
when it turned out
she was gonna betray you.

37
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,286
- Louis.
- You got a problem with that?

38
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:54,687
No.
No problem.

39
00:01:54,738 --> 00:01:56,122
Not as long
as your daddy's here.

40
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,657
Do I have to have
another talk with you?

41
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,559
- He had a talk with you?
- Yes.

42
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:01,628
But I didn't feel the need
to run to you to protect me.

43
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:02,912
Second choice never does.

44
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,047
I can't believe it's up to me

45
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,131
to be the adult in the room.

46
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:07,383
Maybe it's time
we get down to business.

47
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:09,168
Good, because the first order
of business

48
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,671
is discussing what to do
following Ava's statement.

49
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:12,882
She's not making a statement.

50
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,507
- Yes, she is.
- Ava makes a statement,

51
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:15,708
Cameron's gonna be all over it.

52
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,376
Cameron Dennis
isn't the problem right now.

53
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,896
The problem is Ava Hessington
isn't a credible CEO.

54
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,649
The problem is she's on trial
for murder.

55
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,434
And public perception
says that she's as guilty

56
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,478
as Jean Valjean with a loaf
of bread in his pants.

57
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,607
We're facing a vote for control
of her company in two days.

58
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,775
Talking under threat
makes her look desperate.

59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,328
And not talking makes her look
either guilty or incompetent.

60
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:37,063
We need to send the message
to Wall Street

61
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,198
that she's in control
and she's got nothing to hide.

62
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,367
This is a meeting
about how to keep Ava's company

63
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:43,620
without endangering
her murder defense.

64
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,088
Did it ever occur to you that,
if she's cold enough

65
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:46,739
to kill off opposition
to her pipeline,

66
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,208
she's cold enough to pull off
lying to the press?

67
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,578
I mean, we all know
she did this, right?

68
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,518
This isn't open
for discussion.

69
00:02:58,585 --> 00:02:59,953
She's not saying a word.

70
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,437
I'm afraid it's too late.

71
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:03,273
What did you do?

72
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,607
She's on her way
to an interview right now.

73
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:05,725
It'll run in the <i>Journal,</i>

74
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,110
and then it will blow
Gianopolous

75
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:09,862
and his bullshit takeover
attempt out of the water.

76
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:17,070
- Connelly.
- Mr. Connelly, I do apologize,

77
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:19,322
but I'm afraid we have to change
the location of our interview.

78
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,674
- Who is this?
- Miss Hessington's assistant.

79
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,876
Well, I spoke to her assistant
this morning--

80
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:26,462
Yes, Rebecca handles
Miss Hessington's schedule.

81
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:28,214
I handle her life.

82
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:30,166
What, so I'm supposed
to traipse all over town

83
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
because of what she'd prefer?

84
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,720
- Not prefer. Insist.
- Insist?

85
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,888
I'm giving her a forum
to tell her side of the story.

86
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:38,558
An exclusive forum
which needn't be the case.

87
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,143
Now make no mistake,
Mr. Connelly,

88
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:42,178
Miss Hessington is the one
doing the favor here.

89
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:43,796
So, if you'd like
to speak with her,

90
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,516
my driver will be more
than happy to take you to her.

91
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,936
Or if you would prefer
to call Rebecca,

92
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,604
I'm sure she'll be able
to set something up for you

93
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:55,141
sometime say next December.

94
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,673
Go ahead and order.

95
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:12,491
Connelly's
running a little late.

96
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,793
He should get here

97
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,828
at ten past "you're not giving
an interview."

98
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,513
I wasn't trying
to keep this from you.

99
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:19,849
You didn't exactly cc me
on the memo.

100
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,685
Very well.
You want the truth?

101
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,105
I don't particularly appreciate
being muzzled.

102
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:27,974
I suggest you don't think
of it as muzzled so much

103
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,226
as keeping you out of jail
for the rest of your life.

104
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,228
And what'll you have me do,
Harvey, hmm?

105
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,530
Take a week in St. Barts?

106
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:35,848
Because that is not going
to happen.

107
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,283
I know that's not going
to happen.

108
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,701
You're on trial for murder.

109
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:40,870
And because of that
a tender offer's being made

110
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:43,573
on a company
with my family name.

111
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:46,125
And with all that going on,
the fact that I haven't made

112
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:48,327
a statement defending myself
is bullshit.

113
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,912
It's not bullshit.
It's smart.

114
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,714
Of course you see it that way.

115
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,633
You think I'm guilty.

116
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,668
I've told you before
it doesn't matter what I think.

117
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,137
But if you think saying you're
innocent is gonna make people

118
00:04:58,205 --> 00:04:59,705
believe you, it won't.

119
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,974
Because you know who says
they're innocent?

120
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,209
Everybody.

121
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,728
Every day
I keep my mouth shut

122
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:07,647
our stock takes a dive,

123
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,565
and that makes me vulnerable.

124
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,566
I get it.

125
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:11,851
You want to convince the world

126
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,319
you're not responsible
for these murders

127
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:14,987
so you can keep control
of your big oil company.

128
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,572
That is not what I said.

129
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:19,158
Well, that's how Cameron
Dennis is gonna make it sound.

130
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:22,528
Ava, you're on trial
for your life.

131
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,163
This company is my life.

132
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:26,365
And that's exactly
what it's gonna look like--

133
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,335
a greedy oil exec
clinging to her money factory

134
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,003
with her blood-stained hands.

135
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:32,505
Very well.

136
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,924
You've made your point.

137
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:39,095
Now I suggest you find a way
to get me out of both situations

138
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,514
'cause I am not losing control
of my company

139
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,749
to Tony Gianopolous.

anyone, if you two are dating,

00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:41,316
a very strict policy
in favor of that.

157
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,818
And we have
a very strict policy

158
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:45,904
to keep our sugar
to ourselves.

159
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,324
Oh, that's a pity.

160
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:53,161
I'm partial to a little
sweetness in the morning.

161
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,580
Well, then I would recommend
the bakery on 52nd.

162
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:56,831
You care to join me?

163
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,833
I hate to deny you the pleasure
of my company.

164
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,336
I think I can manage
without it.

165
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:03,088
Since you're
from a different country,

166
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,091
I'll translate: "She finds you
a bit douchey, love."

167
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,259
My loss.

168
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,737
Ladies.

169
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:20,755
Oh, that man is trouble.

170
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:21,856
It's okay.
I can handle it.

171
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,108
Oh, no, it's okay.

172
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,726
I don't need you to.

173
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,145
Wait.
What are we talking about?

174
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:28,646
The fact
that he's into me.

175
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,365
Were you here?
He's into me.

176
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:32,450
Then why was I the one
getting all the stares?

177
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,570
Haven't you ever heard,
"go after the second prettiest

178
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,821
to get
the prettiest's attention"?

179
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,623
No, I've never heard that.

180
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,208
- Well, it's a thing.
- Oh.

181
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,961
Are you saying
I'm the second prettiest?

182
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,882
I'm saying you are to him.

183
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,618
Oh, the dress.

184
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,053
He asked you out?
Last week.

185
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,171
- And?
- I passed.

186
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,639
- Why?
- Why should I go out with him?

187
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:55,924
Just because he's charming
and hot?

188
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,842
- And witty and British.
- And has a title.

189
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:58,893
- He does?
- No.

190
00:07:58,961 --> 00:07:59,894
But even if he did,

191
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,095
that wouldn't be a reason.

192
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,627
I told you, Rach,
I don't mix business

193
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,566
with pleasure.
Business?

194
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,067
He's only here
for six weeks.

195
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:08,486
And he is based
out of London.

196
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,472
It's practically
a different company.

197
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,574
And it's definitely
a different country.

198
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,075
- So you'll consider it?
- Nope.

199
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,811
Well

200
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:20,498
What's going on
with Ava Hessington?

201
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,168
I convinced her
not to give an interview.

202
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,752
How'd she get it in her head
it'd be a good idea

203
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,087
in the first place?
Louis.

204
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:27,822
Is he aware
she's up for murder?

205
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,874
Is he aware that most people
don't line their offices

206
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,510
with pictures of themselves?
Evidently not.

207
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,095
You know he's still got one
of his dead cat?

208
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,364
Harvey, leave the cat alone.

209
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,666
Stupid cat.

210
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,302
How dare
you sabotage my case?

211
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,503
I didn't sabotage shit.

212
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,105
You set that thing up
behind my back

213
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,139
and you didn't tell me about it

214
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,558
until you thought
it was too late.

215
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,059
Yeah, because I knew
the minute things heated up

216
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:50,144
on the takeover attempt,
you'd want to take my case back.

217
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,863
Take your case back?

218
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,148
I don't know how familiar
you are with the game of law,

219
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,717
but murder trumps takeover.

220
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:58,403
- You condescending piece of--
- Louis.

221
00:08:58,487 --> 00:08:59,904
Harvey's right.

222
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,289
The woman
can't make public statements

223
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,691
while she's on trial for murder.
Trump.

224
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,192
Well, if she's gonna keep
her mouth shut,

225
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,028
then she's gonna have
to step down

226
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,213
or we're gonna lose this vote.
Asking her to step down

227
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,363
would be asking her
to cut off her arm.

228
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,548
If we don't cut off her arm,
Harvey,

229
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,966
we're gonna lose the patient.

230
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:13,801
She's my client.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

231
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,169
Ava Hessington
is not my client.

232
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,921
Hessington Oil is.

233
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,674
And they generate $14 million
a year in billables.

234
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,975
Have you not been listening?

235
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,061
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

236
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,095
Not for long.

237
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,347
- Excuse me?
- Louis is right.

238
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,549
If she steps down now,

239
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,818
we can still win the vote
and keep them as a client.

240
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,386
Well, who's gonna convince her
to do that?

241
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,438
We don't have
to convince her.

242
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:34,822
We can just go to the board.

243
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,940
We don't even have to tell her.
Like hell you will.

244
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:37,558
And like hell I won't.

245
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,327
Harvey, this needs to happen.

246
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:42,614
- No, I won't do it.
- This is my call.

247
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:46,334
I'm afraid it isn't.

248
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:48,569
Excuse me?

249
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,739
You and I both know
who assigned me to this case,

250
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,458
and it wasn't you.

251
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,010
It was the man you chose
to merge with.

252
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,464
The same man who has a 51% share
of our law firm.

253
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,683
So unless
you're gonna undo that,

254
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,587
you're gonna live with this.

255
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,722
Was she pissed?

256
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,307
I bet she was pissed.

257
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,441
Not as pissed
as you're gonna be.

258
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,943
What are you talking about?

259
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,362
You're on Katrina duty
for the next two days.

260
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:15,980
What?
I'd rather be on latrine duty.

261
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,283
- It's not an option.
- Okay, then I'm going AWOL.

262
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,102
Well, let me connect
the dots for you, Forrest Gump.

263
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,454
Even though Jessica gave in
on the strategy,

264
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,990
Louis made it clear he's willing
to sacrifice Ava.

265
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,775
And you don't trust him
to play by the rules.

266
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,611
Which is why you're gonna work
side by side with her

267
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,297
to figure a way out of this jam.

268
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,133
And at the same time make sure
she and Louis don't shaft us.

269
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,551
Not bad, Forrest.

270
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:38,636
Okay, if I'm Forrest,
then you're Bubba.

271
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,139
- Shrimpin' bidness.
- Harvey...

272
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,456
If Ava loses her company,

273
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,509
will Darby still back you
as managing partner?

274
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:47,812
I didn't ask,
but I sure as hell wouldn't.

275
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,636
What is it, Louis?

276
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,406
I just wanted to thank you
for backing me earlier.

277
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,474
I had your back because you
had the best strategy.

278
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,859
It still means a lot to me.

279
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,077
And, you know, I don't know
where Harvey gets off

280
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:04,278
telling you how to run things.

281
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,364
It's over, Louis.
I'm moving on.

282
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:09,817
It doesn't have to be.

283
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,337
What exactly
are you proposing?

284
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:21,045
Allow me to be
your black swan.

285
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,431
Let me do the things
that your position precludes you

286
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:27,501
from doing, the dark choices,
the distasteful wet work.

287
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,505
You mean like using lye
to dissolve a human body?

288
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:33,507
I mean using lies to dislodge
a pesky CEO.

289
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,776
Well, we've been told
that's not an option.

290
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,510
Not for you, maybe,
but as we just agreed,

291
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,346
it's the right option
for the board.

292
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:41,649
And Harvey and his master Lord
Poppycock don't have to know.

293
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,787
Louis, I appreciate
your offer, I do, but--

294
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:48,656
But the one time
you take my side over his,

295
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,068
you're not willing
to fight for it.

296
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,325
I'm willing to fight.

297
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,827
I just won't do it
behind Darby's back.

298
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,629
Look, I swear
it'll never come back to you.

299
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:58,216
I didn't say I was afraid
to get caught.

300
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,418
I said I don't want
to operate that way.

301
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:01,886
Now if you'll excuse me.

302
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,921
Need I remind you you had me
go behind Harvey's back

303
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,539
to do the same thing
with McKernon Motors?

304
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,041
That was not the same.

305
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:08,976
I get it.

306
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:11,012
You were in charge then.

307
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,065
You're not in charge anymore.

308
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,802
Hey

309
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:26,123
Ooh, all jammed up?

310
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,043
I'm afraid so.

311
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,511
You just need to coax it
a little.

312
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:31,146
Oh, and how does one
do that?

313
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:32,731
Oh, it's all in the touch.

314
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:35,266
Well, I've been nothing
but gentle.

315
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:36,351
There's a time to be gentle,

316
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,404
and there's a time
to be firm.

317
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:44,359
You should see
how I handle the fax.

318
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,494
I can imagine.

319
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:48,002
You know, in fact,
given your skills,

320
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,448
I think you'd probably be
the ideal person

321
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,500
to handle my short-term needs.

322
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:54,786
See, I'm in the states
on a limited basis,

323
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,956
and I've got nobody to help me
with my workload.

324
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,624
I get it.

325
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,743
You're forced
to do everything yourself.

326
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,762
It's getting exhausting.

327
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:08,800
And you need someone
to help relieve the pressure.

328
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:10,185
Naturally, I thought of you.

329
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,603
Not Rachel?

330
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:12,920
I think you know
the answer to that.

331
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:14,105
I knew it then.

332
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,191
I know you did.

333
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:19,093
It'll be a brief,
casual arrangement

334
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:20,311
whilst I'm in New York.

335
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,313
I wouldn't have time
for anything more.

336
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:24,199
Then we have
an agreement?

337
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:26,434
I don't know.

338
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:28,369
What kind of boss would you be?

339
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:30,238
Demanding.

340
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,490
But very generous.
Generous is good.

341
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:36,494
As is Daniel Day-Lewis
doing <i>MacBeth.</i>

342
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,997
You do realize
that this arrangement

343
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,832
would involve
no secretarial work?

344
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,169
I'd be disappointed
if it did.

345
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,644
- Katrina Bennett.
- At your service.

346
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:54,896
- God, I love the sound of that.
- Your wish is my command.

347
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,815
- My wish is for you--
- To work hand in glove

348
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,900
with Mike Ross on getting rid
of Tony Gianopolous,

349
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:00,652
keep an eye
on what they're doing

350
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:02,070
while at the same time
limit their understanding

351
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,471
of what we're doing.
How do you know all that?

352
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:04,722
- It's my job.
- Wait a minute.

353
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,857
I thought you can't stand
Mike Ross.

354
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:07,158
All of a sudden
you're willing to work with him?

355
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:09,494
- It's my job.
- If I ask you to murder someone

356
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:11,613
on a rainy winter's eve,
how would you respond?

357
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:14,666
You want a gun or a knife?

358
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,818
If you were less attractive,
I'd love you.

359
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,455
I know.

360
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,491
Louis, why aren't we
just kicking Ava Hessington out?

361
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,426
She'd be gone before
she even knew what hit her.

362
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:26,878
If Harvey had
half your brains,

363
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:28,283
that's exactly
what we'd be doing.

364
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,881
But he doesn't,
and as much as I hate

365
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:32,333
to admit it, he's in charge
of this decision.

366
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,219
He's not in charge
of this firm.

367
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,271
Go to Jessica,
she'll agree with you,

368
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:38,723
you'll get the credit,
and Harvey will be

369
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:40,391
off Hessington Oil before
he even knows what hit him.

370
00:14:40,476 --> 00:14:43,862
Katrina, as much
as I appreciate your suggestion,

371
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:46,114
I refuse to operate
in a duplicitous manner.

372
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,904
Then I'll find us a way to get
rid of Tony Gianopolous anyway.

373
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,876
Ahahah-ah.

374
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,527
I might have to let you look
at what I've got,

375
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:01,246
but I don't have
to let you touch it.

376
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,364
Touch it?

377
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:04,883
This room is a disaster.

378
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,835
This room is fine.

379
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,872
I know where everything is
and what everything is.

380
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,226
What are you even doing?

381
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:16,594
Finding dirt on Gianopolous.

382
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,062
You're dealing with one

383
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:19,597
of the most sophisticated
raiders in the world.

384
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:21,362
He's not leaving a trail
for you to follow.

385
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,384
Oh, yeah?
And what's your strategy?

386
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:26,053
You gonna record him and make
an embarrassing video?

387
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:28,990
No.
Gonna play a little game.

388
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:32,110
Monopoly?

389
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:33,244
You don't think
I started with that?

390
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:34,779
There's no way to have
a monopoly

391
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:36,865
in the oil business.
It's too goddamn big.

392
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,499
And even if you could,
these are all the companies

393
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,418
that Gianopolous owns
in any way,

394
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:42,904
and these are the biggest
companies in the oil industry.

395
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:46,090
There's no way
to connect the dots.

396
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,260
Well, do you want to go
down the same road and have

397
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,078
another fight or do you want
to try to figure out a way--

398
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,414
- Shit.
- What?

399
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:59,020
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

400
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:07,979
Shit.

401
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:11,866
Shit.

402
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,440
Shitty shit.

403
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:21,826
<i>Shit.</i>

404
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:25,163
You're into <i>The Wire?</i>

405
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,786
shit.

406
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:43,815
Jessica.

407
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,935
What a lovely coincidence
running into you in Toronto.

408
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,636
This is not a coincidence.

409
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:50,384
Well, I hope it's still going
to be lovely.

410
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:53,574
I need you to make it
perfectly clear to Harvey

411
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:54,976
that he has no say

412
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,828
in the Hessington Oil
takeover battle.

413
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,479
And why would I do that?

414
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,031
Because he's making
a huge mistake and using

415
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:01,666
your name to do it.
And let me guess,

416
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,918
you'd like her to remove herself
from management.

417
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:05,820
She can do it herself,

418
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,505
or I can do it for her.

419
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,591
But either way
she's got to go

420
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:11,826
until this trial is over.

421
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,428
I'm afraid
I don't see it that way.

422
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:14,545
Well, you're wrong.

423
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,682
And you're overstepping.

424
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,134
Listen to me.

425
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:23,104
She stands to lose control
of this company permanently

426
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:24,188
if we don't do something.

427
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:25,857
Then do something.

428
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:29,193
I'm trying,
but you're cutting off my legs

429
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:31,062
because of a bond you had
with her father.

430
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:34,015
No, because I value
relationships over money.

431
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,701
Well, I value the terms
of our merger.

432
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:39,120
And Hessington Oil was one
of your biggest selling points.

433
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,289
And Harvey Specter
one of yours.

434
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:43,236
I'm not going to stand
for losing this takeover.

435
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:47,211
Then don't.
But Ava isn't going anywhere.

436
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,364
One more thing.

437
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,366
Instead of spending firm money
to fly

438
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:53,368
to another country
to question my judgment,

439
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:54,836
feel free to call first.

440
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,638
I'll be happy to give you
the same answer over the phone.

441
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,312
This is brilliant.

442
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:05,730
We've got the connection.

443
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:07,565
We just need to figure out
how to stop it.

444
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:10,234
I already have.

445
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,553
This is great work, Katrina.
You struck oil.

446
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:15,573
It was actually Mike's idea.

447
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:16,824
Why do you want
to give him credit?

448
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,776
Because if I don't,
you won't listen

449
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:20,278
when I say
you should take him with you.

450
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:21,662
I'm not taking anyone
with me.

451
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,282
It's an opportunity
for him to see you

452
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:26,534
beat the shit
out of a living legend.

453
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,872
Tony Gianopolous
gets blown out of the water,

454
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:31,956
and Mike gets blown away.

455
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,758
And Jessica hears
about it all.

456
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,760
I'm gonna suggest this
to Harvey.

457
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:37,795
Feel free to tell him
it was all your idea.

458
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,432
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, perfect timing.

459
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:42,600
Harvey, I was just gonna run
something by you.

460
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:43,851
I don't have time, Louis.

461
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,470
I'm working on a murder case.

462
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:47,255
I just dropped by to inform you

463
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:50,141
Mike's coming with you
to see Gianopolous.

464
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,759
Like hell he is.

465
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,978
- Excuse me?
- I'm not taking anyone.

466
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:55,613
- Louis--
- And don't Louis me.

467
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:57,598
This is my case, and you've
been sticking your nose in it

468
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,951
ever since I got it.
Sticking my nose in?

469
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:01,202
You only have this case

470
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:02,770
'cause I was kind enough
to give it to you.

471
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:05,123
You only gave it to me
because you hadn't realized

472
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,274
that you were responsible for
turning Ava's bribery charges

473
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:08,626
into murder charges.

474
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,945
- You're off this case.
- Go ahead.

475
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,547
Call Ava.

476
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:13,998
Tell her that you're diverting
your attention

477
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,134
from her murder trial
to work on this.

478
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:18,953
Yup.
Didn't think so.

479
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,621
Get out of my office
because I got a meeting

480
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:22,757
to prepare for.

481
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:28,679
What just happened to him?

482
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:30,648
- He got "Litt" up.
- Damn straight.

483
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:34,313
Have you seen this?

484
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:35,347
It's an article,

485
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:36,648
in today's <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

486
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,233
painting me as the picture
of corporate greed.

487
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:40,068
As I told you before,
if you speak out--

488
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:42,404
I have the chance
to save my company.

489
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,495
Louis Litt is doing that
right now.

490
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:46,264
- That is not the point.
- That is the point.

491
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:47,872
We can still save your company,

492
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:49,925
and you won't have to hurt
yourself at your murder trial.

493
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:52,877
No, the point is I want
to speak at my murder trial.

494
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:53,929
That's not wise.

495
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:55,147
And how many murder trials

496
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:56,715
have you conducted
in your many years?

497
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,900
- Ava.
- Silence is damning.

498
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:01,236
Look at this article.
I'm already guilty.

499
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,404
If you take the stand,

500
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:04,823
Cameron Dennis is gonna rip you
to shreds.

501
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,442
This is not up for discussion.
I will have my say.

502
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:09,411
Then I'm gonna show you
what you're in for.

503
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:11,663
Well, you wouldn't be doing
your job if you didn't.

504
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:19,504
Have a seat,
Mr. Litt.

505
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:21,239
I'll be with you
in a minute.

506
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,758
You'll be with me?

507
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:25,343
Yes. As I said.
In a minute.

508
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,578
Uhhuh.

509
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:27,963
Well, you know,
I'd ask you who you are,

510
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:31,249
but the truth is I, uh...

511
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,251
I don't really give a shit.

512
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:34,970
Where the hell's
Tony Gianopolous?

513
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:36,805
Mr. Gianopolous is upstairs.

514
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,274
To get upstairs, you have to get
through those doors.

515
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,727
And to get through those doors
you have to get through me.

516
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:44,479
And you're not getting
through me.

517
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:51,119
Well, perhaps I have the key.

518
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:56,441
This is a balance sheet
from one of our subsidiaries.

519
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:57,876
This is nothing.

520
00:20:57,943 --> 00:20:58,994
Sorry.
Forgot.

521
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:01,613
It's a combination lock.

522
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:04,783
This represents the totality
of Gianopolous Limited holdings.

523
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:07,469
You control 40%
of the U.S. radio stations,

524
00:21:07,553 --> 00:21:09,137
corn production,
interstate trucking,

525
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:10,388
and that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

526
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,090
Looks like I picked
the right employer.

527
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:14,760
One problem: Hessington Oil
owns enough of those industries

528
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:17,896
to get you in trouble
with the FTC.

529
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,298
Yeah.
Think we wouldn't find that?

530
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,134
You think we wouldn't?

531
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,435
These folders are out of date.

532
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:24,486
We've already divested.

533
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,973
Into this, this, and this.

534
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:32,310
So what? Hessington doesn't
have holdings in those areas.

535
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:34,312
They do now.

536
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:35,664
And if you don't leave 'em
alone,

537
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,482
you're gonna be tied up
with my friend from the FTC

538
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:40,335
until kingdom goddamn come.

539
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,522
Got that, spank?

540
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,290
Then it's a good thing
Mr. Gianopolous

541
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:48,009
arranged an exception for us
over dinner with his friend,

542
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:53,048
the commissioner of the FTC.

543
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,766
- That's not--
- Legal?

544
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,718
Yes, it is.
As long as we disclose it.

545
00:21:56,803 --> 00:21:58,353
Which we always do.

546
00:21:58,437 --> 00:21:59,855
You think
you're the first lawyer

547
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,172
to try to outsmart us?

548
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:02,307
We're not lawyers.

549
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:03,358
We're investment bankers.

550
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,342
We call you for the paperwork.

551
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,777
We didn't go to Harvard.

552
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:07,946
We went to Wharton,
and we saw you coming

553
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:10,282
a mile away.

554
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:13,068
Spank.

555
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:15,620
Oh, by the way, Mr. Gianopolous
is in Monaco.

556
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:19,207
Christina will validate you
on the way out.

557
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:25,914
Finally cleaning up?

558
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:28,216
Can't stay here forever.

559
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:30,969
How'd your meeting
with Ava go?

560
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:32,921
She wants to testify
at her own trial.

561
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:35,039
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah, I know.

562
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:36,141
We're working on it.

563
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,876
Thought you'd be with Louis.

564
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:40,712
He went to go see Gianopolous
by himself.

565
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,064
I hope it works.

566
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:45,734
We have a good plan.

567
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:49,070
For what it's worth,

568
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:52,157
I suggested Louis
take you with him.

569
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,160
Shit.

570
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:57,946
As Sil would say,

571
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,064
"just when I thought I was out,

572
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:01,700
they pull me back in."

573
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,919
Okay, so you watch
<i>The Sopranos</i> too?

574
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:05,170
Nobody watches <i>The Wire</i>

575
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:08,290
without starting
with <i>The Sopranos.</i>

576
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,531
You, uh, you really
suggest that to Louis?

577
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:17,667
It was your idea.
You deserve the credit.

578
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:24,708
Truce?

579
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,428
Truce.

580
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,431
Shit.

581
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:36,686
You trying to score some extra
edamame from the delivery guy?

582
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:40,023
Please, Yuki always brings me
extra edamame.

583
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,092
Well, then who's
the touch-up for?

584
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:48,114
And did you do a costume change
without leaving the office?

585
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,784
I have a number
that calls a guy...

586
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:52,348
Who knows my size.
I need that number.

587
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:54,821
- I can't give you that number.
- Mm.

588
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:58,325
Oh, my God.
You have a date with Stephen.

589
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:00,109
It's not really a date.

590
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:02,295
It's more...

591
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,998
of an arrangement.
An arrangement?

592
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,467
He has some short-term needs,
asked if I could help him out

593
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,118
while he's in town,
blah blah blah,

594
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,670
I'm meeting him at 8:00.

595
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:12,839
Blah blah blah?

596
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:14,057
What's blah blah blah?

597
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:16,393
Oh, you know,
it's just...

598
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,294
This, that, and the other thing.
Uhhuh.

599
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:21,014
And does he know
that blah blah blah constitutes

600
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,066
this, that, and the other thing?
Rachel.

601
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,986
Stephen and I communicate
a little more subtly--

602
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,772
suggestive banter,
double entendres.

603
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:30,407
We both know
what we agreed to.

604
00:24:30,474 --> 00:24:31,441
It sounds to me
like you agreed

605
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:32,826
to a hot and steamy affair.

606
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,144
I'm not gonna even
dignify that with a response.

607
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:37,914
Oh, my God, did you agree
to a hot and steamy affair?

608
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,916
I have no idea.

609
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:47,173
- Louis, what can I do for you?
- I want off this case.

610
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,324
I take it you struck out
with Gianopolous?

611
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:49,659
I didn't strike out.

612
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,094
What I did was almost pull
a rabbit out of a hat.

613
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:53,346
But the truth is
the one good move we had

614
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:54,764
has been taken away from us,

615
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:56,099
and I'm not gonna be left
holding the bag

616
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,884
because Harvey chose
to handcuff me.

617
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:02,355
Louis, I'm not taking you
off this case.

618
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,557
But I am taking
the handcuffs off.

619
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:10,113
Wait, are you saying
that I have your blessing

620
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,566
to go to the board and convince
them to ditch Ava Hessington?

621
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:16,312
I'm not saying anything.

622
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:17,813
Got it.

623
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,932
Wet work.

624
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:24,053
This conversation
never happened.

625
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:26,055
What is it?

626
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:27,607
Have you ever said to Harvey,

627
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:29,052
"this conversation
never happened"?

628
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:30,993
- Louis.
- Please tell me you never have.

629
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:33,362
Would I tell you if I had?

630
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:34,413
I'll take that as a no.

631
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:36,165
Good night, Louis.

632
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,067
Black Swan.

633
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:48,744
Wednesday, 6:52 p.m.,

634
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:51,347
it happened.

635
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:07,596
Wow.

636
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:09,365
You aren't having
a heart attack, are you?

637
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,767
Would that put a crimp
in your evening?

638
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:12,985
Well, I guess I could scalp
your ticket,

639
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,288
seeing as it is the hottest
of the season.

640
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:18,491
You know, I practically had
to sell my spleen for them.

641
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:20,243
That's funny. I heard
you got them from a client.

642
00:26:20,294 --> 00:26:22,461
Did you also hear
that I traded him my spleen?

643
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,330
I don't care if it cost you
a lung.

644
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:27,750
Daniel Day-Lewis in a kilt?
Worth it.

645
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:30,452
- I'm really glad to hear that.
- Of course you are.

646
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:32,838
You found out
how much I love the theater.

647
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:35,057
You don't think the reason
that I arranged all of this

648
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,459
is because I looked
into you?

649
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:39,295
Didn't you?

650
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:40,796
Sure I did.

651
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:42,565
You know,
I'm actually to theater

652
00:26:42,632 --> 00:26:43,816
what Harvey is to sport.

653
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,434
Nah, you don't give a shit
about theater.

654
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,636
You love sports.

655
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:49,405
- Rugby mostly.
- Nice try.

656
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,107
We do what we can.

657
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:52,325
But we are going for dinner

658
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:53,693
with Daniel Day-Lewis
after the show.

659
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,244
You're kidding.

660
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:56,746
I may be indifferent
to the theater,

661
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,748
but I know
how to get things done.

662
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:00,199
You are good.

663
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:02,985
I told you that
on the first day we met.

664
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:05,988
I'm better than good.

665
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:08,324
What time is dinner?

666
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,542
10:30.

667
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:11,260
Then we better get going.

668
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,713
Oh, the show doesn't start
for another 20 minutes.

669
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:17,666
We aren't going to the show.

670
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:22,688
Taxi!

671
00:27:25,182 --> 00:27:27,182
Is that really necessary?

672
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:28,517
It will be in the deposition.?

673
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:29,906
I don't care
about the deposition.

674
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,353
- Harvey--
- You want to know

675
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:33,439
how you come across, you have
to see how you come across.

676
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:34,807
Now answer my question.

677
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:38,093
Did you bribe
a foreign government?

678
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:39,738
Why are you hesitating,
Miss Hessington?

679
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,040
Something to hide?
Look, I think what Harvey's

680
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:42,542
trying to say--
You hesitate,

681
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:44,293
they won't trust you.

682
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:45,578
Your bribery
isn't in question.

683
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:46,846
Cameron is gonna enter that plea
into evidence.

684
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:48,464
You have to own it
and move on.

685
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:50,110
And I suggest you do it
more believably,

686
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,435
because when you're up there
staring down the barrel

687
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,437
of 12 executioners,

688
00:27:54,521 --> 00:27:56,472
there's no changing your mind.

689
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:58,190
Do you think I don't know
you're trying to rattle me?

690
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:00,259
Rattle you?
I'm just giving you the facts.

691
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,812
Cameron's gonna rattle you.

692
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:04,196
And it's gonna work,

693
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:06,115
because you and I both know
you did this.

694
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,451
- How dare you!
- How dare I what?

695
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:09,569
This is your idea.

696
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:11,203
Then ask me
a goddamn question.

697
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:12,488
You bribed that government.

698
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,407
What's to stop anyone
with a pulse

699
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:17,209
from believing you knew
that money was payment

700
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:18,511
for killing those people?

701
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:20,713
Because life is more important
to me than money.

702
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,282
Then why the hell did you pay
that bribe in the first place?

703
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,853
Because that's how it works
over there.

704
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:26,752
Murder is also how it works
over there.

705
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,554
You did it.
You know it.

706
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:31,290
And you're not convincing
anyone.

707
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:34,060
Very good.

708
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:37,796
Finally we get to it.

709
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:39,482
If you check your records,

710
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:42,485
you'd know the reason we won
that bid is we were

711
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,637
the only company who took it
upon ourselves

712
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:45,971
to go to the people.

713
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:48,441
Because you needed to see
what your obstacle was.

714
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:51,160
My obstacle?

715
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:54,447
We paid $100 million more
than anyone else

716
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:58,751
on the condition that the money
be used to relocate any family

717
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:02,755
who lost anything within
50 miles of that pipeline--

718
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:07,677
job, home, land, livestock.

719
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,662
Anything.

720
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:12,598
What happened over there
sickens me.

721
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:15,935
I lose sleep over it
every night.

722
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:19,388
And as soon as I am
out of this nightmare,

723
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:22,191
I am going to shut down
the entire project--

724
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:27,196
the pipeline, the oil fields,
all of it.

725
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,015
So I've had just about enough
of you two wondering

726
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,851
whether I'm guilty
of these murders or not.

727
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:36,656
Is that a good enough trial run
for you?

728
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:47,717
Holy shit.

729
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:50,219
She didn't do it.

730
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,639
I understand
you have a strategy

731
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:55,541
to defeat the takeover attempt.

732
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,560
I do.
But it involves a conversation

733
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:59,512
about how essential
you find Ava Hessington.

734
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,880
If the only way
to beat Tony Gianopolous

735
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:03,149
is to get rid of her,

736
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:04,616
then I don't think
we have a choice.

737
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,819
If you need cover
for the other board members,

738
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:09,238
then you can just tell them that
Pearson Darby recommended that.

739
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:11,223
And I'll recommend to them

740
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:13,242
that we retain
Pearson Darby.

741
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:15,244
So we have a deal.

742
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:28,457
What's the matter with you?

743
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:34,714
We just deposed
Ava Hessington.

744
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:36,098
You deposed
your own client?

745
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,350
Practice.

746
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:40,019
You couldn't convince her
not to testify?

747
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:44,440
No, not that.

748
00:30:44,524 --> 00:30:46,609
She convinced us
that maybe she should.

749
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:51,096
Well, there would be only one
reason to even consider that.

750
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:53,816
She didn't do it.

751
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,785
- No way.
- I know.

752
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:57,703
You said, if she's cold enough
to do it,

753
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,938
she'd be cold enough
to lie about it,

754
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,826
but this woman is about to lose
her title, her company,

755
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,047
her whole life...

756
00:31:08,114 --> 00:31:10,466
And I know
that she is telling the truth.

757
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:17,423
You don't have to believe me.

758
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:21,010
Take a look for yourself.

759
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:27,399
- Hey.
- What happened?

760
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:29,985
- He agreed.
- She's out.

761
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,638
It'll be done tomorrow
before the tender offer vote.

762
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:34,890
- Then we still have time.
- What are you talking about?

763
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:37,777
She's innocent.

764
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,079
What?

765
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:43,365
Take a look at this.

766
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,241
I figured out
what we're gonna do.

767
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:50,206
And what is that?

768
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,490
What we should have done
in the first place.

769
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,592
We're gonna let her talk
to the board.

770
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,544
And preempt tomorrow's meeting
with one of our own.

771
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:57,179
If she can convince us
she's innocent,

772
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:58,764
she can convince them
to keep her in charge

773
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:01,684
and vote against the takeover.
Winwin.

774
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,502
- Have Louis set it up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Louis?

775
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:05,221
Yeah.
He'll love it.

776
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:06,839
Letting her talk
is what he wanted her

777
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,940
to do in the first place.

778
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:10,008
Get it done.

779
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,854
Louis, what are you
still doing here?

780
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:23,188
You put in a long day.

781
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,825
You did a great job.
Now go home.

782
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,025
I can't.

783
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:29,027
Why not?

784
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,746
She didn't do it.

785
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:34,884
Who didn't do what?

786
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:38,637
Ava Hessington had nothing
to do with those murders.

787
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:44,143
How do you like that?

788
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,291
I'll see you
in the morning.

789
00:32:45,345 --> 00:32:47,980
Jessica.

790
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:51,734
I'm serious.
She's innocent.

791
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:53,602
And what does that have to do
with me going home tonight?

792
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:56,238
It has everything
to do with it.

793
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:57,907
Harvey agreed to let her
talk to the board.

794
00:32:57,991 --> 00:32:59,224
That's all I ever wanted.

795
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:01,393
Louis, if they don't oust her
tomorrow morning,

796
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:04,830
they will lose that takeover
vote tomorrow afternoon.

797
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:06,582
She will be pushed out
either way.

798
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,867
Well, at least
I won't be responsible

799
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:09,869
for taking away
an innocent woman's company.

800
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,503
You're not responsible for it.

801
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:14,039
This is a hostile takeover.

802
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,675
They're coming tomorrow,
and the market doesn't care

803
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:18,010
whether she's innocent or not.

804
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:19,128
Harvey's gonna think
it was me.

805
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:20,579
It was you.

806
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,598
And he would have thought that
before.

807
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:25,751
Please do not stop me

808
00:33:25,802 --> 00:33:27,519
from going back to that board.

809
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:29,855
Louis, you offered
to do this.

810
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:31,440
You're not doing this to Harvey.

811
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:33,359
You're doing this
for your client,

812
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:34,693
Hessington Oil.

813
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:36,762
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

814
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:38,430
- Not anymore.
- Jessica.

815
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,532
Enough.

816
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,267
This conversation did happen,

817
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,770
and it's over.

818
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,443
How long have
you been standing there?

819
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,776
Long enough to know
that if this law thing

820
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:05,363
doesn't work out, you'd make
a lousy boy Friday.

821
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:07,832
I'd ask you to help, but I
wouldn't want to take advantage.

822
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:11,502
And I'd say yes, but I don't
want to be taken advantage of.

823
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:13,254
Though I am happy to watch.

824
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:15,656
I'm nothing but a piece
of meat to you, aren't I?

825
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:18,542
Quiet, copy boy.

826
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:21,712
Same time tomorrow night?

827
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:24,382
Absolutely.

828
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:31,889
Interesting.

829
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:35,676
If you find copy rooms
interesting,

830
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:37,278
you need to get out more.

831
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,230
Oh, I'm not talking
about the copy room.

832
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:40,681
I'm talking about you
and Stephen

833
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:41,892
and the spring in your steps.

834
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,350
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say

835
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:44,535
you were sleeping with him.

836
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,371
Oh, my God,
you slept with him, didn't you?

837
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:49,189
No.

838
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,374
How was it?

839
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:54,245
Suffice it to say,
I was awesome.

840
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:55,629
Oh, wait, sorry,
you probably wanted to know

841
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:56,664
about him, didn't you?
That was the point

842
00:34:56,715 --> 00:34:58,049
of the question, yes.
Eh.

843
00:34:58,133 --> 00:34:59,550
- Really?
- God, no.

844
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:01,385
I may have met my match.
Oh, my God.

845
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,636
And the arrangement?
Ongoing.

846
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,538
- Well, did you tell Harvey?
- Oh, my God.

847
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:07,541
- What?
- I never thought about Harvey.

848
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:08,843
I'm Donna. How could I
have not thought of that?

849
00:35:08,894 --> 00:35:10,428
Because you weren't thinking
with your brain.

850
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:12,096
- Good one.
- You were thinking with your--

851
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,883
- Yeah, I got it.
- So what are you gonna do?

852
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,719
I'm gonna tell him
as soon as he gets back.

853
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:27,578
- Have everything we need?
- Everything.

854
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:28,913
Where's Louis?

855
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:30,197
He's gonna meet us over there.

856
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:31,916
We should all be going
together.

857
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,335
Well, at least Ava's here
on time.

858
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:37,955
- What the hell did you do?
- What are you talking about?

859
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,240
I just got voted out
of my own company.

860
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,492
Wait, the vote on the takeover

861
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:42,843
isn't supposed to be
till this afternoon.

862
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:44,845
Well, they had a different one
before that,

863
00:35:44,913 --> 00:35:46,079
and I'm out.

864
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:48,015
And what I want to know is,
did you know?

865
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:50,017
Ava, I didn't go
behind your back.

866
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:51,936
Well, you may not have gone
behind my back,

867
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,270
but this never would have
happened if you'd let me

868
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:55,272
speak publicly
in the first place.

869
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:58,726
Look, Ava, my believing
in your innocence

870
00:35:58,777 --> 00:36:00,895
wouldn't change my mind
about you talking to a reporter.

871
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:02,446
Then why were you going
to let me speak today?

872
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,264
Because an interview
isn't the same thing

873
00:36:04,316 --> 00:36:06,534
as a closed-door meeting
within your own company.

874
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:07,868
Well, they had
a closed-door meeting,

875
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:10,287
and the only person
who benefited from that was you.

876
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:11,405
How's that?

877
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:13,941
I may be out,
but you're not.

878
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:17,444
Pearson Darby has been
conveniently retained

879
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:21,632
as Hessington Oil's
legal counsel.

880
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,751
You think I don't know
this was you?

881
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:25,786
I don't care whether you know
it was me or not.

882
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:28,055
I stand by what I did,
and I'd do it again.

883
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,173
You mean selling Ava out

884
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:30,508
because of your personal issues
with me?

885
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,177
This isn't personal,
and it's not about you.

886
00:36:33,261 --> 00:36:35,462
Bullshit.
Ever since Darby handed me

887
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,481
this case and not you,
you've been pissed.

888
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:40,467
I wasn't pissed until we had
a disagreement on strategy,

889
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,736
and you invoked his name
to cut me out.

890
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:44,355
I get it.

891
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,190
I wasn't wrong
about it being personal.

892
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:47,691
I was wrong
about which person.

893
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:49,026
You're not pissed at me.

894
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,245
You're pissed at yourself
for getting played.

895
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:53,113
What did you just say to me?

896
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:54,198
You heard me.

897
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:55,699
Fools rush in,

898
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:57,368
and you're the one
who gave him the 51%

899
00:36:57,452 --> 00:37:00,955
in the first place.

900
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:04,208
I merged with Edward
for the sake of this firm,

901
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:06,594
just like what I did today
with Ava.

902
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:10,181
And the only one in this room
taking things personally is you.

903
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:11,832
Tell yourself
whatever you want,

904
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:13,500
but don't tell me it doesn't
have to do with Darby

905
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:15,719
and don't tell me
it isn't personal,

906
00:37:15,804 --> 00:37:18,722
because you can't stand
being number two.

907
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:24,695
- Harvey, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

908
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:27,348
I need Edward Darby
on the phone right now.

909
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:28,976
By the way,
where were you this morning?

910
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:29,950
What are you talking about?
I was here.

911
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:31,184
You weren't here.

912
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:32,853
I was in the copy room.

913
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:35,022
Well, what the hell were you
doing in the copy room?

914
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:38,075
I was finishing up
a couple things for Stephen.

915
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,743
You're working for Stephen?

916
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:42,796
- I made some copies.
- You work for me.

917
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:45,532
Sorry.

918
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,668
It was a one-time thing.
Well, since you haven't gotten

919
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:49,637
Darby for me yet,
what do you want?

920
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:52,806
Nothing.
It can wait.

921
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,659
What do you want?

922
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:14,695
I want to tell you
that I enjoyed working with you.

923
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:18,449
I thought I was gonna be able
to say the same.

924
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:20,751
If it means anything to you,
I told Louis

925
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:22,286
to stop the plan
to get rid of Ava.

926
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,622
Did you know
he wasn't going to?

927
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:26,373
No.

928
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:29,076
But the truth is,
even if I did,

929
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:31,262
I wouldn't have done anything
to stop it.

930
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:33,881
Is that supposed
to make me believe you?

931
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:37,184
It's supposed to make you
understand me.

932
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:42,139
You're loyal to him.

933
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:45,526
I'm committed to him.

934
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:48,062
Good night, Katrina.

935
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:51,782
Good night.

936
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,410
What did she want?

937
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:05,796
Nothing.

938
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,998
Tell me
she enjoyed working with me.

939
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:11,802
- Did you?
- Did I what?

940
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:13,470
Did you enjoy
working with her?

941
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:17,675
I mean, I just kept seeing
you guys working together

942
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:20,561
all the time, and you just
seemed to be bonding away.

943
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:22,730
- Are you jealous?
- It's not funny.

944
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:25,349
I'm not smiling
because it's funny.

945
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:27,234
I'm smiling
because it's sweet.

946
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:28,802
You didn't think it was sweet
when I was jealous

947
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:29,903
of you and Jenny.

948
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,572
You and I
weren't together then,

949
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,742
but we are now.
Right.

950
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,494
Which is why
it bothers me more now.

951
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:40,447
Rachel...

952
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:42,816
I trusted you
with my secret,

953
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:45,035
my life.

954
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,620
If I trusted you with that,
don't you know that

955
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:50,657
that means I...

956
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,694
That I...

957
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:57,664
What are you--
what are you trying to say?

958
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,266
You know
what I'm trying to say.

959
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,386
Don't say it now.
I don't want to hear it here.

960
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,688
Here? Where we've done
pretty much everything else?

961
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:08,359
- Mike, I--
- I love you.

962
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:10,527
I love you.

963
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:12,696
I don't want
to keep it in anymore.

964
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:18,819
I love you too.

965
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,872
And in this moment
I don't care who knows.

966
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:48,148
What you did amounts

967
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:50,100
to nothing short
of insubordination.

968
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:51,185
Did you fly all the way

969
00:40:51,236 --> 00:40:52,385
from another country
to tell me that?

970
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:53,554
You could have just called.

971
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,222
I gave you
a very clear directive,

972
00:40:55,273 --> 00:40:56,240
and you defied me.

973
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:57,241
Do you want to get into it?

974
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:58,292
I most certainly do.

975
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,693
When I agreed to merge
with you,

976
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:01,245
I knew it was 51-49,

977
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,230
but I didn't think
you would lord your 2%

978
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:05,199
over me like a hammer.

979
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,668
And when I agreed
to acquire you,

980
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:08,786
I didn't think
I'd have to.

981
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,170
Are you saying
you regret this merger?

982
00:41:10,238 --> 00:41:11,789
I'm saying perhaps I
should have paid more attention

983
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:13,090
to the red flags,

984
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,458
such as covering up
the embezzlement

985
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:15,959
of a former partner.

986
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,961
Something you were more than
willing to use to make the deal.

987
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:20,013
You went behind my back.

988
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,598
And you stuck me
with this case

989
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:24,601
and then risked losing me
a huge amount of money.

990
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,387
I gave Harvey this case
after already handing you

991
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,639
a huge amount of money.

992
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:32,142
I am in charge
on this side of the ocean.

993
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:33,811
Because I allow it
to be that way.

994
00:41:33,895 --> 00:41:35,112
And there it is again.

995
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:37,865
51-49.

996
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:41,101
Until now I believed
that Harvey was the wild horse

997
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:43,287
that couldn't be tamed,
but perhaps it is you.

998
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,272
I think maybe Harvey was right.

999
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:46,824
It is personal.

1000
00:41:46,908 --> 00:41:48,108
But I didn't make it that way.

1001
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:50,294
You did when you allowed
your feelings

1002
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:52,629
for Ava
to cloud your judgment.

1003
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:55,415
And as you pointed out,
I had a partner once

1004
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:58,118
who made decisions
based on his personal shit,

1005
00:41:58,169 --> 00:42:00,471
and I will not allow that
to happen again.

1006
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:02,589
And 51-49 or not,

1007
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,843
I just took 14 million and put
it on my side of the ledger,

1008
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:07,728
so do me a favor, Edward,
and turn off the lights

1009
00:42:07,795 --> 00:42:09,847
on your way out.
