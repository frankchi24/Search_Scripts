1
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:06,084
You lose,
we don't merge.

2
00:00:06,168 --> 00:00:08,136
You win,
you get what you want.

3
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,088
You lose,
you stay.

4
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,306
You extend
your noncompete,

5
00:00:12,374 --> 00:00:16,010
and you get a chance to earn
your name on the door,

6
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,045
because it's not
going up there now.

7
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:19,380
There's no room
for both of us.

8
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,717
Unless we made room
for each other.

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:24,435
I put him on the list,
and I handed it in.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,438
He didn't put you
on his list.

11
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:28,906
- I won't.
- You will.

12
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:30,191
Harvey will never
forgive me.

13
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,882
This is a letter
to the district attorney,

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,363
saying that you
are breaking the law.

15
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:38,916
You file your motion,

16
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,368
I'll file mine.

17
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,502
You weren't there.

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,891
- I didn't have to be.
- Jessica--

19
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:44,455
You don't work for Jessica.
You work for me.

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,241
You're fired.
No, he's not.

21
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,926
You could've just told me
that you didn't love me

22
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,578
instead of selling me out.

23
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:52,513
I didn't sell you out,
Scottie.

24
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:54,298
I just got fired.

25
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:55,800
Whatever she did,

26
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:57,524
you wouldn't have this merger
without her.

27
00:00:57,586 --> 00:01:00,521
Would you have her work here
or in London?

28
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,590
You're going
to stay here,

29
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,776
be humble,

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,694
and learn
your goddamn place.

31
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:09,230
I never went
to Harvard.

32
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:10,231
What?

33
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:13,067
I'm a fraud.

34
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,138
Hey.

35
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,590
I got your message.
What's going on?

36
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:55,777
Partners meeting.
Essential personnel only.

37
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:56,868
In the middle
of the night?

38
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:58,446
You afraid
of the dark?

39
00:01:58,497 --> 00:01:59,831
I wouldn't be if I had
my Cookie Monster with me.

40
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,082
Well, then go get him,

41
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:03,918
because we're finalizing
the terms of the merger.

42
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:04,919
We?

43
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,370
We.

44
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:08,289
So I'm a partner now?

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,707
Easy, Marcia Clark.

46
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,876
Jessica and I
discussed it.

47
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,095
You're responsible
for making this merger happen.

48
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:15,596
You deserve
to be here.

49
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:17,765
So Jessica and you
talked?

50
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,766
You forgave her?

51
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,835
She won.
I lost.

52
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:21,853
Nothing to forgive.

53
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:24,021
And me?

54
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:27,225
You did
what you had to do.

55
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:33,197
You have no idea
how much I needed to hear that.

56
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:37,068
The merger is complete.

57
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:38,352
And we would like
to show everyone

58
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,955
that the new Darby Pearson
will be stronger,

59
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,356
better connected--

60
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:44,792
And most importantly,
based on a foundation that is--

61
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,910
Full of shit.

62
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:46,994
What the hell's
going on?

63
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,413
- I told her.
- Told her what?

64
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:51,132
That Mike Ross
is a fraud,

65
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,967
and I am not going
to let him get away with it.

66
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,085
How could you do this?

67
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,537
You did this
to yourself.

68
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,899
How long are you going
to keep staring at that offer?

69
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,433
Until one of us blinks.

70
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:11,185
Deron signed it.
You said it was great.

71
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:12,520
I'm not interested
in great.

72
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:15,890
I want it to know
who its daddy is.

73
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,661
What is it, Donna?

74
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:24,498
It's Sunday night.
Darby needs an answer.

75
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:27,001
London.
Send her to London.

76
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:35,910
Do you want
to talk about it?

77
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:40,014
Have Ray
meet me downstairs.

78
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,016
And where should I say
you're going?

79
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,101
Brooklyn.

80
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,707
I did not expect
the great Harvey Specter

81
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:07,708
to come all the way
to Brooklyn

82
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,243
just to deliver
a contract.

83
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:11,329
That's good,
'cause I came for the hot dogs.

84
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,464
I told you,
that was our final offer.

85
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,082
You did,
but the third quarter's

86
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,751
about to end,
and if you want Deron Williams

87
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,620
playing for you
in the fourth,

88
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:22,223
this is his number.

89
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,059
Even if you had
another offer,

90
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:26,460
which you don't,

91
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:29,146
he can't leave
in the middle of a game.

92
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,731
I was talking
about the fourth quarter

93
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,016
of game seven,

94
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,901
when you're looking
to lock up a championship,

95
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:36,904
because the question isn't
"do you want Deron or not?"

96
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,640
It's "do you want
a ring or not?"

97
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:41,075
You got nothing.

98
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:43,277
And I told you,
that's my final offer.

99
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:44,278
Then I guess I'll just have
to go bring Deron

100
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,446
his new Mavs jersey then.

101
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:47,365
There's no way
Mark Cuban pays that much.

102
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,649
Why don't you call him
and ask?

103
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,285
Oh, wait, you can't,
because he hates you.

104
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:52,286
Bullshit.

105
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,371
We may not
be blood brothers,

106
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:54,372
but he doesn't
hate me.

107
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:55,873
Oh, he does now.

108
00:04:55,958 --> 00:05:00,261
Evidently, he found out
about that thing from last May.

109
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:01,345
How do you know that?

110
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,831
Because I was there
when I told him.

111
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:05,599
You have
until 10:00 a.m.

112
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,018
Then I'm calling Dallas.

113
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:09,336
And Mark may not
take your call,

114
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:13,357
but he'll sure as hell
take mine.

115
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:14,608
How do I know
you're not going to turn around

116
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:15,726
and get him
to pay more?

117
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:16,944
You don't.

118
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,446
But if you don't
match this,

119
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:20,898
you'll never find out.

120
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,297
Jessica.

121
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:37,331
Harvey.

122
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,333
I don't recall
giving you my key.

123
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:41,419
I don't recall authorizing you
to negotiate

124
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,870
behind Deron Williams' back.

125
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:44,221
His back
is just fine.

126
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:46,173
I'm standing
right behind it.

127
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:49,710
Then why is the contract
he signed in my hand?

128
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:52,980
How much
did you ask for?

129
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,182
Triple.

130
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,734
You out of your mind?

131
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:57,768
We have leverage.

132
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:00,354
And what is that?

133
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:02,523
- It's complicated.
- Simplify it for me.

134
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,725
- I bluffed him.
- That's not leverage.

135
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,826
It is
if he believes it.

136
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:07,445
And if it fails,
he fires us

137
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,163
and takes ten other players
with him.

138
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,831
Then it better not fail.

139
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,617
You asked the man
for triple.

140
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:15,582
If I had what I said I had,
that's what I'd get.

141
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,205
I don't ask for triple,
he knows I'm bluffing.

142
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,790
Then don't bluff
in the first place.

143
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,676
I'm afraid
that's what I do.

144
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:23,878
You know
what I think?

145
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,179
I think you want it
to fail.

146
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:26,597
I think
you're stuck

147
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:27,681
with a merger
you don't want

148
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:29,683
and a noncompete
you can't stand,

149
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,385
and you're trying
to get me to fire you.

150
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,270
I could bust
that noncompete wide open.

151
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,638
But you gave me
your word.

152
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,941
Which is
why I'm staying.

153
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:39,443
Jessica, I've always
operated this way.

154
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:42,196
It's what you hired me for,
it's what you pay me for,

155
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,365
and it used to be
what you valued me for.

156
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:45,566
I'm not going
to fire you.

157
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,985
Neither is Deron Williams.

158
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,453
Nets just caved.

159
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:52,656
So unless you're looking
to cook me breakfast tomorrow,

160
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:54,208
I'd say we're done.

161
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,470
I told you
I needed time.

162
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:07,755
I know,
but it's been two days,

163
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:08,722
and I can't
take it anymore.

164
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,926
I had to see you.

165
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:20,351
I don't want any comments
about how messy the place is.

166
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,969
Okay.

167
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,907
And what would clean
look like?

168
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,643
Don't even think
about it.

169
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:32,312
I can't not think
about it, all right?

170
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,281
It's all I've been able
to think about for two days.

171
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:36,033
Mike, why are you here?

172
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:38,619
Because that's not going
to happen.

173
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,987
Now or ever?

174
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,840
You lied to me
about everything.

175
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:44,175
Rachel--

176
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:45,209
Do you remember
when I told you I needed time?

177
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:46,827
That's what
I needed it for--

178
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,430
to process this bomb
that you dropped on me.

179
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:53,634
I had a nightmare.

180
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,136
You asked why I'm here.
That's why.

181
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:57,605
I--

182
00:07:57,672 --> 00:07:59,440
you exposed me
to the entire firm.

183
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:01,308
- I would never do that.
- I know.

184
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,843
And I woke up,
and I realized

185
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:04,812
that the real nightmare
wouldn't even be that.

186
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,283
The real nightmare
would be--

187
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,987
would be if you didn't want
to be with me.

188
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:14,321
Do you really
mean that?

189
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:17,458
I meant it
the first time I ever saw you.

190
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:24,748
Rachel, I know that I'm not
who you want me to be,

191
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,967
but--but you know
what happened in that room.

192
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:28,219
You know
what we both felt.

193
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:30,304
I--

194
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:32,673
I don't want
to lose that.

195
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:37,311
I just keep wishing
you never told me.

196
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:40,681
But then it never
would have happened.

197
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:43,050
And it did.

198
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,768
And I'm--

199
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:46,904
I'm really glad
that it did.

200
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:52,026
I am too.

201
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:53,944
But what happens
if you get caught?

202
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,364
Because what you had
may have been a nightmare, Mike,

203
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:58,532
but you can't tell me
you're not afraid

204
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,533
of being exposed.

205
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:00,834
Of course I am.

206
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:03,337
But there's nothing
that I can do about it.

207
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:06,290
Well, maybe there is.

208
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:08,676
What are you saying?

209
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:11,295
Quit.

210
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,946
Go in tomorrow,
and just quit.

222
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,103
I need to talk to you.

223
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,305
You want to talk
about how things played out,

224
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,725
but the place to do that
is somewhere more private.

225
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,279
You didn't just come through
on the merger.

226
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:05,947
You bluffed Hardman,

227
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:08,316
turned Monica Eton,

228
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,617
and put us over the top
on Folsom Foods.

229
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,986
Now that's a lot
of coming through in the clutch.

230
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,322
And I wouldn't have saved
your ass

231
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,742
if I didn't think
you deserved to be here.

232
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:18,993
I don't know
what to say.

233
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,912
Well, the usual response is
"thank you."

234
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,297
The usual road
to getting here

235
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:24,332
doesn't involve
stabbing someone in the back.

236
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,552
Doesn't it?

237
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,339
When I was 16,

238
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,308
I came home,
my mother sat me down,

239
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,477
and said my parents
were separating.

240
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:38,096
Trial basis.

241
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,065
But the good news was
she was going to get me a car

242
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,684
to help with my sister.

243
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,354
All my friends talked about
how lucky I was to have it.

244
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,741
I hated that car.

245
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:52,911
Every time I got in it, I--

246
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:54,913
it just reminded me.

247
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:57,031
Why are you telling me this?

248
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:59,167
Because five years later,

249
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:03,571
that same car got me to Harvard,
which led me here.

250
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,757
So you can think
of this office

251
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:09,093
as a reminder
of what you did to Harvey

252
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:12,130
or as a symbol
of what you can accomplish

253
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,299
at the firm.

254
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:17,752
Now, do you still
have something to say?

255
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,939
No.

256
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,358
No, I don't.

257
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:28,029
They ever get back together?

258
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:30,932
No.

259
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,402
No, they didn't.

260
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,216
Ah, God!
Damn it!

261
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:49,300
Louis, what happened?

262
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,135
Oh.
I'll tell you what happened.

263
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,253
This stupid merger.

264
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,421
It's bad enough
my vote is worth

265
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,639
1/3 of what it was
last week.

266
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,174
Now our uni-balls, gone.

267
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:57,642
Our...What?

268
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:58,726
Pens, Donna.

269
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,144
The new quartermaster,

270
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,631
Barbara L. Tottingham, will not
buy us any more uni-balls.

271
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,634
There's not one single uni-ball
in this entire firm.

272
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,770
- Please stop saying uni-ball.
- No, I will not.

273
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,989
Stuck
with these stupid plastic things

274
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,273
that keep breaking.

275
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,075
So buy your own pen.

276
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,778
Bu

277
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,913
okay.

278
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,081
There are two things
in this firm

279
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:22,367
that I hold very sacred--
my uni-balls

280
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,118
and my raspberry Bran bars.

281
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,587
And if I have to go
and buy 'em myself,

282
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,256
well, then,
this Barbara L. Tottingham

283
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,841
has a message for me,
loud and clear,

284
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,259
and that's "Louis Litt,
go screw yourself."

285
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:32,961
Louis, the ink on your face.
You've got just, like--

286
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,295
you've got, like,
a little bit right there.

287
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,130
Where, here?

288
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:38,466
No, I think you've gotta
give it, like, a good--

289
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,467
Okay, fine.

290
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,936
Gone?

291
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,305
Thank you, Donna.
You're a true friend.

292
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,773
I got your back.

293
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,141
Hey, do you remember

294
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:48,843
when you used to do
those rotator cuff exercises?

295
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,344
Oh, yeah,
what are you kidding? Of course.

296
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,780
Every day for, like, 18 months.
Why do you ask?

297
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:55,283
No reason.

298
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,205
Edward.

299
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,824
Jessica,
how lovely to see you.

300
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,409
I wanted to thank you.

301
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:06,911
- Ah. You saw the sign.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,413
You didn't have
to do that.

303
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:10,248
Our agreement stipulates
Darby Pearson,

304
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,749
not Pearson Darby.

305
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:16,054
Our agreement also stipulates
a 51/49 percentage structure.

306
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:17,705
And this is your way
of showing me

307
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,307
that you think of it
as 50/50.

308
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:21,476
- Merely a gesture.
- Ah.

309
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:22,760
Heck of a gesture.

310
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,712
How would you propose
to a woman?

311
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,930
A woman?

312
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,599
I think we both know that--
Yes, we do.

313
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,735
Anyway...

314
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,570
It is shaping up
to be a lovely day.

315
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:33,988
Oh, I wish
I could say that same.

316
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,657
I assume you know
about the latest goings-on

317
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,058
with Hessington Oil.

318
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,077
I wouldn't be much
of a partner if I didn't.

319
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:42,280
Now they've decide to take on
Ava Hessington personally.

320
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,499
- Who is they?
- The U.S. government.

321
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,451
I've decided to let Harvey
handle it.

322
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,670
- Why?
- Why not?

323
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:49,904
It's not a good time.

324
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,956
He's still digesting
the merger.

325
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,841
- Meaning?
- He's acting out.

326
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,376
Well, he may be
acting out,

327
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,346
but I understand he just got
his client triple the money.

328
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,015
By taking a huge risk
he didn't have to.

329
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,884
This case,
he may have to.

330
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,086
So that's why Harvey.

331
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,306
And this case is more
important to me than just money.

332
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,558
And why is that?

333
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,111
Because it is.

334
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,597
What if I said no?

335
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:19,266
I'm afraid that's not an option.

336
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,869
So I guess
that sign

337
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,072
really doesn't mean 50/50
after all.

338
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,741
I did say
it was merely a gesture.

339
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,877
Hmm.

340
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:31,913
You keep showing up
to surprise me,

341
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,614
people are gonna
get the wrong idea.

342
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:36,134
People are going to think
what they're going to think.

343
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:38,753
I'm here to bury the hatchet.
And what prompted that?

344
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,089
Darby found out what you did
with Deron Williams.

345
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,790
Don't tell me.
He was impressed.

346
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,625
He was pissed.

347
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,793
Thinks you're trying
to get fired.

348
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,678
And you told him
how smart he was.

349
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:50,014
I told him
you said it wasn't true

350
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:51,599
and that I believed you,

351
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,268
and then I fought to give you
a chance to prove it.

352
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,637
Ava Hessington.

353
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:57,638
I got you on it.

354
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:58,806
What does that matter
to me?

355
00:15:58,857 --> 00:15:59,907
Harvey,

356
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,309
I know you and I
have had our problems,

357
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,362
but this is a chance
for us to move past it.

358
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,613
Let's take it.

359
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,532
You really do
wanna make up.

360
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,534
I never wanted to be at odds
in the first place.

361
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:13,287
Neither did I.

362
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,590
Are we good?

363
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:18,209
Don't you wanna tell me
I better win this goddamn case?

364
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:19,994
I didn't think
I had to.

365
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,606
Never stopped you
from saying it before.

366
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,549
Well, I'm learning
to let go.

367
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,885
Oh, Harvey,
there is one more thing.

368
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,639
You better win
this goddamn case.

369
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,027
I know
it's not my place,

370
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,047
but you really suck
at quitting.

371
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:57,198
I can explain.

372
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,635
No need.
It was just a suggestion.

373
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:01,969
Rachel, I tried to do it,
but--

374
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:05,372
But then Jessica
gave you this office to stay?

375
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,874
Actually,
she gave me this office

376
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,012
before I could even
bring it up.

377
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,096
Well, aren't you

378
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:13,347
just the luckiest person
in the world?

379
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:14,715
Rachel--

380
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,567
You came to me,
you were petrified

381
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,552
of being exposed,
and I gave you a way out.

382
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,023
And now, 12 hours later,
you're in a brand-new office

383
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,324
with a diploma on the wall
that, for all I know,

384
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:24,659
came from Kinko's.

385
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,861
What do you want me to do?
Everyone hangs one.

386
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:31,232
No, Mike,
everyone doesn't just hang one.

387
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,700
So that's
what this is really about.

388
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,735
You're damn right
it is.

389
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:38,623
I've been trying to earn one
for as long as I can remember.

390
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:41,175
And you have one and everything
that goes with it,

391
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,678
and you didn't do
a single thing to deserve it.

392
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:44,795
You have no idea
what I have or haven't done

393
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,380
to get where I am.

394
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,716
And that's
the whole problem.

395
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,185
I have no idea
who you are.

396
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:29,765
Harvey, I'm just in the middle
of a little afternoon crossword.

397
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:30,933
Are you a puzzler?

398
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,568
Don't you have work
to do?

399
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:34,135
My dear fellow,
if I have to do work,

400
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:36,104
then I'm not doing my job.

401
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,105
What can I do
for you?

402
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,490
Jessica told me

403
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,359
that you agreed to let me
be lead on Ava Hessington.

404
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:41,743
I wanted to thank you.

405
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:44,145
- You're welcome.
- There's just one problem.

406
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:46,915
You didn't agree to anything.
You demanded it.

407
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,784
And you let Jessica
play good cop

408
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,170
because you didn't wanna
undermine the chain of command.

409
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,121
That's quite
the conspiracy theory.

410
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,656
Well,
here's the good news.

411
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:56,658
My plate's a little full
right now.

412
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:59,461
And since you didn't want me
on this case in the first place,

413
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,329
why don't you let
somebody else handle it?

414
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,432
Good luck.
I hear it's a tough one.

415
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:06,334
What do you want?

416
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:08,103
I want out.

417
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,271
I win this,

418
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,640
you tear up my noncompete,
and you fire me.

419
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,009
You hate this merger
that much.

420
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,677
I had an agreement
with Jessica,

421
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:16,945
and I honored it.

422
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:19,681
Then she accused me
of trying to get fired.

423
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,200
Then she lied to me

424
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,818
by claiming
that she fought for me

425
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,152
to be on this case.

426
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,372
She really does wanna
make up with you, you know.

427
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,041
Funny way
of showing it.

428
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,492
Ironic.

429
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,578
Her belief that you wanted
to be fired

430
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:35,080
led you to wanting
to be fired.

431
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:38,000
Do we have
a deal or not?

432
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,387
It appears we do.

433
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:52,180
Oh, hey.
Uh, go ahead.

434
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,349
No, that's all right.
You were here first.

435
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,717
Why are you being
so polite?

436
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:56,985
Come on, you have
one stupid copy.

437
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:58,437
You could've finished it
already.

438
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,939
Louis, I--

439
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:04,076
A letter of resignation?

440
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,110
Why?

441
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:07,112
It's complicated.

442
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:10,666
Well, simplify it for me,
Mike.

443
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,202
Harvey.

444
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,537
He's the one
who hired me.

445
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,072
Now he wants nothing
to do with me.

446
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:18,406
What are you talking about?
He just gave you a new office.

447
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,042
No, Jessica gave me
a new office.

448
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:24,913
If it was up to Harvey,
I wouldn't even have a cubicle.

449
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:27,716
What happened?

450
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:31,086
All that matters is that,
uh, I can't fix it.

451
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,940
You know, when we were
in the bullpen,

452
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:37,943
Harvey was like Superman.

453
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,895
And then, one day,

454
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:41,897
Hardman decided to just
knock him down a peg.

455
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,532
Gave him
this bullshit assignment,

456
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,400
undoable workload,
unwinnable case.

457
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,035
And I took it
as a chance

458
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:49,454
to break down his walls
and offer my help.

459
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,739
And I just thought,
this just might be

460
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,107
the chance
that we could become--

461
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:54,793
- Friends.
- Yeah.

462
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:58,330
And he looked at me--
how dare I?

463
00:20:58,414 --> 00:20:59,831
I get it.
He's alone.

464
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,466
He always has been.
He always will be.

465
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,502
Always was.

466
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:06,221
Harvey is
not Superman anymore.

467
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:11,426
He's Batman.

468
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,312
And Batman needs Robin.

469
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,630
And I just need
to remind him of that.

470
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,265
What's the one thing
that Harvey values

471
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,433
over everything else?

472
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:19,568
- Winning.
- Yeah.

473
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:20,769
You help him win,

474
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,804
he'll remember
why he needs you.

475
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:24,906
I have to figure out
what cases he's working on.

476
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:26,408
The I.T. Department
has access to every computer

477
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,744
in the entire firm,
syncs up every night.

478
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,246
So all I have to do is get
access to Harvey's hard drive.

479
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:33,314
That place is a fortress.

480
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:37,536
Benjamin.

481
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:40,706
It's you.

482
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,424
Aw, that's sweet.
You remember me.

483
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:43,658
Oh, yes.

484
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,660
I remember everyone
who's ever bamboozled me

485
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:47,495
into giving them
a top-of-the-line laptop.

486
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:48,997
Their names
are Michael Ross.

487
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,016
I didn't bamboozle you,
Benjamin.

488
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,500
I won it
fair and square.

489
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:55,020
And I've been tracking
every Internet move you've made

490
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:58,023
for the past ten months,
waiting for the slipup.

491
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:00,609
Bet you thought you had me
at teenybikini.com.

492
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:02,561
No.
No, no.

493
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:04,062
Because I cross-referenced that

494
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,848
with your workplace
harassment case, and I knew.

495
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,817
But don't think I'm not aware
that you went home for dinner

496
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:11,319
and used your personal computer
to go back there.

497
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,288
Okay,
that's not actionable,

498
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:15,374
but hacking
my personal computer is.

499
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,210
Good luck proving that.
Now, what do you want?

500
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:20,195
- I want access to a hard drive.
- No way.

501
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:21,546
Not only that,
I want you to give me

502
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,382
whatever I want
whenever I want it

503
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:24,549
for the rest
of your life.

504
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,917
And why would I
do that?

505
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:27,386
Oh, right.

506
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,872
Because I just recorded you
admitting to violating the law.

507
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:33,975
- The XJS-5000.
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:35,594
- You--you set me up.
- Yep.

509
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:37,646
You knew that I would
track your home computer.

510
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:39,147
And after
you've been convicted,

511
00:22:39,215 --> 00:22:42,651
you'll be lucky to be hired
as a network administrator...

512
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:44,903
At a high school...

513
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:46,855
In Jersey.

514
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:48,940
How long are you gonna
keep at this?

515
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,992
Until I find out
what I just got myself into.

516
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,611
I mean, look at this stack
of papers.

517
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:55,614
It's 1/5 of the files
we have on Ava Hessington.

518
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:58,250
- You need a shortcut.
- Well, I'm not going to Mike.

519
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:00,702
I'm not talking
about him.

520
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:03,588
Ava Hessington
started in the London office.

521
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,175
It's too late.

522
00:23:07,243 --> 00:23:09,928
No, it's not.

523
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:15,133
You gotta be
kidding me.

524
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:17,185
How did you get
through security?

525
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:19,304
Charm and this smile.

526
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:20,555
You bought a ticket,
didn't you?

527
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,390
Trinidad-Tobago.

528
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,759
First-class?
You're not even going.

529
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:27,529
I prefer to not travel
in style.

530
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,064
I'd prefer to be alone
right now.

531
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:31,533
Scottie,
I need your help.

532
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,034
I'm sorry,
I have a plane to catch.

533
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:34,536
A plane, by the way,
that you put me on.

534
00:23:34,603 --> 00:23:36,955
After I saved your job,
which you accepted.

535
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,606
So now we're both working
for the same firm.

536
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:40,441
Oh, I guess now I'm just
one of the many partners

537
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:41,626
who gets to work with you

538
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,879
and yet wants nothing to do
with you.

539
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:45,831
Scottie.

540
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:48,616
Please!

541
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:50,418
You once helped me
without me asking.

542
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,338
Well, now I'm asking.

543
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:55,557
Then tell me something.

544
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:57,476
Something what?

545
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,511
Just...

546
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:04,266
Something.

547
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,735
I remember the first time
I ever saw you.

548
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:08,603
Con Law.

549
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:10,939
You threw me some line, and I
gave you shit about your hair.

550
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,824
No, it was two weeks
before that

551
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,409
outside Langdell.

552
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,644
You were wearing a blue dress.
The wind was blowing.

553
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:19,414
When I saw your face,
it stopped me dead in my tracks.

554
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,200
That's not enough.

555
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:23,919
Well, I'm not finished.

556
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:26,004
The next time I saw you
was Con Law.

557
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:28,423
You answered the first question
that Dyson asked,

558
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,543
and I knew that that face
that blew me away

559
00:24:31,627 --> 00:24:34,045
was your second best asset.

560
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,348
Look, you mean
something to me.

561
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,266
You've always meant
something to me,

562
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:43,188
and you always will mean
something to me.

563
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:49,528
You are such a dick.

564
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,148
What do you need, Harvey?

565
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,816
Ava Hessington.

566
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,188
Well, this is gonna
take a while.

567
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:04,159
So you're gonna
buy me a drink,

568
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,879
and I'm gonna take that ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

569
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:15,781
Okay, Norma,
it's been 24 hours.

570
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:17,788
If you can't get me Barbara lL.
Tottingham on the phone,

571
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,173
well, then guess what,
you don't get--

572
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:22,259
Oh.
It's you!

573
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,761
Well, you tell Norma if I don't
have a package of uni-balls

574
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,095
on my desk by noon,

575
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:26,964
she can kiss her trip
to Dollywood good-bye.

576
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,315
Now, why don't you
get the hell out of here,

577
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,435
so I can fix myself
a raspberry Bran bar in peace?

578
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:34,405
What are you looking at?

579
00:25:42,313 --> 00:25:43,864
Looking for this?

580
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:46,200
It's the last one.

581
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:48,652
Not today.

582
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,654
You're Barbara L. Tottingham.

583
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:53,040
I hardly made it difficult
to figure out.

584
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:55,325
Barbara L. Tottingham.

585
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:59,329
B.L.T.
Which is a sandwich.

586
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:01,215
And what does one put
on a B.L.T.?

587
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,716
Mayonnaise,
invented by the French.

588
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,969
Which points directly
to another French sandwich.

589
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,470
Of course, the monte cristo,
as in the Count of Monte Cristo.

590
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,688
How did I not see that?

591
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:08,772
It was staring me
right in the face.

592
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Indeed it was.

593
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:10,975
The count returned
from the dead,

594
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:12,393
as I am now returned

595
00:26:12,477 --> 00:26:14,478
from the banishment
to which you sentenced me...

596
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:15,980
As quartermaster.

597
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,614
I would ask you
how you did it,

598
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:20,017
but I know you wouldn't tell me,
because I wouldn't tell you.

599
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:21,201
What I will tell you is

600
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:22,369
that during my time
in the wilderness--

601
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:24,822
- It was three days.
- And nights.

602
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:26,040
I endeavored to discover

603
00:26:26,124 --> 00:26:28,375
what perquisites
you value most in this firm--

604
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,794
your beloved Bran bars.

605
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:31,962
You're never going
to have them.

606
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,380
I can buy them myself.

607
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,306
Even if you were willing
to buy them yourself--

608
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:37,134
which we both know
you aren't--

609
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:39,386
you'll never eat them
on Pearson Darby grounds.

610
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:40,387
You didn't.

611
00:26:40,472 --> 00:26:43,090
I did.
They're banned.

612
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:47,845
Wait a second.

613
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:51,148
You're telling me that
Barbara L. Tottingham is Nigel?

614
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:52,516
No.
Stay with me.

615
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:55,986
B.L.T., mayonnaise,
monte cristo sandwich.

616
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:57,271
Oh, my God,
I'm so hungry.

617
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:58,572
- Donna.
- What?

618
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:00,524
What do you want from me, Louis?
I'm busy.

619
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,060
So you can't have your pens
or your Bran bars, big deal.

620
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:04,445
Donna, listen.

621
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:05,829
When I was in ninth grade,

622
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:07,417
there was this wrestler
Randy Cusumano.

623
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,249
And one day after school
in the locker room,

624
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:11,085
he pinned me down, and he taped
my butt cheeks together.

625
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:12,870
Wait a second, is this the
story from <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

626
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:14,421
I'm not familiar
with that song.

627
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,124
Never mind.

628
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,459
Look, I swore
that I would get him back

629
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:20,911
no matter what it took.

630
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:23,013
What did it take?

631
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:24,214
Ah, you don't really
wanna know.

632
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:25,549
Thank you.

633
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,084
The point is
if I'm Nigel and Nigel's me,

634
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:29,803
he's not gonna stop
at Bran bars and pens.

635
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:32,473
I gotta take care of Nigel
once and for all.

636
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,727
You need to get rid of him
as quartermaster.

637
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:37,978
Miss Hessington,

638
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:40,064
first of all, I want you
to familiarize yourself

639
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,231
with this man.

640
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:42,900
U.S. attorney
Richard Jensen.

641
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:44,568
He's one of the best
there is,

642
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:45,903
and he's
who we'll be going up against.

643
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:47,371
Well, that's all
well and good, Mr. Specter,

644
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:48,989
but I have one question.

645
00:27:49,074 --> 00:27:51,158
Why should I hire you?

646
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:52,576
Because you trust
Edward Darby.

647
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,745
I'm afraid that only gets you
in the room.

648
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:56,780
This civil servant

649
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,465
seems to have
a personal vendetta against me,

650
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,833
and I don't even know why.

651
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:00,951
Well, I do.

652
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:02,285
He needs a head
on a platter.

653
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:03,670
Why mine?

654
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,889
You've been skirting
environmental laws for a decade.

655
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:07,975
He's got a chance to nail you,
and he's gonna take it.

656
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,460
This isn't
an environmental allegation.

657
00:28:10,512 --> 00:28:12,629
No, it's a bribery charge,

658
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,848
it's got teeth,
and it's coming your way.

659
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,818
Don't sugarcoat it,
Mr. Specter.

660
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:19,736
Give it to me straight.
Okay, I will.

661
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:21,822
Because when he digs
a little deeper,

662
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,140
he's gonna find evidence

663
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:25,909
of the spill your company
covered up in 2008,

664
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:28,245
the whistle-blower
you bought off in 2010,

665
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:32,082
and the environmental impact
study you doctored in 2006.

666
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,201
So it's not gonna be hard
to convince a jury

667
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:36,620
that you're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

668
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,422
to get your pipeline.

669
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:40,924
And what are you going to do
to stop him?

670
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:44,828
Bury evidence,
contact witnesses,

671
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:47,347
or sleep with your rival
pitcher's girlfriend

672
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:49,550
the night
before the big game?

673
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:51,268
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

674
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:52,603
I got it.

675
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,222
I looked into you.
You looked into me.

676
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:56,773
I actually prefer it
that way.

677
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:58,175
And why is that?

678
00:28:58,226 --> 00:28:59,476
Because you know
what I'll do to win.

679
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:01,287
Saves me the trouble
of explaining it to you.

680
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,063
And I won't have
to explain to you

681
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:04,681
what I did to win
that pipeline.

682
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:05,983
You bribed them.

683
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,818
Guilty as charged.

684
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:09,369
And I don't care
what Richard Jensen says.

685
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:11,155
Every company with a pipeline
over there

686
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:12,789
did the same thing.

687
00:29:12,857 --> 00:29:14,858
- Is that your defense?
- It's the truth.

688
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,543
It would be nice
if we only found oil

689
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:19,496
under Texas ranchers
or North Sea fishermen.

690
00:29:19,547 --> 00:29:20,914
But in the real world,

691
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:24,501
we find it in nasty places
under nasty people.

692
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:26,587
And any executive worth a damn
does what's needed

693
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:28,005
or goes out of business.

694
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:31,391
- Good. We're done.
- Excuse me?

695
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:33,236
I just needed to know
what I was dealing with

696
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:34,678
before I make
my next move.

697
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,680
- And what is that?
- I'll let you know.

698
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:39,266
I haven't officially
hired you yet.

699
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,518
Yes, you have.

700
00:29:48,893 --> 00:29:50,744
How long
you been waiting here?

701
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,613
Since I found out
what you need.

702
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:54,498
What I need is for you
to leave me alone.

703
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:57,284
No, what you need is
information on Ava Hessington.

704
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:59,920
In 2008, her company tried
to destroy evidence--

705
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,239
Of an oil spill?

706
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,208
Okay, well,
in 2010, they--

707
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:05,842
They bought off
a whistle-blower.

708
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,461
And if the next thing
you're gonna tell me

709
00:30:07,545 --> 00:30:10,514
is about an environmental
impact study in 2006,

710
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:11,548
don't.

711
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,250
You think
you're not replaceable?

712
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,018
I got all that
from an associate

713
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:16,553
I picked at random.

714
00:30:16,604 --> 00:30:18,472
I've been doing this
before I met you,

715
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:21,258
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

716
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:22,693
You had enough?
No.

717
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,028
No, you know what, I haven't,
because you haven't.

718
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:26,446
Excuse me?

719
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:27,781
You haven't said whatever
you have to say to rip me

720
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,032
to shreds enough so that
you can start to forgive me.

721
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,617
So go ahead.

722
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:31,818
Whatever it takes,
I can take it.

723
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:33,870
Go!

724
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:35,539
Harvey, I'm sorry,
all right?

725
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:36,823
But I need you
to listen to me now.

726
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:38,625
Listen to you?

727
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,377
You know when I would've
listened to you?

728
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:41,545
That night.

729
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:45,282
- Jessica threatened me.
- I don't care.

730
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,550
Anyone comes at you
with any threat at all,

731
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:47,968
you come to me.

732
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:49,419
I don't give a shit
if it's the Queen on England.

733
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,471
You come to me.
You tell me!

734
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,173
You tell me everything!

735
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:55,392
That's what
goddamn loyalty is.

736
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:13,193
Okay, you're right.

737
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:14,444
You don't know
who I am

738
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:15,975
or what I've done
to deserve anything.

739
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,115
So here's what's gonna happen.
I am gonna tell you.

740
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,700
I am gonna tell you
everything,

741
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:21,251
and when we're done,
either we're gonna be finished,

742
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,253
or we're gonna go back there
and we're gonna do exactly

743
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:25,589
what we should've done
the other night.

744
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:27,708
Okay.

745
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,571
Okay, one more time.

746
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:35,421
Are you ready?
Yes.

747
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:36,422
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:37,423
Okay.

749
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:39,225
So I was here.
Mmhmm.

750
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:41,144
Yeah? And I was running
down here.

751
00:31:41,228 --> 00:31:43,446
And the cops,
they were back here.

752
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,316
So I am running--
let's see, where is it?

753
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,901
Oh, yeah,
it was down here.

754
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,869
And I run into here,

755
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:51,955
and then Donna,
she was right here.

756
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,824
- Okay.
- So she let me in...

757
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:56,793
Here.

758
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:59,545
And then Harvey,
he was right down--

759
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,580
No!

760
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:01,781
What?

761
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:04,116
Harvey is not getting
anywhere near there.

762
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:06,052
Oh, no one is ever
getting anywhere near there.

763
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,387
Oh, you think
you're that good, do you?

764
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:09,756
It's one
of my many gifts.

765
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:11,567
Being that good
or thinking you're that good?

766
00:32:11,592 --> 00:32:14,260
Do you want a replay?
'Cause I will go right now.

767
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,729
- Like you could.
- I could!

768
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:19,015
Soon...ish.

769
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:20,800
Do you have, like,
an energy drink or something?

770
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,902
- Oh.
- Come on! We were up all night.

771
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,303
You kept me up
all night.

772
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:27,306
<i>You</i> kept me up all night.

773
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,669
I can't tell you
how it feels

774
00:32:39,753 --> 00:32:41,487
that you know.

775
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:43,489
Mm, well, who knew

776
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,259
that honesty
was the best policy?

777
00:32:46,326 --> 00:32:49,379
Oh, wait.
Everyone knew that.

778
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:54,350
What?

779
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:03,977
Can I help you?

780
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,196
Louis Litt.

781
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:08,815
Oh, I know
who you are.

782
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:11,234
Freshly minted
senior partner,

783
00:33:11,318 --> 00:33:13,536
expert in matters
of corporate finance,

784
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,022
and the man responsible
for the superb training

785
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:17,156
of the associates.

786
00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:21,077
You've looked into me.
Mmhmm.

787
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:24,080
I've looked into you.

788
00:33:24,164 --> 00:33:25,999
Tarte au chocolat
from Cafe Pouchkine.

789
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,367
The best patisserie
in Paris.

790
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,086
A steeping cup
of da Hong pao.

791
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,171
The most expensive tea
in the world.

792
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:34,173
Two of my favorite things.

793
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:37,844
What better to enjoy
after signing this order...

794
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:39,145
Making me quartermaster?

795
00:33:39,212 --> 00:33:40,513
Pity you don't have
a Montblanc pen

796
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:41,764
for me to sign it with.

797
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:44,567
With cobalt ink.

798
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,185
We already have
a quartermaster.

799
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:47,653
Sir, I know...

800
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,772
That this is
Nigel's position

801
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:52,108
and him losing it
would not be easy for him.

802
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:53,910
But let me
just assure you,

803
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:56,913
I'm not just prepared
for this position...

804
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:59,365
I was born for it.

805
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:02,368
I have PhDs
in chemical engineering

806
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:03,920
and petroleum exploration.

807
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:06,589
I've made it to the top
in a field dominated by men,

808
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:09,042
and I'm facing
a prison sentence

809
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:11,210
for an allegation
which any man in my position

810
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:12,578
would be fined for.

811
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:14,714
Every similar case
has been settled with a fine,

812
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:15,932
not prison.

813
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,137
That's what we're proposing.

814
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:19,218
Well, there's just
one problem.

815
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:21,687
I'm not charging you
because you're a woman.

816
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,272
I'm charging you
because you're the one I caught.

817
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:25,808
Ava, can you give us
a minute?

818
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:36,736
Okay, she's gonna
write you a check.

819
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:38,071
Let's talk about how much.

820
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:40,289
I'm sorry, Harvey.

821
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:42,325
Not this time.

822
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:45,945
Is that what I said to you
on Hazelton?

823
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,663
That was
a long time ago.

824
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:49,916
We're not at the D.A.'s office
anymore.

825
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:52,785
I didn't realize our bond
had an expiration date.

826
00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:54,620
It doesn't, but...

827
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:57,890
you want to deal on this,
I need jail time.

828
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:01,094
You're running for office?

829
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:02,562
What if I am?

830
00:35:02,629 --> 00:35:05,231
You need a scalp.

831
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:06,732
I can think of four people
off the top of my head

832
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,280
that make her look like
Mother Teresa.

833
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:10,520
Harvey, I can't afford
to horse trade on this.

834
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:11,604
You've done it before.

835
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,606
And I'll do it again,
but...not today.

836
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:16,359
Richard, you are singling out
this woman, and it's wrong.

837
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:18,945
That's not my problem.

838
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:20,363
What if I told you
I need this one?

839
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:24,083
Then I'd have to tell you...
I'm sorry.

840
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:27,203
Not gonna forget this.

841
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:28,621
Harvey, look.

842
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:31,257
If our bond can't survive
me telling you no,

843
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:32,992
then...

844
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,962
It didn't mean much
to begin with.

845
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:47,306
- Hey, Rach.
- No time, code two!

846
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:48,691
Richard Gere's
in the lobby?

847
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,194
- Leaving now, let's go.
- Relax.

848
00:35:51,278 --> 00:35:54,197
We have trained for this.
Okay.

849
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:57,683
Wait!

850
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:13,866
Congratulations.

851
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:17,369
Your writing implements
and nourishment of choice.

852
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:18,554
Mm.

853
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,558
Yeah, I'd say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

854
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,810
Please don't do this.

855
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:26,896
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

856
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,398
You're not gonna trick me into
letting you stay quartermaster

857
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:30,933
just so you can take away
what's most dear to me

858
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:33,402
little by little.

859
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:37,106
Then I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take it away all at once.

860
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,992
What are you
talking about?

861
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,862
I took you for a bylaws man.
It seems I was wrong.

862
00:36:42,913 --> 00:36:44,396
At Darby International,

863
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:45,948
one cannot be in charge
of both the animate

864
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:48,534
and the inanimate
at the same time.

865
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:53,956
Your beloved associates
are mine.

866
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,291
You set me up.

867
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,709
What better way
to catch a rat

868
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,461
than with
quartermaster cheese?

869
00:36:58,545 --> 00:36:59,762
What are you gonna do,

870
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:02,882
beg Darby to undo
what you just begged him to do?

871
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:07,687
Hold on.

872
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:11,057
Nigel, the associates
are my life.

873
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,426
So please don't do this.

874
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:16,479
When I was
at preparatory school,

875
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:19,232
like you,
I was bullied again and again.

876
00:37:19,283 --> 00:37:22,068
It was painful,
but I always saw them coming.

877
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,602
But with you,
I didn't.

878
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:26,989
So it wasn't a stab in the back,
it was a stab in the heart.

879
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:29,742
And I just gave you
the opportunity to take it back,

880
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:31,377
and you passed.

881
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:35,665
So no, quartermaster Litt,
I won't forgive you.

882
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:42,955
Nice office.

883
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:44,724
Thanks.

884
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:47,009
Do you mind
if I ask you a favor?

885
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:48,177
Yeah, anything.

886
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:49,979
I have
a ton of old files

887
00:37:50,063 --> 00:37:51,931
that I need organized
and shipped to storage,

888
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:55,134
and I was wondering if you
could maybe do that for me.

889
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:56,635
I

890
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:58,154
Because I figured if you were
suddenly doing things for people

891
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:00,106
that they don't need you to do,
didn't ask you to do,

892
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:03,776
and don't want you to do,
then maybe I'd get in on that.

893
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,749
I put that on Harvey's desk
for him, not you.

894
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:12,034
Maybe.

895
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,819
But I know
what you don't seem to get.

896
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,655
Harvey didn't value you
for your help on cases.

897
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:19,158
He valued you for your loyalty,
which he told you last night.

898
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:20,376
Yeah, I know that.

899
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,620
And I'm trying
to get it back,

900
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:22,828
and this is
the only way I know how.

901
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,163
By sending Rachel
to distract me

902
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,631
and sneaking
into his office?

903
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh, by the way, you think
I don't know about you two?

904
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:29,001
Took me one look.
Donna, come on.

905
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:32,021
You wanna know how
to get Harvey's loyalty back?

906
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:34,523
Get in a time machine and undo
what you did with Jessica.

907
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:36,508
Oh, shoot,
you can't do that.

908
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,111
You know what, I figured
you'd bring this file back.

909
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,147
There's also one
in your bottom drawer.

910
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:44,817
You might wanna grab that too.

911
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:45,985
And just in case of that,

912
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:48,738
I put seven other copies
in his office.

913
00:38:48,822 --> 00:38:50,289
'Cause whether
he forgives me or not,

914
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:52,825
he's still gonna need it.

915
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:55,161
Some random associate
gave him all that information

916
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:57,713
on Ava Hessington?

917
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:58,748
No way.

918
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:01,300
It was Scottie.

919
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:03,535
Yeah, I found the ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

920
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:04,804
It's not a giant leap.

921
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:07,506
The only problem is
Scottie's not here.

922
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:08,924
She's in London.

923
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,543
And Harvey--
he is still gonna need this.

924
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:15,598
This file doesn't lead
to Harvey forgiving you.

925
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:17,099
Donna...

926
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:19,068
Please could you just separate
our relationship

927
00:39:19,152 --> 00:39:20,953
from yours and his
for just, like, one second?

928
00:39:20,987 --> 00:39:22,355
Are you kidding me?

929
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:24,023
Do you think I'm mad
just because of him?

930
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:25,991
You did this
to me too.

931
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,526
And whether you appreciate it
or not,

932
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,278
I've had your back
since the day that you got here.

933
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:31,864
Yes. Yes, you have.
But what about last year?

934
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:33,249
When I had your back,
you ignored me,

935
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,000
and it almost cost him
his license.

936
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,670
The difference is
I did what I did for him,

937
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:39,255
not for me.

938
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:41,407
And I didn't get
a brand-new office for it.

939
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,676
I got fired.

940
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,897
Yum.

941
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:57,100
Oh, what do you want, Michael?
Please.

942
00:39:57,151 --> 00:39:58,634
I'm just trying to eat
my egg McMuffin

943
00:39:58,685 --> 00:39:59,936
while I'm still off-line,
okay?

944
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:02,655
I thought
you were never off-line.

945
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,691
Five minutes a day.

946
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:07,193
Listen, Benjamin,

947
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:09,946
I don't wanna hold what's
on this dictaphone over you

948
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:11,114
for the rest
of your life.

949
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:13,533
Why not?

950
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:15,118
I don't need
any more enemies.

951
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:17,453
I'd rather have a friend,
but...

952
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:19,422
I do need a favor.

953
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,124
And if I don't
give it to you,

954
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:25,128
then what do you do
with the dictaphone?

955
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,763
It's the only copy
there is.

956
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,964
Go on, erase it.

957
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:30,049
Then I'll ask you
my favor.

958
00:40:30,134 --> 00:40:32,935
How do I know
that this is the only copy?

959
00:40:33,003 --> 00:40:35,388
Because I'm giving you
my word.

960
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:41,727
What do you need?

961
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:45,982
I need you to build me
a time machine.

962
00:40:47,117 --> 00:40:49,402
And a bite
of the sandwich.

963
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:52,021
Come on.
That's not sanitary, Michael.

964
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,874
Come on,
just a little.

965
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,794
You can have
the rest.

966
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:01,530
- How did it go with Richard?
- It didn't.

967
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:03,365
He didn't budge.
Why not?

968
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,701
Says he's running for office,
but it doesn't make sense.

969
00:41:05,752 --> 00:41:08,504
Yeah, it does.

970
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,208
Son of bitch!

971
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:13,375
He looks me in the eye,

972
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:14,827
and he feeds me
a bullshit sandwich.

973
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:16,879
He's obviously not
the same man he used to be.

974
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,148
Yeah, well, I am.

975
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:21,184
Wait a second.
Let me guess. Mike?

976
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:22,435
Just because you use it

977
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,552
doesn't mean you have
to forgive him.

978
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:25,554
You're right.
I don't.

979
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:35,898
Harvey.
What are you doing here?

980
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:38,234
Hessington Oil's
number one competitor

981
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:41,170
also happens to be your biggest
campaign contributor?

982
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:42,455
Which has nothing to do
with the fact

983
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:43,623
that your client
broke the law.

984
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:44,907
You don't want a deal.

985
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:47,009
What you want
is a long, drawn-out trial

986
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:49,011
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

987
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,214
You think I wasn't
gonna find that out?

988
00:41:51,265 --> 00:41:52,598
I mean,
I gotta hand it to you.

989
00:41:52,683 --> 00:41:53,749
You set it up perfectly

990
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,017
to shield yourself
from prosecution.

991
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:57,854
To shield myself
from breaking the law.

992
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:00,273
Richard Jensen,
prosecuting the competition.

993
00:42:00,357 --> 00:42:02,024
It's a hell
of a campaign slogan.

994
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:04,977
Harvey,
your client did this.

995
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:06,929
I'm not going
after an innocent person.

996
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,781
And you know
that if I win this election,

997
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:10,316
I will do good things.

998
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,535
You know what, you sound
just like Cameron Dennis.

999
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:13,819
You remember?

1000
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:16,205
Always a reason,
always out for the greater good.

1001
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:18,491
But in the end,
it's all about him.

1002
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:20,660
Look, I've never claimed
to be out for the greater good.

1003
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,579
So cut me a deal
and find yourself another donor.

1004
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,749
Harvey, it's too late.

1005
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,385
Please.
I need this.

1006
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,340
Well, that's not
my problem.

1007
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:38,311
Send Carolyn my love.

1008
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:43,149
You wanted to see me?

1009
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:46,018
I know why you care so much
about Ava Hessington.

1010
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:47,069
Well, it's no secret.

1011
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:48,738
Her father
was my first client.

1012
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:53,409
I think he was
a little bit more than that.

1013
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:54,977
It was a different time.

1014
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:57,363
Does she know?

1015
00:42:57,447 --> 00:42:59,999
She knows
that I care about her.

1016
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,924
I'm sorry, was there
something else you wanted?

1017
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:03,169
Just to let you know
that if I could figure that out,

1018
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:04,870
Harvey can figure that out.

1019
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:06,622
And why would that
be a problem?

1020
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:08,124
Because it's one thing
for Harvey to know

1021
00:43:08,175 --> 00:43:09,625
that this case
is important to you,

1022
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:12,929
another to know
how important.

1023
00:43:12,996 --> 00:43:15,514
Are you telling me
you don't trust him?

1024
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,933
I told you

1025
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,169
he's having a difficult time
digesting this merger.

1026
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,807
I don't want him using this
as leverage to leave.

1027
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:26,609
At the end of the day,

1028
00:43:26,676 --> 00:43:29,946
I don't believe
Harvey really wants to leave.

1029
00:43:31,448 --> 00:43:32,615
Harvey...

1030
00:43:32,682 --> 00:43:33,899
What a coincidence.

1031
00:43:33,984 --> 00:43:36,852
Cameron.
You grew the mustache back.

1032
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:38,738
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

1033
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:41,540
It wasn't a success
the first time.

1034
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,025
What are you doing here?

1035
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:44,794
Ah, Richard told me
that you mentioned me

1036
00:43:44,861 --> 00:43:46,295
at your last meeting.

1037
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:49,131
It's funny,
'cause he called me

1038
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,700
after your first meeting,
wanted my advice.

1039
00:43:51,752 --> 00:43:53,502
So I guess
you're here to tell me

1040
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:55,171
he's not gonna give me
a deal.

1041
00:43:55,222 --> 00:43:57,206
I'm here to tell you he's
recusing himself from the case.

1042
00:43:57,257 --> 00:43:59,175
He didn't want the appearance
of a conflict

1043
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:01,260
to damage the workings
of justice.

1044
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:03,212
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

1045
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:06,048
Lucky for me,
I've always been special.

1046
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:07,733
No, you've always been
a corrupt prick.

1047
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:09,518
It just took me a while
to realize it.

1048
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:11,053
And it took me a while
to realize

1049
00:44:11,104 --> 00:44:13,356
that you don't have a speck
of loyalty in your entire body.

1050
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:16,325
Loyalty is a two-way street,
and you ran me off the road.

1051
00:44:16,393 --> 00:44:18,244
So what
are you gonna do?

1052
00:44:18,328 --> 00:44:20,413
You gonna let Jessica fight your
fight like you did last time,

1053
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:21,730
or you gonna run away

1054
00:44:21,782 --> 00:44:23,032
like you did when you left
the D.A.'s office?

1055
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,034
Neither one, Cameron.
But thank you.

1056
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:26,702
For what?

1057
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:29,738
For reminding me
that I don't run from a fight.

1058
00:44:32,742 --> 00:44:33,709
What was so important
that I had

1059
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,628
to come down here
right away?

1060
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:38,848
Don't tell me
you want a bigger office.

1061
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:40,683
You told me
that I can think of this office

1062
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,135
as a reminder
of what I did to Harvey

1063
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,639
or as a symbol
of what I can do at this firm.

1064
00:44:46,723 --> 00:44:48,891
But the thing is
I don't wanna be here

1065
00:44:48,942 --> 00:44:50,926
if I'm not solid
with Harvey.

1066
00:44:50,977 --> 00:44:53,429
Well,
that's between you and Harvey.

1067
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,400
It's between you and me.

1068
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:00,236
You put yourself between us
when you blackmailed me.

1069
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,154
Well, the word
you're looking for is extortion,

1070
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,656
not blackmail,

1071
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,158
and I'm not going to comment
on that accusation.

1072
00:45:06,243 --> 00:45:09,078
But as for your choices,

1073
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:11,113
you made those
all by yourself.

1074
00:45:11,164 --> 00:45:12,415
So don't come crying
to me.

1075
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:16,952
This is a copy of the letter you
wrote to the district attorney

1076
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:19,338
when you threatened
to expose me.

1077
00:45:19,423 --> 00:45:21,424
Expose you?
For what?

1078
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:22,755
I never wrote
a letter like that.

1079
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:25,227
I'm not recording you.

1080
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:26,679
I don't need
to record you.

1081
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:29,432
This letter was printed
from your hard drive,

1082
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:32,301
which has your computer's
digital signature.

1083
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,773
What do you want?

1084
00:45:37,824 --> 00:45:39,275
I wanna know,
if you had the chance,

1085
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:40,642
would you have traded
that car

1086
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,111
to get your parents
back together?

1087
00:45:43,313 --> 00:45:44,747
That's a stupid
goddamn question,

1088
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:46,031
and you know it.

1089
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:48,584
I never had that chance,
so what does it matter?

1090
00:45:48,651 --> 00:45:51,003
Because I do.

1091
00:45:51,088 --> 00:45:54,623
What do I want?

1092
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:56,876
I wanna give
this office back.

1093
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,462
I didn't earn it,
I don't want it,

1094
00:45:59,513 --> 00:46:01,593
and if there's a chance
it'll help Harvey forgive me,

1095
00:46:01,631 --> 00:46:03,599
I'm gonna take it.

1096
00:46:07,104 --> 00:46:09,555
Oh, and, uh,

1097
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:12,775
if you ever do
send that letter,

1098
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:15,778
you're in the same boat
as me.

1099
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:30,192
Harvey,
you're looking determined.

1100
00:46:30,243 --> 00:46:32,828
- I am.
- What can I do for you?

1101
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:35,881
Look, I know
we had an arrangement,

1102
00:46:35,966 --> 00:46:37,216
but I came here
to change it.

1103
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,217
Change it?

1104
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:39,969
But you might not even win.

1105
00:46:40,036 --> 00:46:42,638
I've just heard about
this new special prosecutor.

1106
00:46:42,705 --> 00:46:44,840
Relax, the case
was always gonna be hard.

1107
00:46:44,891 --> 00:46:46,142
It just got
a little harder.

1108
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:47,476
Because you made it
that way.

1109
00:46:47,544 --> 00:46:48,811
That's my problem.

1110
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:51,013
And now you're using
that increased difficulty

1111
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:52,714
to renegotiate our deal.

1112
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:56,652
That's your problem.

1113
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,989
We both know
how important Ava is to you.

1114
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:02,775
What do you want?

1115
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:04,693
I don't wanna run
from a fight.

1116
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:06,328
Meaning?

1117
00:47:06,396 --> 00:47:07,329
I win,

1118
00:47:07,397 --> 00:47:09,865
you don't fire me,

1119
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:13,402
you back me
for managing partner.

1120
00:47:13,453 --> 00:47:16,905
You want
to take down Jessica.

1121
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:18,697
Yes, I do.

1122
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:23,698
