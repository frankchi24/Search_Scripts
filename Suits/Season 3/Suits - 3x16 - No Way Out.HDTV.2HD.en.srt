1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,614
- I wanna go legit.
- You can't.

2
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:04,516
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,621
and just put me in there
just like she did with Harvard.

4
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,206
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

5
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,758
you don't move
the goddamn body.

6
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:11,659
Harvey, I'm stuck.

7
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,928
I can't live my whole life
like this.

8
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:15,297
We're investment bankers.

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,498
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,767
Just admit it,
you want me to take the job,

11
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:20,018
but you're too afraid
to say it.

12
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:21,669
I want you to take the job.

13
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,005
You and your associate
conspired with Harold Gunderson

14
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:26,057
to file a lawsuit
against your own clients.

15
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:27,475
That is a bribe.

16
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:28,893
Quelling knows
about your bullshit lawsuit

17
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:29,894
with Harold Gunderson.

18
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:31,479
You need to call
Lola Jensen.

19
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,198
You said it yourself,
hacking into the bar

20
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:34,949
is twice the crime
I've been committing.

21
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:37,152
I am telling you
Quelling is on the trail,

22
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,953
and you quitting
isn't gonna change that.

23
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:40,155
You're letting Mike
walk out the door

24
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,289
without trying to stop him,

25
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:42,624
and anytime I ask you
about anything

26
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:45,577
all you say is,
"I can't talk about it."

27
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,195
Mike is gone, Harvey.

28
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,363
The jeopardy's gone too.

29
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:49,664
And now you wanna tell someone

30
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,966
who keeps finding a reason
to be pissed at you,

31
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,968
and it's not the third time,
and it's not the fifth time,

32
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,387
and it's not the last time.

33
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:56,971
You took money
from our client's competitors

34
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,706
to trump up
your bullshit suit.

35
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,041
The penalty
is being disbarred.

36
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,394
Being a lawyer
is what I am.

37
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:03,978
And if you take that away--

38
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:04,979
It's up to you.

39
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:06,681
I'll drop the suit.

40
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:09,184
I'm officially a member
of the New York bar.

41
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,551
You went to Lola?

42
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,355
I want to stay.

43
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:21,413
I'd bring in champagne,

44
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:22,747
but after
all we've been through,

45
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,283
I think scotch
seems more appropriate.

46
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:27,285
Does it?

47
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,589
Harvey, we've had
this conversation once.

48
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,341
If you want someone
who doesn't speak their mind,

49
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,510
I'm not that person.

50
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:36,761
I know.

51
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,881
And Mike staying
doesn't change my opinion.

52
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,717
Telling Scottie about him
is a mistake.

53
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,470
I know.

54
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:46,921
Then why are you
being so quiet?

55
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,474
Someone who keeps finding
a way to be pissed at me,

56
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:51,476
and it's not the third time
or the fifth time

57
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,861
or the last time.

58
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,280
- I wasn't gonna say that.
- Yeah, well, you did.

59
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:56,948
Because you forced it
out of me.

60
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:01,903
Donna, do you want me
and Scottie to succeed or not?

61
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,905
I want you to be happy.

62
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,957
- That's an evasive answer.
- No, it isn't.

63
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,910
Just isn't up to me
to decide what that means.

64
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:15,333
Now are we gonna drink
to Mike staying or what?

65
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,752
Give me that.

66
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,838
Not that one.

67
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:20,922
The bigger one.

68
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,123
Seriously?

69
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,625
[Glasses clink]

70
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,805
- Hey.
- Hey.

71
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,307
I'm so glad you're home.

72
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:41,493
I made dinner
because I want to celebrate.

73
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:45,113
I'm not taking the job.

74
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,197
What?

75
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:47,949
I went to see Harvey,

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,151
and, um...

77
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,253
I told him that I'm staying.

78
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:58,092
What about the fact
that it was eating you up?

79
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,161
Look, Rachel, I know
this isn't what you wanted.

80
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,329
What I wanted?

81
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,181
I didn't wanna give you
my opinion at all,

82
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:04,549
but you forced it out of me,

83
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,718
and then you told me that you
were gonna take the job.

84
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:07,802
Okay, Rachel--

85
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,053
No, and now
you come in here,

86
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,438
and you tell me
you're gonna stay a fraud.

87
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,190
- A lawyer.
- A fraud.

88
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,612
What happened
to accepting me for who I am?

89
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,315
What happened
to you taking the job?

90
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,287
It was a way out.

91
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:28,373
You said you were afraid
if you told me your opinion,

92
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,074
I'd hold it against you,

93
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,912
but now that I'm not doing
what you told me to,

94
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,129
you're holding it
against me.

95
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:36,130
I am.

96
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:37,549
Yeah, that's not fair.

97
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,417
I wanna know what changed

98
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,369
from when you told me you were
gonna take the job to now.

99
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,704
I went to see Quelling.

100
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,889
He once had
an offer on the table

101
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,975
that would change his life,

102
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,309
and he turned it down

103
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:51,312
because he wanted to do
what was right for his clients.

104
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,648
Cost him everything.

105
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:55,266
The only thing
it didn't cost him

106
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,218
was his ability
to practice law.

107
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,820
And I didn't want
to take it away from him

108
00:03:58,887 --> 00:03:59,887
just like I don't wanna
take it away from me.

109
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,939
Mike.

110
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:04,108
You said that staying
is eating me up,

111
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:06,995
but the thought of going
is eating me up more.

112
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:12,367
I'm just--I'm not ready
to leave, Rachel.

a few questions.

Who's "we"?

What can I help you with?

We'd prefer to have
this conversation in private.

- Prefer?
- Insist.

123
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,660
I know we got in a fight,

124
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:58,830
but drinking before 10:00 a.m.,
is that really the answer?

140
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,467
I didn't tell her
about Mike.

00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,571
Well, not on your own anyway.

164
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:49,056
Is there a question?

165
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,224
Come on,
you're a bright young man.

166
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,226
You see where I'm going.

167
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,996
I don't want the dealer.

168
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:56,914
I want the supplier.

169
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,866
Harvey Specter.

170
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:03,621
Roll over on him,
I'll cut a deal right now.

181
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,267
Harvey Specter.
I represent Mike Ross.

182
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:45,601
Sir, you can't
go back there.

183
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:47,486
Sir!

184
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,360
Well, hey there.

185
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:56,612
Are you charging him?

186
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:58,414
- Not at the moment.
- Then he's coming with me.

187
00:07:58,481 --> 00:07:59,999
And you had no right
to bring him in.

188
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,784
I had every right
to bring him in,

189
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,086
but it doesn't matter
'cause he came in voluntarily.

190
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:05,504
And he's leaving
immediately.

191
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:07,089
We were just having
a friendly conversation

192
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:08,541
about the witnesses
who suddenly fell out

193
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,510
of the Ava Hessington case.

194
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,379
Seems your associate
was a little chummy

195
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:15,598
with the associate
at Bratton Gould.

196
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,634
Harvey Gunderson,
I think, is his name.

197
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:21,304
Harold Gunderson.

198
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:23,356
You're right.

199
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,274
You're Harvey.

200
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:26,976
I gotta keep this
all straight in my head

201
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:28,477
before I make my case.

202
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,863
Because once
we bring Harold in,

203
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:32,448
he'll point
the finger at Mike,

204
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,033
who will then
have no choice

205
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:37,519
but to bring it right home
to you, Harvey.

206
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:40,373
I promise I won't forget
your name again.

207
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:42,959
Open that door.

208
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:49,882
Good talking to you, Mike.
Hope it's the first of many.

209
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:53,252
Jessica,
I have some dire news.

210
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:55,054
I was just walking
by the conference room,

211
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:57,306
and I saw Max Pollard
sitting there all by himself.

212
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,540
Harvey was a no-show?

213
00:08:58,592 --> 00:08:59,809
Don't worry,
I took care of everything,

214
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,927
but it's not like Harvey
to miss a meeting.

215
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:03,562
Thank you, Louis.
I'll look into it.

216
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:04,764
You see,
that's just it.

217
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,715
I think something
might be wrong with him.

218
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,601
You mean like he's a spy?

219
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,436
No, Jessica, listen.

220
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,221
Ever since my heart attack,

221
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:13,572
I've been worrying
about other people's health.

222
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:15,157
And I'd ask Donna,
but I don't wanna burden her

223
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,525
with the knowledge
of his mortality.

224
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:18,327
You don't think
Donna knows Harvey can die?

225
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:19,612
Look, Jessica, I know

226
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,897
Harvey appears to be lean
and relatively fit,

227
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:24,083
but coronary disease can strike
even the most handsome.

228
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,534
Louis, listen to me.

229
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,204
Harvey isn't sick.
He didn't have a heart attack.

230
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:29,455
And if he missed
that meeting,

231
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,842
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

232
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:33,959
I'm sure you're right.

233
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:35,094
I'm gonna go check
my blood pressure.

234
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:37,263
Oh, good idea.

235
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,939
Where the hell is Harvey?

236
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:48,441
Is he supposed to be
somewhere he's not?

237
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:51,027
Donna, no games.

238
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:52,895
He missed a meeting
with a longtime client,

239
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:55,398
so either you screwed up,
which you never do,

240
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,150
or there's an emergency
I'm not being told about.

241
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:59,201
Both.

242
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,153
Meaning?

243
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:03,605
I forgot
to cancel that meeting

244
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,291
because there's
an emergency.

245
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:05,241
What is it?

246
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,914
Mike Ross got called in
for questioning this morning.

247
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:16,469
Sorry about this, Harvey.

248
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:18,137
Could have been worse.

249
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:19,922
You thought they had me
for being a fraud?

250
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,140
Well, I didn't think
they had you

251
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:22,758
for overdue library books.

252
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:24,477
Why'd you go with them
in the first place?

253
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:25,811
Didn't your grandmother
ever teach you

254
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,346
not to get into cars
with strangers?

255
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:28,597
I was being cooperative.

256
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:30,683
Well, don't do that again.

257
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,234
Goddamn Quelling.

258
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:33,486
He didn't just
hand us to the bar.

259
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,154
He went
to the Justice Department.

260
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:36,522
I can't believe it.

261
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:38,357
I looked him in the eye.
He gave me his word.

262
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:41,026
Screw that guy.
I'm turning him into the bar.

263
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:42,995
Right now
he's not our problem.

264
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,447
Harold is.

265
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:45,581
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

266
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,283
Not a chance.

267
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,484
Harvey, they haven't
brought him in yet.

268
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:49,418
All I need
is five minutes to tell him--

269
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:50,819
To stick to your story?

270
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:53,089
That's exactly why they
haven't brought him in yet.

271
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:54,507
You talk to Harold,

272
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,824
they'll be watching,
we'll be done.

273
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:57,593
If we don't talk to him
before this Woodall guy

274
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,161
gets him in the room,
we're in deep shit.

275
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:02,214
Then we need to talk to him
without talking to him.

276
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:15,528
Allison Holt.

277
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:18,197
Harvey Specter.

278
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:20,816
Can't say I'm surprised
to see you.

279
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:23,018
So I assume that means you've
spoken to the U.S. Attorney.

280
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:24,153
I have.

281
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:25,204
Then I suggest
we make sure

282
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:26,405
we're on the same page.

283
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,324
Unlike you,
I don't automatically

284
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,127
protect someone who may have
jeopardized my firm.

285
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:33,662
What exactly did you say
when Woodall came to you?

286
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,748
He didn't come to me.
I went to him.

287
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,133
What?

288
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,717
A man named James Quelling
came at me,

289
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:41,137
questioning the settlement
between Harold Gunderson,

290
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:43,472
Mike Ross,
and your murder witnesses.

291
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,591
So you go straight
to the U.S. Attorney?

292
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:46,725
My integrity was questioned.

293
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,977
First step
isn't to go to the person

294
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:50,229
I'm accused of colluding with
to cover it up.

295
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,713
Answer me one thing--

296
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:53,566
does Harold Gunderson know
what's going on?

297
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,683
I don't know
what he knows,

298
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,902
and, frankly,
I don't care.

299
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:59,905
I fired Harold Gunderson
an hour ago.

300
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,781
Can I talk to you
for a second?

301
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:11,617
Of course.

302
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:18,073
I just got
taken downtown.

303
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,575
What?

304
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,344
The U.S. Attorney's office
brought me in for questioning.

305
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:26,465
I thought it was about me,
but it wasn't.

306
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,583
[Exhales]
Thank God.

307
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:28,851
No, Rachel,
it's still bad.

308
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,052
They're looking
into the settlement

309
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:32,137
that I made with Harold
before Ava's trial.

310
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:34,356
That deal
wasn't exactly legitimate.

311
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:37,943
And they want me
to turn on Harvey.

312
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:39,528
I knew you should have
taken that job.

313
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:40,613
This has nothing
to do with that.

314
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:41,614
Doesn't it?

315
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:43,115
If you weren't working here,

316
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,267
they wouldn't be able
to use your relationship

317
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:46,452
with Harvey as leverage.

318
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:47,703
You think
I would turn my back on him

319
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,371
even if I wasn't
working here?

320
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,939
I don't think you'd ever
turn your back on Harvey.

321
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,291
That's the problem.

322
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,827
- What does that mean?
- Harvey wanted you to stay.

323
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,795
I wanted you to leave.
You chose to stay.

324
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,298
So your priorities,
they seem pretty clear to me.

325
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:03,168
- Rachel, come on.
- Hey, wait a minute

326
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:04,453
if they charge you
with something,

327
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:05,671
they're gonna go
through your records,

328
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:07,139
and they are going
to realize

329
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:10,142
that you're not
a member of the bar.

330
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:14,179
No, they won't.

331
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:24,156
What are you talking about?

332
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,858
I had Lola Jensen
hack into the bar

333
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:29,328
and put me
in their records.

334
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:31,914
And when were
you going to tell me?

335
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:33,532
I was going to tell you
everything last night,

336
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:35,501
but you didn't exactly seem
like you were in the mood.

337
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:38,987
Oh, I'm not
in the mood right now either.

338
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,205
I am gonna go outside
and get some air.

339
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,757
Why don't you just stay here
and figure out

340
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,092
if there's some other crime
you can commit

341
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,345
to get out of this one?

342
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,775
You should have called me
the minute this went down.

343
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,993
There wasn't time.

344
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,595
You had time
to see Allison Holt.

345
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,263
I was trying to get
out in front of it.

346
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:02,415
Allison Holt
isn't our problem.

347
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,917
Mike Ross is.

348
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,251
The U.S. Attorney
keeps poking around,

349
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:06,870
he's gonna find out
that his star witness

350
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,422
isn't even in the bar.
No, he won't.

351
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:11,624
If they look in the bar,
they'll find Mike Ross

352
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,711
listed as a member.

353
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:16,963
You had him
commit another felony?

354
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:18,631
You want me
to say that out loud?

355
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:21,918
No, I don't.

356
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:23,686
I'd rather get back
to the matter at hand.

357
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:26,106
We need to make sure
Harold Gunderson doesn't talk.

358
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,390
Then you need
to learn more

359
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,025
about the man
who's trying to make him talk,

360
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:32,112
because he's coming for you,
and you don't know who he is,

361
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,563
what he'll do,
or what he's got.

362
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:34,864
I know one thing--

363
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,099
if he had
any kind of proof,

364
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,234
someone here would have
already been arrested.

365
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:41,270
Arrested?
For what?

366
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:42,956
We're being investigated
for the settlement

367
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,658
between us and Bratton Gould
in the Hessington case.

368
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:46,876
Quelling didn't go away?

369
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,461
Quelling threatened
to go to the bar.

370
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:51,331
This is
the U.S. Attorney's office.

371
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:54,417
Well, that only matters
if the allegations have merit.

372
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,287
I never thought
I would have to ask this,

373
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,423
but do the allegations
have merit?

374
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:01,624
We're handling this,
Scottie.

375
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:02,926
I didn't ask
who was handling it.

376
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:06,429
I asked
if they have merit.

377
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:14,070
Scottie.
Scottie.

378
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:15,304
What, are you
gonna be charming?

379
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:17,073
Quote a TV show?

380
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:18,474
What happened to
"I'm going to do better"?

381
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,410
God damn it,
I'm trying.

382
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:22,779
Harvey, I don't think you
understand what trying means.

383
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,697
You know what, Scottie?
You keep on thinking

384
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,366
that there are things
being withheld from you, but--

385
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,701
But what?
It's just business?

386
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:31,204
- It is just business.
- Fine.

387
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:33,256
As a senior partner,
I want to know

388
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,375
if this firm outright
broke any laws.

389
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,093
- Harvey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, Donna.

390
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,095
If you want me
to talk to Stephanie,

391
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:40,830
you have to tell me what you
want me to ask her right now.

392
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,632
[Sighs]

393
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:45,635
I guess it's
"not now, Scottie."

394
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,274
Mike. Mike.
I need to talk to you.

395
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,559
No, no, I can't
even be seen with you.

396
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:54,144
Go, now.
But you have to talk to me.

397
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:56,179
Allison Holt
just fired me out of the blue.

398
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,847
I'm freaking out, man.
Harold, listen to me.

399
00:15:57,898 --> 00:15:59,032
You have to calm down,
all right?

400
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:00,683
Harold Gunderson,
you're not welcome here.

401
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,152
You know what, Louis?

402
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:03,486
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now, so--

403
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:05,622
Well, I don't give a shit.
Mike, do me a favor.

404
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,292
Do not let this unappreciative
ex-employee into our offices.

405
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,961
Harold, you have to go,
right now.

406
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,997
No, wait, Mike.
Please.

407
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:15,915
I got a call
from the U.S. Attorney's office

408
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,634
asking for me to come in.

409
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,052
Somehow,
they're onto what we did,

410
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:20,053
and I think we need to--
Harold, Harold, Harold.

411
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:21,671
Harold.

412
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:23,473
All I know
about that settlement

413
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,309
is that you stuck it to us
because you saw the chance

414
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:27,644
to get back at us
for firing you.

415
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:28,728
Mike, that's not true.

416
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:30,763
I don't want
to hear it, Harold.

417
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:32,432
What you did
was harsh and vindictive,

418
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:35,902
but it was completely legal
because you initiated it.

419
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:37,770
And nobody can prove
anything other than that

420
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,523
as long as we both
remember it.

421
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:45,695
- I lost my job, Mike.
- I'm sorry about that, Harold.

422
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:48,498
I wish there was something
I could do.

423
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:49,999
Now I have to go back inside.

424
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,001
Michael Ross,
Harold Gunderson,

425
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:53,203
you're under arrest
for conspiracy

426
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:56,739
to defraud
the United States government.

427
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,770
Hey.
Thanks for meeting with me.

428
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:12,605
Donna, you can thank me
all you want.

429
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,390
I don't know anything
about Eric Woodall.

430
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,591
Stephanie, come on.

431
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,310
You know everything that goes on
in that office.

432
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,646
You just don't want
to tell me.

433
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,147
What do you want
to know?

434
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,399
Well, how about we start with
why he's coming after Harvey?

435
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,618
Because he hates
dirty lawyers.

436
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,370
He thinks
they're the scum of the earth.

437
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:28,955
And Harvey got
on his radar?

438
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,324
And the reason
Woodall's not on your radar

439
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:34,627
is because the last case he won
took him four years.

440
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,663
So you're saying
he'll stop at nothing?

441
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:38,414
Not that I've ever seen.

442
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:39,716
Then we need
to know what he's got.

443
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:41,084
No way.

444
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:42,952
I called you
when they brought your guy in.

445
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,837
I could lose my job
for that as it is.

446
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:47,790
You have something else a lot
more important than your job,

447
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,592
thanks to me.

448
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:51,561
When are you gonna stop
holding that over my head?

449
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:54,897
In another 30 seconds if you
tell me what I need to know.

450
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,301
Okay.

451
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,186
He's got nothing.

452
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:03,106
But the thing is,
he wins with nothing.

453
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:05,441
You just said
he hates dirty lawyers,

454
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:08,411
and now you're saying
he'll break the law?

455
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,813
He may, he may not.

456
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:13,950
But he'll definitely
bend the shit out of it.

457
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:16,986
I want to know
what's going on.

458
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:18,204
I told you
what's going on.

459
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,173
Harvey and I are taking care
of a situation.

460
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:23,176
That's a bullshit answer,
and you know it.

461
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,628
I don't know how it went
with you and Edward Darby,

462
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,463
but you come into my office
with that attitude,

463
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,682
and it won't go well
for you with me.

464
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:30,833
My attitude comes
from the fact

465
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:31,934
that I worked
for Edward Darby.

466
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,303
I don't want to work
for another one.

467
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,638
You're way out of line.

468
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,940
Your name is not
on the door here.

469
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,392
No, but if this all comes down
because of something

470
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:40,860
you and Harvey did,
I'm tainted by it.

471
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:45,031
Then walk away, Scottie.
I'm not stopping you.

472
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,033
No, the noncompete
you had me sign is stopping me.

473
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:49,319
Is that
what's stopping you?

474
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,571
Jessica, I moved my life
back to New York.

475
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:53,239
I don't want
to move again.

476
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:55,575
So I'm asking you
one more time--

477
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:58,211
what is going on?

478
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:05,468
What's going on,

479
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,220
is you and Harvey
made an impulsive deal

480
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:08,838
for you to come here,

481
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,089
and clearly,
it's not working out,

482
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:11,724
or you'd be having
this conversation

483
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,210
with him and not me.

484
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:20,850
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

485
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,352
I've been in here
for two hours.

486
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:23,552
You said I was under arrest,

487
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:27,390
but I still haven't
been processed.

488
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,225
I demand to call Harvey.

489
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:32,278
Sorry, we can't have that.

490
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:34,280
Then I guess you can't have
a guilty verdict against me

491
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:36,616
or anybody else,
because I know my rights.

492
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,668
Well, I'm afraid
your rights have run

493
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,671
smack into a little something
called the Patriot Act.

494
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:42,922
Whatever bullshit
you're trying to pull

495
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:44,707
only applies to terrorists.

496
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:46,259
Then it's a good thing
there are allegations

497
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:49,379
of terrorism against
those Hessington witnesses.

498
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,717
[Sighs]

499
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:57,103
You're not gonna
get away with this.

500
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:59,389
I'm not getting away
with anything.

501
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,226
I'm just being thorough by
looking into these allegations.

502
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:04,444
Try to be patient.

503
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:05,895
Maybe, uh,
think about the fact

504
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,448
that Harold Gunderson
is trying to be patient

505
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:11,317
right next door.

506
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:25,535
Pacing.
Right on schedule.

507
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,537
First sign that a man
is losing it.

508
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,289
It's called walking.

509
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:30,540
You can call it
what you want.

510
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:31,708
I know what I'm looking at.

511
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,710
Yeah.
So do I.

512
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,861
A guy who looked
into those terrorist allegations

513
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,580
and came up with nothing.

514
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:39,716
I'll admit the rumors
about those witnesses

515
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,168
were unsubstantiated.

516
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:44,053
But I'd be negligent
if I didn't look

517
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:48,207
into an American with ties
to such questionable characters.

518
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,560
And you never know
what a thorough background check

519
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:54,597
is gonna turn up.

520
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:56,015
Then go ahead.

521
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,717
Do your background check,
so I can get out of here,

522
00:20:57,768 --> 00:21:00,770
because all this is doing
is making me bored.

523
00:21:00,854 --> 00:21:03,022
Well, I can take care
of that for you.

524
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:06,025
Why don't I let you watch
a little TV?

525
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:16,619
Now, that's pacing.

526
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:27,513
Did you find out anything
useful on Eric Woodall?

527
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,383
I found out we need
to start going on offense.

528
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:32,051
How?

529
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:33,720
Donna's having Mike compile
every piece of communication

530
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,104
during that settlement
to prove

531
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,557
Harold contacted us first,
not the other way around.

532
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:40,226
- Is that true?
- You really want to know?

533
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:41,811
After that,
we're gonna read up

534
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:44,564
on every tactic Woodall used
in his last case.

535
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:45,565
Case?

536
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,650
Took him four years.

537
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,235
Dog with a bone.

538
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,237
That's why we're going
on offense.

539
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:54,157
Well, I found out
something too.

540
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:56,626
Scottie wants to leave.

541
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,994
What?

542
00:21:58,078 --> 00:22:01,280
She asked out
of her noncompete.

543
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:02,715
And what did you say?

544
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:05,001
I said I had to discuss it
with my partner.

545
00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:07,754
It would have been nice if she
discussed it with her partner.

546
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:11,557
She accused me
of some pretty shady shit.

547
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,092
And she's right.

548
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,144
What are you talking about?

549
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:18,097
I told you earlier,

550
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:21,100
I didn't want
to know about Mike and the bar,

551
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:22,602
and just now, you asked me
if I wanted to know

552
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:24,654
about Mike and Harold,
and again,

553
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:27,190
I didn't want to know.

554
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:30,993
And "I don't want to know" is
exactly what Edward Darby said.

555
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,497
We're not him.

556
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,616
Edward Darby didn't
commit those murders.

557
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,117
He just covered them up.

558
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:41,153
And it seems to me
we keep doing things,

559
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:44,657
and then we have to keep
covering them up.

560
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,293
We're not him.

561
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:48,544
Harvey.

562
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:52,799
What do you want me
to tell Scottie?

563
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,300
If she doesn't want
to be here,

564
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:56,669
let her go.

565
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,842
[Elevator dings]

566
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:04,444
What the hell
did you do?

567
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:05,561
You know what I did.

568
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:06,813
I handed you in
to the bar.

569
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:08,398
Mike Ross and I
had a deal.

570
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:10,683
Yeah, well, that deal
went away when he got brought in

571
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:12,869
for questioning
by the U.S. Attorney.

572
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:14,454
What?
That wasn't me.

573
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,822
I didn't go to them.

574
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:17,189
I don't give a shit
if you went to them or not.

575
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:19,125
This whole thing started
when you walked into my office

576
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:21,377
with a lawsuit
you were bribed to create.

577
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:23,212
And after that,
I made a deal with Mike.

578
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:24,630
And I held
to my end of the bargain.

579
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:26,082
Maybe you didn't hear me.

580
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,967
That deal went away
when they picked him up,

581
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:29,919
hauled him in,
and then tried to get him

582
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:31,304
to turn on me.

583
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:32,422
Well, you can still
stop this.

584
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:34,390
Yeah, well,
I'm not going to.

585

over your shoulder every day

Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

589

You pulled out a gun
and threatened to shoot my guy,

if you didn't mean to shoot it,

but a badass on his high horse.

but I need him to give me--
He was talking to Harold?

some idiotic fight outside.
Why?

No, it's nothing.
I have to go talk to Harvey.

Whoa, wait a second.
Harvey?

611
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:40,490
Does this have something to do
with why he missed his meeting

00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:19,662
It had everything
to do with it.

632
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:21,247
You mean you were
trying to cover your tracks.

633
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:23,366
No, we were having
a heated conversation

634
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,868
about what bullshit charges
these are.

635
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:28,337
Okay, I'm done
playing your games.

636
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:31,156
He was your only friend
at that firm, you got fired.

637
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,675
You got him another job,

638
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:35,344
and that's why you went to him
to set this whole thing up.

639
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:36,796
You've got
your information wrong.

640
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:38,347
He wasn't my friend.

641
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:39,765
I had the chance
to save his job...

642
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,101
But instead,
he threw me under the bus.

643
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:44,303
That is why I instituted
this lawsuit.

644
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:47,339
So you can take your bullshit
allegations somewhere else

645
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:49,191
because I am not
gonna roll on Harvey.

646
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,776
I'm not rolling on Mike.

647
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:55,064
And Harold is not
gonna roll on me.

648
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:58,367
You guys
are well rehearsed.

649
00:25:58,452 --> 00:25:59,902
So I'll ask you again,

650
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:02,738
is that what you were doing
on the street today?

651
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:06,993
[Sighs]

652
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:08,411
Jesus Christ, you know,
you drive like my Nana--

653
00:26:08,495 --> 00:26:10,079
he drives like my Nana,
and she's 102.

654
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:11,664
Relax, Louis.
Ray's on it.

655
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:13,833
Nobody's
getting us there faster.

656
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:15,167
I mean, I can't believe
this whole thing's been going on

657
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:16,419
and I've been
completely out of the loop.

658
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:17,753
Louis, I don't want
to rehash it.

659
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,088
Right now,
Mike's in custody.

660
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:20,423
We need to get him out.

661
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:23,259
Yeah, and you need to tell me
what the hell happened.

662
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:24,543
Are you asking
if we broke the law

663
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:26,512
when we made
that settlement with Harold?

664
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:30,483
That's exactly
what I'm asking.

665
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,485
We have exposure.

666
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:37,273
Well, then you better hope
that Ray drives

667
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:39,992
a little goddamn faster,
because you and I both know

668
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,994
what's going on in there.

669
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:47,557
Let me tell what
we're dealing with here.

670
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:53,622
Conspiring to bribe witnesses--
seven years.

671
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:56,842
You filed a sworn declaration
in support of your suit.

672
00:26:56,926 --> 00:26:59,628
That's perjury--
another two years.

673
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,963
And to top it all off,

674
00:27:01,014 --> 00:27:02,631
the money was
transferred overseas,

675
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,350
which would be--

676
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:09,638
well, you're a lawyer.
Fill in the blank.

677
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:11,557
- Wire fraud.
- Bingo.

678
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:15,177
Big winner.
And your prize is 20 more years.

679
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:18,564
And here's the thing.
I am gonna make sure

680
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:20,315
that it's not
a cushy white-collar prison.

681
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:21,483
[Car horn honking]

682
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,518
This is just ridiculous.

683
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,687
If Harold isn't broken by now,
I'll shit my pants.

684
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:27,406
If Harold's broken,
then when we get there,

685
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,393
Mike's gonna be
on his way to prison.

686
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:34,129
Someone needs to get in there
and hold his hand.

687
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:35,914
Not someone...

688
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,300
You.
Are you serious?

689
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,551
I'm the last person
in the world

690
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:42,370
that Harold Gunderson
wants to see right now.

691
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:44,506
Louis,
when we were associates,

692
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:46,141
who did you fear most?

693
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:48,477
That's easy.
My mother.

694
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:52,014
I meant in the firm.

695
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:53,548
Daniel Hardman.

696
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,566
So who would you most
want to come in

697
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:56,401
and take on Eric Woodall,

698
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:59,404
if you were in that room?

699
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:01,073
- Daniel Hardman.
- Exactly.

700
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:02,774
Look, Harold may not like you,

701
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:05,244
but he respects you,
and he's all alone.

702
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:06,528
Now, when we get there,

703
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:08,530
I need you to channel
your inner Hardman,

704
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:09,781
get him to trust you,

705
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:13,401
and then shut him
the hell up.

706
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,743
Can I talk to you
for a second?

707
00:28:21,794 --> 00:28:23,011
You look concerned.

708
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,464
[Sighs]

709
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:31,086
Do you know why I never batted
an eye when I found out

710
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:33,355
Harvey had hired a kid
who didn't go to law school?

711
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:36,058
Because you're loyal to him.

712
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,777
Because I knew
what was inside him.

713
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:40,529
And I thought if he had
a protege--

714
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:43,232
He could have hired
a protege from Harvard.

715
00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:46,368
But he wouldn't have been
forced to protect him.

716
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,705
And he wouldn't have become
the man he is today.

717
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:53,742
Well, now that protege is
in trouble.

718
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:55,160
[Sighs]

719
00:28:55,245 --> 00:28:58,163
They have Mike
and Harold Gunderson in custody.

720
00:28:59,832 --> 00:29:01,449
Then Harvey's
in trouble too.

721
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:03,451
No.

722
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:05,287
Mike would never
turn on Harvey.

723
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:07,306
You never know
what might happen to a person

724
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,092
once they get
in that room.

725
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:14,062
Not now, Scottie.

726
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,463
Donna, I'm just writing him

727
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:18,684
a note telling him
I wanted to talk.

728
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:20,686
[Scoffs]
"To talk."

729
00:29:23,306 --> 00:29:25,274
I don't think you know how hard
he's trying.

730
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,642
I know he's trying.

731
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:29,477
I'm just not sure
that it's good enough.

732
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:30,912
You knew
who he was, Scottie.

733
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,365
- And I thought he would change.
- I think he has changed,

734
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:34,366
and if it's not enough
for you, then--

735
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,584
That's not the problem.

736
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,169
I think that he's changed
too much,

737
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:40,706
and I think it happened
before I got back.

738
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,424
He's a good man, Scottie,

739
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:45,844
but he's not perfect.

740
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:47,963
Sometimes you just have to take
what you get,

741
00:29:48,014 --> 00:29:50,265
or walk away.

742
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:01,727
You know, they did
an experiment a few years back.

743
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:04,062
Took five mice,
put 'em in a cage,

744
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:08,317
fed them just enough to survive,
and you know what happened?

745
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:11,519
One by one,
they cornered the weakest mouse

746
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:14,873
and ate him alive.

747
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:17,826
You know what you're gonna be
when you get to prison, Mike?

748
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:20,162
The weakest mouse.
Bullshit.

749
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:22,197
They have done studies,
and I've read them,

750
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:23,465
and that's not what happens.

751
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,001
The only way a mouse
eats one of his own

752
00:30:26,052 --> 00:30:28,553
is if he's been contaminated
by another species.

but I'm not letting him go,

I demand to see my client,

and my client isn't Mike Ross,
it's Harold Gunderson.

00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,268
- And you are?
- Louis Litt, Pearson Specter.

769
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:36,771
You're telling me that a man
who works at the law firm

he's accused of colluding with
just happens to be his attorney?

That's exactly
what I'm saying.

772
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:43,278
- Bullshit.
- No.

773
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:44,996
What's bullshit is you thinking
it's up to you

who gets to represent
Harold Gunderson.

775

So if I walk in there
right now

776
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:50,719
and ask him who his attorney is,
he's gonna say it's you?

777
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,120
Doesn't matter
what he says.

778
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:55,090
It's 4:07, and if
you don't let me see my client,

779
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:57,726
anything he says after this
second will be inadmissible.

- Then why am I still in here?

Because we're waiting

Louis?
To do what?

Harold hates Louis!

I'm in the seventh circle
of hell.

00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,318
Well, the cavalry
has arrived.

801
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:59,738
I don't need the cavalry.
I've decided to get out.

Okay, Harold,
you cannot sign a deal.

You'll never work
as a lawyer again.

You fired me as a lawyer.

Now, you have a chance
to walk out of here today,

has ever happened,

Rachel, if this thing
moves forward to trial,

I will do everything
in my power to win.

827
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:05,253
But there's two minutes left
in the game,

828
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,305
and our star players
are on the field.

829
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,276

we just have to have faith.

We're going to be family.

834
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:25,874

family is by being with them

It's about the time I decided
to tell my dad about my mom.

You remember what I told you
about her?

847
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:03,978
- Harvey--
- I was 20,

848
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,330
out of the house,

849
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:06,981
and I told her
I would never tell him

850
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,984
as long as she never
brought anyone--

851
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:17,659
I came home to do laundry
one day, and I heard--

I heard,

853
00:35:22,214 --> 00:35:26,968
and then I saw,
and I told him that night.

854
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:34,859
Because sometimes
it's better to tell.

This whole thing
was my idea.

It's me Woodall wants.

then with Lola Jensen,

and to top it all off,

00:36:09,395 --> 00:36:11,813
we suborned perjury
with Edward Darby.

00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,806
Thank you.

946
00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:34,509
You and Louis
really came through.

947
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,979
So did you.

948
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,599
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

949
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,484
- No, you don't.
- You don't want to go to jail.

950
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:45,570
Harvey...

951
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:51,943
I sat in that room today
and listened to you tell me

952
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,995
that ever since the day
we met,

953
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:55,163
you've had to cross one line

954
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,165
after another, and--
Mike-

955
00:42:57,232 --> 00:43:00,668
No, just...
Let me finish.

956
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:04,922
First there was
Clifford Danner,

957
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:06,924
then the witnesses,

958
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:09,627
then suborning perjury,
not to mention the 17 things

959
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:14,682
we did to stop the merger
in the first place.

960
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,350
All of it,
since you hired me.

961
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:19,053
Look, that's not
what I said.

962
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:20,421
Yes, it is.

963
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,590
[Sighs] I wasn't blaming you
for those things.

964
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,592
It doesn't matter.

965
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:30,314
I'm tired of putting the people
I care about in jeopardy.

I called Jonathan Sidwell
this afternoon.

I took the job.

969
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:45,780
We just got out.

Harvey...

You're a good man, Harvey.

Thanks.

977
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,843
Hey, when's your last day?

978
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:33,494
I don't know.
Why?

979
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,046
Well, I want to take you out
to dinner, you know?

980
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,597
I'm not gonna see you anymore.

I don't think you realize,
but I'm not exactly leaving.

Sidwell.
You're a client.

983
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:47,675
Which means technically,
you work for me now.

984
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,694
No, I don't.

985

"No, I don't, boss."

- Don't even try it.
- Or "sir."

987
00:44:52,698 --> 00:44:54,115
Whichever feels
least comfortable.

988
00:44:54,182 --> 00:44:56,234
You know,
since I'm working alone now,

989
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,202
I guess
that makes me Superman.

990
00:44:58,287 --> 00:45:01,289
Or Aquaman, seeing
as you're in over your head.
