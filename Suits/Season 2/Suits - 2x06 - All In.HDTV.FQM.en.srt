he'd stay out of trouble.

Explain to me,
how you sell your company

183
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,888
on a cocktail napkin
at a poker table.

184
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:39,989
I didn't sell it.

00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:42,792
I just put it up
as collateral.

186
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,461
On a cocktail napkin
at a poker table.

187
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,897
I had aces
full of kings.

Come on, you saw it.
It was bullshit.

The guy rivered me.
No, what's bullshit is,

191
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,404
you should have
never been at that table

192
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,506
in the first place,
much less drunk at that table.

193
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,007
I gave
the keynote speech, Harvey.

194
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:01,511
They toasted me.
I had...one drink.

195
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,246
You're an alcoholic
at a casino.

196
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:04,747
You don't get any drinks.

197
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:07,817
I'm not an alcoholic.
I'm a compulsive gambler.

And those dots
aren't connected?

199
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:11,988
Let me explain.
You had a drink.

200
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:14,023
You gambled.
You lost your company.

201
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,260
I know, it was stupid.
Is there anything we can do?

202
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,261
What I should do
is walk through that door

203
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:19,262
and make you
live with this.

Well, you won't,
will you?

Because you owe me.

What exactly
was on the napkin?

I don't
remember exactly,

208
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:34,911
but the deal was,
he was gonna give me

209
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,579
$3 million
to back my bet,

210
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,448
and when I won,
I'd give him his money back

211
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:40,283
with an extra $1/2 million.

212
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,418
And if you lost,
he'd just get the company.

actress in Hollywood.

266
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:51,414
That's because
his napkin didn't meet

00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,883
the minimum requirements
of a contract.

was written
on the napkin?

'Cause no matter
what it was written on,

- Jessica.
- Where are you?

322
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,866
- In a meeting.
- Do people often yell

323
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,202
"I hit the jackpot"
in your meetings?

324

If you know where I am,
why are you asking?

325
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,074
Because the answer tells me
I should be worried.

326
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:00,643
It's just poker.

327

Harvey, I know
losing Donna's been hard.

I'm fine.

You haven't hired

She's irreplaceable.

- I'm assigning you a temp.
- Excellent.

That motion's a slam dunk,

my headache wasn't big enough.

it was a formality.

Well, you know what
they say about assuming.

These allegations
are serious.

I know
how serious they are,

365
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:44,713
and I also know how important
this case is to your firm.

366
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,315
Then you also know that,
until proven,

367
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:49,552
they have no business being
placed in public record.

I see what you're saying.

Humiliating someone for no good
reason doesn't seem fair.

No, not at all.

372
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,167
I just happen to be
of the opinion

373
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:07,303
that trials
are about truth.

374
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,806

will get what's coming to them.

I'm not clear on.

00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,499
Go through
the security footage

379
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,267
and count the number
of drinks Keith had.

380
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:36,771
We establish his state of mind,
then file a motion to dismiss.

How hard is that?
Not the thing I'm unclear on.

I don't have time to explain
where babies come from.

How exactly did you
get this footage?

384
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:43,778
Head of security
owed me one.

385
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,279
Which brings me
to my next question:

386
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,982
Everyone always owes you one,
but Keith says you owe him one.

387
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,517
Why?
Why don't you just ask him?

388
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,452
- I did. He wouldn't tell me.
- Exactly.

389
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,521
Because if he had,
I wouldn't owe him one anymore.

their success to ballet

00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:35,876
Drink number 15.

476
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:38,278
Your client?
That's awful.

477
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,346
No, no, no,
it's good.

478
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:40,447
We're even
putting him in rehab

479
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,715
to help
nullify his contract.

480
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:42,883
Touching.

481
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:45,586
Harvey truly cares
about his clients.

482
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:46,854
Uhuhuh, my idea.

483
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,123
Well, you're really
coming along.

484
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,358
What are you
doing here so late?

485
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:52,593
Working with Louis.

486
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,996
I'm sorry?
With Louis?

487
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,765
Associate work.

488
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:02,236
He, um...he replaced
Harold with me.

489
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,340
Good for you.

490
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,542
Looks like you're
really coming along.

491
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,879
Thank you, Mike.

492
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,687
And that was
the last drink of the night.

493
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:23,157
16 drinks in 11 hours

494
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,892
in a 180-pound man,

495
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,428
and that's a blood
alcohol level of .16%,

496
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,196
double the legal limit.

497
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:31,565
Your Honor, you've heard
the expression "beer goggles."

498
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,401
Well, when my client was looking
at that dirty napkin,

499
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,970
all he saw
was Angelina Jolie.

500
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,574
Your Honor, my client
entered into a contract

501
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:41,842
with a man that was
aware enough to realize

502
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,410
that he had a good hand,

503
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,512
aware enough
to ask for help,

504
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,014
aware enough to sign
a piece of paper

505
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:49,850
for the sole purpose of winning
a large pot of money,

506
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,318
and now he's mad
he lost.

507
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,787
Our client has
a history of drinking

508
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,556
and has agreed
to be placed into rehab.

509
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,958
That has nothing
to do with this.

510
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:59,560
That tape clearly shows
that Keith didn't

511
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:02,062
make any of those decisions
while he was sober.

512
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,965
Maybe not.
But you did.

513
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,333
What?

514
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,868
The next morning,
you came to my client

515
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,170
and offered to pay him what
you'd owed him if you'd won.

516
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,271
I don't care
what he says

517
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,873
about his client's
state of mind,

518
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:15,409
he was stone-cold sober.
Which clearly demonstrates

519
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:17,644
they were perfectly happy
with the terms of the contract.

520
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:19,613
Your Honor,
those were settlement talks,

521
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:21,915
not subject
to disclosure here.

522
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:23,484
Mr. Specter,
you're asking me

523
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,919
to dismiss this contract
without a trial.

524
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,755
Let's have it.

525
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,458
Yes, I made an offer.

526
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:34,695
Then I'm sorry, counselor,
I'm not ruling for dismissal.

527
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,797
This goes forward
to trial.

528
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,402
This guy is
pissing me off.

529
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:50,604
Yeah, he's really good.
Kind of inspiring, actually.

530
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:51,805
You trying
to piss me off more?

531
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,274
Yeah, it focuses you.
It's what you do to me.

532
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:55,442
Yeah, I do that
because you don't have

533
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,878
a natural killer instinct.
Yes, I do.

534
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,379
Good, because
I need you to use it.

535
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:00,681
See what I did there?

536
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,049
Yeah.
What's our end game?

537
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:03,951
Interim control
of the company.

538
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,819
Possession is
9/10 of the law.

539
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:07,621
Whoever is in control
in the interim

540
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,389
is likely to be
in control in the end.

541
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:10,457
Plus, if we're
in the driver's seat,

542
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:11,959
we can drag
this trial out forever.

543
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,727
And we can do anything
we want in the meantime.

544
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:14,995
By the time
this is over,

545
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:17,264
he won't even get back
his $3 million in chips.

546
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:18,365
What do you
need me to do?

547
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,599
Find out everything
there is to know

548
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,767
about this Tommy guy

549
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,502
and get his ass in here
for a deposition.

550
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,706
On it.

551
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,808
Louis,
I finished.

552
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,977
You were here all night?

553
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,445
You said you wanted everything
by this morning,

554
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:33,680
so here's everything
on the lease agreements

555
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:35,148
and all of the financials.

556
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:37,484
Oh, no, Sergei waltzed me
through the financials earlier.

557
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:38,885
Did you know that
he danced with Nureyev?

558
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:41,888
I did.
Um, also...

559
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:44,858
I found this.

560
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,997
Lead paint?

561
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:52,666
Okay, this is...
excellent.

562
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:54,768
- You can use it?
- "Use it"?

563
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:58,038
We are gonna pas de deux
all over their asses with it.

564
00:22:58,106 --> 00:23:00,040
"We"?

565
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:06,546
- Get out.
- Okay.

566
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:12,986
[Indistinct chatter]

567
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:21,561
Here to buy me
a drink?

568
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:23,363
That didn't go so well
for me last time.

569
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:26,566
No. No, I'm here
same as everyone else,

570
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:29,369
to contribute to
your reelection campaign.

571
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:30,637
Actually, I already did.

572
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:33,607
Pearson Hardman is
now a platinum-level donor.

573
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:35,976
Go, Follman.

574
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:37,744
I know
what you're doing.

575
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:39,479
Of course, you don't have
to disclose this,

576
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:40,814
and neither do we,

577
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:44,684
but I am of the opinion
that elections are about truth,

578
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:46,920
and truth
requires openness.

579
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,724
You think
you can get me to recuse

580
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,726
by implying
a conflict of interest?

581
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,094
You know,
I hadn't thought of that.

582
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:55,996
I'll simply
return the money.

583
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:57,531
That is certainly
your prerogative.

584
00:23:57,598 --> 00:24:01,401
But it could look like
you took money for favors

585
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:03,770
and then got scared.

586
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,906
No one forced liquor
down your throat, Ella.

587
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:09,042
You got drunk,
we played a bad joke,

588
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,411
but that was
a long time ago.

589
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:14,047
You know, a man's reputation
is at stake,

590
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:17,184
and I'm not
joking with you now.

591
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,686
Cheers.

592
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:27,761
Lastly, section 5,
page 30 states

593
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,096
that the Royal Hall
is responsible

594
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,298
for all maintenance and repairs
of the rehearsal space.

595
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:32,966
I'm aware of what
the lease says, Mr. Litt,

596
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:34,267
having drafted it myself.

597
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:35,735
Okay, well, then
how do you explain this?

598
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:37,304
The Royal Hall's
knowing failure to fix

599
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:40,574
the air conditioning system
has created a toxic environment.

600
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,975
Lead-based paint.

601
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:44,811
See, your disregard
for the safety of your charges

602
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,114
takes it from a tenant dispute
to a criminal action,

603
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,248
a fact that
I will happily bring

604
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:49,449
to the attention
of the district attorney

605
00:24:49,517 --> 00:24:51,451
unless repairs
are made yesterday.

606
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,920
Then you'll be exposing
the ballet itself

607
00:24:53,988 --> 00:24:56,590
because the terms require
they cover all repairs

608
00:24:56,657 --> 00:25:00,494
from a special fund they
stopped paying into a year ago.

609
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,295
No, no, no, no, payments have
been going out every month.

610
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:03,864
Then perhaps
you should figure out

611
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:07,434
where they've been going in
because it's not here.

612
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,770
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

613
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:12,639
Our financial records say--
Mr. Litt,

614
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:14,207
we were willing
to look the other way,

615
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,643
but since you have come in here
and threatened me,

616
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:19,546
I'm going to take
legal action of my own.

617
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:21,548
We'll be filing
for eviction.

618
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:23,550
It's time
the ballet moves on.

619
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:35,896
Can you tell me what
this is exactly, Mr. Walsh?

620
00:25:35,963 --> 00:25:37,164
I don't know.

621
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:38,498
If I told you
it was a yaw drive,

622
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:41,134
would that mean
anything to you?

623
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,538
A yaw drive keeps the rotor
facing the right way,

624
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:46,106
even when
the wind direction changes.

625
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:49,442
If you have a problem with this,
you're not getting any power.

626
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,244
I'm sorry, where exactly
did you study engineering?

627
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:52,779
I didn't.

628
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:55,415
But you're suggesting that
you can run an energy company.

629
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:57,017
My client's
gonna be running it,

630
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,685
not designing parts.

631
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,754
Well, does your client
have any idea

632
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:05,158
how to protect the company
from the numerous allegations

633
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:06,927
made by the Jarvis
Homeowners Association?

634
00:26:06,994 --> 00:26:08,428
Are you even
aware of these allegations?

635
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,197
I haven't taken over
the company yet, Mr. Specter.

636
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,132
Well, let me explain
something to you.

637
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,501
My client's company
needs to remain viable

638
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:15,936
during the course
of this trial,

639
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:19,039
and these allegations are
a threat to its very existence.

640
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,007
And I don't think someone
who doesn't know the difference

641
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:23,210
between a yaw drive
and a carburetor

642
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,378
is the man for the job.
He's right.

643
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:27,547
I don't know
anything about energy.

644
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,015
And I'll tell you
something else:

645
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,018
I also know very little
about ice cream.

646
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:34,087
Yeah, I mean,
I enjoy vanilla,

647
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:35,989
but beyond that,
nothing.

648
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:37,891
Vanilla...
could've guessed.

649
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,960
I assume
you have a point.

650
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:41,595
I don't know anything
about any of the companies

651
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:42,862
that I've turned around.

652
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,899
But I don't have to
because I hire experts

653
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,968
to advise me
on operating them.

654
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,470
And the one thing all
these experts have in common

655
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:52,539
is that none of them
has a drinking problem.

656
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:54,541
- Your Honor--
- He raised the issue.

657
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,810
His client--
and I quote--

658
00:26:56,877 --> 00:26:59,145
"has a history of drinking"
and was, in fact,

659
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,881
so intoxicated that night
that his own lawyers

660
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:04,884
had to place him to rehab.
He disputed that.

661
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:06,553
That is not
the subject of this hearing.

662
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:08,488
- Your Honor, he's trying to--
- I know what he's trying to do.

663
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:10,523
He's using
your words against you.

664
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,859
But they are your words,
Mr. Specter.

665
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:16,429
The issue of the napkin contract
will be heard at trial,

666
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:19,266
but in the interim,
Thomas Walsh

667
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,469
will assume control
of the company.

668
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,206
Thank you.

669
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:35,504
This is just wrong.

670
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:37,006
I know, this ruling
doesn't make any sense.

671
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,774
No, I meant this.

672
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:40,609
- The hot dog is wrong?
- It's a truck.

673
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:41,944
This is New York.

674
00:27:42,012 --> 00:27:45,448
I want a cart, a vendor,
or a vague sense of danger,

675
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,349
that the hot dog might
be made of anything.

676
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,784
Okay, well, I think
I saw some cats

677
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:49,985
lurking out
behind the truck.

678
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:53,656
Stop trying
to make me feel better.

679
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:55,458
Not so bad.
All right, street meat,

680
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:56,592
you wanna talk
about what just happened?

681
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,860
No, I don't.

682
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,462
You said whoever's in control
in the interim--

683
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:01,931
- I know what I said.
- So what's the other 1/10?

684
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,199
What are you
talking about?

685
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,900
You said possession
is 9/10 of the law.

686
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,169
So I figure we need
the other 1/10, right?

687
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:09,071
- We're not gonna win this.
- What?

688
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:11,040
- We don't have him.
- It's a 10% chance,

689
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,042
but it's still a chance.
I mean, the odds are--

690
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,043
I'm not talking
about the odds,

691
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,745
I'm talking about the man.

692
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:16,946
Wow, I've never
heard you say

693
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:18,614
another lawyer's
better than you before.

694
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:20,483
He's not,
he's just got a better hand,

695
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,085
and he knows it.

696
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,421
- What if we play a new hand?
- I'm listening.

697
00:28:25,489 --> 00:28:27,323
You're always talking
about this gun

698
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,692
being pointed
at your head.

699
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,761
What if we take off
our jacket

700
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,964
and show them that we have
a bomb strapped to our chest?

701
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:37,166
It's a metaphor,
metaphor.

702
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,676
- You wanted to see me?
- It was Sergei.

703
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,545
He lied to me.

704
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:52,014
The money went
into his account.

705
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:53,549
There's no way
that you could have--

706
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:57,086
What, known?
It's my job to know.

707
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:00,790
God, I never take anyone
at their word.

708
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,525
You know I was
eight years old

709
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,160
when I saw him perform
<i>The Nutcracker?</i>

710
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:06,662
Eight.

711
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,432
Everybody else was into sports,
and I was this rebel,

712
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,568
gliding down my own path.

713
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,003
He inspired me.

714
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,871
That's why I'm
so light on my feet.

715
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:17,439
I just can't do it to him.

716
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:18,974
I cannot do it
to him, Rachel.

717
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,643
He <i>is</i> the ballet.

718
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,646
No, the ballet
is bigger than Sergei.

719
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,585
It embodies
our emotions,

720
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:32,755
it is breathtaking
in its beauty,

721
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:34,924
and most importantly,

722
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:37,960
it expresses what cannot
be put into words.

723
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,930
- Yes, but--
- No buts.

724
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:44,166
The Louis I know wouldn't be
defeated by something like this.

725
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:47,670
He is ruthless.
He is mean.

726
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:50,973
And if someone wronged him,
he wouldn't hesitate

727
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,976
to tear them apart
limb from limb.

728
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,154
You ruined everything.
I took your help,

729
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,188
and now we're evicted!
I want to--

730
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:07,723
Shut up, Sergei.

731
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:10,092
- How dare you?
- Me?

732
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,195
You, you brought disgrace
on my beloved ballet.

733
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,831
- I <i>am</i> the ballet.
- You were the ballet.

734
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,032
And now you're done,

735
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,868
and the Royal Hall,
they've been paid.

736
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:20,936
How?

737
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,204
I reorganized accounts,
moved money.

738
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:23,505
I did what I do.

739
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,374
I showed them how
they can pay for everything

740
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:28,410
by eliminating
your bloated salary.

741
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:31,847
[Chuckles]
Well,

742
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,315
the board would never agree,
so it's ridiculous.

743
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:35,584
Oh, please, stop.
It's why they're here, Sergei.

744
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:37,152
This isn't
about the eviction.

745
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,621
They know what you've done.

746
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,322
They want to see your face
when they tell you you're fired.

747
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,059
But I'm giving you one chance
to avoid scandal.

748
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,728
My leaving
is a scandal.

749
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:47,096
Your leaving
is a gift.

750
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:48,931
Take it before
I change my mind.

751
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:52,268
[Scoffs]

752
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,443
You wanted
to see me?

753
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,213
That was
a good speech.

754
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:07,750
Got me right here.

755
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:10,653
The only thing is,
you said, <i>"we</i> played a joke."

756
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,222
There was no "we."
It was you.

757
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,758
You targeted me.
What do you want me to say?

758
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:20,496
I was young, I was stupid,
and I'm sorry.

759
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:23,766
[Scoffs]
You were young and smart,

760
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,968
and I don't believe
you're sorry for a second

761
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:29,505
because it was no accident
that the classroom you chose

762
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:31,006
belonged to the Professor

763
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:32,808
who was conducting
the interviews

764
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,044
for the job
we both wanted.

765
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:39,915
- I had no idea.
- You sabotaged me.

766
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,451
There were
dozens of applicants.

767
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,119
No, we both know
it was you or me.

768
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,522
- I didn't know that he--
- Objection.

769
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:49,458
Bullshit.

770
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,694
What do you want, Ella?

771
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,830
I want to recuse myself.

772
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:57,266
On one condition:

773
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:01,437
Admit you know
what you did.

774
00:32:06,443 --> 00:32:08,610
I wanted that job.

775
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:10,512
I know what I did.

776
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,383
I'm not sorry
I did it.

777
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:17,786
And I'd do it again.

778
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,531
You look confused.

779
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,667
I am.

780
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:34,003
About what?

781
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,473
I...like Louis.

782
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,508
[Laughs]
Trust me, I've been there.

783
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:43,078
Doesn't last.

784
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:46,081
Oh, my God.
Is that--

785
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,119
is that Louis' dictaphone?

786
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:51,754
Oh, yeah, I needed it

787
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:54,089
to transcribe the notes
for the ballet case.

788
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:55,424
Do you have any idea
what this means?

789
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:59,395
Rachel, this is a window
into the mind of Louis Litt.

790
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:01,397
It's a dictaphone.

791
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:03,032
That he treats
like his best friend.

792
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,566
- Mike.
- Ahh--come on, gotta try it.

793
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:07,936
Goal number seven:
Perfect the British accent.

794
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:09,938
Hey, top of the morning,
mate.

795
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:11,473
Would ya like
some tea and crumpets?

796
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,641
- Yes!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

797
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,143
We really--
we really shouldn't.

798
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,278
Oh, no, but I think
we really, really should.

799
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:18,881
Come up with a catchphrase.
Injunct this.

800
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:20,482
Hey, Harold,
injunct this.

801
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,084
This is insane.

802
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:23,485
[Rewinding tape]
Insanely awesome.

803
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:24,853
You just got Litt up.

804
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,423
Excuse me, Miss Zane,
you just got Litt up.

805
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,259
- Oh, no, Rachel.
- No, no, no! Enough.

806
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:32,194
- No, you just got Litt up.
- I feel dirty.

807
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,896
Wait, wait,
this is a gold mine.

808
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:35,998
One more, come on.

809
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,267
They're settling?
You wanted that?

810
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:40,102
Wanted it?
I goddamn orchestrated it.

811
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,937
CM plays what they should have
in the first place,

812
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,372
and the suit
against us goes away.

813
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,107
And Daniel Hardman's
none the wiser.

814
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,277
Where the hell is Donna?

815
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:51,013
He recorded us.

816
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:52,714
He must have planted this
in Harvey's office.

817
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,384
No, th--
that's horrible.

818
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,019
- That's why he turned on me.
- Wait a minute.

819
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:58,487
What are you going to do?
I don't know.

820
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:01,523
But if I tell Harvey about this,
he is gonna kill Louis.

821
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:03,826
[Sighs]

822
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:05,094
Come on, let's go.
They're in the conference room.

823
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,962
- Okay.
- Everything all right?

824
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,764
Uh, yeah, no.

825
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,232
Did you get
that power of attorney?

826
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,034
Yeah. Let's go
set off that bomb.

827
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:14,036
Thanks.

828
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:21,643
By the way, where did you
find that yaw drive anyway?

829
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,481
Pulled it out
of the back of a photocopier.

830
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:28,283
Gentlemen, as you are
now in control of the company,

831
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,486
we thought it best to bring
a problem to your attention.

832
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:32,387
How selfless of you.

833
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:33,889
These are amended copies
of the allegations

834
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:36,358
against your company by the
Jarvis Homeowners Association.

835
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:38,894
Nice try.
I looked into those allegations.

836
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:41,396
Not a single expert has backed
one of their claims.

837
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:43,699
- Well, one has now.
- Keith Hoyt.

838
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:45,501
Who better to speak
to the harmful effects

839
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:48,737
than the man who designed
the wind farm himself?

840
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:50,539
No, no, if he
goes through with this,

841
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:51,974
that company
goes out of business.

842
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,642
There's no way he kills
his own company.

843
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,210
You're right,
he wouldn't.

844
00:34:55,278 --> 00:34:58,013
But I would,
and as you pointed out,

845
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,315
Keith's judgment
has been impaired lately,

846
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,483
so I convinced him
to let me

847
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:03,218
make the decisions
going forward.

848
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:05,053
I now have
power of attorney,

849
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,122
and I'd rather see
this company worth nothing

850
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,659
than let you have it.

851
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,728
- This is bullshit.
- Let him finish.

852
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:15,664
Something's coming.

853
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:17,866
We have
three choices here.

854
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:21,069
We move forward with the suit--
lose-lose--

855
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:24,506
we can give you your money back,
plus the $500,000,

856
00:35:24,574 --> 00:35:28,177
or you and I
can play poker for it.

857
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:30,179
And I'm not giving you
your money back.

858
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,253
Are you crazy?

859
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:40,155
You're gonna gamble
a man's company?

860
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,624
What, no, you're gonna
gamble for $30 million?

861
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,159
It was your idea.

862
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:46,428
No, it was my idea
to make him take the $500,000.

863
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:49,297
But it's not $500,000,
it's $3.5 million.

864
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,233
Why give him that when
I could take it for free?

865
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,801
[Sighs]

866
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:55,303
Okay.

867
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:57,105
But let me take it.

868
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:59,641
What? A minute ago,
you were ready to fold.

869
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,376
What are you gonna do
if he goes all in?

870
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:02,744
Harvey, I know
the odds of every card

871

in every hand
before it's even dealt.

872

tell me what the card is?

875
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,520
I'm gonna tell you
what it isn't.

876
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,956
It's not one of
the 52 cards in a deck

877
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:16,524
because you think
you're smarter than me.

878
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,193
It's a baseball card

879
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:22,597
or football card or...

It's the joker.

881

I told you this before.
I'm gonna tell you again.

882
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:31,273
I don't play the odds.
I play the man.

883
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,441
Well, let me
tell you one thing.

884
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:36,311
- What?
- Louis bugged your office.

885
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:39,014
He heard our whole conversation
about Tanner's lawsuit,

886
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,448
and then he ran,
and he told Hardman.

887
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:43,018
You just saying that
to make me mad, so I can focus?

888
00:36:48,924 --> 00:36:50,592
You're not the only one
who can play the man.

you can handle me?

Oh, I think
I'll be just fine.

until one of us is busted,

even if it takes all night,
but you know what?

you're looking to him.

You see,
I looked into you.

You say
you're a self-made man.

905

Your ex-wife
had a different story

when she told me
why she left you.

907

She said you had
a chip on your shoulder

908

because everything you ever got
came from daddy.

Now, you may not think
this is true anymore.

You said yourself,
you're not an expert.

and fight your battles.

to do better than that.

You're right, Tommy,
I do have you beat.

they don't have
anything to do with it.

After that, he was on tilt,
never recovered.

to bust him.

Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

want me to beat him?

That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

You took Mike
to a casino,

and two days later,
you're gambling

00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,121
with a client's
$30 million company.

933
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:34,622
I wasn't gambling,
I was playing poker.

- Harvey, save it.
- Save it?

935

Gambling is what you do when
you're playing against the house

anything about this guy.

00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:53,808
No, I did know,
and I was right.

944
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:55,176
This time.

945
00:39:55,244 --> 00:39:56,911
But you know
what else gambling

946
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,447
and what you did
have in common?

947
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:02,217
This.

948
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:03,685
You think
I didn't remember

949
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:07,455
your "Life is this,
and I like this" speech?

950
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:09,290
When you get that from your job,
it's one thing,

951
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:11,426
but then you start chasing it.
No, I wasn't chasing it.

952
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,027
We were going
to lose this in court.

953
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:15,430
- Then lose.
- No! I am not--

954
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:19,467
You're not what?
A human being?

955
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:22,537
We're people,
and sometimes we lose.

956
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:23,805
Sometimes?

957
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,306
Look, I don't
know about you,

958
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:27,442
but I feel like that's
all we've been doing lately.

959
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,045
Hardman's back, Donna's gone,
we're being sued--

960
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:33,648
I mean, we're fighting
for our goddamn lives here.

961
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:36,951
I just had a huge win,
and I am not in the mood to hear

962
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:40,622
why it might have
turned out as a loss.

963
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:44,626
Harvey...

964
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:48,329
you're right.

965
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:50,632
We are being sued,

966
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,567
and our backs
are against the wall,

967
00:40:52,635 --> 00:40:55,036
and I need to know

968
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:57,372
that this bullshit
is out of your system

969
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,674
and that you can focus.

970
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:01,376
Can you do that?

971
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:05,947
I'm focused.

972
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:22,363
I was--

973
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,399
I don't give a shit
what you were doing.

974
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:25,833
You know, Harvey, you can
make fun of me all you want,

975
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,969
but watch your tone.

976
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:36,077
What the hell
is that?

977
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,580
That's not yours.

978
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:42,216
This is a violation
of my privacy.

979
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,885
You know what,
I have a right to know

980
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:46,854
what's going on at this firm,
just as much as you.

981
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,624
Okay.
Did you tell Jessica?

982
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:51,259
There's gonna
come a day, Louis,

983
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:52,860
when I need
something from you,

984
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:56,898
and when I do, you're gonna
remember that I let this pass.

985
00:41:56,966 --> 00:42:00,134
Daniel Hardman
is not the answer.

986
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:02,904
You owe me.
