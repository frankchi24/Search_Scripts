00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:49,824
knows you're not really a lawyer
and is keeping you on anyway.

163
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:52,060
Jessica it is.

164
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:53,895
Ready to serve.

165
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:55,864
I need you on Paul Porter.

166
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,600
- The bowtie guy?
- Every case he has--

167
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,335
read, summarize,
find weaknesses.

168
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:01,503
I want to know
everything he knows.

169
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:02,737
- What, is he getting fired?
- Nope.

170
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,373
He's getting lunch.

171
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,442
So, Hardman's back.

172
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,644
It's interesting stuff, huh?

173
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,212
Lots to talk about.

174
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,481
Do you have a question,
Louis?

175
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:14,583
Yes.

176
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,687
I mean, you know Jessica.

177
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,755
That's not a question.

178
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:24,559
- She seems bothered.
- Huh. Still not a question.

179
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:26,361
Hardman was managing partner,
now she's managing partner.

180
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:27,696
Do you even know
what a question is?

181
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:29,864
Donna...look.
I need information.

182
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,033
Now I wanna know what
the whole story is

183
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,336
so I can formulate
some sort of strategy.

184
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:39,741
You mean formulate
whose ass to kiss?

185
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,676
I have two house seats
to the stage reading

186
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,446
of a new Albee play.

187
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:47,048
- Edward Albee?
- Yes.

188
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,217
Meryl Streep...
[Gasps]

189
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:52,454
and Glenn Close.

190
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,089
No!

191
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:57,692
- We can go.
- No. No.

192
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,902
I cannot tell you
what I do not know, Louis.

193
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:12,907
Okay.

194
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:16,211
Well, you know where they are.

195
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:19,447
Curtain's at 8:00.

196
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:27,422
[Clears throat]

197
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,426
[Clears throat again]

198
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:34,429
Hi.

199
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,464
Wait a minute,
I kiss you like that

200
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:38,266
and all you have
to say to me is "hi"?

201
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:39,401
Come on, admit it.

202
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:41,102
I kind of rocked your world.

203
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,607
Look, Mike,
it was a good kiss, but...

204
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,342
Oh...

205
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,645
Jenny?

206
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:55,650
We broke up.

207
00:08:55,718 --> 00:09:01,589
It turns out I kind of have
feelings for this other girl.

208
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:05,260
So...it's over?

209
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,200
Well, um,
in that case,

210
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,003
then, yes,
it was a good kiss.

211
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:20,141
But just so we're clear,
I rocked your world.

212
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:24,679
You did.

213
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,414
[Whispering] Now tell me
what would you say...

214
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,583
[Loudly]
to helping me with my work

215
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,252
in a professional capacity?

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,388
Smooth.

217
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,323
Actually, you know what,
you could.

218
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,892
I have to summarize all those
cases in bankruptcy over there.

219
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,294
It's funny because
I have to summarize

220
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,363
all of the cases at the firm.

221
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:43,865
For Hardman.

222
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,367
Ooh.

223
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,069
So you don't like him.
I don't.

224
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:52,540
You wanna tell me why
over dinner?

225
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,309
- Are you asking me out--
- On a date?

226
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,745
Yeah, I am.

227
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:57,912
To talk about Hardman?

228
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,214
Hardman who?

229
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,049
No, I wanna talk about
our kiss.

230
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:02,684
And when I say, "talk about,"
I mean repeat.

231
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,652
[Whispering]
And when I say, "kiss," I mean--

232
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,688
[loudly]
Redacting all those phone calls

233
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:07,922
in the Slessinger filing.

234
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,991
Mmhmm.
Getting better.

235
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,760
- Quick study.
- A date it is.

236
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:12,927
And by "date" I mean--

237
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:16,431
- Okay, no more of this.
- Yeah, of course.

238
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:24,105
So this is
what it's like, huh?

239
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,473
This is what what's like?

240
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,511
Being closed
by Harvey Specter.

241
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,279
I don't resent it.

242
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:32,947
It's a great meal,
great table.

243
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,150
But let's not pretend
it's not self-serving.

244
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,752
Hardman is back.

245
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,687
Jessica doesn't want
to go back to the kitchen.

246
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:42,857
Jessica Pearson
was never the "housewife."

247
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:46,027
You know where
my office is, Harvey?

248
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,695
46.

249
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:51,132
I've been knocked down
three floors in five years

250
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,034
on Jessica's watch.

251
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:54,335
We have to look into that.

252
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,937
I don't want a new office.

253
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,539
I want respect.

254
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:01,376
What you want is for someone
to help you with Madison 25.

255
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:03,411
You've done your homework.

256
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,713
You are about
to lose a huge client, Paul.

257
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:06,781
I don't want to close you.

258
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,216
Let me close him.

259
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:11,252
The problem is Tom Klapperich.
He's like you.

260
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,788
He thinks he knows
better than everyone.

261
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,890
Truth is he doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

262
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,059
He needs to declare bankruptcy

263
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,294
and he doesn't wanna
hear that.

264
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:20,662
Well, let me keep him
in the family

265
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:24,465
in exchange
for backing Jessica.

266
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,901
Well, you close him,
then we'll talk.

267
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,903
That's not so reassuring.

268
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,639
You came to me.

269
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,175
I didn't come to you.

270
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:35,710
I'll see you on the first tee.

271
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,012
No, you won't.

272
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,248
Oh, is this where
you make your threat?

273
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,517
I've had the carrot,
now I get the stick?

274
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,552
That's not my style.

275
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,955
The person you're gonna meet
on the tee is Fred Couples.

276
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,957
And just so we're clear,

277
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:52,627
that's being closed
by Harvey Specter.

278
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,120
Let's talk football.

279
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:06,114
Peyton Manning goes down
you lose your first 13 games.

280
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,228
You gotta protect your assets
and build for the future.

281
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:10,731
You don't wanna pay
28 million for a guy

282
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,333
who may not play next year.

283
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,568
So what do you do?

284
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:14,569
You move on.

285
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,337
The season isn't over,
Harvey.

286
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:18,272
You're 200 million
in the red

287
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,608
with 1/4 billion due
in two days.

288
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:24,278
Madison 25
is going to be built.

289
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:28,316
Madison 25 should be built,
but the market's changed.

290
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,318
Vacancies are up,
rents are down,

291
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:31,986
and you can't take out
a loan against your future

292
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:33,454
if the money's
never gonna flow.

293
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:35,823
It's time to protect
your franchise.

294
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,225
Really?
I should just skate

295
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,260
while the hundreds of
contractors and subcontractors

296
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,362
that I've made financial
commitments to,

297
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,664
they should just wait in line
with their hands held out,

298
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:45,333
hoping for 50¢
on the dollar?

299
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,969
They know how
the business works.

300
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:50,371
Look, I know that Paul feels
I should protect myself.

301
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:51,472
I should protect
my family business,

302
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,408
but I want to protect
my family name.

303
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:57,812
There's no shame
in declaring bankruptcy, okay?

304
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,747
It's a tool that
will allow you to survive.

305
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:02,116
Wanna know the kind of guy
I am, Harvey?

306
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,118
I'm the kind of guy,

307
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:07,755
that when the clock says,
"The game's over, take a knee,"

308
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:09,757
that's when
I throw a hail Mary.

309
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:12,927
Everybody throws a hail Mary
when they got nothing to lose.

310
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:15,296
You got something to lose.

311
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:16,931
I like long odds.

312
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,934
Let's just say,
I won't declare bankruptcy.

313
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,870
What are my other options?

314
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:25,706
I have an idea.

315
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:37,251
You were right...

316
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:38,786
about Hardman and Jessica.

317
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:42,490
- You want something from me.
- I do.

318
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,959
Mike needs an extension
on a $1/4 billion loan.

319
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,395
And you want me to believe
that you're here for Mike?

320
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:48,496
Yes.

321
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:50,665
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

322
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:53,067
Harvey needs me.

323
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:56,037
I know you're amazing
at dealing with banks, Louis.

324
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:57,305
[Laughs]
What, do you think

325
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:59,073
I'm gonna fall
for that shit?

326
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:02,510
I mean just, like, the best.

327
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:06,914
What bank?

328
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:08,382
- National Metropolitan.
- The gatekeeper?

329
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,585
Elaine Cohen?
[Chuckles] Exactly.

330
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:14,488
So, you think
you can get him in?

331
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:17,591
Well, you know
I can get him in.

332
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,494
But you also know
I can keep him out.

333
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,029
Okay, what's it gonna take?

334
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:23,664
Five details
of the Pearson Hardman divide.

335
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:25,166
- No. No.
- Three? One?

336
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:28,502
One.

337
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,859
And I get the Albee tickets.

338
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,033
We get the Albee tickets.

339
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:40,181
Tell a soul, deal's off.

340
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:45,386
Done.

341
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:46,854
I love Tom.

342
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:48,756
I love Madison 25, really.

343
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,591
But I'm afraid if you look
at the fine print,

344
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,259
the terms of the loan
are what they are,

345
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,627
and what they aren't

346
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,997
is subject to renegotiation.
Are you kidding me?

347
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,065
The terms of loans
are adjusted all the time.

348
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,134
And you can see
he has the assets.

349
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:02,303
What I see?

350
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:06,674
Is that I'm gonna have to give
you a 50% haircut on that.

351
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:08,009
That is not liquid.

352
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,177
You're never gonna
be able to sell

353
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:12,680
a minority partnership interest,
and that--

354
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:14,749
a monkey could tell
you could never monetize that.

355
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:16,517
You know what else
a monkey could tell you?

356
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:20,121
You're about to ruin a property
that will make you millions.

357
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:22,723
I'm so sorry, gentlemen,
but this is not 2007.

358
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,126
We don't play that game
anymore.

359
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,395
The days of you
high-flying people

360
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:29,163
claiming you're richer
than God

361
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:31,899
when all you're really doing is
moving assets around are over.

362
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,267
Today we're gonna take
a look up your skirt

363
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:34,802
and see what you have.

364
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,440
And I'm afraid
you don't have much.

365
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:42,843
- She actually said that?
- Yes.

366
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,045
Please don't make me
relive it.

367
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,947
As it is, I may drink a lot
on our date.

368
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,351
You know,
if we're really gonna do this,

369
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:53,988
we should probably be careful
talking about it here.

370
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,790
Oh, you're right.
Yeah.

371
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:58,192
We should definitely set some
dating ground rules.

372
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,693
You're not taking me home,
to my place or yours.

373
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:04,098
Whoa, okay, I'm not talking
about ground rules for sex.

374
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,334
I'm talking about ground rules
for keeping this thing quiet.

375
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:11,172
Oh. So you think if we went
to my place or yours,

376
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:14,075
that means sex?

377
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:17,344
Uh, no.
I mean--

378
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:19,113
you--
[Laughs]

379
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:20,614
Uh--
[Clears throat]

380
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:23,117
What I meant was that I know you
didn't want to date anyone

381
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:26,520
in the office, and I assume you
have a reason for that.

382
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:27,721
Oh, okay, there is.

383
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:30,291
There's a story.
I see it right there.

384
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,425
There's no story there.
I dated someone here once.

385
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:33,094
It didn't work out.
That's it.

386
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,429
No more questions.
Those are my ground rules.

387
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,365
Hmm, note to self:
touchy about dating history.

388
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,301
Wow, I smell pheromones
in the air.

389
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:44,672
Which suggests to me, Ms. Zane,
that you failed to grasp

390
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:46,540
the importance of the task
that I assigned.

391
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:47,775
Or unless you're done.

392
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:48,776
- Well, I--
- No?

393
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:50,277
You do realize you asked her

394
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:53,280
to summarize every case
in the firm, right?

395
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,382
I'm so sorry,
was I talking to you?

396
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,618
Because I already
did your job for you.

397
00:16:57,686 --> 00:17:00,087
Actually,
the bank didn't budge.

398
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:02,623
I got you in, Michael.

399
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,359
What, do you expect me
to do everything?

400
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:08,162
Now, do I have to gather
every first year

401
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,598
and make them stay the night
because the paralegal

402
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,600
was too busy flirting
and couldn't get it done?

403
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:17,204
Actually, all the associates
are leaving early tonight.

404
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:18,639
Excuse me?

405
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:22,309
Yeah, Hardman invited everyone
to his box at the Garden.

406
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:25,346
Springsteen.

407
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,548
The boss?

408
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:31,685
Wait, didn't he invite you?

409
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,623
You think I want to spend
my evening with a bunch of

410
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,091
douche bag associates
at a concert

411
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,294
given by a goddamn
octogenarian?

412
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,663
Get it done.

413
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:57,745
If I wanted to sink his
business to keep his business,

414
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:59,647
I could have
done that myself.

415
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:02,183
Hello, Paul.
Make yourself at home.

416
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,085
You made him think he could
risk, not just this project,

417
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:08,422
but everything he owns,
on a personal guarantee.

418
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,991
Are you crazy?
What I am, Paul,

419
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,095
is working my ass off
to make your client happy.

420
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,665
You think I haven't
tried everything

421
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:19,867
to keep
his dream alive?

422
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:21,869
The fact is, the bank
is going to foreclose.

423
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,103
Tom needs
to be protected,

424
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:26,140
and your plan
is too big a risk.

425
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,208
For you, yes,
but not for Tom,

426
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,842
and as I understand it,
we work for him.

427
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,944
[Laughing]
No, no, no, no.

428
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,213
I work for him.

429
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,281
You are working
for me.

430
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,016
I said he needed
to declare bankruptcy,

431
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:40,054
but, oh, you--
you played it your way.

432
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:44,558
Well, Jessica may give
you free rein to do that,

433
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:47,027
but I can't imagine
Hardman will.

434
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:51,699
You know, Paul, couples passed
on a little tip for you.

435
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:55,135
He said your game was weak
because you were too cautious.

436
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:58,572
I said, "It's not your game,
it's who you are."

437
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:11,585
Harvey, I may have been
knocked down to the 46th floor,

438
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,721
but bankruptcy

439
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:19,326
is on the rise.

440
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:24,431
My influence in this firm
is not nothing.

441
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:31,372
You get Tom
to sign those papers.

442
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:36,243
Is that a threat?

443
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:38,212
I don't make threats.

444
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,149
I just do
what I do.

445
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,773
You find anything?

446
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:01,642
Oh, I'm gonna make
Paul love you.

447
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,777
That's doubtful. He got wind
of our little maneuver.

448
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:04,945
- [Laughs]
- What?

449
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,947
You said "got wind."

450
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:09,717
[Clears throat] Anyway,
I have another maneuver.

451
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:10,951
A better one.

452
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,953
Paul says we tell Tom
there's no other way.

453
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:14,321
But there is
another way.

454
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:15,589
Oh, wait, you don't even want
to hear it?

455
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:16,991
Of course
I want to hear it.

456
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:19,693
Since when do I take marching
orders from a bow tie?

457
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,828
There are eight projects
being built

458
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:22,796
in the two blocks
around Madison 25.

459
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:24,531
Every one of them
started after it.

460
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,767
Madison 25 is the centerpiece
of the whole development.

461
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:28,936
If it's not finished,
they're all worthless.

462
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:30,871
That's not
the bank's problem.

463
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,674
But it is, 'cause guess
what six of these buildings

464
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:37,678
have in common.

465
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,446
National's
backing them all?

466
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:42,283
Doesn't make sense for them
to foreclose and devalue

467
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,317
all their other projects.

468
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:45,286
Unless they have
another agenda.

469
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:50,057
Huh, I wonder where we could
ever find evidence of that?

470
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,359
Think that helps us?

471
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,228
I think we can take this
to the bank.

472
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,429
Now, you see,
that's funny

473
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:56,964
because we're actually going
to a bank.

474
00:20:57,032 --> 00:21:01,001
That's good.

475
00:21:04,873 --> 00:21:07,274
Twice in one day,
Mr. Specter.

476
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,243
I understand how
your client must feel.

477
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,878
Actually,
he's feeling fantastic.

478
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:12,346
You know why that is?

479
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,416
'Cause I told him the balloon
payment's going away.

480
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,886
Okay, I'll bite.
Why is it going away?

481
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:20,254
Because as much
as people hate lawyers,

482
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,156
you know who they hate more?
Bankers.

483
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:23,991
After all,
you were the ones

484
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,959
that got us into this recession
in the first place, right?

485
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:28,962
Oh, gentlemen.
I do not need a history lesson.

486
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,731
Then let's talk
about the future.

487
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,001
What happens to Madison 25 after
you force it into bankruptcy?

488
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,570
Maybe someone steps in
and finishes it.

489
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:38,272
Someone whose recent
merger leaves them

490
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,407
needing a large
downtown address?

491
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:41,742
Oh, now that
you mention it,

492
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,577
there's a little item
in your shareholder letter

493
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:46,080
about the search for
a new corporate headquarters.

494
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:48,582
- Yeah, I like to read.
- Well, I don't--

495
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,317
You intend to leverage
this foreclosure

496
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:52,519
to get a prime piece
of real estate at a song.

497
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:55,756
You see, Elaine,
we looked up your skirt.

498
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:57,124
And the six clients
you represent

499
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,259
surrounding Madison 25--
well, it turns out

500
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:01,362
Pearson Hardman actually
reps three of them.

501
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:03,630
And when the other three find
out about what you've done,

502
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,332
which will happen right after
I leave here,

503
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,934
we'll rep all six.

504
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,169
And when we move
their business elsewhere,

505
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:12,005
they'll take roughly,
mm--

506
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:14,408
Mm, a shitload of money
out of your bank.

507
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:17,378
- Shitload?
- Well, give or take.

508
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:25,719
It's important that nobody
knows about this.

509
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:28,122
I've never...

510
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:31,325
done anything
like this before.

511
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:35,095
Louis, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

512
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:36,764
Exploring your options
is something

513
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:39,700
everybody does
these days.

514
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:41,535
Sometimes you're
in a relationship,

515
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:43,504
they take you
for granted.

516
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,707
You shouldn't be taken
for granted.

517
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:48,976
I wouldn't take you
for granted.

518
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:51,178
I've never even
considered this.

519
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,380
Really?
People do it all the time.

520
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:54,615
Well, not me.

521
00:22:54,682 --> 00:22:56,350
I never even let myself
think it, let alone--

522
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,018
Sometimes, Louis,

523
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,387
the only way
to move on

524
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:05,392
is try something new.
[Chuckles]

525
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,361
You're trying
to seduce me.

526
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,464
I'm merely saying,

527
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:13,434
if Jessica Pearson can't see the
quality of the work that you do,

528
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,903
I know half a dozen firms
who will.

529
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,805
Litt, nothing,
and nobody.

530
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:19,807
I mean, who does
she think she is?

531
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:22,910
So...
high and mighty.

532
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:26,880
The question isn't,
"Can I get you an offer?"

533
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,950
It's, "How good an offer
can I get you?"

534
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,889
Uh, solicitation.

535
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,926
Drugs and prostitution,
that's what you think of me?

536
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:40,360
I've guessed
everything else.

537
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,062
Okay, what were
you arrested for?

538
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,197
Uh, jaywalking?
Murder?

539
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:44,832
- [Imitates buzzer]
- Spill it.

540
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:46,033
Nope, mm-mm.

541
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,635
I will have to remain
a mystery to you.

542
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:50,504
So, um--

543
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:52,673
it was a nice date.
Great restaurant.

544
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,176
- I actually picked it myself.
- Did you?

545
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:58,912
I actually asked
Donna myself.

546
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,549
See, honesty,
I-I love that in a man.

547
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:09,323
Uh

548
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,891
- Um--

Look, I know that
we joked about not

550
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,365
going home together--

551
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:26,406
I think
you were right, so--

552
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:29,076
you know, if we're
gonna do this, let's--

553
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:31,645
let's do it right.

554
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:35,115
Okay.
[Sighs]

555
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:41,488
Yeah.
Let's do it right.

556
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:50,063
Good night.

Remind me to move.

No forwarding address.
Come to think of it,

561
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,214
how did you get my address
in the first place?

562
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:08,782
That's a nice tux.
Where were you tonight?

563
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,884
It's not where I was,
it's where I'm going.

You're going out now?

everything became clear
tonight, okay?

00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:22,029
- I was out with Rachel--
- Oh, gosh, here it comes.

I'm serious, okay?

571
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,668
I need to--I need to talk
to you about this.

572
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:31,004
I need to tell you something.
Listen--

573
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,372
I need to make sure that
you understand that I--

574
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,374
Look, I understand.
I think we've covered this.

575
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:35,976
I'm not interested
in your personal life.

576
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:39,646
I realize that
because you don't have one.

Oh, yeah, great, you're
an international man of mystery,

but I'm not you,
all right?

I want a personal life.

And I don't want
to be a liar, so...

I'm gonna tell Rachel.
Everything.

No, you're not.

back to haunt me, Harvey.

- Harvey, please--
- After everything I did

591
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,446
to keep your job, you're just
gonna start spreading it around

592

that you're a fraud?
I'm not spreading it around.

No, she's not.

No, what you fail
to understand

is our firm
is under attack.

we're done.

getting laid,
but not for me.

to Jessica making me

fire you in the first place?
What are you saying?

You're saying that
I can't date Rachel?

Date Rachel!
Or don't, I don't care.

But you're not
gonna tell her.

I can't be in a relationship
based on a lie.

Then I guess
you have your answer.

But being honest
with her about this?

- That is off the table.
- There is no "about this."

I'm either honest with her,
or I'm not.

or can you just
not help being a dick?

633
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:59,078
My word this time.

634
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,180
Jessica--

635
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,383
Your job was
to make Paul happy,

636
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,685
not take over a case
and do it your way.

637
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:08,521
- The client's way.
- No, it's the client's way

638
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:10,290
because you told the client
it could be done.

639
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,858
And I was right!

640
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:14,360
And yet the experts,

641
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:17,063
the people I pay
to know bankruptcy

642
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,765
feel that
Paul's client--

643
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:22,035
oh, yes, Harvey,
Paul's client--

644
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,736
stands to put more money
at risk

645
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,939
when he can get out now
and move on.

646
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:28,141
This is better.
This is a win-win.

647
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:32,378
No, it's lose-lose,
and I'm not losing this one.

648
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:33,947
You are not to pitch this
to the client.

649
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:36,416
- I can't keep it from him.
- You're not hearing me, Harvey.

650
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:38,518
This isn't a discussion.

651
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:41,354
Tell the client
it didn't work.

652
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:43,389
You tried, you failed.

653
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,658
Move on.

654
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,994
I'm sorry if Paul's ego
is bruised--

655
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:51,464
This isn't about his ego.
It's about yours.

656
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:54,234
Make it go away,

657
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:57,203
and then walk away.

658
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,952
I even told him
about the time I got arrested.

659
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,356
It's crazy, it's like
we can talk about anything.

660
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,458
That's, um--
that's great.

661
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:19,626
I can tell you're nervous.
Don't be.

662
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:21,094
We're gonna find
a secret meeting spot

663
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:22,629
somewhere outside
of the office.

664
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:26,199
No one here will have
any idea what's going on.

665
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,701
Watch this.

666
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,603
Good morning,
Mr. Ross.

667
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:33,273
Eh...
Uh, morning.

668
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,642
You still need
some work on that.

669
00:29:39,847 --> 00:29:43,516
Harvey told me.

670
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:45,652
I know you work for him,
but he's wrong about this.

671
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,819
If he really cared
about me,

672
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,721
he wouldn't be
handing out ultimatums.

673
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,392
Ow.

674
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,194
Do you like
this office?

675
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:57,630
Sure.

676
00:29:57,698 --> 00:30:00,233
Do you know how much Harvey
likes this office?

677
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:03,036
Harvey loves
this office.

678
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:05,471
But for you, he was willing
to give it up.

679
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,974
He's giving me
his office?

680
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:10,009
How do you think he kept
your job, fraud man?

681
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:13,479
Hmm? Because Harvey said
it was a package deal.

682
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:15,481
She fired you,
she fired him.

683
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:18,985
So before you go mouthing off
about him not caring about you,

684
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:20,253
you think about that.
Wait a minute.

685
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:25,892
He did that for me?

686
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:29,495
[Sighs]
I just--

687
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:32,298
what--what am I supposed
to say to her?

688
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,701
I mean, Rachel and I are both
finally in the right place.

689
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:39,339
I told her that I wanted this,
and now--

690
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,107
I'm gonna look like
such an asshole.

691
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,577
Just do it gently.
Firmly, but...

692
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:47,146
[Sighs]

693
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:48,815
Gently.

694
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:54,387
- And--and that's gonna help?
- No, probably not.

695
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:58,024
How are we even supposed to
work together after that, huh?

696
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:04,364
It's possible.

697
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:08,534
It is?

698
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:13,272
It is.

699
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,977
And how do you get
from here to--

700
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,381
The feelings
just go away.

701
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:23,616
Eventually.

702
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,396
Can I help you,
Louis?

703
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:37,697
Jessica, listen, um,

704
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:39,298
I know you've got
a lot going on right now,

705
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,134
um, but I just wanted
to tell you that I--

706
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:44,604
Jessica.
We need to talk.

707
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:47,240
Excuse me.
Hi, I was--

708
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:52,612
Now.

709
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,351
Never mind,
it can wait.

710
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,220
Yes, Paul?

711
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:05,525
I want to make sure that you
and I are on the same page.

712
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,261
I gave you and Harvey
an opportunity.

713
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,496
I didn't give you
a client.

714
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:14,500
I am well aware
of your position, Paul.

715
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:17,370
If you'll excuse me?
Mm.

716
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:28,648
[Sighs]

717
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:29,949
[Door opens]

718
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,117
What?

719
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:34,987
- Sorry, um--
- Oh, put it right here.

720
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:40,359
And get out.

721
00:32:49,736 --> 00:32:54,941
Daniel Hardman?
[Chuckles]

722
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:06,953
The XJS 5000 dictaphone?

723
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,258
How the hell
did he know?

724
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:16,262
[Laughs]

725
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:39,285
I heard the bank
came through.

726
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:43,656
Jessica told me
to tank the deal.

727
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:45,992
Sucks, doesn't it?

728
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:49,462
Being told what to do.

729
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,532
What not to do.

730
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:57,770
What are you gonna do
about what we talked about?

731
00:33:57,838 --> 00:34:00,606
I don't know.

732
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,575
I think
you do know.

733
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:04,110
I think you know
what's right,

734
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:07,980
whether I had
to tell you or not.

735
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:18,057
So, Tom.

736
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:23,329
Harvey has something
to tell you.

737
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:27,233
Did you find me
my miracle?

738
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:30,236
The bank agreed to alter
the terms of the loan.

739
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:31,370
No balloon payment.

740
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:32,672
Madison 25 is safe.
No bankruptcy.

741
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,541
Oh, oh, man.
Thank you.

742
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:38,678
Thank you so much.

743
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,012
Well, Paul.
Mm.

744
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,181
Looks like you found me
the right quarterback

745
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:43,983
for the fourth quarter.
[Laughs]

746
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:46,185
I won't forget this.

747
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:50,489
No, nor will I.

748
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:12,313
I have been irritated by you,
exasperated with you,

749
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:14,849
and angry at you,

750
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,752
but I never thought
I'd feel betrayed by you.

751
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,053
I put together
a good deal.

752
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:20,555
- It was a safe deal--
- I don't care.

753
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:23,458
You just ensured that a voting
partner would never back me.

754
00:35:23,526 --> 00:35:26,361
If his mother were dying
of cancer and I saved her,

755
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,962
I still wouldn't
get his vote.

756
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,163
I know you're angry,

757
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,065
but I took the restructured deal
to real estate.

758
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,333
That puts them
in your pocket.

759
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:33,768
Real estate has always been
in my pocket.

760
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:35,403
It's only you
they hated.

761
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:36,804
And I'm beginning
to understand why.

762
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:39,774
- This isn't me against you.
- Hardman is back.

763
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:42,310
You were the one person
I could trust.

764
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:43,311
- Jessica--
- I've always known

765
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:44,512
what you are, Harvey,

766
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,515
and I thought that was
my greatest asset.

767
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,919
Now I'm wondering if you're
not my biggest liability.

768
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:53,087
This isn't
about bankruptcy.

769
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:54,556
You're still pissed off
about Mike Ross.

770
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:57,158
- Damn right I am.
- I offered to walk away.

771
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:59,327
That offer was bullshit,
and you know it.

772
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:01,529
You hired that kid
to amuse yourself,

773
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:03,097
and now I'm vulnerable.

774
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:05,466
And after everything
that's happened,

775
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:10,572
you still couldn't put me
ahead of you.

776
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,640
The client asked me
to save his dream.

777
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:14,108
I did.

778
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:16,110
You're actually starting
to believe your own bullshit.

779
00:36:16,178 --> 00:36:18,746
- Jessica, come on.
- Just go, Harvey.

780
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:23,117
I will get past this.
I will move on.

781
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:26,854
And I will accept that
at the end of the day,

782
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:30,458
that I am alone
in this.

783
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:56,951
- Hey.
- Hey.

784
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:58,052
Four blocks
from the office,

785
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,954
I sort of love
this clandestine thing.

786
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:01,289
Kind of sexy, right?
[Laughs]

787
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:03,491
[Laughs]
Oh, thank you.

788
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,259
Look, I was thinking about
what you said last night,

789
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:07,862
and you're right,
I have been so scared about

790
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,532
taking the LSATs, I know I have.
Rachel, I, uh-

791
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,302
there's something
I need to tell you.

792
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,039
We can't do this
anymore.

793
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:19,474
Okay.

794
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,742
It's not that
I don't want to--

795
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,076
Wait, where's
this coming from?

796
00:37:22,144 --> 00:37:24,245
Because last night you--eh--
this was all your idea.

797
00:37:24,313 --> 00:37:25,480
- I know.
- So?

798
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:28,650
Collin McCarthy?

799
00:37:28,717 --> 00:37:30,718
- What about Collin McCarthy?
- You dated him.

800
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:32,553
- Yeah, I know.
- He was a first-year.

801
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:34,355
You broke up with him,
and his work went off a cliff,

802
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:35,857
and then he was fired
two months later.

803
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:37,125
That's why you don't want
to date someone

804
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:38,526
from the office, right?
This is ridiculous.

805
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:39,927
He has nothing to do
with you and me.

806
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:41,462
But he does.

807
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:44,966
I know that you and I both
want this, okay, but--

808
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:48,903
chances are,
I'm gonna screw it up.

809
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:50,204
I love my job,

810
00:37:50,272 --> 00:37:53,274
and I love--
I love working with you.

811
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:55,209
And I'm afraid, okay?
I'm afraid that--

812
00:37:55,277 --> 00:37:58,980
that this
will ruin that.

813
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:00,314
So--

814
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:06,320
Wow, that was a lot
of words, Mike.

815
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:08,456
Why don't you just
say it?

816
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:10,091
You know what, actually,
don't say it.

817
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,260
I can say it for you
because it doesn't take me days

818
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:13,327
to hear your message.

819
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:14,896
I hear your message
loud and clear.

820
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:20,201
I'm just not good enough
for you.

821
00:38:32,948 --> 00:38:37,719
Have Norma send up
a bouquet of flowers,

822
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:42,790
and make sure that they
repolish the cherrywood.

823
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:46,394
It's walnut.

824
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:51,599
I just wanted to make sure
that the place was ready.

825
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,568
I had them
redo the walls.

826
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:57,572
This is taupe.
Mm.

827
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,707
I want it
to be perfect

828
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:03,411
for when Daniel
gets back.

829
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:05,646
You wanted something
this morning.

830
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:07,715
I'm sorry,
I was rushed.

831
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:10,418
I'm not now.

832
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:14,122
Do you still need me?

833
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:16,591
No.

834
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:45,286
Checking up on me?

835
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:46,954
Checking in on you.

836
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:48,823
Well, don't worry, Harvey.

837
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,592
You were right,
as always.

838
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,061
I don't like having
to tell you to do something

839
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:55,563
that you don't want
to do.

840
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:58,232
Why is it that I have to do
everything that you tell me to,

841
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,937
but you can ignore whatever
Jessica tells you to do?

842
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:05,339
You have plenty of time
to find the right girl, Mike.

843
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:08,209
[Chuckles]
Well, thank you.

844
00:40:08,277 --> 00:40:10,545
Guess I should get my book,
take some notes.

845
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:12,747
Harvey Specter's
dating tips.

846
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:16,584
'Cause I'm sure you told
yourself that at 25 and 30

847
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:19,120
and 35, and I'm sure you'll be
telling yourself that

848
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:23,791
when you're 50.

849
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:29,030
You know
I was right.

850
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:33,568
Doesn't make it
any better.

851
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:16,544
[Rattling]

852
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:28,022
You're not alone
in this.

853
00:41:32,694 --> 00:41:35,930
Put it over there.
