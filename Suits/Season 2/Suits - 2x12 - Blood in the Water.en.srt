1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,248
Previously on...
<i>Suits</i>

2
00:00:01,249 --> 00:00:03,929
Tess, there is such
thing as right and wrong.

3
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:06,230
You're married.
What if I wasn't?

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,467
What you're doing,
it only ends one way.

5
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,172
I wasn't the only senior
partner who voted for Hardman,

6
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,573
and I don't see you
giving anyone else shit

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,741
the way you give me.

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,009
And by the way,
when the chips were down,

9
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:19,911
I backed you,
I ousted him.

10
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,612
Tell yourself
whatever you want, Louis.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,814
But tell it to yourself.

12
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:26,517
I can't go away
with you, Harvey.

13
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:29,620
Why not?

14
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:31,489
The next time
I have an option

15
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,391
to cross the line
to save you,

16
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,660
I'll send you packing
and not think twice.

17
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:40,231
Now get your shit
together.

18
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,833
You need to go,

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,602
and I need to get
my shit together.

20
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:13,364
How nice,
greeting me at the door.

21
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:14,932
When are they gonna take
that down?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,002
Pearson...
Just doesn't have the same ring.

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,571
Pearson Paulsen
sounds pretty good.

24
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,039
Okay.
No, it doesn't.

25
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:23,207
How's my day?

26
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,208
How was your night?

27
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,510
And by night,
I mean weekend,

28
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:27,078
and by weekend,
I mean Zoe.

29
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:29,080
It was fine.

30
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,148
That's it?

31
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,316
No fun banter?

32
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,018
No witty repartee?

33
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:36,421
And you're in the office
at exactly 8:00.

34
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:38,256
Not early, which would mean
it went badly,

35
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:40,083
and not late, which would mean
it went great.

36
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,259
But exactly on time,
which means--

37
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,429
You and Zoe never went away
for the weekend.

38
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,330
What happened?
Do you want to talk about it?

39
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,365
I have ice cream.

40
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:48,466
It's 8:00 a.m.

41
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,435
Which is why God made
chunky monkey.

42
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,203
It has chocolate
and bananas.

43
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:54,071
Bananas are part
of a healthy breakfast.

44
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:55,072
And who cares
about the bananas?

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,641
It has chocolate.

46
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,668
Okay, you caught me.
I don't even eat the bananas.

47
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,245
8:00 a.m. means the business
day has already started.

48
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:02,713
I'd like to conduct
some business.

49
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:03,815
Well, in that case,

50
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,049
Trent Devon would like
to see you.

51
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:06,217
So schedule
an appointment.

52
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:09,654
Okay, you have
an 8:02 with Trent Devon.

53
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:10,721
Well, I didn't meet you
at the elevator

54
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,029
just to chat
about your weekend.

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,191
Fine.
Get Mike.

56
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,892
From home?

57
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,828
You gotta be kidding me.

58
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:19,497
My client is here,
and my associate is not?

59
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:20,598
Well, I'm sure--

60
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,946
- Donna,
I don't want to hear it.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,502
The minute Mike Ross sets foot
in this building,

62
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,072
I want to know.

63
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,374
I think it's a bad idea,
Harvey.

64
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,609
We'll double
the share price

65
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:32,710
by the end
of the first quarter.

66
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,679
That's not
what I meant.

67
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:37,014
I'm just--
I'm not sure going public

68
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:38,316
is the best move
right now.

69
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:39,584
That's why I'm here.

70
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,352
Trust me, these aren't
valid reservations.

71
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,787
You're just getting
cold feet.

72
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,088
Harvey.

73
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,223
I'll have Donna send you
some fuzzy slippers.

74
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,257
You'll be just fine.

75
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:47,492
Are fuzzy slippers
gonna stop

76
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,761
the Title 16 ruling
that came down Friday?

77
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,597
You don't even know
what that is, do you?

78
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:53,865
No, I don't.

79
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,066
But what I do know is
it's not gonna change

80
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,467
the value of your site.

81
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,803
You've tripled your reach
in the past ten months.

82
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,705
Everyone is talking
about you.

83
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:03,241
Now is the time.

84
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,812
Come on,
we agreed on this.

85
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,380
What's this really about?

86
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,849
It's about the changes
around here.

87
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,251
Nothing's changed.

88
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,153
I'm here.
Harvey.

89
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:17,941
I may be a tech head,
but I'm not oblivious.

90
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,124
This firm just went
through a battle, and I know it.

91
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,359
Are you telling me
that you don't trust me

92
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:23,060
to put your needs
above the firm's?

93
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,829
No, I've always trusted you,
Harvey.

94
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:28,699
I'm just saying
I don't--

95
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,301
I think you might be
too distracted

96
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,702
to give me
the best advice.

97
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,604
- Trent.
- I have to consider my options.

98
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,274
About the IPO
or Pearson Hardman?

99
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,110
Both.

100
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,645
We have a problem.

101
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:42,914
Yeah?

102
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,649
Bernie Carillo is
thinking of leaving us.

103
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,884
That's absolutely not true,
and I would know.

104
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:49,554
I have it
on good authority.

105
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,822
So let me guess.
It's my fault.

106
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,257
Louis, I didn't come here
to blame you.

107
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:57,595
I came here to give you
a heads up.

108
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:59,430
You want to spit out
what you're chewing on?

109
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:01,532
Yeah, you order me
to rescind an offer

110
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,467
due to
a firm-wide hiring freeze.

111
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,436
I stake my reputation
on it.

112
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,905
Two minutes later,
you hire a fifth-year.

113
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,040
You went back
on your word,

114
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:10,408
and you made me look
like a fool.

115
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,509
I also gave you my word
that there'd be

116
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,077
no coming back
from your vote.

117
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:15,913
And I'm ready
to go back on that.

118
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:19,150
We're losing clients, Louis,
and I can't have that.

119
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,452
So today
is day one

120
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,455
of the Louis Litt
rehabilitation program.

121
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:27,258
Take it.
Move on.

122
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:32,430
It is time
to heal the wounds.

123
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:35,533
I'll take care
of Carillo.

124
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:41,472
Come on!

125
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,107
Out with it.
What'd you do?

126
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,508
I think I put in
too much toner.

127
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,810
With Carillo,
you imbecile.

128
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:47,211
He's considering
a change of counsel.

129
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,412
Now, I want to know
what you did

130
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,648
or more likely did not do
to cause this.

131
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,751
What?

132
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:54,986
- I don't know.
- What a shocker.

133
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:56,773
If you want, I can go back,
and I'll retry--

134
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:57,888
No, no, no, no.

135
00:04:57,956 --> 00:04:59,890
What I want is for you
to finish

136
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:00,925
drafting the contracts

137
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:02,259
and deliver them
to Rachel Zane

138
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:03,861
by 8:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

139
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,162
Then wait
for further instructions,

140
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,697
politely seated,

141
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,599
with your hands crossed
on your lap.

142
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,867
Uh.

143
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,769
And if anything goes wrong,

144
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:13,604
I swear to almighty God

145
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:14,905
that you
are gonna rue the day

146
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:16,173
that you decided
to become

147
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:18,476
the embarrassment
of a lawyer that you are.

148
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:22,680
Louis Litt
does not lose clients.

149
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,515
Is that clear?

150
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,451
About the Carillo contracts

151
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,853
or the fact
that you don't lose clients?

152
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,221
Get out.

153
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,157
Oh, sorry.

154
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:37,995
Uhoh.
Wait a minute.

155
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:40,364
What is this?

156
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:43,234
Is that a triple nonfat
sugar-free mocha latte?

157
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,603
- Oh, you sweet, sweet--
- Mmm.

158
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,111
Wait a minute.
What did you do wrong?

159
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:49,273
Okay, I'm offended.
You're questioning my motives?

160
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:50,708
- Actually, Mike--
- It's okay.

161
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,443
You haven't had
your second triple latte yet.

162
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,912
I forgive you
because I'm in a forgiving mood.

163
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,660
- Right, but Harvey's...
- I love the smell

164
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:57,915
of litigation in the morning.
Not.

165
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,450
It's 8:30.

166
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:00,551
Yeah, in the morning.

167
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:01,652
It's 30 minutes past

168
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,041
when you were required
to be here,

169
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:04,588
which means
it's an hour past

170
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,756
when you should be here.

171
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:10,061
Okay, since when
do we use a time clock?

172
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,563
What are the new FTC
Title 16 requirements?

173
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,131
Oh, they're nothing.
It's a nuisance.

174
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,333
Trent Devon's worried
about them.

175
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,303
Okay, well, all it is
is another form to fill out.

176
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,571
So if that's what you're worried
about, it's fine.

177
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,339
What I'm worried about
is the fact

178
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,528
that I
could've told him that

179
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,615
had you been
at the meeting

180
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,043
this morning at 8:00.

181
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,232
What?
I checked the schedule.

182
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,446
There was nothing on it
for this morning.

183
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,614
It happened spontaneously,
as things do.

184
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,882
And I was there.

185
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,617
You were not there.

186
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,320
Did you not hear me

187
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:37,788
when I told you to get
your shit together?

188
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,290
No, I did hear you,
and I did

189
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,758
get my shit together,
by the way.

190
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,426
That's why I'm late
this morning.

191
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,261
Deciding to be late
to get your shit together

192
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,063
is not getting
your shit together.

193
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,364
Get it
through your head.

194
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:48,599
We just went
through a civil war,

195
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,600
and the world knows it.

196
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:50,701
We're weak.

197
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,103
And the law
of the jungle says

198
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,204
the weak get eaten.

199
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,106
Okay, Harvey,
I'm sorry,

200
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,294
but you need
to ease up here.

201
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:57,441
Ease up?

202
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,477
You're telling me
to ease up

203
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,811
when our clients
are leaving?

204
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,347
That's right,
Trent Devon might leave.

205
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,715
People don't leave me!

206
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,283
- I-I--
- Enough!

207
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,853
Your job is to help me,
not to screw me.

208
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,054
If I tell you
you did that,

209
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:11,722
I don't want to hear
that you didn't.

210
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,357
I should've fired you
last week.

211
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:14,792
You know what,
I should fire you right now.

212
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,894
But I cut you slack
because your grandmother died.

213
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:18,729
Well, you've used up
the rope.

214
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:22,466
You keep it up,
I will fire you tomorrow.

"People don't leave me"?

227
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:07,349
- Donna, I don't--
- I do.

228
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,284
- He deserved it.
- He deserved a slap.

229
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,953
You knocked him
across the room.

230
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:18,560
What happened with Zoe?

231
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,529
She's leaving New York

232
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:24,533
to take care of her niece
whose father is dying.

233
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,368
Oh, my God.

234
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:29,271
Harvey, I'm sorry.

235
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,673
Is there anything--

236
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:34,443
No.

237
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:38,380
Just one thing.

238
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,450
I don't think kicking
the dog is gonna help.

239
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:56,131
Wow, you look like hell.

240
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,499
Jimmy.

241
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,134
You here to pick a fight
with me?

242
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,402
'Cause I'm really
not in the mood.

243
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,871
No, no, Mike.
It's not like that, man.

244
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,306
Oh, yeah?
You're not still pissed at me?

245
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:06,074
You gave me an out.

246
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:07,609
I might not have respected it
at the time,

247
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:08,710
but I do now.

248
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:09,738
As far as I'm concerned,

249
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:10,712
I owe you one.
Okay.

250
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,901
Yeah.
Let me buy you a drink.

251
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:12,981
Two conditions.

252
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:14,149
You still owe me one.

253
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:17,252
You still owe me one.

254
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,154
As long as I still
don't owe you one.

255
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:21,623
Bartender.
It's good to see you, man.

256
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,492
You too, buddy.
So what's going on?

257
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,161
You had a bad day?
Yeah.

258
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,529
Okay.
So give it to me.

259
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:29,197
Well, evidently,
getting in at 8:30

260
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,599
can only mean one thing.

261
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,833
Yeah, that you had
your head up your ass

262
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:34,436
from 7:00 to 8:15.
- How'd you know?

263
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:36,238
Are you forgetting
I used to work for Louis too?

264
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,940
And unlike you, I didn't have
Harvey there to protect me.

265
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,442
No, this was Harvey.

266
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,044
Whoa.
Ain't that some shit.

267
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,312
Anyway,

268
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,313
here's
to the wonderful world

269
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,415
of being an associate,
right?

270
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,683
Yeah.

271
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,252
Pearson Hardman.

272
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:53,622
What does that mean?

273
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,690
I'm at Bratton Gould,
my man.

274
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:57,926
And I'm happy.
No!

275
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,394
Associates don't get
to be happy, Jimmy.

276
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:01,396
No, you do
at Bratton Gould.

277
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:05,166
I got an office.

278
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,469
Shoot me now.

279
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,004
That's great.

280
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,238
Listen, Mike.

281
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,240
When I said
that I owe you one, I mean it.

282
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,809
'Cause you didn't hear it
from me, but we're expanding.

283
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:15,810
So if you want to jump,
just let me know.

284
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,112
I'll put in a word
for you.

285
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,047
- I can't leave Harvey.
- Screw Harvey.

286
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:23,351
I mean,
what's he done for you?

287
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:24,686
More than you know.

288
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:27,255
Okay, maybe.

289
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:29,190
But a year
under Harvey Specter,

290
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:30,959
they would kill
to have you.

291
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:34,462
And you wouldn't be
the only one.

292
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,766
There are people
from Pearson Hardman

293
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,134
going to Bratton Gould?
Who?

294
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,602
I can't tell you that.

295
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,770
Jimmy,
you have to tell me that.

296
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:42,871
Mike, come on.

297
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:43,939
If they knew
it came from me--

298
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:46,174
They won't.

299
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:53,648
I saw Clark and Owens meeting
with our partners.

300
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,217
If you're here
to give me

301
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,325
your letter
of resignation,

302
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:58,653
I'll accept it
in the morning.

303
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:00,889
Oh, that's ironic.
I was offered a job tonight.

304
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:02,857
- Congratulations.
- I passed.

305
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,025
You want credit
for that?

306
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,994
No, I want to do the job
I already have.

307
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:08,363
Apology accepted.

308
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,765
Bratton Gould
is poaching our associates,

309
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,300
Clark, Owens,

310
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,301
but he's also coming after--

311
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,637
Our clients.
Trent Devon.

312
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:16,805
Someone's whispering
in his ear.

313
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,139
Allison Holt.

314
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,774
She was brought in
about a month ago.

315
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:21,476
She was ready to throw you
under the bus.

316
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:22,877
And Jessica
threw her out.

317
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,079
So you think
she's in this for revenge?

318
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:25,180
Maybe.

319
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:26,648
But we both know
who brought her in.

320
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,850
Hardman.

321
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:32,020
You think
this is him?

322
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,188
Hell of a view.

323
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,357
Clark and Owens
don't deserve this.

324
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:39,027
Which one is Owens,
by the way, the redhead?

325
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,996
You don't even know
who your associates are,

326
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,131
but you're here to complain
about losing them?

327
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,000
You bitter
because you were fired?

328
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,267
I'm not bitter, Harvey.

329
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,837
Unlike you, I don't take
things personally.

330
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,438
And by the way,
I was right.

331
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,540
I advised you to settle,
and you settled.

332
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,476
Your advice was for us
to settle,

333
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,111
and I lose
my law license.

334
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,479
And my question is,

335
00:11:57,546 --> 00:12:00,482
was taking that deal
your idea or Daniel Hardman's?

336
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,684
You think
Daniel's behind this?

337
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,452
You met with him
six days ago.

338
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,821
I'm not even gonna ask
how you know that.

339
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,289
I told you before,
Jessica.

340
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,658
I'm a straight shooter.

341
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,693
Daniel wasn't dictating
my actions then,

342
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,294
and he's not now.

343
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,096
Either way,
we are filing a claim

344
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:16,364
for tortious interference.

345
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:17,793
You're using
privileged information

346
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,933
to target our clients.

347
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,403
You really want to cry
foul to the ref?

348
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,638
You know who went to the ref
more than anyone?

349
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:26,141
Michael Jordan.
He did it quietly.

350
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,844
And he got six rings,
and he's my client.

351
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:32,080
Maybe I
should call him too.

352
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:33,748
You're not getting
Trent Devon.

353
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:36,518
You can't keep people
who want to leave, Harvey.

354
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:39,020
Everybody knows
about your civil war.

355
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,156
Pearson Hardman
is falling apart.

356
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:42,891
And I'm telling you,

357
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,796
the avalanche
has already started.

358
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:54,969
The Carillo contracts,
they should be signed

359
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,471
and on my desk.
I know.

360
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,806
Well,
since you're so in the know,

361
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,040
perhaps you can tell me
why I don't have them yet.

362
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,676
- Because they're not signed.
- Not signed?

363
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,078
I called earlier to have them
to have them messengered--

364
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,379
The story's already
taking too long.

365
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,413
And they said
they didn't need to see them.

366
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,815
Still waiting.

367
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,583
They said
they're no longer a client.

368
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,585
Harold.

369
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,087
No.
Harold didn't--

370
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:14,189
Louis,
Harold didn't do anything.

371
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,590
Harold never
does anything.

372
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,192
He got me the contracts
first thing this morning.

373
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,393
He worked all night.
They were really quite--

374
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,794
Excuse me.
They were really quite--

375
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:22,063
- "Quite" what?
- Good, actually.

376
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,598
Uhhuh. And how many
citations you correct?

377
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,866
- None.
- You're lying.

378
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,835
- No, I'm not.
- I don't care.

379
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,903
Wow. Yeah.
That is a tattoo.

380
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:30,572
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

381
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,075
Manatee--the slow,
gentle cow of the sea.

382
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,511
Uh, no.
It's a shark actually.

383
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,446
Totally.
No--yes.

384
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:39,547
That's a shark.

385
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:42,617
That is a big, wide,
fat shark.

386
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,219
You're fired.

387
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:46,721
- You can't fire Mike.
- <i>You.</i>

388
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:49,124
You moron. You can't
even get your firing right.

389
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:52,293
- I'm fired?
- Louis, come on.

390
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,628
Pack up your things and go.
Now.

391
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,896
But I did everything
you asked.

392
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,231
I delivered
the Carillo contracts.

393
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,432
I don't care.

394
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,101
The client fired us,
and now I'm firing you.

395
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,669
Times are tough,
people.

396
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,806
We can't afford mistakes.
We can't afford incompetence.

397
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:07,075
You can't cut it,
get out.

398
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,476
There is no place
for mediocrity here

399
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:09,878
at Pearson Hardman,

400
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:13,882
and there's certainly no place
for someone like you.

401
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,519
Everyone else
get back to work.

402
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:27,925
You know,
I didn't just do

403
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,227
what he asked for Carillo.

404
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,328
I went way beyond.

405
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,729
I didn't make
any mistakes,

406
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,231
and I know that they're not
leaving because of me.

407
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:34,999
So why didn't you
say that to him?

408
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,902
Because he
makes me freeze.

409
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,238
You know,
sometimes I wish

410
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,807
we would've known each other
at Harvard.

411
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,511
Yeah. Yeah.
Harvard.

412
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,379
You probably hung out
with Duncan and those guys.

413
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,748
I hung out
with the library.

414
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,383
I'm such a loser.

415
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:53,951
No, you're not,
Harold.

416
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,520
Look, for the record,

417
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:58,122
Duncan was a douche.
He <i>was</i> a douche.

418
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,991
- Totally.
- Like a douchy-douche.

419
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,292
Do you remember that thing
he used to do with the--

420
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,640
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

421
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:06,964
See,
that's what I mean.

422
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,066
If you would've known me
there,

423
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,300
then at least
someone here would know

424
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,468
that I wasn't always
like this.

425
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,036
People used to come
to me

426
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,838
for help
on their essays.

427
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:15,606
We'd sit in the quiet
of my apartment

428
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,141
where no one
was yelling at me,

429
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,577
and I could think
and write.

430
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:23,481
- Really?
- Yeah.

431
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,050
Here.

432
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:28,386
This is the first essay
I wrote in law school.

433
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,655
Look
at the Professor's comments.

434
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,757
Holy shit.

435
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:36,394
Louis is right.
I don't belong here.

436
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,162
No, he's not.

437
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,597
- Thomas.
- Poconos weekend.

438
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,165
- With the girlfriend.
- Which one?

439
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,601
- Doesn't matter.
- Done. Winters?

440
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,069
- Lunch with the mayor.
- Campos.

441
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:47,071
- Lunch with me.
- Lunch with me.

442
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,207
- Benson?
- Box at the Garden.

443
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:50,575
Have Lundqvist meet him
pre-game.

444
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,576
Does the king do that?

445
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,177
He does for me.
Siebertz.

446
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,712
- Tickets.
- Super Bowl.

447
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,280
- Broadway.
- Really?

448
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,482
Beneath
that lumberjack chest

449
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:58,583
beats the heart
of a songbird.

450
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,618
Fine.
Anything but <i>Cats.</i>

451
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:01,619
<i>Cats</i> closed
over a decade ago.

452
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,020
What took 'em
so long?

453
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,456
That's it then.
We're done.

454
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:06,758
Closed them all.

455
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:09,360
That's just foreplay.
We didn't close shit.

456
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,229
I want to have talked
to every one of my clients

457
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:12,463
by the end
of the day.

458
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,866
You stay on Trent Devon
until he takes the call.

459
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,000
I will.

460
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,035
And, Harvey...

461
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,773
No one
is leaving you.

462
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,711
Okay.

463
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,679
Harold is
totally freaked out.

464
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:30,114
I think he's gonna have
an ulcer,

465
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:31,983
but the good news is he'll never
disappoint you again,

466
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,187
so you can go and magnanimously
hire him back now.

467
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,522
Why would I do that?

468
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,024
Um, I don't know,
because you made your point.

469
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:41,959
You think
that was a show?

470
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,862
Look,
I know Harold can be...

471
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,397
Harold.

472
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,199
He's an idiot savant
minus the savant.

473
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,334
He tries hard.
He's a good person.

474
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:52,203
Yeah, well, then tell him
to join the Peace Corps.

475
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:54,272
Why don't you just give him
a second chance?

476
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,841
I did, Mike.
It was called his second day.

477
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,230
You realize you need cause,
right?

478
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,477
You want a cause?

479
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:01,112
He left a zero off
the Hopkins settlement,

480
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,648
which cost the client
$360,000.

481
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,683
He filed a motion
with the appeals court

482
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:08,186
instead of the superior court,
which accidentally triggered

483
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,387
a death penalty review.

484
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,022
And then
the one and only time

485
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,891
that I take him to court
with me, his fly was down,

486
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,260
and he called the judge
"Your Owner."

487
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:21,799
You know why he does
those things, right?

488
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,801
Because you
intimidate him.

489
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,670
You brutalize him.

490
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:26,737
You're always talking
about how great

491
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:27,905
you are at grooming us.

492
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:29,574
Well, you were not great
at grooming him.

493
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,242
If he can't take
a drill sergeant yelling at him,

494
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,777
how can he handle
people shooting at him?

495
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,085
People don't shoot at us,
Louis.

496
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,948
Don't they?

497
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,216
Okay.
You know what?

498
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:42,253
You want him to stay...

499
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,756
Fine.
He can stay.

500
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:46,791
Thank you.

501
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,959
One condition.

502
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,493
You personally guarantee

503
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,028
every piece
of work product

504
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,697
that Harold sends
out of this office

505
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:53,931
just like I have.

506
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:55,166
You check everything
he does.

507
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,701
You cross every "t,"
dot every "I,"

508
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:59,537
and still do everything
you have to for Harvey.

509
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,540
People may not be shooting
at us, but we are at war.

510
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,109
So how does that work
for you?

511
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:09,413
Do we have a deal?

512
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,156
Harold.

513
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,325
I was just coming by
to wish you well.

514
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,394
Thanks, Rachel,
but I think it's gonna be okay.

515
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,296
Mike's talking to Louis
right now.

516
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,430
Really?

517
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,933
That's great.

518
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:36,440
Well?

519
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:45,316
There was nothing
I could do.

520
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:48,686
It's okay.
I know you tried, Mike.

521
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,788
If it'll make
you feel better,

522
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:53,457
you're not the only person
being let go this week.

523
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,594
Well, Clark and Owens
are only getting let go

524
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:57,828
because someone found out
that they're moving

525
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,797
to Bratton Gould
with McKinney and Kline.

526
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,832
- They are?
- Yeah, I overheard it.

527
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,036
I guess some people
will choose any port in a storm.

528
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:09,674
Harold,
good luck.

529
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:13,244
You too.

530
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,690
This sucks.
It does.

531
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:29,360
He didn't deserve that.

532
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,066
Allison's not done.

533
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,801
We know.
We're working all the clients.

534
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:39,303
No, it's more than that.
She's taking McKinney and Kline.

535
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:40,338
It's just
two more associates.

536
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:44,675
No,
it's more than that.

537
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,410
I tell you
the rats are jumping ship,

538
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,611
and you say it's fine,
but Donna nods,

539
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,079
and you're busting out
life jackets?

540
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:50,681
You have a history
of panicking.

541
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:51,782
He's not panicking.

542
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,484
Clark, Owens,
McKinney, Kline--

543
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,785
these aren't
just fifth-years.

544
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:56,153
They're
the best fifth-years.

545
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,861
They're Louis's
first class of associates.

546
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,690
He gave her
a report card?

547
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,926
Harvey,
you do not know that.

548
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,894
Well,
I'm gonna goddamn find out.

549
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,964
Stop.

550
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:08,566
Just cut it out.

551
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,834
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

552
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,335
Bye.

553
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,903
I never liked you,
Louis.

554
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,839
You're a vindictive,
sniveling rat,

555
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:16,907
but I never thought
you'd betray your own firm.

556
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,210
I never betrayed
this firm.

557
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,717
What do you call helping
Allison Holt

558
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:21,746
poach our associates?

559
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:23,881
I had nothing to do
with that.

560
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,549
I love this firm,
Harvey.

561
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,084
You were a traitor
when you voted for Hardman,

562
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:28,285
and you're
a traitor now.

563
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,587
Like I've told you before,

564
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:30,688
I'm not the only one

565
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:31,756
in this firm
who voted for Hardman.

566
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,090
And I voted to oust him
once I knew.

567
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,059
Once you knew you had
to save your own ass.

568
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,327
All right, you know what,
Harvey, just get out.

569
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:40,164
Get out.

570
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:43,801
Ri--
I did nothing wrong.

571
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,436
Jesus!

572
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,071
You bugged my office.

573
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:49,407
You ran to Hardman
about the CM lawsuit.

574
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,776
You sold your soul
for senior partnership.

575
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:54,278
And once you got it,
you created a drug policy

576
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:57,248
with the sole purpose
of firing me!

577
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:58,282
I did it
for Hardman.

578
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,617
Maybe Hardman
wanted me dead,

579
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,185
but you're the one
who went out,

580
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,820
got the gun,
aimed it,

581
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,889
and fired it at my head.

582
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,157
And it blew up
in my face!

583
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,493
And what would have happened
if it didn't?

584
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,362
I was under orders.

585
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,950
Were you also under orders
when you ran

586
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:14,498
to Hardman
about Monica Eton?

587
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,101
How do you know
it was me?

588
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,170
Because I set it up!

589
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,406
Because I know
who you are!

590
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:25,142
Are you still
gonna tell me

591
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,644
you're not helping Allison?

592
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:28,813
Harvey,
I swear to God

593
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,449
I did not do this.

594
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:32,716
Maybe not.

595
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,552
But now that you've done
what you've done,

596
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,556
I will never trust you.

597
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,927
Pearson Hardman
is my life.

598
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:45,996
Well, here's what's
gonna happen from now on.

599
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:49,266
You and I,
we're done.

600
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,769
Don't drop by
my office.

601
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:54,438
Don't ask Donna
for information.

602
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,873
You're the guy
that nobody wants

603
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,743
but we can't get rid of.

604
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:02,480
I'm a senior partner.

605
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:04,615
So I can't
make you leave.

606
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:07,051
But as far
as I'm concerned,

607
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,855
you don't even work here
anymore.

608
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,502
That glass
does not look halffull.

609
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,543
You're cherry-picking
Pearson Hardman associates.

610
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,911
I only want
the best cherries.

611
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:46,447
Then why not go
after the gardener who grew 'em?

612
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,750
You want to leave
Pearson Hardman.

613
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:51,753
I'm a proven commodity who
delivers outstanding billables.

614
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,288
With an unparalleled knowledge
of finance.

615
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,223
Yeah, I'm well aware
of who you are, Louis.

616
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,859
But how do I know
that Harvey Specter

617
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,427
didn't just send you here?

618
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,629
'Cause I'm the last person
that Harvey Specter would trust.

619
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,664
Just ask Daniel Hardman.

620
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,266
I did.
He said you betrayed him.

621
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:07,502
Like I said,
I am well aware of who you are.

622
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,137
Well, if you spoke to Daniel,
then you would know

623
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,639
that he lost Pearson Hardman
not because of my betrayal

624
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:12,807
but because of his own.

625
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:16,911
My loyalty does not sway
with the wind.

626
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,513
I'm leaving
Pearson Hardman

627
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,081
because there's no room
for me there anymore.

628
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,649
You could go anywhere.

629
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,251
Well, I've done
my homework.

630
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,955
You guys are expanding.
You are hiring well.

631
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,457
You're gonna have
a young staff

632
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:30,725
that needs guidance.

633
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,493
You know
that I'm the right fit.

634
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:33,928
And I want
to move now.

635
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,697
You have
a non-compete clause.

636
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,244
Jessica is gonna waive
the non-compete

637
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,666
as long
as I don't take clients.

638
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,736
- I wouldn't if I were her.
- Well, you're not.

639
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:43,004
Harvey wants me gone,

640
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,808
and he has a way
of getting what he wants, so--

641
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,845
There might be
a partnership position

642
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:53,314
for you.

643
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:55,149
Senior partnership.

644
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,652
That, you're gonna have
to earn.

645
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,987
I have earned it.

646
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,388
And I'm not giving up
what I've worked for

647
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:01,589
my whole life.

648
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,592
Louis, you have made
a tactical error.

649
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,094
You've shown me
all your cards,

650
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,695
you can't offer
any clients,

651
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,097
and you're being forced
to leave a place

652
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,298
that doesn't want you.

653
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,368
You are a very good fit
for us.

654
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,037
But if you want
to join us,

655
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,773
you're gonna have to prove
how much you want it.

656
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,008
Please don't do this.

657
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,510
Do what?
I'm just negotiating.

658
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:26,147
You have
an empty title.

659
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:30,051
If you come with us,
I promise

660
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,388
that you will be
truly valued.

661
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,598
Well, that's it.

662
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,566
I've talked to every client
except Trent Devon.

663
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:46,701
Well, I know
why he's returning

664
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,049
Allison's calls
instead of yours.

665
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,270
Because he thinks
we're not focused.

666
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:50,371
That's not enough.

667
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,807
Come on. You taught me
to always ask...

668
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,008
What's in it for him?

669
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,556
"If we're looking
to expand our reach,

670
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,011
"then Trent Devon's
data platform

671
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,847
provides the perfect symbiosis
with our search algorithms."

672
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,551
Page 23,
the CEO of flash-start.

673
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,553
Allison doesn't
represent them.

674
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:08,189
Google bought Meebo
for $100 million.

675
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,524
Allison is trying to do
the same thing

676
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,591
with Flash-Start.

677
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,360
Allison doesn't
represent them.

678
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,796
Pretend she does.

679
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,998
Trent gets $100 million,

680
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,566
but his company
gets swallowed up,

681
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:19,767
and that's not
what he wants.

682
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:20,802
Well, what if they let him run
both companies?

683
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:21,909
That's too good
to be true.

684
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,071
It's happened before.

685
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,039
So if that's true,
all we need to do

686
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,607
is figure out a way
to beat that deal.

687
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,977
We can't beat that deal.

688
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:33,214
Okay.
So what do we do?

689
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:40,955
Why didn't you
just tell me?

690
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,557
Allison said
you had a history

691
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,059
and that it might get in the way
of what she was offering.

692
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,195
- Flash-Start.
- Very good.

693
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,496
But Allison
doesn't represent them.

694
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,798
No, but she does represent
a hedge fund

695
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,101
that's about to buy
a controlling interest.

696
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:54,268
And let me guess.

697
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,903
They want you
to run the whole thing.

698
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,939
We'll take on Google.

699
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,774
And let me guess.

700
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,209
You're here to try
and beat it.

701
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,711
No, I'm here to tell you
to take it.

702
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,079
If I were you,
I would,

703
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,882
and I would hire the lawyer
who brought it to me.

704
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,883
Thanks, Harvey.

705
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:09,984
You're welcome.

706
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:13,755
There's just one thing.

707
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,190
I wonder,
what's in it for her?

708
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:17,391
What are you implying?

709
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,193
Let me look over the deal.
My own time.

710
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,562
If it is what she says it is,
I'll tell you.

711
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,598
If it's not,
you'll want to know.

712
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,266
- Harvey, I already told you--
- Look.

713
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,701
You said
we weren't focused,

714
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,503
and I'm not here to try
to convince you that we were.

715
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,772
But you also said
you've always trusted me,

716
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,611
and I'm telling you,
trust me one more time.

717
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:42,617
Louis.
Do you need something?

718
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:47,922
Actually, yes.

719
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,791
I need you to waive
my non-compete,

720
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,628
so I can take a position
at another firm.

721
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,730
Bratton Gould.

722
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,399
I had nothing to do
with Allison Holt's poaching.

723
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,402
What did
she offer you?

724
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,572
I went to her.

725
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,274
Why?

726
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,977
I got Harvey's message.

727
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,880
What message?

728
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:15,817
You don't know?
It doesn't matter.

729
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,451
This is what he wants.

730
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,690
And this is
what you want?

731
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,258
You know
you can't take clients.

732
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:29,163
Oh, I wouldn't
even if I could.

733
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,164
I have no desire
to hurt our firm--

734
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,333
your firm.

735
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,603
Do you know
why I instituted

736
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:38,272
the Louis Litt
rehabilitation program?

737
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,310
Because I was seduced
by Daniel Hardman once too.

738
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:47,882
He made me feel special
and smart and valued.

739
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,550
The problem was

740
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:52,820
he really didn't give
a shit about me.

741
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,590
But I will give him
one thing.

742
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:59,961
He was right
about you.

743
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:04,966
You deserve
a senior partnership.

744
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,205
I'm gonna let you go,
Louis.

745
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,874
Just for the record,

746
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,477
I am not on the same page
as Harvey.

747
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:19,247
I don't want you
to go.

748
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:35,696
What?

749
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:36,898
Were we really quitting,

750
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,000
or was that just a move
to get to the contract?

751
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,635
You don't think I have
his best interests at heart?

752
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,069
That's not
what I asked.

753
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,871
If it's a good deal,
he should take it.

754
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,139
But you said
it's too good to be true.

755
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:46,974
What else
did I say?

756
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,163
That it's my job
to help you.

757
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,543
So what are you gonna do?

758
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:50,811
I'm gonna go find out
what's too good about it.

759
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:51,913
Goodbye, Mike.

760
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,880
Hey, you can quit
all you want,

761
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:54,582
but Trent Devon
is not leaving.

762
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,718
Okay.
Good talk.

763
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:11,933
Yeah.
You know who I am, asshole.

764
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,868
- I'm sorry. Okay?
- For what?

765
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:15,069
Sleeping with my wife?

766
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:17,071
What, you didn't do it
on purpose?

767
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,306
It's over.
Okay?

768
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:22,109
I swear to God.
You think it's that easy?

769
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:25,413
Keep your goddamn apology,

770
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,116
and stay the hell away
from Tess!

771
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:17,924
Oh, my God.
What the hell happened to you?

772
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:20,160
Oh, I don't want
to talk about it.

773
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,962
Ow.
With me. Now.

774
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,131
This isn't
the first-aid kit

775
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,833
from the kitchen.

776
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,601
Use other people's
antibacterial cream?

777
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,670
Please, I might as well
give myself a staph infection.

778
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:32,939
It's antibacterial.

779
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:34,774
That's what
they want you to believe.

780
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:37,143
- But you're using it.
- Shh.

781
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,079
Looks like
it's gonna bruise.

782
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:42,148
Oh, look, I'm sure
it's gonna be fine, it's--

783
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:47,454
How do you know
how to do this?

784
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:49,422
Bruno used to get
into these fights

785
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,893
with this Maine coon
on the 37th floor.

786
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:55,820
Pumpkin.

787
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:01,534
- No, I don't need it.
- Here you go.

788
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:02,802
- I don't need tissues.
- Are you sure?

789
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,172
Put them down.

790
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,342
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

791
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,244
It's New York.
I got jumped.

792
00:31:11,312 --> 00:31:12,679
Didn't you call 911?

793
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:13,913
To have the police come
and ask a million questions

794
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:15,682
about a guy
who they're never gonna catch?

795
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,517
No, thanks.

796
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:21,387
You knew him.

797
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:25,191
Let's just say
that actions have consequences.

798
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,961
Okay.

799
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:31,164
I get it.
Yeah, I get that.

800
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:33,900
We gonna talk about that box
you were carrying?

801
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:36,302
Oh, man.
What box?

802
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,937
The box
full of personal things

803
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:39,105
from your office?

804
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:43,409
Like you said,
actions have consequences.

805
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,645
- Jessica fired you.
- Mm-mm.

806
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:48,748
She asked me to stay.
She did?

807
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:49,916
Yeah,
because she knows

808
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:51,217
that I would never sell out
this firm.

809
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,385
Well, then I don't
understand, what are you--

810
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,154
Mike, do I have
to spell it out for you?

811
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:56,222
You're Harvey's right hand.
He hates me.

812
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,358
So?
Jessica's the boss.

813
00:31:58,425 --> 00:32:00,593
Come on,
Harvey's always hated you.

814
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:02,328
No, actually.

815
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:04,731
Harvey hasn't
always hated me.

816
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,233
We were never
Elmer and Bugs.

817
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,538
We were...
Ralph and Sam.

818
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:12,739
Who?

819
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,240
Ralph Wolf
and Sam Sheepdog.

820
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,775
The cartoon characters?

821
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:17,143
Yeah.

822
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:20,280
They came to the meadow
every day to work, friendly.

823
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:22,615
But then when they punched
in the time clock,

824
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:24,083
Ralph would try
to steal the sheep,

825
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,518
and Sam would stop him.

826
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:29,422
I mean,
it was brutal.

827
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,158
And then
they'd punch out again.

828
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:34,060
Friends.

829
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:36,629
And that was
me and Harvey.

830
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:39,532
Harvey's not punching out
anymore.

831
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,635
And I can't walk in here
every day

832
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:45,972
knowing that I'm gonna
be working side by side

833
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,207
next to somebody
who despises me.

834
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:51,010
I just--
Mike, I can't.

835
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:54,347
Louis,
if actions have consequences,

836
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:57,917
then maybe actions
can redeem you.

837
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,887
No,
it's too late for that.

838
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:03,356
Die's been already cast.

839
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:04,457
Here.

840
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,825
You can send me
a new tube of Arnica

841
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:07,093
at your convenience.

842
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,394
You don't have
to stay,

843
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:11,464
but I have
some merger projections

844
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,765
that I have to go through
for Harvey.

845
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:16,736
And I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be
out of my depth.

846
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:21,841
Morning.

847
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,644
Thought I'd get in early
and destroy Allison Holt.

848
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,845
How's that going?

849
00:33:25,913 --> 00:33:28,181
- It's a work in progress.
- Mm-hmm.

850
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:30,216
Louis's letter
of resignation.

851
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,564
Found it on my desk
this morning.

852
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:32,619
- Good.
- No.

853
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:35,521
Not good, Harvey.

854
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:37,023
We can agree
to disagree.

855
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:38,691
We're not agreeing
on anything.

856
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,593
You pushed Louis
out the door.

857
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:42,161
It was not your call
to make.

858
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,831
Louis may or may not have
helped Allison,

859
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:48,468
but he has betrayed you, me,
and this entire firm.

860
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:49,469
We're better off.

861
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:50,603
If you
really believe that,

862
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:52,038
then something's
got you off your game.

863
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:53,706
- Jessica, I'm not off my--
- No.

864
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:56,042
Not you.
Me.

865
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,012
Your job
is to help me.

866
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,613
And when I say
you are off your game,

867
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,682
you say,
"how do I get it back?"

868
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,419
I went to Louis
to get him back on board,

869
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:08,554
and you made an end run
around me.

870
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:10,590
When does it stop?

871
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:11,724
We can't let Trent go
with Allison.

872
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,093
He's gonna...get screwed.

873
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:18,131
I'm--I'm sorry.

874
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:19,666
It's nothing.

875
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,768
It's just some stairs.

876
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,705
Oh, God.

877
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,074
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see her there.

878
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:29,242
Who did this to you?

879
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,110
- I'm fine.
- You're not.

880
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,612
And after I'm done
kicking his ass,

881
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,113
the guy who did it
isn't gonna be either.

882
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,949
- Harvey, just let it go.
- That's not who I am.

883
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:38,484
I deserved it.

884
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:41,754
- What did you do?
- I don't want to tell you.

885
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,356
I wouldn't call this
getting your shit together.

886
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:44,691
I don't want to tell you
because of the story

887
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:48,761
you told me about your mom
and your dad.

888
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:51,798
You got off easy.

889
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:55,168
I know.

890
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:58,237
It's a bad deal.

891
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,739
What, you're reading
between the lines?

892
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,975
'Cause I couldn't find anything
in the contract.

893
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,977
Because the problem's
not in the contract.

894
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:05,878
You said it yourself.
The deal's too good to be true.

895
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:07,113
The financials
don't support it.

896
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,815
What, you get your MBA
overnight?

897
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:10,316
No.

898
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,018
You went to Louis?

899
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,386
We worked all night.

900
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,754
He didn't betray us, Harvey.
He found the problem.

901
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,856
They never wanted anything to do
with Trent's company.

902
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,024
After the deal,
they're just gonna sell it off

903
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,325
for spare parts.

904
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:20,827
That won't get them
what they paid for it.

905
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:22,294
But it'll get them
what they wanted.

906
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,263
- Trent.
- Exactly.

907
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,065
Louis figured this out?

908
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:28,134
Trent's contract
has the same problem as Louis's.

909
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:29,335
He's got a non-compete.

910
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:30,470
They couldn't get him
to run the company

911
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:31,471
unless they bought his.

912
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,072
Now Louis wants back in.

913
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,307
No, he doesn't.

914
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,011
This is just his way
of saying he's sorry.

915
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,979
It's not on the menu,
but might I suggest

916
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:48,447
the "I got my ass kicked"
Martini?

917
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,682
It goes well

918
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,250
with the "second-tier law firm"
potato skins.

919
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,518
Those come
with bacon?

920
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:54,920
I don't know,
never had 'em.

921
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,822
I take it
my client's not coming.

922
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,157
He was your client,

923
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,359
but then you offered him
a deal too good to be true.

924
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:03,229
You got
the paperwork.

925
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,598
Because he trusted me.

926
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,233
Well played, Harvey.

927
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,001
No.
Here's the play.

928
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:10,703
He's gonna take
his company public,

929
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,371
like I told him to
months ago.

930
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:15,541
A deal my new client,
a certain hedge fund,

931
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,276
just agreed
to underwrite.

932
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,211
You know Edelson Investments,
don't you?

933
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,379
I do.

934
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,348
Apparently,
I used to represent them.

935
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,016
Ah,
you're taking this well.

936
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,918
What do you want me to do,
cry?

937
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:27,219
Harvey,
we play the game.

938
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,622
Sometimes we win,
sometimes we lose.

939
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,090
Not me.

940
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:34,627
Which brings me
to a suggestion of my own.

941
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,462
Come work
for Bratton Gould.

942
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,696
Come work for <i>you?</i>

943
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:39,065
<i>With</i> me.

944
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:41,172
Did you not hear what I said
about the potato skins?

945
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:42,668
You're second-tier.

946
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:43,969
What about you?

947
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,838
There's blood in the water,
Harvey.

948
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,006
You may have fended off
this attack,

949
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:48,674
but we're not
the only ones circling.

950
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:51,210
We fended you off,
we'll fend off the rest.

951
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:52,411
With who?

952
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,447
I got all
your best senior associates,

953
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:56,515
your future,
and I'm not done.

954
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,551
We'll see
about that.

955
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:01,153
Lunch is on us.

956
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,722
After all, we just landed
a huge, new client.

957
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,192
You say "we,"
but I don't see

958
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,161
your name
on the door.

959
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,796
Mike, Mike, Mike.
I got your call.

960
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,565
You said you owed me one,
right?

961
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:13,833
Yeah,
and I meant it too.

962
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,134
Well,
you're gonna pay me back.

963
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,536
I'm happy to,
'cause listen to me,

964
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:18,838
when I bring you in,

965
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,940
and you kick ass,
I look kick-ass.

966
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,710
Got your resume?
Right there.

967
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:27,847
You gotta be kidding me.

968
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:28,948
Oh, you didn't think
it was gonna be easy

969
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:29,949
to pay me back,
did you?

970
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,317
Harold?

971
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,985
I'm not gonna look kick-ass.

972
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm gonna look ass-kicked.

973
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:37,022
Look at how he did.

974
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,390
Are you kidding me?

975
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,592
You keep saying that.

976
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,860
Man, we talking
about the same Harold?

977
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,461
I know.

978
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,863
Seriously,
Mike, man,

979
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,464
if this doesn't work,
I'm gonna look like shit.

980
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:48,000
Jimmy,
he needs a second chance

981
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,235
just like you did.

982
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:51,570
All right, all right.

983
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,172
You won't regret it.

984
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,206
Harold's great.

985
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,176
You're gonna love
his new tattoo.

986
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,177
He's here,
isn't he?

987
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:01,814
Right over there.

988
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,691
Not only do you retain
one client,

989
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,026
you landed another.

990
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:16,061
I knew there was a reason
why I kept you around.

991
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,764
And a reason Allison Holt's
trying to steal me away.

992
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:21,567
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

993
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,302
What could possibly
go wrong?

994
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,738
Congratulations.
That's what I said to Mike.

995
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,907
Him too?
She's after everyone.

996
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:29,275
Don't worry.
He's staying.

997
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:30,743
Loyal as a basset hound.

998
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,279
Oh.
Are they particularly loyal?

999
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:37,583
I turned her down.

1000
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:38,584
But?

1001
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,654
I want my name
on the door.

1002
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,691
I don't want to end
around you anymore.

1003
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:49,328
I want to discuss things
with you as an equal.

1004
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,163
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?

1005
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:54,466
How long are we gonna walk
by his name on the wall, huh?

1006
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:55,935
They're coming
after us,

1007
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,337
and they're not gonna stop
until we send them a message

1008
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,471
that we are whole.

1009
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,040
I'm not gonna just slap

1010
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,841
someone else's name up there,
Harvey.

1011
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,444
- "Someone"?
- I told you once.

1012
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,947
You don't make decisions
when you're reeling from a loss.

1013
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,983
And your response was,
"let's quit today."

1014
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,618
Not quit.
Fight.

1015
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,553
Without any thought
for the consequences.

1016
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,655
With my gut,
which serves me well.

1017
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:18,490
As a closer,
not a leader.

1018
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:19,592
Jessica.

1019
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,026
Watson, Klyman,

1020
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:22,861
Gallo, Goldberg, Specter.

1021
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,830
The first five senior partners
you named.

1022
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,266
The first five major moves
I made.

1023
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,201
All success stories.

1024
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,370
Last week,
you had me steal someone

1025
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,906
from the D.A.'s office
for reasons you won't say.

1026
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:36,041
We won't even go
into what you did to Louis.

1027
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,010
And then
there's the cherry on top.

1028
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:39,478
- Mike.
- Who showed up this morning

1029
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,513
beaten to a pulp.

1030
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:42,881
He also beat Hardman
to a pulp.

1031
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,417
One day, what he is
isn't going to be enough

1032
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:47,386
to make up
for what he isn't.

1033
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:51,090
Which is
how you feel about me.

1034
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:53,692
Harvey, what was
Michael Jordan's record

1035
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,727
on the Bulls?

1036
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:57,563
664 wins,
285 losses.

1037
00:39:57,631 --> 00:40:00,266
More than twice as many wins
than losses.

1038
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,569
Do you know what his record was
in the front office?

1039
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,904
- No.
- 185 to 291.

1040
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:09,541
Almost twice as many losses
as wins.

1041
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:10,876
You know
how I know that?

1042
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:12,711
Because you knew one day,
I'd come in here

1043
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,948
asking for this.

1044
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,850
Because I look
at the future

1045
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,586
like an adult.

1046
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,921
Are you saying
it's a no?

1047
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:27,226
I'm saying
I'm not rushing this decision

1048
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:30,229
and that your judgment
that day was wrong.

1049
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,505
Thank you.

1050
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,712
- Hey.
- Hey.

1051
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,247
I thought
you'd like to know

1052
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:52,851
that Harold got a job
at another firm.

1053
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,714
Good.

1054
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,223
Look, Rachel--

1055
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,894
He found out,
didn't he?

1056
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,529
I just want you
to know that it was

1057
00:41:03,596 --> 00:41:07,099
after I ended things
with Tess.

1058
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:11,603
I want you to know
that I just don't give a shit.
