1
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,586
I want to, uh--

2
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:33,167
taupe.

3
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,538
- Is that--?
- Justice Thomas.

4
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,539
I knew it.

5
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,573
What can I do for you,
Louis?

6
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:41,742
Ah, to the point.
Of course.

7
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:43,477
I wanted t--

8
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,580
I wanted to congratulate you
on bringing in Pfister Insurance

9
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:47,915
and let you know
I've taken the liberty

10
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,416
of putting together
the initial paperwork.

11
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:51,819
Excellent.
Leave it there.

12
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:53,187
I wanted
to follow it through.

13
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,621
I would relish
the opportunity to--

14
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:57,090
Nonsense.
Louis, it's beneath you.

15
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,593
Oh, I think you'll find
nothing's beneath me.

16
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,196
Are you offering
something untoward to me?

17
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:05,132
I'm simply saying that
I'm not oblivious to the fact

18
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:07,701
that there's change afoot,
firm dynamic-wise.

19
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:09,770
We used to be--huh.

20
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:12,773
Now, we're kinda--hmm.

21
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,375
We might need
a little--hmm.

22
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:16,844
You know?
Louis.

23
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:20,914
I'd like things to operate with
a certain integrity around here.

24
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,583
Oh, I admire
that philosophy.

25
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:24,418
I actually try
to live by it myself.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,886
Good.

27
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:30,023
Now,
can you do me a favor?

28
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,358
Anything.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,227
Send Mike Ross to me.

30
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,929
Ross?
You want to work with Ross?

31
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,464
He's actually
working for me right now

32
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,234
on the Liquid Water
litigation,

33
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,302
and he's been on it for weeks,
and I wish I could do it,

34
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:44,304
but I cannot.
I can't do it right now.

35
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,772
Then forget
I said anything.

36
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:48,275
But I can give you
Dickinson.

37
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,980
Okay.

38
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:55,415
Let me know
how that works out.

39
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,618
With Ross.

40
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,620
Okay.

41
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,690
Um, I am taking Mike exclusively
for the next two weeks.

42
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:04,791
Excuse me?

43
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,660
I'm calling in
my chip.

44
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,862
Our wager? The Price sisters?
My triumph?

45
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,831
Does that ring a bell?
Can't have him.

46
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,899
Oh, well,
then I guess you'd rather

47
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,166
that I announce
to the entire office

48
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:16,003
that the mighty Harvey Specter
is a welcher.

49
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:20,374
I didn't welch.
You passed on him.

50
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,676
Okay, please.
I'm begging you. I need him.

51
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:24,144
Okay,
tell you what, Louis.

52
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,748
Just say out loud that I am
the best closer in New York,

53
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,316
and you can have him.
Fine.

54
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:30,417
To Donna.

55
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,854
- No.
- Then we don't have a deal.

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,155
Welcher.

57
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,524
That was fun.
Morning.

58
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:40,360
If that's a big check,
I want another Marni bag.

59
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:42,129
Hands off the vinyl,
junior.

60
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,031
10:00, nice of you
to join us.

61
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,599
I was closing Cranston
this morning.

62
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,801
Oh, yeah? Couldn't get it done
by 9:00, huh?

63
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:50,537
You're a little lippy
for a Monday.

64
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,373
- What the hell?
- What? What is it?

65
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,208
"Draft of complaint
from Smith and Devane,

66
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,144
threatening to reopen
Randall v. CM,"

67
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:58,679
a case I won
4 years ago.

68
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,013
Randall v. CM?

69
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,149
Ah, accident
on the Merritt Parkway.

70
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:03,984
They claimed it was
Coastal Motors' hood,

71
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:07,454
you killed it in court
by saying it was the driver.

72
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,389
This can't be surprising
to you anymore.

73
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:10,490
They're saying
there's new evidence.

74
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,526
New evidence?
It's product liability.

75
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:14,594
The statute of limitations
is expired.

76
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:16,029
Which means
it's a shakedown.

77
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,497
You gotta quash
that shit.

78
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:19,700
I do, and I will.

79
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:21,468
Whoa.

80
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,204
Come on.
The Spinners? Really?

81
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,039
For your information,
the Spinners were

82
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,709
one of the defining pop bands
of their time.

83
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,277
Oh.
Oh, wow, sorry.

84
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,846
Yeah, that's cool, like, uh,
like, the Jonas Brothers

85
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:37,985
or Hanson or 'NSYNC
or Selena Gomez, yeah.

86
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,288
Come here, lippy.
I want to show you something.

87
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,758
Yeah?
What, you got Bieber fever?

88
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,870
Prepare motions to dismiss
by end of day Thursday,

89
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,472
and don't puss out
when Judge Edelstein

90
00:03:58,474 --> 00:04:00,240
tries to stifle
my brilliance.

91
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:04,611
- He's all yours.
- What?

92
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:05,712
Why the sudden
change of mind?

93
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,080
Does it matter?

94
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,081
You're punishing him,
aren't you?

95
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,549
- Yes.
- So you're saying

96
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,118
working for me is punishment?
As far as I'm concerned,

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,552
this whole conversation's
punishment.

98
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:13,553
Oh, here we go.

99
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:14,921
- Duration?
- One case.

100
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:16,423
- Jurisdiction?
- Exclusive.

101
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,492
- What can I do to him?
- What do you want to do to him?

102
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:21,128
Harvey.

103
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,496
Things.

104
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:23,730
That is not
a legitimate answer.

105
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,198
Honor the boundaries
of labor law?

106
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,566
I prefer
the Geneva Convention.

107
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:29,636
- Then we have a deal.
- We--

108
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,174
I think
I need a sick day.

109
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,250
Careful there,
Harv.

110
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:45,118
That's high-end
Brazilian cherry

111
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,020
from the South American
rainforest.

112
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:49,056
Tanner.
You selling furniture now?

113
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:52,592
No, but if we both did,
I'd sell more than you.

114
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,428
I thought I told you
to stay out of my city.

115
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,297
Can't. I'm the newest senior
partner at Smith and Devane.

116
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,565
Don't get
too comfortable.

117
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,734
If all you're bringing
is the Boston shakedown,

118
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:01,968
you're not gonna
be here long.

119
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,403
Oh, I'm bringing
more than that, Harvey.

120
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:05,205
Randall versus CM
is a winner.

121
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:06,473
That case
was litigated.

122
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:07,707
- Not by me.
- Well, let me

123
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,042
bring you up to speed.

124
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,611
Frank Randall had a history
of substance abuse.

125
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,147
His family tried to blame
Coastal Motors,

126
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,783
but his death had nothing to do
with the carmaker or its design.

127
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:18,452
Yeah, well,
we've got new evidence

128
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:20,020
that contradicts
that assertion.

129
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:22,155
Oh, look at that,
you learned some new words.

130
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:25,425
Even if it were true, the
statute of limitations ran out.

131
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:27,194
Well, what you call
a shakedown,

132
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,830
I call a sure thing.

133
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,364
This is
an internal memo.

134
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:34,000
Showing that CM
knew about engineering defects.

135
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,903
You're on the wrong side
of this one, Harvey.

136
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:38,438
I never saw this thing
in my life.

137
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,308
Sure looks like you did,
and that statute of limitations

138
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,310
doesn't apply
to fraudulent concealment.

139
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:45,178
I didn't conceal
jack shit.

140
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,713
Harvey,
that's for your client.

141
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,116
We want $46 million
and not a penny less,

142
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:51,852
and this,
well, that's for you

143
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:54,187
because we're suing you
and your entire firm for fraud.

144
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:57,657
You really
want to come after me again?

145
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,593
I'm not moving down here
for the Sushi.

146
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:01,728
0 and 2 doesn't look good
on a resume.

147
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,164
You know, I'm thinking
Upper East Side.

148
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,398
Well,
why don't you check out

149
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,668
the corner of
81st and kiss-my-ass?

161
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:46,948
This looks bad,
Harvey.

162
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,683
I don't care how it looks,
it's bullshit .

163
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:50,651
Then tell me what's bullshit
because I'm looking at

164
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:52,920
a document that undermines
your entire defense.

165
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,989
An anonymous memo with names
and dates blacked out.

166
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,858
It's damning, and it
implicates you in a cover-up.

167
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,126
Never crossed my desk.

168
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:04,098
I'm not saying it did.
I'm saying it looks bad.

169
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,633
I don't want Daniel
knowing about this.

170
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,002
I got nothing to hide.
I didn't do anything wrong.

171
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:11,105
I believe you, but you're not
my only concern at the moment.

172
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:13,241
You know full well
what Daniel will do

173
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:15,076
if he finds out
you're being accused of fraud

174
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,544
and it happened
on my watch.

175
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,879
He'll use it against us,
but I also know

176
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,648
that he's familiar
with the people at CM,

177
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,483
and he's bound to find out
sooner or later.

178
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,419
Then make it go away
before it gets to sooner.

179
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,328
Durham Foods
v. Liquid Water.

180
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,330
I need motions to dismiss,
compel,

181
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:37,832
strike,
and change venue.

182
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,033
Why are they not
finished yet?

183
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:40,501
Okay, Louis,
I might be a quick study,

184
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,271
but I'm gonna need a tad
more information than that.

185
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:45,306
Have you heard of Liquid Water?

186
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:49,744
Yeah, sure. Liquid Water.
"We put the I.Q. in liquid."

187
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,412
You see?
You already know the client.

188
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:52,947
- What did they do?
- They didn't do anything.

189
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,115
They're being accused

190
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:55,216
of coming up with
a deceptive slogan.

191
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,051
- By Durham Foods.
- Exactly.

192
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,786
They have their own line
of bottled water, which,

193
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:01,222
by the way,
tastes like a stagnant pond.

194
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:02,790
So how do we
defend against their claim?

195
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,792
Who said anything about "we,"
white man?

196
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,427
My defense is puffery.

197
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:07,928
Oh, you're gonna
stick out your chest?

198
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,397
No, Mike,
"puffery" is--

199
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,598
A big, bold,
empty statement

200
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,166
not meant to be taken as fact,
therefore

201
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,702
not subject to deceptive
advertising litigation.

202
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,604
Touche.

203
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:17,905
See?
It's a solid case.

204
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,341
I agree.
No one would actually believe

205
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,610
that drinking Liquid Water
would raise your I.Q.

206
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:24,412
I mean, who would be
that stupid?

207
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:26,814
I mean, other than people
who actually drink...

208
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,849
Liquid Water.

209
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:32,420
You know what?
Whatever.

210
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,188
Just don't mention that
last part in the deposition,

211
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,189
okay?
Yeah, okay.

212
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:36,724
Wait, Louis?

213
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,293
Um,
if we're claiming puffery,

214
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:41,228
why do I need to waste
all my time with these motions?

215
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,596
All right, let me
explain something to you.

216
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:44,732
We're at war,
and in times of war,

217
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,434
a private does not question
his commanding officer.

218
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:48,602
If I ask you to wipe out
a village, you say, "how high?"

219
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:49,937
- That--
- Which brings me

220
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:51,972
to my next point.
You report to me and me only.

221
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,808
You don't talk about
our business with anyone else.

222
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,676
You're in by 7:00,
you're out no sooner than 10:00,

223
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:58,279
and here's the most important
thing, no sex of any kind.

224
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:00,014
Weakens legs,
clouds your judgment. Got it?

225
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,315
- I'm not sure I do.
- Good.

226
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:04,118
Okay.

227
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,087
No sex.

228
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,255
No sex.
Got it.

229
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:15,596
Oh, my God.

230
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,931
Well?

231
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,733
- Oh, my God.
- Donna,

232
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,568
I need to know
if you ever saw this.

233
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,837
Yes, Harvey,
I saw the smoking gun

234
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,638
in a multimillion-dollar
liability claim,

235
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,674
and I hid it from you.

236
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:29,009
I also know where Amelia
Earhart's living, and I have

237
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,745
the missing 18 minutes
from the Watergate tapes.

238
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:32,012
All right,
take it easy.

239
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,848
I don't like
having my competence questioned.

240
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,616
Yeah, and I don't like
being sued for fraud.

241
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,284
That document
never came into this office,

242
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,786
or you would have
seen it.

243
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,821
Donna, two dozen people
worked on this case,

244
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:42,957
and any one of them could have
seen it and missed it.

245
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,125
I need to know
that didn't happen,

246
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,093
or I need to know
who to fire.

247
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:49,096
Give me an order.

248
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:51,232
Go through every file
in the original case

249
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,200
and make sure
that document isn't in them,

250
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,769
and do it
without anyone knowing.

251
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:57,538
Done.

252
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:02,910
Okay, ha ha,
joke's on me.

253
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:04,412
Aren't you
Louis's boy?

254
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:06,247
Yes, I get it.
No more fondling the vinyl.

255
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:08,949
Or besmirching
the good name of the Spinners.

256
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:11,118
Yes, I totally deserve
to be handed over

257
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,254
to the poor man's Lex Luthor
for that.

258
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,656
Please, Harvey,
you have to get me back.

259
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,991
- Have to?
- Will you?

260
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,559
He thinks
we're going to war.

261
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:21,495
He give you the
"burn down the village" speech?

262
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,963
Yes.
What is it with him?

263
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,632
It's like the pony thing
all over again.

264
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,233
He's, like, the captain
of mixed metaphors.

265
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:28,302
Look, I can't
take you back now.

266
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:30,004
I have to honor my bet,

267
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:32,273
especially since
my honor's in question.

268
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,608
Okay, why are you strangely
emphasizing the word "honor?"

269
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,243
This letter
of complaint.

270
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:38,746
I'm being accused of fraud
by Travis Tanner.

271
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:43,317
Isn't that like the pot
accusing the kettle of...fraud?

272
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm going to the airport
to talk to CM right now.

273
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:47,221
I'm want to reassure
Lawrence Kemp

274
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:48,489
that we're all over this.

275
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:49,924
Please, Harvey, come on.
Take me with you.

276
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,859
I can do this.
I can work for both of you.

277
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,994
It's too risky.
I'm solo on this.

278
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,429
Besides, I've got

279
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:57,832
a relationship with Kemp.
I should talk to him alone.

280
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,300
Not a word to Louis.
Understand?

281
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:01,635
Yeah. Hey, he said
that I can't have sex

282
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:04,605
while I'm working with him.
Is that really his call?

283
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:06,707
Well, he is
your commanding officer.

284
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,301
You looking for <i>Civil Torts,</i>
<i>Volume Three?</i>

285
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:36,170
People put that in criminal law.
I hate that.

286
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:37,505
Yeah, I know.
Me too.

287
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:39,807
Oh, I knew we had something
in common.

288
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,242
You need my help?

289
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,844
Ah no, I've actually
got it right...there.

290
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:46,413
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

291
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,316
Harold, you're the associate,
and I'm the paralegal.

292
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:51,919
It's my job to help you,
not the other way around.

293
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,787
I don't see us
that way.

294
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:57,157
Okay, um, you want to help me?
My--my stapler is broken.

295
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,225
Could you get me
a new one?

296
00:11:58,227 --> 00:11:59,593
I'll get you three.

297
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,195
Harold.

298
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:10,938
Thank you.

299
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,109
Good to see you,
Lawrence.

300
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,176
Harvey,
good to see you.

301
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:17,344
Sorry this had to be
on the fly.

302
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:18,979
It's not a problem.

303
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,514
I want to start
by giving you my word

304
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:23,217
that we crushed this suit once,
we're gonna to crush it again.

305
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,552
I should hope so.

306
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:26,587
I was hoping to have
this discussion privately.

307
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:29,256
Well, this is our new
general counsel, Matt Lasker.

308
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,091
He insisted on being
part of the discussion.

309
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:32,760
Forgive me,
I'm just getting up to speed.

310
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,228
- Then you should know that--
- Out of curiosity,

311
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,963
why did you receive
a draft of the complaint

312
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,832
before we did,
Mr. Specter?

313
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,235
Travis Tanner gave me
an advanced copy.

314
00:12:41,237 --> 00:12:42,403
Must like you.

315
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,104
We have
a special relationship.

316
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,906
- Which I've looked into.
- Harvey,

317
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,975
he really seems to have
a bone to pick with you.

318
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:48,976
That's not gonna be
a problem.

319
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:51,679
May be for us.

320
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:56,317
Tanner came to see you,
didn't he?

321
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,485
- At our request.
- Lawrence, I'm telling you,

322
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,520
we can handle this.

323
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:01,589
We just need
to stick together.

324
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,758
Look, if I'm going to defend us
against this suit--

325
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,228
"If" being
the operative word.

326
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,598
A-am I being fired?

327
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,566
Ww--we're keeping you
on retainer

328
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,268
while we evaluate
our options.

329
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,337
Don't you see, Tanner's trying
to put a wedge between us?

330
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,706
What Lawrence is reluctant
to tell you is,

331
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,307
your relationship
with this man

332
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,209
has put us
directly in his crosshairs.

333
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:24,478
There is
a wedge between us.

334
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,814
Maybe Lawrence's reluctance
stems from the fact

335
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,882
that I also have
a relationship with him.

336
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:31,685
Harvey, I have
a corporate responsibility here.

337
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,821
Well, while you're evaluating
your options,

338
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,090
why don't you think about
who was there for your company

339
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:39,293
four years ago and what happened
to your stock price after I won.

340
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:40,861
Oh, you got paid
very well for that.

341
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:41,895
As were you.

342
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:43,998
You had a huge bonus
that year,

343
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,233
and I don't actually
recall it ever going back down.

344
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,501
There's no need
to get personal.

345
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:49,203
You...our asses
are on the line,

346
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:51,138
and you're trying
to cut me loose--it's personal.

347
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,973
- Harvey--
- Save the "it's not you,

348
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:56,744
it's me" speech, okay?
Be a man and make a clean break.

349
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,078
- Fine.
- No.

350
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,413
You're fired.

351
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:02,149
He's on record.

352
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,257
Remember I told you
it was

353
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:12,159
to work with me and Louis
at the same time?

354
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:13,594
Yes.

355
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,129
We have to take
that risk.

356
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:17,531
I need you to go through
every file in this case.

357
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,366
You mean you want me to find
what you missed?

358
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:20,968
I didn't miss
anything.

359
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,803
I need you to go through
those files

360
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:26,874
and tell me what's not in there.
Shit, I gotta go.

361
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:29,877
What happened?

362
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,279
Well, I got good news
and bad news.

363
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,715
- What's the bad news?
- I got us fired.

364
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:35,749
What's the good news?

365
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,918
Anything we find
from here on out

366
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,354
is no longer covered
by attorney client privilege.

367
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,430
Did you find
what you're not looking for?

368
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,332
No, did you find
what you're not looking for?

369
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:56,035
Nope. Oh, my God,
it is so stuffy in here.

370
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:58,437
What are the symptoms
of carbon dioxide poisoning?

371
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,574
Uh, headaches, dizziness,
mental confusion,

372
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,409
mental confusion.

373
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:07,279
Kevin,
trusts and estates?

374
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,515
No, it's too meek.
It's gotta be a woman.

375
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:10,783
Who is it?

376
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,452
- Harold. I need a stapler.
- I was right.

377
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,653
Okay, there are files
everywhere.

378
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:15,721
He's gonna be suspicious.
What do we do?

379
00:15:15,723 --> 00:15:16,989
Don't worry, I got it.

380
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,990
I got th--
what are you-?

381
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,024
Come here.

382
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,126
Ow!
Oh, come on, you pussy.

383
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,327
- Ow. Okay, what are you--?
- Shh.

384
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:23,129
What's going on?

385
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,131
Come in.

386
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,402
Hi, Harold, honey.

387
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:31,971
Is this why it says,
"Do not enter?"

388
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,106
We're kind of busy in here.
Do you mind if, um...

389
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,307
You know,

390
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,542
you just don't bother us
anymore?

391
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,511
Sure.
No problem.

392
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,949
Yeah, he didn't notice
the files.

393
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,553
Oh, sh--, I'm late for
Louis's settlement conference.

394
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:51,457
Uh, and...thanks.

395
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:54,426
You're welcome.

396
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,195
And then I take the shuttle
to Grand Central,

397
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,563
and then I take the local
from there.

398
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,232
I think you'll find that...
pleasurable, actually.

399
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:01,634
Sorry, restroom.

400
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:04,003
No, that's okay.
This is my associate, Mike Ross.

401
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,373
He was busy, uh, drafting
some pertinent documents.

402
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,378
Motion to dismiss,
motion to compel,

403
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,481
motion to strike,
motion to change venue,

404
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:17,349
and we have another half dozen
in the pipeline.

405
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,118
- No, they're here.
- Oh.

406
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,319
What is this?

407
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:22,021
This was supposed to be
a settlement conference.

408
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,323
Oh, we're not here to settle.
We're proceeding to trial.

409
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,225
You want to take this case
to trial?

410
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:30,029
Um, unless I can't hear
the sound of my own voice,

411
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,697
I believe that's
what I just frickin' said.

412
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,732
We're the little guy.

413
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:36,569
Your parent company's
a behemoth.

414
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:37,937
A jury's gonna hate you.

415
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:39,471
Well, thanks to your
disgusting smears in the media,

416
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:40,940
that might be true,

417
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:43,509
which is why we're also filing
a countersuit for libel,

418
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,911
slander, and anything else
that might be appropriate

419
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:49,181
in this case.
Tortious interference?

420
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:51,383
This is--you got--this is not
good faith, Mr. Litt.

421
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,719
Sir, you have besmirched
the good name of Liquid Water,

422
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,188
and if you think that we're here
for a settlement conference,

423
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,023
well, let me just correct
that one for you right now.

424
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,793
We are not settling.
We will not be settling.

425
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:03,095
In fact, the only thing
that's settling here

426
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:06,599
is the sediment at the bottom
of your putrid water. Get me?

427
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,300
Now be sure to take
that Grand Central shuttle

428
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:11,237
like I told you, okay?
I think you're gonna love it.

429
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,639
- Uh, that was--
- Amazing? I know.

430
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,575
- I'm sorry, Louis, that I, uh--
- Questioned my orders? I know.

431
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,244
I thought it was
just busy work.

432
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,479
Well, it wasn't. For every
hour you spent drafting them,

433
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,780
they're gonna spend
ten hours

434
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:23,816
figuring out
how to argue it back in court.

435
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,551
You're gonna bury them
in paperwork.

436
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:27,086
Look at you.

437
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,388
You catch on quick.
What happens next?

438
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,657
They squirm for a day or two,
reevaluate,

439
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,259
and come back to us
on our terms.

440
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,861
Like...tomorrow,
maybe?

441
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:37,796
Tomo--

442
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:40,966
Mike. Sweet,
impressionable, young Mike.

443
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:42,167
You see,
unlike what Harvey believes,

444
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:43,836
going to trial
is a good thing,

445
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:45,738
especially when the other side
can't afford it.

446
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,973
Durham Foods,
their financials are soft,

447
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,341
but it's gonna take a trial
to put 'em down,

448
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:50,542
so you better
lace up your bootstraps

449
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:51,644
'cause this battle
could take months.

450
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,816
Uh, where you going?

451
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,718
Uh, I just
have to go back...

452
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,420
to, uh, the bathroom.

453
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:02,621
You just went.

454
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,989
Are you keeping track?

455
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,759
I may start.

456
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:14,166
I don't mean to intrude,
but Donna's not at her desk.

457
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:16,168
Do you have a minute?

458
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:20,873
I overstepped last week.
I want to make up for it.

459
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,274
It's not necessary,
Daniel.

460
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:24,343
Pfister Insurance.
I thought

461
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:27,813
maybe we could handle them
together.

462
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,649
I'm gonna to have
to take a rain check.

463
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,685
It's a peace offering, Harvey.
Take it.

464
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,253
You know, I'm sorry,

465
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:36,956
but my plate's just
a little full at the moment.

466
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,590
Do you mind if I ask
with what?

467
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,826
Uh, the usual.
I have six situations,

468
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,294
all in need
of immediate attention.

469
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:45,798
Which begs the question,
why not add one more?

470
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:51,537
I'll see if I can free up
some time next week, okay?

471
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,012
Um...I think
I didn't find something.

472
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,181
Let me
not have it then.

473
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,084
During the two years
before our car was manufactured,

474
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,186
there was this mid-level
quality control manager

475
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,355
named Sarah Layton,
who wrote several reports

476
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,024
on other CM car models
but never on ours.

477
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,959
So she's not relevant
to our case.

478
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:17,363
It would appear that way,
but after May 5th, 2006,

479
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,398
she never wrote
another report ever again.

480
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,966
That's kind of a coincidence,
isn't it?

481
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,602
That on the exact date that
our car went into production,

482
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:25,437
she disappeared
from CM's records?

483
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,672
She could've just
been fired.

484
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:27,840
Never filed
for unemployment.

485
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:31,176
- Could've quit.
- No exit interview.

486
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:32,277
Permanent unpaid leave.

487
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,712
Gets out of any records.

488
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,214
And nothing to tie her
to our car.

489
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,448
She wrote that memo.

490
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,983
- Very smart.
- Thank you.

491
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,284
I meant them,
not you.

492
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:41,587
But I found it.
That makes me even smarter.

493
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,555
Don't be cocky.
It's unbecoming.

494
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,291
On you. I can pull it off.

495
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:49,061
You better be nice to me
because I know where she lives.

496
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,830
Where who lives?

497
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,098
My high school sweetheart.
We connected on Facebook.

498
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,534
Oh. Bullshit,
you're not that sentimental.

499
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,770
- Yes, I am.
- She was his first.

500
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:02,608
Deposition tomorrow.
Be ready.

501
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:07,813
- First?
- I had to sell it.

502
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,581
Give me the address
and tell Donna to hurry up.

503
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,317
I'm naked to the world
down here.

504
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,653
Harvey,
there is one problem.

505
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,889
If this woman was involved
in the original cover-up,

506
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,290
she's not gonna want
to talk to a lawyer

507
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:19,725
who isn't on her side
anymore.

508
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,261
Well, I better think of
something on my way down there.

509
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,603
I went to the file room
to get you the good stapler,

510
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,072
but there was
a bit of a snafu.

511
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:35,574
- In the file room?
- I don't want to get into it.

512
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:39,111
In the meantime, I brought you
my own personal stapler,

513
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,914
a two-hole punch, three-hole
punch, old-school wite-out,

514
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,049
and enough highlighters
to last you till kingdom come.

515
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:45,417
Look, Harold, I-I know

516
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,786
that you don't see us
as paralegal and associate,

517
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,922
but I think it's best
from now on

518
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:52,558
that I just help you.

519
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,493
Because the truth--
the truth is,

520
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:58,564
you are far too valuable
to be wasting your time on this.

521
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:01,200
I am?

522
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:02,634
You're right.
Yeah.

523
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,369
And besides, you probably
don't want all this stuff,

524
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:05,504
anyway.
Well, there's that.

525
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:06,839
Except for the stapler,
of course.

526
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:09,341
You got it. Of course.
Thank you.

527
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:29,795
Sarah Layton?

528
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:33,132
You recognize me.

529
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:34,700
I do.

530
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:37,369
Then you know
who I work for.

531
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:38,637
Coastal Motors.

532
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:40,806
I'm not gonna deny that.

533
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:43,909
What do you want?

534
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,677
We have a problem.

535
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,781
I need you to tell me everyone
you've ever shown this to.

536
00:21:54,654 --> 00:21:55,888
I never showed it
to anyone.

537
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,157
Ms. Layton,
I don't care that you wrote it.

538
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,858
You made a deal
to keep your mouth shut,

539
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,093
and I believe
you kept it.

540
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,628
All I care about
is who else read it.

541
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,197
I don't know
who else read it...

542
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,465
'Cause I didn't write it.

543
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:07,866
- Ms. Layton--
- I brought my concerns

544
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,368
to Mr. Kemp.

545
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,670
He told me not to put anything
in writing, and I never did.

546
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:13,605
Good.

547
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:15,007
I need you
to swear to me

548
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,075
that you never
told anyone

549
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:19,211
other than Lawrence Kemp
about the flaws in his hood.

550
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,014
You listen to me.

551
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:24,082
He promised he'd fix
the problems on the line

552
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,485
if I kept quiet.
He did,

553
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:29,922
but he never went back and fixed
the ones we already made,

554
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:31,523
and that man died.

555
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:35,127
I have been living with that
ever since.

556
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:38,997
Now get off my property,
and leave me the hell alone.

557
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:57,182
Furniture salesman
to limo driver.

558
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:58,784
You're stepping up
in the world.

559
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:00,586
Well, it's nice to know
you still have a sense of humor,

560
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,121
Harvey, considering you just
learned you defended a murderer.

561
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:05,624
I should've known
you'd have me followed.

562
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:08,393
Follow you?
I've been waiting for you.

563
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,529
I told you,
you're on the wrong side.

564
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:11,797
I don't defend murderers.

565
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,933
That's not
what that woman just told you.

566
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,169
You wanted me
to find her.

567
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:20,272
You have the document.
No proof of fraud.

568
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,374
Can't admit it
without fraud.

569
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,109
Now that you know
Kemp lied on the stand--

570
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,778
I'm obligated to come forward
and tell the court. Otherwise--

571
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,248
Even if you weren't
guilty of fraud then,

572
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,916
you'll be guilty
of fraud now.

573
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,417
Of course,
when you do come forward,

574
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:33,986
it's going to be awfully hard
for people to believe

575
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:35,454
you didn't know about it
at the time.

576
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,788
You know
I didn't know.

577
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,390
I don't know
anything of the kind.

578
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:41,960
What I do know is,
you're in a bind.

579
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:44,663
I wouldn't wait
too long now.

580
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:47,399
I'd hate to have to report you
to the bar.

581
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:00,810
Lawrence goddamn Kemp.

582
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:02,945
Harvey, I need this suit
quashed, and I need it done now,

583
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:06,382
so channel your anger
and find a way out.

584
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:08,451
I mean, I knew I had an enemy
in Tanner, but--

585
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:10,820
Did you ever think that
the person you should be mad at

586
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,388
is yourself?
Excuse me?

587
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,023
Law 101.

588
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,725
Don't ask your client
if he committed murder,

589
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:18,060
but sure as hell find out
if there's a smoking gun.

590
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,563
Jessica, I'm sorry,
I wasn't born yesterday,

591
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:23,199
but he swore to me there was
nothing wrong with that car,

592
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:24,200
and I believed him.

593
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:25,768
Well, he lied to you.

594
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,404
It's not the first time,
and it won't be the last,

595
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:30,673
but now Tanner knows it.

596
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:32,041
I guess
it's time to tell Daniel.

597
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:33,542
What? Now?
No.

598
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:35,611
I just had the chance
to tell him, and I didn't.

599
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:37,246
- Why not?
- Because you told me not to.

600
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,048
The one time
you listen to me.

601
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,616
No, no, no, no.
You can't lay into me

602
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:43,019
every time I go against you
and then flip it around now.

603
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:45,288
We're not telling.
I'm gonna fix it.

604
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,390
Well, the one way to fix it
is to negotiate a settlement.

605
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:50,559
Oh, wait, we can't
because you got us fired.

606
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:54,630
I did, which means
there's nothing stopping us

607
00:24:54,632 --> 00:24:55,998
from strong-arming them.

608
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,101
I gotta go.

609
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:01,270
Just admit it.
Your research suggests

610
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:04,674
that consumers believe
your water tastes like shit.

611
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:06,008
Do I have
to answer that?

612
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,443
What exactly
are you getting at, Mr. Litt?

613
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:09,578
What I'm getting at is,
Mr. Kessler is aware of the fact

614
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,148
that his company's product
can't compete with ours

615
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,482
'cause it tastes
like shit,

616
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:15,885
and they resorted
to filing a bogus lawsuit

617
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:18,287
against us in a desperate
attempt to hide that fact.

618
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,890
No, you don't
have to answer that.

619
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:22,358
Hey, Mike--

620
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,860
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

621
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:26,529
Kevin, right?

622
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:28,064
How long have you
worked at Durham Foods?

623
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:30,533
22 years.
I started right out of college.

624
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:31,767
That's dedication.

625
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,136
I admire that.

626
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:35,705
What's your current title?

627
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,540
Vice president
of Market Research.

628
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:38,874
It says here,
three years ago,

629
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:41,610
you applied
for senior vice president,

630
00:25:41,612 --> 00:25:45,281
but they gave the job
to an Alan Stansby instead,

631
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:48,017
a man who had been at the
company far shorter than you.

632
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,251
Correct.

633
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:50,252
Well, how'd that
make you feel?

634
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:51,487
Yes or no questions.

635
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:52,788
My client's not here
to discuss feelings.

636
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,824
Okay, truthfully,
you were hoping to be

637
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:57,760
further up the corporate ladder
by now, weren't you?

638
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,829
Maybe.

639
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,130
Thank you, Mike.

640
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:02,365
And once again,

641
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:05,434
recently you applied
for a senior VP position

642
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:07,470
and were turned down.
Is that correct?

643
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:08,938
- Yes.
- You do know that

644
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,807
management is going outside the
company to fill the job, right?

645
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:13,576
Objection.
Lack of foundation.

646
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:14,577
You know what?
I am so sorry. That was--

647
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,011
that's off the record.

648
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,213
That's just because of
a headhunter friend of mine--

649
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:18,614
That's not--no,
we object to that too.

650
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:19,682
I'm warning you,
Mr. Litt.

651
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:22,685
I'm sorry.
Statement withdrawn.

652
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:29,692
You know, you can tow
the party line, Kevin...

653
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:33,629
but I know exactly

654
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:36,465
what it's like to bust your ass
every day at a company

655
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:39,135
and be overlooked for
a promotion time and time again.

656
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:42,638
It just...

657
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,373
hurts.

658
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,543
Just physically hurts.

659
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:49,745
Right here.

660
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:53,916
Give 110% every day,
and for what?

661
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:58,821
So they can just...
chip away at your dignity?

662
00:26:58,823 --> 00:27:02,825
You can be the, uh,
loyal soldier today,

663
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:08,197
be the cannon fodder
for your bosses,

664
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:10,299
or you can turn the guns on 'em
right now,

665
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:11,467
and you can just
tell me the truth.

666
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:12,535
We're done here.

667
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:14,103
- It's true.
- Kevin.

668
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:15,771
- Our product sucks.
- No, objection.

669
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:17,273
You can't object
to your own witness.

670
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:18,307
We're suing 'cause
we're losing market share.

671
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,575
- Kevin.
- There's nothing wrong

672
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:24,480
with your ad campaign,
and that's the truth.

673
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:26,348
Thank you, Kevin.

674
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:31,187
Uh, Louis,
that was awesome.

675
00:27:31,189 --> 00:27:32,254
That was pretty spectacular,
wasn't it?

676
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:33,823
His testimony
is gonna be amazing.

677
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:35,724
I got him to admit
some damning things, didn't I?

678
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,560
You know, we should subpoena
the outside company

679
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:38,694
that put together
the focus groups.

680
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:39,728
- Yes.
- We should get

681
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,230
all their records...
Like it.

682
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:42,498
And the names and addresses
of the people who took part.

683
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,966
They're protected
in civil actions

684
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:45,501
under the privacy statute
of '74.

685
00:27:45,503 --> 00:27:47,470
No, that was overturned
by Kressler v. Symtech.

686
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:49,138
Not if they'd
been compensated,

687
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,339
as is this case
right here.

688
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:51,874
We're gonna
win this thing.

689
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:54,643
"If I can't win,
I won't run."

690
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:55,945
- What?
- "If I can't win,

691
00:27:55,947 --> 00:27:57,746
I won't ru--"
that's <i>Chariots of Fire.</i>

692
00:27:57,748 --> 00:27:59,882
Come on. Do you--don't tell me
you don't know that film.

693
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:01,450
You know,
like what you and Harvey do,

694
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:02,485
the--the movie quotes.

695
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:03,686
I forgot.
It's--yeah.

696
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:05,154
Well, it's been a long time
since I saw it,

697
00:28:05,156 --> 00:28:06,489
you know. It's a great,
great flick though.

698
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:07,890
Yeah.

699
00:28:07,892 --> 00:28:09,325
Anyway, all right.
So, um,

700
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:12,862
make sure the subpoenas
are on my desk in the morning.

701
00:28:12,864 --> 00:28:14,997
Oh, Mike, uh,

702
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:18,000
make it the afternoon
'cause you've earned it.

703
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:26,509
Good night,
Tommy.

704
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:31,881
Lawrence,
what a coincidence,

705
00:28:31,883 --> 00:28:33,716
me running into you
in your own building.

706
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:34,884
I certainly
wasn't waiting for you.

707
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:36,452
Harvey.

708
00:28:36,454 --> 00:28:37,686
Ah,
it's better this way.

709
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:39,555
Your new lawyer
won't hear what I have to say

710
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:41,490
and be put in a position
to commit fraud,

711
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:43,893
like you did to me.

712
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:46,762
I don't know what you think
you know, but it's wrong.

713
00:28:46,764 --> 00:28:49,765
I know about
Sarah Layton.

714
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:57,106
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

715
00:28:57,108 --> 00:29:01,010
But whatever you know, Harvey,
is privileged information.

716
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:03,913
Not if I found out yesterday,
and definitely not

717
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,915
if you conspired
for me to commit fraud.

718
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,116
There's no fraud.

719
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:08,851
She found a problem,
and you tried to--

720
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:11,186
And I fixed it,
and there's no record!

721
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:13,222
That's what a solid front end

722
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:15,558
feels like,
but you didn't make one,

723
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,360
so when Frank Randall's car
hit the divider

724
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:20,429
at 50 times the force
that you just felt,

725
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,431
it crumpled
and split him in half.

726
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,966
Then I savaged
his reputation,

727
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:25,568
all because
you looked me in the eye

728
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,870
and told me that your hood
was rock solid.

729
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:31,440
What do you want,
Harvey?

730
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:33,242
What you should have done
in the first place.

731
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:36,412
Pay these people
and make this thing go away.

732
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:38,447
If you don't,
I'm coming forward

733
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,050
and telling the court
what I know.

734
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:45,154
Even if I didn't want to,
I'd have to, but I want to,

735
00:29:45,156 --> 00:29:48,257
and when I do, Coastal Motors
is gonna cut you loose

736
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,025
exactly the same way
you did to me,

737
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:53,228
so either you make it right
on your own, or I will.

738
00:29:58,123 --> 00:29:59,491
Hey, I got the subpoenas.

739
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:00,947
I said the afternoon.

740
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,915
It's the first thing
in the morning.

741
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,350
War doesn't wait
for the afternoon.

742
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:07,520
Sweeter words
have never been spoken.

743
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,723
Gentlemen,
before you do any more work,

744
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,325
Durham Foods
is declaring bankruptcy.

745
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:13,893
- Yes.
- Damn.

746
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,795
- Damn? We win.
- No, now if there's a judgment

747
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,063
on the countersuit,
we're gonna be

748
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,931
in the back of the line
behind a dozen lenders.

749
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:22,034
Sorry. I know you've been
working on this for weeks.

750
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:26,939
Uh, yeah. Yeah, well,
what are you gonna do?

751
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:32,645
We can still get a win-win out
of this whole thing.

752
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:33,980
- How?
- Well, you said that

753
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,115
their other products are
worth real money, right?

754
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,351
So why don't we just
advise Liquid Water

755
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:41,554
to buy the whole company
and then just give up the suit?

756
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:43,489
We kill the competition
and get their other products

757
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:45,157
at a discount
to market value.

758
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,160
- Win.
- Win.

759
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:01,474
Why'd you cover
for me?

760
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:02,475
What do you mean?

761
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,343
With Hardman
out there.

762
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:06,579
You let him think
that we were working together.

763
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:09,181
In the deposition yesterday
when you were--

764
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:12,218
you know, when you were
talking about not--

765
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,155
I've just really enjoyed
working with you, Louis.

766
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,424
- You have?
- Yeah, sure.

767
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,763
Well, I thought Harvey
might have poisoned the well

768
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:27,667
in regards to any relationship
between the two of us.

769
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,035
Louis,
can I be honest with you?

770
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:30,703
- Yeah, I can keep it real.
- As far as

771
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:33,372
poisoning the well goes,

772
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,208
Harvey didn't really
have anything to do with it.

773
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,077
That's pretty much
all been you.

774
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,578
What are you
talking about?

775
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,180
Among other things,

776
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:45,117
you tried to sabotage
my relationship with Jenny.

777
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,119
After you laughed
at that video of me.

778
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,554
You stuck me
in housing court.

779
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:49,922
'Cause you stole a client
from me.

780
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,958
You tried to blackmail me
with a fake drug test.

781
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,559
Yeah,
but it didn't work.

782
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:55,194
You defeated me.
So?

783
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:56,862
So it's water
under the bridge.

784
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:59,598
No, no, no.
Not water under the bridge.

785
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,400
Louis, you can't do that
to people and expect them

786
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:04,136
to forget about it and move on.
Don't you get that?

787
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:07,139
- They should.
- Would you?

788
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:12,545
Okay.

789
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:17,683
Mike, I will take
your thoughts...

790
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,754
on my behavior
under advisement.

791
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,792
Wait, Mike?
Yeah?

792
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:31,998
Something's in the air still.
Like a pall of secrecy

793
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,733
or a layer of unease.

794
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,735
I don't know
what you're talking about.

795
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,603
Mm, my spider parts
are tingling.

796
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:39,438
Please don't ever
say things like that.

797
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,342
Harvey's up to something.
I know it. What is he up to?

798
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:48,114
I don't know.

799
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:50,683
- You sure?
- Yes.

800
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,865
Um, Louis's parts
are tingling.

801
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:08,501
I don't want to know what
that means or how you know that.

802
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:10,102
It means he knows
you're hiding something.

803
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,038
Well, if everything goes
like I expect,

804
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,339
there won't be
anything to hide.

805
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:15,074
Good, because it just
doesn't feel right lying.

806
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,776
You know, I actually kind of
like working with him.

807
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:17,977
He's not a bad lawyer.

808
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:20,112
I mean, you know,
we have fun.

809
00:33:20,114 --> 00:33:22,715
You guys thinking about
moving in together?

810
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,617
Jealous?

811
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:27,686
Where's your gatekeeper?

812
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:30,589
Any Tom, Dick, or Harry
can just waltz right in.

813
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,325
Well, I don't see
any Toms or Harrys here, but--

814
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:35,061
Okay, can we just please
cut the small talk

815
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,962
and you let me know
what I'm not privy to?

816
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:38,464
I don't know
what imaginary world

817
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:40,132
you're skipping through
right now, Louis,

818
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,802
but you're there
all by yourself.

819
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,837
Right.

820
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,972
So first you hand me Ross
on a silver platter,

821
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:48,574
then Donna's not at her desk
for days.

822
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:50,576
You think that I don't know
that there's a power struggle

823
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:52,545
going on
between Jessica and Hardman?

824
00:33:54,047 --> 00:33:57,283
Harvey, look,

825
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,520
I admit I haven't
always been, um...

826
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:04,924
well-behaved,

827
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:08,594
but I can help you on this.
You just gotta trust me.

828
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:12,531
Louis, go away.

829
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:22,141
- That was harsh.
- You kidding me?

830
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,843
He came hat in hand,
Harvey.

831
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,011
Have you met him?
This guy gets one whiff

832
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:27,746
of what we've been hiding
from Hardman,

833
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:30,182
I guarantee you it's his office
he's in, not ours.

834
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:32,284
I know,
we can't trust him.

835
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:34,153
Still, you should have seen him
in this deposition.

836
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,721
I mean, all he wants
is to be you.

837
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:36,989
Isn't that
what everybody wants?

838
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,390
- I'm serious, Harvey.
- Well, I'm sorry.

839
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:40,192
That's just pathetic.
I know, but what I'm-

840
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:42,361
- Harvey Specter.

841
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:45,364
Harvey, it's Lawrence Kemp.
Give 'em what they want.

842
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:47,299
- Good.
- Is that it?

843
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:48,701
You want a medal?

844
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,503
For what it's worth,
I never meant

845
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,638
to put your reputation
on the line,

846
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,473
and that memo
never crossed my desk.

847
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,741
Goodbye, Lawrence.

848
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:57,243
They're settling?
You wanted that?

849
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,145
Wanted it?
I goddamn orchestrated it.

850
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,046
CM pays what they should have
in the first place.

851
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:02,448
And the suit against us
goes away.

852
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,250
And Daniel Hardman's
none the wiser.

853
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:05,251
Where the hell's Donna?

854
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:06,986
She's in the file room.

855
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:08,921
Hasn't found
that document yet.

856
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,159
There is no document.

857
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:14,927
So you believe him?

858
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:18,864
Not really. I just remember
who we're dealing with.

859
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,941
Harvey.

860
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:32,478
What are you doing here?

861
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,515
Nothing. Just delivered
CM's settlement offer to Smith.

862
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,484
Or Devane.

863
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,352
I can't remember,
I can't tell those guys apart.

864
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:41,720
It's not their case.

865
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,623
No, but it is their firm,
and I don't trust you.

866
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,492
Our offer
was take it or leave it.

867
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:48,727
Well, we took it.
And now we're done.

868
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,029
Hmm, well,
I'm afraid there's still

869
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,131
the little matter
of our fraud claim against you.

870
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,600
Tanner, I'm glad you did
what you did.

871
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:56,468
The Randall family
deserved that money,

872
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,370
but let's not pretend
you've got shit on me.

873
00:35:58,372 --> 00:35:59,572
Excuse me?

874
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,707
You used that memo
to get what you wanted,

875
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,476
but it never would have held up
in court because you wrote it.

876
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:06,745
That's
a scintillating argument.

877
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,214
Too bad
not a word of it's true.

878
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:09,848
Well, let's take a look
at your resume.

879
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,551
Witness tampering,
extortion, bribery.

880
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:14,053
Forgery fits right in.

881
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:16,388
That document's
the real deal, Harv,

882
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,057
and as far as
reputations go,

883
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,760
I know all about your dirty
dealings in the D.A.'s office.

884
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,130
Unlike your theories about me,
you were actually investigated

885
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:28,500
for the very thing you're being
accused of, burying evidence--

886
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:30,869
a point I can't wait
to bring up in court.

887
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:32,838
You're the one
with the problem, Harv.

888
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,074
You know
I didn't do this.

889
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:37,376
Hey, thanks for settling
the case for me, buddy,

890
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:39,178
but I said I wanted
a pound of flesh

891
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,049
from CM and you,
and I meant it.

892
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:46,085
- That was harsh.
- You kidding me?

893
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:47,686
He came hat in hand,
Harvey.

894
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,922
Have you met him?
This guy gets one whiff

895
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:51,624
of what we've been hiding
from Hardman,

896
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,993
I guarantee you it's his office
he's in, not ours.

897
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,161
I know,
we can't trust him.

898
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:57,997
Still, you should have seen him
in this deposition.

899
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,632
I mean, all he wants
is to be you.

900
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,699
Isn't that
what everybody wants?

901
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:01,867
I'm serious, Harvey.

902
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:03,035
I'm sorry,
that's just pathetic.

903
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,336
I know,
but what I'm--

904
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,804
- Bothering you?

905
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,341
No.
No, not at all.

906
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:10,643
I heard about
your proposal

907
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,745
to buy Durham Foods
out of bankruptcy.

908
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:13,846
Impressive.

909
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:16,215
Well, the way I see it
is a win-win.

910
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:19,251
Way to think
outside the box.

911
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,754
It was actually
Mike Ross's idea.

912
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,756
I'm glad to see
it all worked out.

913
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:32,865
Louis...

914
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:36,468
you seem upset
about something.

915
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,471
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

916
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,876
Jessica Pearson,
leading by example.

917
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:52,278
Spare me the charm, Harvey.
Give it to me straight.

918
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,748
CM settled.
$46 million.

919
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,683
1/3 to Frank Randall's widow,

920
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,052
the rest into a blind trust
for his children.

921
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:00,220
You're pleased
with that?

922
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:01,421
Damn straight I am.

923
00:38:01,423 --> 00:38:03,289
When's the other shoe
gonna drop?

924
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,924
What makes you think
there's another shoe?

925
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:08,094
It's Tanner.
There's always another shoe.

926
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:11,031
They're still
coming after us for fraud.

927
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,400
It's time
to pay the Piper.

928
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:15,402
You want to tell him,
or shall I?

929
00:38:15,404 --> 00:38:18,705
Well, we'll worry
about that tomorrow.

930
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:20,373
What the hell gives you two
the right

931
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,409
to hide a lawsuit
against my firm from me?

932
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:26,346
- Daniel--
- I am not done yet.

933
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,816
When were you planning on
telling me this?

934
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,317
When the case
went to court?

935
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:35,121
When our malpractice insurance
ran out?

936
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:37,624
Are the two of you
so shortsighted

937
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:40,193
that you would allow
your distaste of me

938
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:43,997
to impair your ability
to run this firm?

939
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:49,135
When you came five years ago
to blackmail me, I was furious.

940
00:38:49,137 --> 00:38:53,106
You told me that I was
blaming you for my own actions.

941
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:55,608
I wasn't just embezzling,
but I also tried to cover it up.

942
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,744
Well, that's what you were
so busy doing

943
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:59,045
the other morning,
covering it up.

944
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,513
You had the chance to tell me,
and you didn't.

945
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:01,948
- No, I didn't.
- Why?

946
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,383
I don't trust you.

947
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:04,717
That's not true.

948
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,154
He didn't tell you
because I don't trust you.

949
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:10,590
Tell me you're not gonna
use this as some power play.

950
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,259
That's exactly
what I should do,

951
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:14,661
but I am gonna
give you the chance

952
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:16,763
I have been asking you
to give me,

953
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:18,832
the chance
to redeem yourself.

954
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:19,999
How?

955
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,302
They're not just
coming after you.

956
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:25,672
They're coming after
all of us.

957
00:39:25,674 --> 00:39:29,075
Pearson. Hardman.

958
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,677
What are you proposing?

959
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,646
We fight them
together.

960
00:39:35,182 --> 00:39:37,350
Okay.

961
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:44,991
You trust him?

962
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:47,994
At the moment,
we don't really have a choice.

963
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:56,836
Looking good, Louis.

964
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:02,175
You're supposed to say,
"feeling good, Billy Ray."

965
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:05,578
You know, <i>Trading Places.</i>
<i>Movie quotes, it's what we do.</i>

966
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,180
You want something?

967
00:40:07,182 --> 00:40:09,215
Uh, well,
I just heard

968
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:11,584
that you ran with my idea
about buying out Durham Foods,

969
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:13,786
and Hardman told me
you gave me the credit,

970
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:17,023
so...
Team Litt-Ross.

971
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:22,095
I told him because I don't
like to owe anyone anything.

972
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:25,698
You covered for me with him
earlier, so I threw you a bone.

973
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,467
Now we're even.
Where's this coming from?

974
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,801
I'll tell you
where it's coming from.

975
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:30,970
You were right.
Actions have impact.

976
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:35,275
So you want to remember
the marijuana and tennis thing?

977
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:38,278
Well, I'm gonna
remember things too.

978
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,494
How's your budding bro-mance
with Louis?

979
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,396
Evidently,
it's over.

980
00:40:56,398 --> 00:40:58,598
So fickle is the heart.

981
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,402
What's going on with you?
Why are you being so...weird?

982
00:41:02,404 --> 00:41:04,170
Tanner took the deal.

983
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:05,405
So it's done.

984
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:08,441
No. He's still
coming after me for fraud,

985
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:10,643
and a lot of people are gonna
think I buried that document.

986
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:12,278
How can you bury
what doesn't exist?

987
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,746
Doesn't matter.

988
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:18,618
They'll think it happened once,
it could happen again.

989
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,421
So why are you smiling?

990
00:41:21,423 --> 00:41:24,324
Because I know
what they don't.

991
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:26,693
You're gonna
beat Tanner.

992
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:30,563
I'm not just gonna beat him.
When I'm done with him,

993
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:33,700
his own mother
won't even recognize him.

994
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:57,423
Ah, that's where you are.
I've been looking for you.

995
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:03,596
You okay? You look like
you're gonna be sick.

996
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:05,698
Oh, God, you know,
actually, I do,

997
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,267
I feel like
I'm coming down with something.

998
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:09,469
Do you think that maybe
you could grab me a water?

999
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:11,738
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
