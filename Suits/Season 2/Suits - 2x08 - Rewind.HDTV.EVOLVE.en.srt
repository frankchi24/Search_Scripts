Original Air Date on August 9, 2012

2
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:11,912
You're late.

3
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:13,047
Nope.
30 seconds early.

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,849
Good.
Learning to tell time.

5
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:15,950
Ha ha ha.

6
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,384
I won't be in today.

7
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:19,153
What?
Does Jessica know?

8
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:20,588
I don't tell Jessica
everything.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,456
Oh, it's like a "Harvey
Specter's day off"

10
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,858
kind of a thing?
Should I call Ed Rooney,

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,226
see if we can
get Sloane out of school?

12
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:26,560
Not in the mood today.

13
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:27,895
Life moves pretty fast
if you don't

14
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,396
stop and look around
once in a while.

15
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:30,464
What do you think about
Hardman running for

16
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,565
managing partner?

17
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,033
- Think he's going to win.
- Why?

18
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,802
Because you don't
call for a vote

19
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:35,970
unless you have the votes.

20
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:37,171
Good.

21
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:39,206
We need to tip the scales
in her favor.

22
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,241
Okay. What do you
need me to do?

23
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:41,242
I need you to step up.

24
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:42,843
You're not going to
like it.

25
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,879
And Jessica can't know
it came from me.

26
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,981
I gave Hardman the road map
to settling with Tanner.

27
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,082
You voted for it.

28
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:49,216
Haven't we done enough
to Jessica?

29
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:51,085
We're not doing this
to Jessica,

30
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:54,021
we're doing this
<i>for</i> Jessica.

31
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:56,056
We gonna cross the line
with this?

32
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,291
We've been crossing lines

33
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,059
long before we even
ever met.

34
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,753
How do I know the Patriots
aren't going 19-0?

35
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,522
Because no team from Boston
is going undefeated

36
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:30,491
when the road
goes through New York.

37
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:31,659
You got that right.

38
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,294
Goddamn Patriots.

39
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:35,529
- Your dad called.
- I'll call him later.

40
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,931
He always asks why
the idiots in charge

41
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,465
haven't made you
partner yet.

42
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,367
He's so proud.
It's sweet.

43
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,604
He's right.

44
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,606
You have that look
on your face.

45
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,610
Louis is getting
a secretary.

46
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:50,911
Her name...

47
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:52,146
is Norma.

48
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:53,180
What is she,
100 years old?

49
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,181
She won't last a week.

50
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:56,383
You heard it here first.

51
00:01:56,385 --> 00:02:00,321
Oh, and Jessica's
on her way down.

52
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:03,324
So, you buried
the Jessica news

53
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,792
to lead with
the Louis news.

54
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,528
I'm not apologizing
for who I am.

55
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:11,665
Hi, is this the location of
the douchebag convention?

56
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,234
It is now.

57
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,569
I thought you
went to work.

58
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,805
- I had to get this.
- Whoa.

59
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,140
Look at that.
The world's smallest burrito.

60
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,276
Which is why I got more.

61
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:25,479
Whoa.
Breakfast of champions.

62
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:26,513
Trevor, I can't.

63
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:27,615
I'm a bike messenger.

64
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:31,085
I deliver packages,
or people die.

65
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:32,653
Am I gonna have to give you
a code red?

66
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,355
Mm...

67
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:35,623
- Okay.
- Ohh.

68
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,625
All you did was weaken
a country today, Kaffee.

69
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:41,161
Well, what can I say?

70
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:44,765
Really? Okay.

71
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,567
- I gotta go to work.
- Thank you.

72
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,469
Remember, we're going out
tonight, so...

73
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,170
you know, don't be you.

74
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,306
Oh, wait a minute. I still
owe you from last week.

75
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,707
No, no, no, you get
the dickhead discount.

76
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,776
Oh, is that 30%? Or is that
the shitface coupon?

77
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,444
Same thing, because you're
a shitface and a dickhead.

78
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:58,779
Right, got it.
Have a great day!

79
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,880
Later, asshole.

80
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:01,882
Later.

81
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:04,985
Shit.

82
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,127
I need your help
on something.

83
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,762
Show me the skulls,
I'll crack 'em.

84
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:17,398
Not for this. For this,
I need your discretion.

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,366
I also need to know
you'll take it seriously.

86
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:20,768
I haven't worked in
the mail room

87
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,237
in a long time,
Jessica.

88
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,040
Someone's stealing from our
clients' escrow accounts.

89
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,207
Why isn't Daniel here?

90
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,076
Daniel's managing partner.

91
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,477
Isn't that why Daniel
should be here?

92
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,312
And I'm in charge
of the money.

93
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:35,015
Oh, you want to go to him with
a solution, not a problem.

94
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,417
You don't always have to
let your superiors know

95
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,419
what you're up to.
I'll try to remember that.

96
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,520
Really? I thought you were
under the impression

97
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:41,221
you had invented it.

98
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:42,256
What do you
need me to do?

99
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,557
I need you to step up.

100
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,559
Do whatever you have to do
to find out who did it,

101
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,661
and do it quietly.
I will.

102
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:48,829
And when I do,

103
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:52,032
I want you to step up
for me.

104
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,234
What do you want,
Harvey?

105
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:56,370
I'm an associate
who kicks more ass

106
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:59,506
than any partner
in this goddamn firm.

107
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:01,608
I want a seat
at the table.

118
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,822
There's so many partners,
it could be anyone of them.

119
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:38,470
Watson scares the kids,

120
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:39,905
but I don't make him
for the embezzler.

121
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,441
The embezzler?
He's not a Batman villain.

122
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,042
And it's just that kind of
thinking that has led you

123
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,243
to not catching him.

124
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,546
I was just assigned this
15 minutes ago.

125
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,114
Have you ever looked into
Dortch's eyes?

126
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,216
- Yeah, he's cross-eyed.
- Or is he?

127
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,617
What does that even mean?

128
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,019
Is there a reward
for this?

129
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,688
Yes. I make Jessica happy,
I make partner.

130
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,889
Ooh, then we get
a bigger office.

131
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,990
Then I get
a bigger office.

132
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,158
Hey, I'm
helping you out here.

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,226
Are you?

134
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:02,627
What do you think
about Ginsberg?

135
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:03,829
We need to
follow the money.

136
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,931
Which will lead
straight to Rutherford.

137
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,866
This would be so much more fun
with margaritas.

138
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,368
Okay, that's it.
I need facts,

139
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,569
and I need them right now.
Well then,

140
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,837
why did you ask me to
guess who did it?

141
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,071
I didn't.

142
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:14,639
- Then why am I here?
- I need you to tell me

143
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,808
who handles these five
escrow accounts.

144
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,777
Oh. Well,
that's easy.

145
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,379
Zoe.

146
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:23,115
God, why didn't you just say so
in the first place?

147
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:26,718
Get out.

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,919
If you want to talk to
Monica Eton,

149
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,087
call her yourself.

150
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,655
I called her,
but she hung up

151
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:31,990
the minute I said
Pearson Hardman.

152
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,925
Of course she did.
She hates everybody here.

153
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,394
- She doesn't hate you.
- Well, no,

154
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:36,561
but that's because
I'm adorable.

155
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:38,029
See, I can't help you
with that.

156
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:39,798
So why don't you try using
your powers of adorability

157
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,166
for good?
Not a word.

158
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:43,702
And that is not
being adorable.

159
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:45,837
Mike, seriously, this is

160
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,038
not a small thing.

161
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,473
Look, the last time you
asked me to help you

162
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,409
it was about Donna, and look at
how that turned out.

163
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,044
Okay, that wasn't me,
and this isn't that--

164
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:54,813
Monica Eton is not Donna.

165
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,182
Maybe not, but she still
means something to me.

166
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:59,684
So tell me why I should
convince her to talk to someone

167
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,553
who works at a firm
that she hates.

168
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:03,288
Because...

169
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,322
You don't know

170
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:07,092
the real reason
why she left.

171
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,932
Monica.

172
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,700
Hey, it's so funny
running into you.

173
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,436
Louis, we both
work here.

174
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:18,737
Yeah. Listen, I just wanted
to tell you that

175
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:19,971
I joined
the Hudson Racquet Club.

176
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:21,106
You know, I just figured
I'd treat myself

177
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,274
for making junior partner.

178
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,809
Good for you.

179
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,076
Yeah, I'd love to get you
out on the court.

180
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:26,411
Maybe like, if you're
available Saturday?

181
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:27,813
- I can't.
- I can't Saturday, but--

182
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:29,047
- Monica, Louis.

183
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,449
- Harvey.
- H-dog.

184
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:31,650
- No.
- What?

185
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,251
No, listen. I wanted to
talk to you about--

186
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:34,753
Cashing and burning
with Monica?

187
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:36,354
I didn't crash and burn
with her.

188
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:38,223
So why don't you stop quoting
whatever "B" movie

189
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,192
that came from, and call me
when you finally see <i>Amadeus.</i>

190
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,160
Salieri, Mozart.

191
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,829
Are you wearing braces?

192
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:45,297
- Proudly.
- Walk me through that.

193
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,431
I will walk you
through it.

194
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,000
Uh, for starters,
it costs $15,000--

195
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:50,702
Okay, I don't have time
for this.

196
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,204
I heard you had a closed-door
meeting with Jessica.

197
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:54,606
I did.
Or I didn't.

198
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:55,941
Either way, it's
none of your business.

199
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:57,309
I just think it's weird
when, you know,

200
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,710
you have a one-on-one
with her,

201
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:00,078
when you're an associate
and I'm a junior partner.

202
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,413
Proudly wearing braces.

203
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,949
You mi--for your information,
it is a very small step

204
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,951
from junior to senior partner
when you have straight teeth.

205
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:07,352
Just know that people take you
very seriously.

206
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,588
That tie. I have the same one.

207
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,922
I don't want to
see it again.

208
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:13,592
What would he have said if you
weren't wearing braces?

209
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:14,993
What a dick.

210
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:17,696
Mark my words, if I am ever
in charge of anyone,

211
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,897
I am going to be the most
beloved leader

212
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,866
that those lucky bastards
have ever seen.

213
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,968
You know what I'd do,
I'd be--

214
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,937
H-dog? H-dog?

215
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,739
Zoe Lawford.

216
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,074
I'm sorry, you are?

217
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,876
The only man here who could
beat you at pool.

218
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,277
Uh, head-to-head
is even.

219
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,478
I'm up by one.

220
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,946
Well, I thought you'd
given up altogether.

221
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:36,214
You don't call,
you don't write.

222
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,983
I was just trying to give it
a little time.

223
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,485
You know, letting mystery
build back up.

224
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,220
You mean you didn't know
I transferred

225
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:43,688
to beautiful escrow.

226
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,123
Hey, I have my finger
on the pulse.

227
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,259
Really?

228
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:48,960
Name three associates
in tax law.

229
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,929
Boring, more boring,

230
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,163
and boring in a skirt.

231
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,966
Oh! August 3rd.

232
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,234
Date of my transfer.

233
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:57,569
I did know.

234
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:00,071
We miss you up there.

235
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:01,439
We miss me,
or you miss me?

236
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,908
We miss you.

237
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,411
I need you.

238
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,313
You're here to look at my
files, aren't you?

239
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,614
I need you to type in
your password

240
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,550
and leave for five minutes.

241
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:12,717
You're doing
something wrong.

242
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,919
No, I'm fixing
something wrong.

243
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,353
- Fixing what?
- That, I can't tell you.

244
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:16,521
Why? Don't trust me?

245
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:17,889
I do.
But if I tell you,

246
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,158
then I'm breaking
someone's trust in me.

247
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,327
Okay, let me just
get this straight.

248
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,229
You're asking me
to risk my job to help you

249
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,731
solve a mysterious problem
for an unknown person,

250
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:29,701
based on nothing
but your word?

251
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,903
That's exactly
what I'm asking.

252
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,739
Ahh.

253
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,311
Oh my God, there's an emergency
in wills and trusts.

254
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:49,321
Thank you. Cheers.

255
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,523
You ready?
I am. Hit me, hit me.

256
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:53,158
All right, um...
All right.

257
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,459
This guy.
Favorite movie.

258
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,994
<i>Grease.</i>

259
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:57,696
<i>2.</i>
<i>- Yes, I agree with you.</i>

260
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:58,964
Oh. What about this,

261
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:01,099
Rico Suave over here,
what are you thinking?

262
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,200
Shaves his chest.

263
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,602
No.
No, no, man,

264
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:05,370
that's a thing that like,
real men do now.

265
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,671
Oh, I don't think so.

266
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:07,973
- Yeah--
- I'm sorry,

267
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:10,108
did you just say real men
shave their chests?

268
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,010
Oh, um, not--
not real men.

269
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:15,113
Just me.
That's all.

270
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,448
I like him.
He's funny.

271
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,515
- And hairless.
- Oh, I'm Jenny.

272
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:20,418
Mike.

273
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,121
And just so you guys know, uh,
he shaves his chest

274
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,724
because he is, I'm very proud
of him, an Olympic swimmer.

275
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:27,092
- I am.
- Is that right?

276
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:29,494
So that's what you do when you
meet girls, you lie?

277
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:31,696
- Totally.
- If they're hot.

278
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,000
We also buy them drinks,
I'm not sure if--

279
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,101
- Oh, we drink.
- Uh, yeah.

280
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:40,038
- Bartender?
- Yeah? No, go for it.

281
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,606
Wait, no way a girl
thought you were

282
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:42,807
a point guard
for the Knicks.

283
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,242
Well, you've never
seen me dribble.

284
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:45,744
Uh, I would like to know
something about you

285
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,145
that's not a lie.

286
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,680
Ooh.

287
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,982
Um...

288
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:52,183
I love my grandmother.

289
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:54,352
Well, now we know why
he's single.

290
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:56,021
Come on,
it's kind of sweet.

291
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,123
Look, I--
I'm not usually in it for him,

292
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,624
but I really gotta
step in here.

293
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:01,026
Um...

294
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:02,694
Dude's a genius.
Trevor, stop.

295
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,295
- No, no, no--
- What do you mean, genius?

296
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,197
- All right.
- It's not a thing, it's just--

297
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,365
No, no, no,
here we go.

298
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,335
Ask him a math question.
Hard as you want.

299
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:11,736
- Trevor.
- Hard as you want!

300
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:12,837
Anything.

301
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,974
What's 75 times 863,

302
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:20,078
minus 10?

303
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,213
64,715.

304
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,982
- Bang.
- How do we know that's right?

305
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:27,686
Uh, it's right.
It's right.

306
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:29,621
All right, think of a book
you read in high school,

307
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,656
he will recite the first page...
I don't want to do this,

308
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,091
- Verbatim.
- I don't want to do it.

309
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:36,161
Come on, come on, come on,
just do it--do it for me.

310
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:40,065
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

311
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,499
"Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,

312
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,436

00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:45,637
"having little or no money--"

00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,039
<i>Old Man and the Sea.</i>

"The box with the baits was

00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:54,646

used to subdue the big fish--"

317
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,748
I know that one,
that's not right.

318
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,684
Oh, no, no, no.
I got bored, I did page seven.

319
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:03,321
<i>Curious George.</i>

320
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:04,689
I can't.

321
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:06,825
I can't do that.
What? Come on, you can do

322
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,326
the other ones, you don't know
<i>Curious George?</i>

323
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:09,661
I never read
<i>Curious George.</i>

324
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,329
You never read
<i>Curious George?</i>

325
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:12,697
Monkeys freak me out.

326
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,232
My girlfriend and I
have to go to the bathroom.

327
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,201
Mmhmm.

328
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,336
I have to go to
the bathroom.

329
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:20,171
And when we come back,
these drinkies--

330
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:23,374
Will be filled.
Absolutely, 100%.

331
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,978
Dude, what are you doing?

332
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,313
Are you trying to
blow this?

333
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,814
What are you
talking about?

334
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:30,982
I know that you have
<i>Curious George,</i>

335
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,083
I've seen it on
your bookshelf.

336
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,718
For once, we don't
have to lie.

337
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,054
My mom gave me that book.
She read it to me every night.

338
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:37,789
I'm not going to use it
to just pick up some girl.

339
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,390
You don't have to do
anything.

340
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,726
Let me tell them.
Okay?

341
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:43,061
You'll probably go home
with both of them.

342
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:45,730
Trevor.
Stop.

343
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,136
Fine.

344
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:52,437
I hate your guts.

345
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,916
I followed the money.

346
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,217
Let's hear it.

347
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,686
Louis Litt is the man
we're looking for.

348
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:10,421
Are you sure?

349
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:11,790
I told you
I followed the money.

350
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,892
Which, by the way, he's been
spending left and right.

351
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:15,326
You're talking about
the braces.

352
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:16,728
$15,000.

353
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,863
Not to mention
the Hudson Racquet Club.

354
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,231
Who knows what else?

355
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:23,301
That club costs
$60,000 a year.

356
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:26,137
What are you
going to do?

357
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,639
I'm gonna
break him down,

358
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,575
and I'm gonna
crack him open.

359
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,603
You wanted to see me?

360
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,539
I did.

361
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,340
Well, if this is
about Norma?

362
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,276
Truth be told, we can
do a lot better.

363
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,046
This isn't about Norma.

364
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,514
Pray tell.

365
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:05,715
How can your your newest
junior partner

366
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:07,150
be of service to thee?

367
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,052
Pray tell?

368
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,688
You can pray tell me

369
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,056
how the hell you got
the nerve

370
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,392
to stand in front of
my face

371
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,395
after what you did.

372
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,401
I couldn't help it.

373
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,635
All those late nights.

374
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,705
Your fibers are
so tantalizing.

375
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,674
What?

376
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,542
I fell asleep
on your couch,

377
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,945
just once, because it's
so damn soft.

378
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,548
Not the topic of
this conversation.

379
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,783
Is this about
the MySpace profile?

380
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:44,387
Because I can
take that down.

381
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,123
Okay, fine.

382
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,324
You got me.

383
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,758
I've copied the complete
works of Shakespeare

384
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,494
and I've charged it to
those bastards at C.M.,

385
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,895
I regularly raid Harvey's
liquor, and I've

386
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,430
taken every raspberry-bran bar
from the kitchen

387
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,764
that we've ever bought--
Louis-

388
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:55,765
I need to know where
Stanley gets them, do you?

389
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:59,069
Enough!

390
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,704
Well, should I just--

391
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,973
what, pack my things?

392
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,708
Not necessary.

393
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,842
Thank you, Jessica.

394
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,412
Thank you for your mercy.

395
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,981
Louis.

396
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,315
Yeah.

397
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,584
You will replace every one of
those goddamn bran bars.

398
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,286
Yes.

399
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,355
And, I promise not to walk
barefoot in the library

400
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,389
ever again.
Out.

401
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,857
Okay.

402
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,365
Next time you
bring me a name,

403
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,900
make goddamn sure
it's the right one.

404
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,234
I followed the money.

405
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,435
You got lost on the way.

406
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,504
You saying Louis
was framed?

407
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,673
I'm saying you
shit the bed.

408
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,575
I gave you a job to do,
and you promptly

409
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,177
asked for a seat
at the table.

410
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,511
You want to sit
with the grown-ups?

411
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,513
Do your job like a man.

412
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:49,786
Ouch.

413
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,188
What?

414
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,722
You need me to remove
Jessica's foot from your ass?

415
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,990
You heard all that?

416
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,125
Intercom was on.

417
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,893
Couldn't help myself.

418
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,195
Has it ever
been on before?

419
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,362
Has it ever been off?

420
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,463
Wait, what?

421
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,865
I listen to your
private conversations?

422
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:02,899
Gotta go.

423
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,801
- Wait.
- What?

424
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,002
I don't like to
be wrong.

425
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:07,170
It made sense, Harvey.

426
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,605
Louis is the firm's
financial wizard.

427
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,240
Look. Louis might not
have done it,

428
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,042
but he can help me
figure out who did.

429
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,377
You're going to ask Louis
for help on something this big?

430
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,746
When a dog smells a bone,
he digs.

431
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:17,881
Doesn't mean you
have to tell him

432
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,950
what kind of bone
he's digging for.

433
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,418
Just so we're clear,

434
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,687
I'm gonna keep listening to
your private conversations.

435
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,755
- Pickles.
- Peppers.

436
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:26,756
Here you go.

437
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,091
Here you go.
That's fine.

438
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,326
Oh yeah, that girl Nikki
called me.

439
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,927
Oh, that's awesome.

440
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,629
I don't even know how she got
my number, it's weird.

441
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,897
I do.

442
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,366
I asked her out.
She wanted your number instead.

443
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,935
I didn't tell her about
the <i>Curious George</i> thing.

444
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,970
What?

445
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,538
I don't know, it's--

446
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,906
I just felt like I kind of
hit it off more

447
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,040
with that Jenny girl,
that's all.

448
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,041
The blonde?

449
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,876
She's not even as hot.

450
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,778
I liked her better.

451
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,980
Well, you can't
do anything now.

452
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,083
Girls have rules about
that kind of shit.

453
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,618
Wait a minute.

454
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,319
Are you--
is this a snake?

455
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,054
Are you snaking my girl
right now?

456
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,689
No, I already did.

457
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,424
- You called her?
- Of course I did.

458
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:02,759
- What a dick.
- What?

459
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,094
- Son of a bitch.
- I--I don't have

460
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,428
rules against that shit.
Okay.

461
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,330
Aw, whatever. That Nikki girl's
pretty hot too.

462
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,332
Yeah.

463
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:12,269
Look at this clown.

464
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,138
He walks like he's got
a rod up his ass.

465
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,873
Nice haircut, guy.

466
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,010
Man, if I ever look like that,
shoot me.

467
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,612
Monica, you work late
all the time.

468
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,714
I'm not 22.
You are.

469
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:27,150
All I'm saying is, you work
80 hours a week

470
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,585
while studying for the LSATs
every night.

471
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,420
Well right, but that's because
this time next year

472
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,622
I want to be in law school,
and five years from now

473
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,923
I want to be a lawyer.

474
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,492
Five years from now,
you're gonna be

475
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,762
a kick-ass lawyer
at Pearson Hardman.

476
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,970
How often does Louis
ask you out?

477
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,305
Every single day.

478
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,539
There are laws
to protect you from

479
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,141
sexual harassment,
you know.

480
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,376
Believe me, the day I need
a law to protect me from Louis

481
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,578
is the day I stop
being a lawyer.

482
00:16:57,815 --> 00:16:59,449
Busy?

483
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,017
Very funny, Harvey, let's get
to it, okay?

484
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,185
Because you happen to be
interrupting

485
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,321
my lunchtime sanctuary.

486
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,423
You think I don't know
lunchtime sanctuary

487
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,691
means staring at Monica?

488
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,892
First of all,
I'll have you know that

489
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,427
I have been coming here
way before her.

490
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,996
And I will be coming here
every Thursday at 1:00 p.m.

491
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,264
till the day I die.

492
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,501
Now let me see your friend's
financials.

493
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,703
Why are the names
all blacked out?

494
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,571
Because of how
sensitive it is.

495
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,506
How sensitive is it?

496
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,275
He works at
a powerful firm.

497
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,444
I can't tell you
which one.

498
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,745
They have an embezzler.

499
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,580
Ahh, so that's
what your

500
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,982
closed-door meeting
with Jessica was about.

501
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,451
We're being hired
by another firm.

502
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm sworn to secrecy.

503
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,722
If we can figure out
who this is,

504
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,324
a very big head
will roll.

505
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,628
Where?
Hufton and Wood?

506
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,564
Bagwell and Rose?

507
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,233
Oh, come on. Those assholes
at Jacobson and Kearney?

508
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,972
Look, I told you,
I was sworn to secrecy.

509
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,642
My God, this is just like
a maze of raw data.

510
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:00,977
Can you make any
sense of it?

511
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,445
Yeah, I already have.

512
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,848
Look at this.

513
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,149
See?

514
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,851
He's setting up this patsy
to take the fall.

515
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,186
He's not even gonna see it
coming, what a "smuck."

516
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,122
I'm sorry, did--
did you just say,

517
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,656
what a "smuck?"

518
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:16,993
No, I said
what a "smuck."

519
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,094
You mean schmuck.

520
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,662
Huh?

521
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:20,997
You know a schmuck, right?

522
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,031
"Smuck."

523
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,478
Monica?

524
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,913
Mike Ross.

525
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,047
Can I join you?

526
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,350
Chair's empty.

527
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,684
I appreciate it.

528
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,988
Rachel said this was about
one of my old cases?

529
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,791
This is a lawsuit that we just
drew up in your name,

530
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,394
seeking $10 million in damages
from Pearson Hardman.

531
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,529
Should have
seen this coming.

532
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,597
Five years ago
you got screwed.

533
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,832
One way to put it.

534
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,600
You had options
you didn't explore.

535
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:58,968
And you're
exploring them for me.

536
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,871
I can make what stopped you
before go away, yes.

537
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:05,542
Harvey will
back your claim.

538
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,576
What about Jessica?

539
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,845
You don't need Jessica.

540
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,981
Why are you
doing this?

541
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,517
Does it matter?

542
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,986
No. It doesn't.

543
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,956
I don't want anything
to do with this.

544
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,893
Last five years haven't been
easy for you, have they?

545
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:26,029
You don't know
anything about me.

546
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,797
I know you've been
working retail.

547
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,966
It's a boutique
on Park Avenue, right?

548
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,902
It's a good job, you're making
what, maybe 40 grand a year?

549
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,204
This is Manhattan.

550
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,739
What, are you covering rent
with that?

551
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,042
So you're the new
attack dog.

552
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,578
Well, Spot,
I'm not revisiting a story

553
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,881
I spent the last five years
trying to forget.

554
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,350
Just take it
with you.

555
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,118
You may
change your mind.

556
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,621
And if you call me,
I'll come fetch.

557
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,967
- It's Daniel Hardman.
- What?

558
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,435
He's been playing
a shell game.

559
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,238
He's moving money out of one
account and into another.

560
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,672
For an entire year.

561
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,174
Your partner
sold you out.

562
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,376
Daniel has never done
anything unethical.

563
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,677
And the fact that
you don't like him--

564
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,913
I know, isn't reason
to falsely accuse him.

565
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,748
I'm not.

566
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,618
You falsely accused Louis.

567
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,419
I stake my career
on this.

568
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,222
You are.

569
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,624
He did it.

570
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,135
Shit.

571
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,803
He did.

572
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:43,840
You have to go
to the D.A.

573
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,776
I'm going to Daniel.

574
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,978
Who's not doing their job
like a man now?

575
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,080
I'm giving him the courtesy
of explaining himself.

576
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,050
You shouldn't.

577
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,852
What you do
if it were me?

578
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:40,767
- Hi.
- Hey.

579
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,103
- Come in.
- Oh. Thanks.

580
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:46,039
Oh...

581
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,674
Are those for me,
probably?

582
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:48,942
Yeah. That's a thing,
right?

583
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,210
Uh, bringing flowers
for the roommate of

584
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:51,645
the girl you're taking--

585
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:55,082
you're just gonna take
one of those, okay.

586
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:57,451
Who's gonna tell her?
You? Lieutenant Weinberg?

587
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:58,619
That's from

588
00:21:58,621 --> 00:21:59,953
- <i>A Few Good Men.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

589
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:03,123
Yeah. I get HBO.

590
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,358
I love you!

591
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,011
Uh, Nikki is gonna be out
any minute, so--

592
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:09,341
Am I dressed okay, for her?

593
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,599
Yeah, uh, you look fine.

594
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:13,867
- Good?
- Yeah.

595
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,669
Would--can you
me the truth?

596
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:17,504
You don't want
the truth.

597
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:19,039
"'Cause deep down
in places you don't

598
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,674
"talk about at
parties, you want me

599
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:23,043
"on that wall,
you <i>need</i> me on that wall--"

600
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,745
Hey, Nikki.

601
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:27,080
Hi.

602
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,082
Uh, wow.

603
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:32,152
Those look beautiful.

604
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:33,453
Ohuh,
yeah--um,

605
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,255
so--so, do you.

606
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:36,757
So they-
I'm gonna go

607
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,243
put these in water.
Okay.

608
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,560
You liar.

609
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:40,925
Look at her.

610
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,950
You did want to look perfect
on your first date.

611
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,992
Yeah, I do.

612
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:46,633
Ready?

613
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,302
Yeah, I'm ready.
Are--

614
00:22:48,304 --> 00:22:49,369
are you ready?
- Yeah.

615
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,171
Then we, ready.

616
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:52,539
For dinner.
Everyone's ready,

617
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:53,707
isn't that great? - Good Night.

618
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,642
That great?

619
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:04,551
Something I can
help you with?

620
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:05,719
Yon help me
understand why

621
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:09,022
you've been stealing
from our clients.

622
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,090
Jessica, I can--

623
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:13,093
Oh, God damn
Daniel.

624
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,804
It was for Alicia.

625
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,259
She's dying.

626
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,364
What?

627
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:25,243
Breast cancer.

628
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:27,078
Stage four.

629
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,881
Why didn't you say
anything?

630
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,582
She found a lump
a year ago.

631
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,694
It was the worst day
of our lives.

632
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,111
I have no words.

633
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,193
I thought I could
handle it myself.

634
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:47,498
And the money?

635
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,534
Treatments.
Not covered by insurance.

636
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:50,635
Why not?

637
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,537
They're not
in the books.

638
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,138
But I don't care.

639
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:56,252
She's not dying because
I didn't spend the money.

640
00:23:57,944 --> 00:24:02,547
You stole $1/2 million.

641
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:06,651
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

642
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,221
What do you expect?

643
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:13,724
I honestly don't know.

644
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:20,512
Wild Maine salmon,
braised fennel

645
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,394
mushroom polenta,
arugula salad,

646
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,791
and do you really need
to keep doing this?

647
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,462
U really are a genius.

648
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:28,897
Sexy, right?

649
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:31,066
What'd you get
on your SATs?

650
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,887
Ooh, 1590.

651
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,635
Yeah, it was an ambiguous
question, I don't know.

652
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,278
I really don't like
to talk about it.

653
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,837
Oh, no, no, no.
Here, let me get that,

654
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,706
c'mon.
Parents' plastic.

655
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,774
They're cool.

656
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:43,108
Cool.

657
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,408
Listen, um...

658
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,134
Why don't we go back
to your place, cause

659
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:53,852
I'm live in Brooklyn,
and I kinda in

660
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,154
a strange roommate
situation--

661
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:57,256
I want to
pay you $1000

662
00:24:57,258 --> 00:24:59,858
to take the LSATs for me.

663
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,894
Oh.

664
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,063
What?

665
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,603
That's why you snaked me
from Jenny.

666
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:12,738
I don't know what you're

667
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,606
talking about.
Unbelievable.

668
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,809
We're not all
born geniuses.

669
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:17,910
And I need your help.

670
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:19,745
Yeah, you might not
be a genius,

671
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:21,747
but you know exactly
what you're doing.

672
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:28,053
And you're not getting
my help.

673
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:31,123
Come on.

674
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,558
What do you want?

675
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,026
Oh, I don't want
anything.

676
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,729
Because I'm not
your trained monkey.

677
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:38,464
Tell your mommy thanks
for dinner.

678
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:41,767
Grammy!

679
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,235
Oh my God,
what's the matter?

680
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,770
Bob, what happened?
Relax, Mike.

681
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:46,972
Edith's fine, I'm just gonna
go get her a glass of water.

682
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,674
Grammy, here, look at me.
What happened?

683
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,275
I don't know.
I think the floor was wet.

684
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:52,044
The floor was wet,
how did the floor get wet?

685
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:53,846
Well, it happened fast.

686
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:55,214
But I'm okay.

687
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:57,416
But, what are you
doing here?

688
00:25:57,418 --> 00:25:59,752
I thought you
had a date.

689
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:03,789
Uh, it di--
no, it didn't work out.

690
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,824
So, you came to see
your grandmother.

691
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:07,493
That's not normal,
Michael.

692
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,395
Rea--are we gonna do this,
right now?

693
00:26:09,397 --> 00:26:10,496
- Hey.
- Thank you, Bob,

694
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:11,864
I really appreciate it.

695
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:14,733
That's what neighbors
are for.

696
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,335
Here, you drink that,
and we'll be right back.

697
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:18,570
Okay?

698
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:20,739
- For what it's worth...
- Uh-huh.

699
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:22,608
The floor wasn't
wet.

700
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,611
You know, if I were you, I'd get
full-time care for Edith.

701
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,620
- Are you crazy?
- Did you hear me?

702
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:36,855
His wife's
dying of cancer.

703
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,257
So you're going to
let him walk?

704
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:39,658
No, nobody's walking.

705
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,727
The firm's taking out a loan
against its assets.

706
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,062
Daniel will pay it back.

707
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:45,330
Great. My dad has gout,
can I have $1 million?

708
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:46,832
Coldhearted son of a bitch.

709
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:50,302
You know those Tuesday lunches
at the Harvard Club?

710
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,937
He's taking Alicia
to chemo.

711
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:53,705
He stole from our clients,

712
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,140
which means he's stealing
from us.

713
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,376
When it was Louis,
you were ready to break him down

714
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:58,510
and crack him open.

715
00:26:58,512 --> 00:27:00,646
Daniel is the reason
why I'm here.

716
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:01,980
He plucked me
from the bullpen

717
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:03,515
when I didn't know my ass
from my elbow.

718
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:05,584
He saw a star
to hitch his wagon to.

719
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:08,220
This is Manhattan,
Harvey.

720
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:11,523
How many black women do you see
with their name on the door?

721
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,125
You know what, he was smart
to put your name first.

722
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,661
That way you might not notice
that you'd always be number two.

723
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:17,296
- Careful, Harvey.
- Then again,

724
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:19,498
maybe you're okay staying
number two--Scottie Pippen...

725
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,632
Don't pull that shit on me.

726
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:23,469
We made a deal,
and I honored it.

727
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:27,206
It's time for you
to honor it.

728
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,442
Wow,
a man's wife's dying,

729
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:34,546
and the first words out
of your mouth are "you owe me."

730
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:35,981
Who's the bad guy now?

731
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,657
You asked me what
it's gonna take.

732
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:01,190
It's gonna take $5,000.

733
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:03,960
- Keep your voice down.
- Why, am I making you nervous?

734
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:05,495
Yes.

735
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:08,264
Good. Now you know
how I'm gonna feel.

736
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,099
You're asking me
to expose myself

737
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:11,501
so that you can go
make a fortune.

738
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:12,902
So either you figure out
how to pay me,

739
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,671
or you roll the dice
on your own.

740
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,507
But trust me when I tell you,
these tests aren't easy.

741
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,877
Well, they are for me.

742
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:23,046
Okay.

743
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,415
Good.

744
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:29,018
What made you change
your mind?

745
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,521
None of your business.

746
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,427
- You're not Monica.
- Oh, no, I'm--

747
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,429
- Rachel Zane.
- How did you know that?

748
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:40,763
I'm Donna.
I know everything.

749
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:43,166
- Everything?
- You started three months ago,

750
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,534
you have a peach yogurt
every morning,

751
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:45,935
you've got a cute pair
of suede pumps

752
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,704
I totally plan on stealing,

753
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,005
and your father's
Robert Zane,

754
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,308
name partner at Rand,
Kaldor, and Zane.

755
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,078
And, apparently, you don't like
people knowing who your dad is.

756
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,347
Well, they just--
they treat you differently.

757
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:59,182
Your secret's safe
with me.

758
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:00,883
No, it doesn't really
matter.

759
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:03,052
I won't be here that long.
It is the cafeteria?

760
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:05,054
Because it is <i>way</i> better
than it used to be.

761
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,023
Nope.
I live for foie gras Fridays.

762
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:10,293
- They don't have that.
- Don't they?

763
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:13,129
You're weird.
We'll be friends.

764
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,897
Anyway, I should go.

765
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:16,466
I'm just gonna leave
this stuff here for Monica.

766
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:17,667
She should be back
pretty soon.

767
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,403
She just has Tuesday pilates
at Chelsea Pier.

768
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,639
Every Tuesday?

769
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:26,909
Now, I thought
you knew everything.

770
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:28,444
I do.

771
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,488
What are you
so bouncy about?

772
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,459
You're gonna be so happy
that I listen to your intercom.

773
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,497
Who is it?

774
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,566
Room service.

775
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:52,735
What are you doing here?

776
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:55,371
Delivering champagne.
I see you can afford it

777
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,106
since the money you've been
stealing from our clients

778
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:59,509
hasn't been going to
your wife's cancer treatments.

779
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,710
Hey, Monica,
how's it going?

780
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:04,647
- Harvey.
- Daniel and I need a minute.

781
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,750
Letter of resignation.

782
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,385
You're gonna sign it,

783
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:11,454
and then name Jessica
as your successor.

784
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,755
I don't think so.

785
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:14,824
Unflinching in the face
of defeat.

786
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:16,092
It's not defeat.

787
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:17,927
You come after me
for embezzlement,

788
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,963
every Pearson Hardman client
you've got is gone.

789
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,800
Which is why Jessica
won't let me do that.

790
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:25,535
Then why are you here?

791
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:26,869
Waiting for your wife.

792
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:28,471
What are you talking about?

793
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:29,806
She's invited
to a fund raiser.

794
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,974
She'll be at the front desk
in three minutes.

795
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:34,444
You don't sign, they'll send her
up to this room.

796
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,345
You do sign, they'll send her
to another room.

797
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:38,981
You dragged a woman
racked with cancer here

798
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:40,383
to blackmail me?

799
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:44,721
You think it's me
she's gonna have issue with?

800
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:45,988
You goddamn bastard.

801
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,191
Says the man cheating
on his dying wife.

802
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:51,961
- You don't know anything.
- I do.

803
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:54,897
I've seen you with her,
and I know you love her.

804
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,500
And this has nothing to do
with that.

805
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:00,336
I also know that you don't want
the rest of Alicia's life

806
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:02,171
spent picturing this.

807
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:04,907
If she wasn't sick,
she could probably get over it.

808
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:08,878
She's not getting
any better, Daniel.

809
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,481
You have two minutes.

810
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:15,485
It's your call.

811
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:27,497
There's something
I think you should know.

812
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:30,733
Please.

813
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:33,269
Mike Ross had lunch
with Monica Eton today.

814
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,938
I saw him hand her
a filing.

815
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,040
And why do you think
this concerns me?

816
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:39,342
I just think that
their meeting

817
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:40,643
on the eve
of the firm's vote suggests

818
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:42,712
that Jessica's making
a move.

819
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:45,815
You've been good to me
since you've been back.

820
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:52,221
She hasn't.

821
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:54,957
Do what you will.

822
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:08,137
About time.
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

823
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,872
Especially since
you didn't give me a reason.

824
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:13,943
I've got about 5,000 reasons.

825
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:16,646
We'll be fine.

826
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,381
Oh, my God, you're high.

827
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,817
- I'm fine.
- Are you crazy?

828
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:22,251
I'm about to do
something illegal, okay?

829
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:24,320
It helps calm me down.
Great, you'll be calm.

830
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:26,422
How the hell are you gonna
handle the test?

831
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:27,423
I don't know,
maybe the same way I handled

832
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:28,491
your little quiz
the other night.

833
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,927
- You were high.
- And drunk.

834
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,462
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a test to take.

835
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:35,565
And I've gotta miss a couple
of questions on purpose.

836
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:11,467
It's done.
Hardman's gone.

837
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:17,240
Harvey...

838
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:20,343
What is it?

839
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:23,813
I don't know how
to say this.

840
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:26,048
Just say it, Donna.
What?

841
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:31,988
Your dad...
he had a heart attack.

842
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:49,005
Harvey, I'm so sorry.

843
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:54,710
It's okay.

844
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:56,512
Oh, my God.

845
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,558
- Good morning, Monica.
- Jessica.

846
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,893
You look tired. Did you get
much rest last night?

847
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:23,529
- I want to explain.
- I'm not here for excuses.

848
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:25,064
Then why are you here?

849
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:27,567
- To see you off.
- My relationship with Daniel

850
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:29,769
has nothing to do
with my work here.

851
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:32,471
I need to know
I can trust my people.

852
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:34,273
You're not my people.

853
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:36,475
You can't fire me.

854
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:37,944
I'll sue for wrongful
termination.

855
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,512
Which will lead me
to implicate you

856
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:40,880
in Daniel's crimes.

857
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:43,716
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Didn't you?

858
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:47,186
Diamond earrings,
diamond bracelet,

859
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:52,058
and trips to,
let's see now...

860
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,996
Mexico...France...
Hong Kong.

861
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:58,564
Hope you liked that one.

862
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,666
- I didn't know.
- I don't care.

863
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:03,135
You are
a Harvard-educated lawyer.

864
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:04,670
Do you think that a jury
will believe

865
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:08,441
you had no idea
where that money came from?

866
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:11,544
Don't do this.

867
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:14,580
Louis will accept
your resignation,

868
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:18,417
and I will never
see you here again.

869
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,126
I expected a fight,
but not a dirty one.

870
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,227
I don't know what
you're talking about.

871
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:30,196
Mike Ross met
with Monica Eton.

872
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:31,564
And what does that have
to do with me?

873
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,866
I am disappointed that
you felt the need to go there.

874
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,601
I'm disappointed
you think I did.

875
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:38,204
You really expect me
to believe that you didn't--

876
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,472
Stop right there!

877
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:41,173
You know,
you might fight dirty,

878
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,776
and Harvey might fight dirty,
but I don't.

879
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,413
What the hell are you doing?

880
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:50,016
Trying to get Monica Eton to
file a sexual harassment suit

881
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,350
against Daniel Hardman?

882
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:52,818
Okay she left because
of their affair,

883
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,087
which he paid for
with embezzled money.

884
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:57,790
- That was five years ago.
- And her life fell apart!

885
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:58,958
I know you think
you're trying to help me,

886
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,293
but drop it, immediately.

887
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:07,767
Wow. That's what
all this was about?

888
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,301
Nice performance.

889
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:10,469
I'm trying to help Jessica.

890
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:11,771
Mike, you cannot
keep me in the dark.

891
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:13,172
Not when you're the one
asking me for help.

892
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,740
Couldn't take the chance
that you wouldn't help.

893
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,308
You told me it was about
one of Monica's old cases.

894
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,743
You lied like it's
second nature.

895
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,478
Our backs are
against the wall.

896
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
I did what I had to do.
And you're proud of that?

897
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,982
Rachel, sometimes
you have to cross a line

898
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,184
to do the right thing.
Wow...

899
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:28,621
Harvey has really
rubbed off on you.

900
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:31,924
I didn't learn that
from Harvey.

901
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,460
Heh.

902
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:36,729
Holy shit, dude.

903
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:38,130
Pays to be a nerd.

904
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:40,633
Yeah, but you still
don't get the girls.

905
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:41,701
I don't know,
I guess I'm gonna use this

906
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:43,602
to get my grandma
some help.

907
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,337
Too bad it was
a one-time-only deal.

908
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:46,472
Actually,
she has three friends

909
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:48,374
who want to use
my services, so...

910
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,009
- Oh, good.
- We're in business.

911
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,010
'Cause you're gonna need
to start paying

912
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:54,213
all the rent around here.

913
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:55,648
What?

914
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,949
Oh, did you think
you were the only one

915
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,050
stepping up his game?

916
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,486
Meaning?

917
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:10,229
What? Trevor, no, no, no.
Not a good idea.

918
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,498
No.
Which is why I'm moving out.

919
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,200
Unless you want in,
in which case,

920
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:15,801
you know,
I'm still moving out.

921
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,002
But we could go together--

922
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,205
move into a much,
much nicer apartment.

923
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:21,073
That's Jenny.

924
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,575
First date.

925
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:23,943
Could you not tell her
about this?

926
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,578
Go get the door.

927
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,246
Unbelievable.

928
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,684
Jenny.

929
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,552
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

930
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,761
Daniel came in last night
to pick up his things.

931
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:42,962
Threw a phone at my head.

932
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:44,964
You duck,
or is his aim that bad?

933
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,566
- He throws like a girl.
- I'm not surprised.

934
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:48,901
You needed me?

935
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,102
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

936
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,637
We have a new partner.

937
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,240
Andrew McCutcheon.
Solid candidate.

938
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,475
A simple thank you
would suffice.

939
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:59,245
Me thank you?
Never.

940
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:01,180
Well, I have a partners
meeting in five minutes.

941
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:05,985
I'm gonna break the news
that I'm taking Daniel's office.

942
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:08,788
- Who's taking yours?
- I'm looking at him.

943
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:14,293
Jessica...

944
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:17,930
Thank you.

945
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:19,265
One last tip.

946
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:23,135
Don't let Louis in here
after hours.

947
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,953
Finally an office big enough
for your balls.

948
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:43,022
Okay, I am not touching
that one.

949
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,523
You would if you had
bigger balls.

950
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:47,593
Hold on a sec, did you listen
on Jessica's intercom?

951
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,628
- No. She told me.
- Before me?

952
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,730
Well, I was the one
to figure it out about Daniel.

953
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:52,998
Oh, and how did she
know that?

954
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,137
Let's just focus
on what's important.

955
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,873
You just made partner.

956
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:04,543
We just made partner.

957
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:06,512
I'll grab the can opener.

958
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,180
Whoa, whoa,
that's pre-trial ritual.

959
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,649
We're making an exception.

960
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:12,518
- I'll get the thumbtacks.
- Two dozen?

961
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,553
- Three dozen.
- Ooh, going for the record!

962
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:20,960
- Zoe.
- Harvey.

963
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:22,294
Is word out already?

964
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,796
Word about what?

965
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,731
Oh, don't be coy.
I just made partner.

966
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,233
You're here
to congratulate me.

967
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:31,637
I knew it.
It was Hardman, wasn't it?

968
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:35,174
What do you want me
to say?

969
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:39,378
Nothing.

970
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,080
I know how it is
around here.

971
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:43,349
Secrets and lies--
standard procedure.

972
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:44,884
I didn't build
the sandbox, Zoe.

973
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:46,719
No, you just like
to play in it.

974
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,487
- And you don't?
- No.

975
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,889
And I don't like watching
what it's doing

976
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:51,257
to a man I care about.

977
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:53,659
- Zoe--
- I'm leaving.

978
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,828
Today's my last day.
Because of this?

979
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,563
Look, I did what I did
for the good of the firm.

980
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:00,199
You think that's
what I'm talking about?

981
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,334
Do you know what this is?

982
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:05,104
It's my condolences,

983
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:07,740
which I expected to leave
on your desk,

984
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:09,675
because I thought you'd be out
mourning your father.

985
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:11,744
- I had--
- What, bigger fish to fry?

986
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,879
Don't you see?
That's what this place does.

987
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,714
There's always bigger fish.

988
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:19,585
I am dealing how I deal.

989
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,353
Harvey,
you've lost your way.

990
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:50,242
How'd it go yesterday?

991
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:52,578
Fine.
Mike pull it off?

992
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,680
- Yep.
- He suspect you were in on it?

993
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:56,982
- Nope.
- Well, now they know.

994
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:58,450
Gonna swing us some votes.

995
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:00,753
We threw Daniel's ass out
once, we'll do it again.

996
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:04,523
- Damn right.
- One more thing.

997
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,759
I'm getting Donna back.

998
