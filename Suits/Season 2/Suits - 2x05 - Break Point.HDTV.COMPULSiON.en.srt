1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:01,436
Previously on <i>Suits:</i>

2
00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:03,432
We're suing you and your
entire firm for fraud.

3
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:06,520
I'm looking at a document that
implicates you in a cover-up.

4
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:09,257
I savaged his reputation all
because you looked me in the eye

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,492
and told me that your hood
was rock solid.

6
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:13,995
You make it right
on your own or I will.

7
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,163
When were you planning
on telling me this?

8
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:17,999
Did you find what
you're not looking for?

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,033
No, did u find
what you're not looking for?

10
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,201
Nope.

11
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,435
That document never
came into this office.

12
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:22,637
Where the hell is Donna?

13
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,038
She's in the file room.

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,239
Hasn't found
that document yet.

15
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:27,041
Anyone could have
seen it and missed it.

16
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,776
I need to know
that didn't happen,

17
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:32,013
or I need to know
who to fire.

18
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,468
Never thought I'd see

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,036
the great Harvey Specter
break a sweat.

20
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,404
You want to race,
Jeffrey?

21
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,939
I'm more than happy
to kick your ass.

22
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:00,474
Believe me, Harvey,

23
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,209
I didn't get up
at 5:00 a.m. for my health.

24
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,445
A guy like you
in Central Park at this hour?

25
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,847
That's not where
my mind went either.

26
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,483
Only guy I'm here
to solicit is you, buddy.

27
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,518
I'll assume you've heard
of Marco Mendoza.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,753
Yeah, the 16-year-old
tennis phenom.

29
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,321
What about him?

30
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:16,256
I'm on the cusp
of signing that kid.

31
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:17,491
I want you
to be part of the team.

32
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,892
Just because
I know about tennis

33
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:20,360
doesn't mean I
give a shit about tennis.

34
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:21,862
Hey, the basketballs
in your office

35
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,197
didn't autograph
themselves, Harvey.

36
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,299
You owe me.
Oh, please.

37
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:27,534
I've brought you just as
many clients as you brought me.

38
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:30,237
Five minutes with the kid.
That's all I'm asking.

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,507
You're an agent, Jeffrey.
It's never all you're asking.

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,045
There might be
one slight wrinkle.

41
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:43,083
So you want me to emancipate
him from his father?

42
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:45,352
That's a hell of a thing to do
just for a commission.

43
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,321
Just listen
to what he has to say.

44
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:50,357
Marco, tell him your story.

45
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,060
Look, I've been playing tennis
since before I could walk.

46
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:55,229
When I was six, I was
crushing kids in high school.

47
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,997
I don't play cards,
I don't drink.

48
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,900
What I do is win.

49
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,535
I like this kid.

50
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,371
So what does that have
to do with your father?

51
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,874
He won't let me go pro.

52
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,242
So it's all
about the money.

53
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:09,176
No, I don't care
about the money.

54
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:10,611
You can keep the money.

55
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:13,514
Nine out of ten tournaments
are closed to amateurs.

56
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:16,083
If I don't go pro,
I can't play against the best.

57
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,451
And if I can't
play against the best,

58
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:18,919
I can't be the best.

59
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,755
That's a great speech,
but you're 16,

60
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:24,992
and what I'm not hearing is why
you can't wait two more years.

61
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:27,261
People hit their prime
at different ages, Mr. Specter.

62
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,463
Look at me.

63
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:33,467
I have a chance to be great,
and I have a chance now.

64
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,719
You know that paper doesn't...

65
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,454
put itself
in the machine, right?

66
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,056
What the hell
is wrong with you?

67
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:57,291
Me? You're the one
that looks

68
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:58,492
like you're
burying a dead body.

69
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,994
It is 6:00 in the morning.

70
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:02,663
I come in here
to shred in peace,

71
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,698
and you walk in and you scare
the crap out of me.

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,067
I'm sorry...
"Shred in peace"?

73
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,070
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this machine is?

74
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:11,705
Okay, I'm sorry.

75
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,440
If you want, I can help.

76
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,875
I'm actually here
to do some shredding myself.

77
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,610
You know what?
Never mind.

78
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:19,746
You've ruined
the whole thing.

79
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,081
Well, the good news is,

80
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,716
we don't have
a copy of that memo.

81
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:23,951
I'm sorry
to rain on your parade,

82
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,919
but the accusation here
isn't that you have it,

83
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,688
it's that you buried it,

84
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,989
so we should
probably move forward.

85
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,290
To what?

86
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,458
We need to put them
on the defensive.

87
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,194
- No, we don't.
- Harvey.

88
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,529
We need to get them
to drop the case.

89
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,764
- And how would we do that?
- How would I do it?

90
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,466
I would go to
the Randall family.

91
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,001
They got screwed
and they want justice,

92
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,469
but I'm not the guy
who screwed them,

93
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,503
so we need to
convince them that I--

94
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,105
Are you crazy?

95
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:47,207
You trashed this woman's
dead husband in open court.

96
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,642
Do you think
she gives a shit

97
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,010
about whether or not
you buried that document?

98
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,245
If you go there, you're not
just poking the bear,

99
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,181
you're putting
a cattle prod up its ass.

100
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:55,682
Is that
the same crack advice

101
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:57,985
you gave Brockton Cosmetics
and Drake Consulting

102
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,286
and Nappi LLC.?

103
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,887
'Cause none of those companies
exist anymore.

104
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,556
Congratulations, Harvey.

105
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,092
You found the three cases
that I've lost in 14 years.

106
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:07,027
And do you know what else
those cases have in common?

107
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:10,430
Nothing. Because I learn
from my mistakes.

108
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,798
Well, I'd prefer
to be represented by someone

109
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,467
who doesn't make any mistakes
in the first place.

110
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,202
Like you?

111
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,937
Because you've been accused
of burying evidence

112
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,605
not once, but twice.

113
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,507
Those accusations
are bullshit.

114
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,042
And that is
what I'm here to prove.

115
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:25,579
Jessica, if I may?

116
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,215
I don't think Harvey's problem
is with Allison.

117
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:30,817
I think his problem
is with me.

118
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,753
Daniel, we don't need
to air our laundry in here.

119
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:35,155
This is
a privileged conversation.

120
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:38,158
Jessica, I'm asking
you and Harvey to trust me.

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,894
So I'm going to
do the same for you.

122
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:45,165
I brought Allison in here
because I think she's the best.

123
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,034
Use her or don't.

124
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,104
But, if not, I suggest
you find someone just as good.

125
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:53,507
Harvey...

126
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,045
will you give
Allison and me a minute?

127
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,081
Let her down easy.

128
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:06,753
Allison,
I am impressed by you.

129
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,021
But if I'm going
to give you this job,

130
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,023
I need to know
that I can trust you.

131
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,725
I'm a straight shooter,
Jessica.

132
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,728
Easy to say,
harder to prove.

133
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,296
All right,
how about this?

134
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:19,232
Um, you are
an elegant woman,

135
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,767
but there's no
getting around it...

136
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,838
that dress does not
belong in this office.

137
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,709
I like you.

138
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,711
This may be something
that you don't like.

139
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,647
You won't be the one
dictating terms here. I will.

140
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,148
And regarding your laundry,

141
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,917
you have my word that Danny
won't be involved,

142
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,519
but you need to keep
that man on a leash.

143
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,921
- She said that to your face?
- Yep.

144
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,856
- You kick her ass out?
- Hired her on the spot.

145
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:43,957
The woman insults you,

146
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,926
all of a sudden
you're in bed with her?

147
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,661
Maybe I should tell you
how much I hate those shoes.

148
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:48,762
That's the joke
you're gonna make?

149
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,163
What?
It's both respectful

150
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,965
and disrespectful
at the same time.

151
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,734
Harvey, I don't
want you to overlook

152
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,470
the point of the story.
It's Allison's case.

153
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:57,771
The firm is the client,
and you're--

154
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:02,209
- The dog on a leash?
- Stay out of her way.

155
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,415
I got the address.

156
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,716

169
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:55,752
That's good.

170
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:58,964
I am not seeing
what I'm seeing.

171
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,532
Mrs. Randall, please,

172
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,601
I know you hate me for
what I did to your husband.

173
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,869
"Hate" is not the word.

174
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,305
There is no word to describe
what I feel for you.

175
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,941
Now get your ass--
Jennifer, look where we are.

176
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:10,742
I don't mean
to disrespect you

177
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,544
or dishonor
your husband's memory.

178
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,012
You've already done that.

179
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:15,447
I'm trying to make up
for it now.

180
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,182
Now that your back's
against the wall.

181
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:19,685
No, I started years ago.

182
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,856
This says
he's our anonymous donor.

183
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,625
- It's true.
- Of course. Guilty conscience.

184
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:29,061
No, I don't have
a guilty conscience,

185
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,896
'cause I wasn't the one
who hid that memo.

186
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,264
Look, I went
after your husband

187
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,999
because I thought
that car was solid.

188
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:36,335
I didn't like doing it,
but it was my job.

189
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:37,903
Why'd you give us
the money then?

190
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,638
Because you were trying
to make something good

191
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,974
come from something bad,
like I am now.

192
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:44,176
- What do you want?
- I know what he wants.

193
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:46,612
We're not
dropping our suit.

194
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:48,547
And the fact that you would
come here to tell me that

195
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:51,216
shows me just what kind
of self-serving trash you are.

196
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,019
You're right, I came here
to get you to drop your suit.

197
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:57,322
But instead of self-serving,
let's talk about me serving you.

198
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:59,391
You want payback
for what was done to you--

199
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,360
justice--
and I can get it.

200
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:03,328
My husband died,

201
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,697
and you made me sit there
while you shit on him.

202
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,499
That's what was done to me.

203
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:10,569
Now you're gonna tell me
that wasn't you?

204
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:12,404
Yeah, I want justice,

205
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:16,008
but that little donation
doesn't cover it.

206
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,495
This isn't really helping
your street cred, Harold.

207
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:38,330
It's not mine,
it's Louis'.

208
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:40,165
What's his name?

209
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,367
Bruno.
He brought him in

210
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,669
because he hasn't
been eating.

211
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:46,171
Whoa, wh--have you
mentioned to Louis

212
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:48,173
that you're allergic?

213
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,242
I tried to,
but he said that--

214
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:52,110
Allergies
are a sign of weakness.

215
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,646
Right, and bringing your cat
to work is a sign of strength.

216
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,683
Yeah, you want
to trade places?

217
00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:59,751
Uh, nope.

218
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,286
No, I got a meeting
in the conference room.

219
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:02,587
That's right,
that little tennis fling.

220
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:03,855
Makes me sick.

221
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,724
Harvey's got no appreciation
for the game.

222
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,526
Man wouldn't know topspin
if it hit him in the ball sack.

223
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:10,629
But enjoy yourself.
Get out.

224
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:18,070
Can you not smell that?
I'm stuffed up.

225
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,237
Uhhuh.
How long has it been?

226
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,238
Two hours.

227
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,406
How often do
I tell you to do it?

228
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:24,976
I'll get the bag.

229
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:25,977
Hi.

230
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,113
What's wrong, Bruno?

231
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,281
You're my best friend.

232
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:32,551
- You all set?
- I'm ready to roll.

233
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,019
Good, 'cause I got
a bidding war starting

234
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,555
for Marco's endorsement.

235
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:37,856
Dad?

236
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:39,257
Marco, why don't
you take a seat?

237
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,359
What's he doing here?

238
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:41,793
He's here to meet
with his son.

239
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:44,162
We're emancipating,
and you said you were in.

240
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:46,231
I did, which means
Marco's my client,

241
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:49,134
not you, so why don't you
go home, Jeffrey?

242
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,303
I'll call you
when we're done.

243
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,110
Mr. Mendoza,
I want to be clear,

244
00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:59,311
I'm not here
to exploit your son.

245
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:00,512
I'm here to protect him.

246
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:01,513
You're off
to a good start.

247
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,115
You can ask
any one of my clients.

248
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,149
They'll tell you the same.

249
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:06,818
You represent
Michael Jordan.

250
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,421
I do. In fact, I want
to tell you a story about him.

251
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:11,857
You want to tell me
a story about Michael Jordan

252
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,358
to convince me
my son should turn pro?

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,327
Let me tell you a story
about George Washington.

254
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:16,828
Maybe junior here
could become President.

255
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,097
I'm really more of
an Abe Lincoln fan myself.

256
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:20,766
You know, freed the slaves,
great beard.

257
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:22,401
- You finished?
- Yep.

258
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:26,405
Everybody knows M.J.
took two years off in his prime.

259
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,206
He regrets it to this day.

260
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,374
But he made
that decision himself,

261
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,109
and that's how
he lives with it.

262
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:34,679
All your son is asking is
for the chance to do the same.

263
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:35,781
I may not know
Mr. Jordan,

264
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,549
but I do know
that he's divorced,

265
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:40,218
and I've heard the rumors
about his gambling problem.

266
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,887
He's a man apart.

267
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,290
Now, my son is not ready
to handle that kind of life.

268
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,626
You've prepared me for this
since I was three.

269
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,928
I taught you tennis
because it's a beautiful game.

270
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,197
You may not have set out
to raise a prodigy,

271
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,598
but the fact is,
you did.

272
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,034
Do you have any children,
Mr. Specter?

273
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:59,004
No? Then I'm not interested
in your parenting advice.

274
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,439
I'm not giving
parenting advice.

275
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,740
I'm giving career advice.

276
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:03,942
You told me that
you didn't want to exploit him,

277
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,644
that you wanted
to protect him--

278
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:08,079
him, not his career.
- Look, you don't get it.

279
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,481
They're the same to me.

280
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:10,582
All right, I'm committed
to both of them,

281
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:11,383
and I don't give a shit
if you like it or not.

282
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,951
Marco.

283
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,152
You say that word to me
in front of these parasites?

284
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,587
Yeah, I'll say
whatever I want to say.

285
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,489
Shut your mouth.

286
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:19,224
Now, you are not
going to turn pro,

287
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,460
and you are not going
to continue down this path,

288
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:25,897
and this conversation
is over.

289
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,466
You just want
to let him leave?

290
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,034
Look, I don't
care what he does, okay?

291
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:32,037
I want to file
for emancipation.

292
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,841
So you're telling me
you don't have it?

293
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,642
I don't, but I'm sure
it'll turn up.

294
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:38,944
You sure?

295
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,579
Your job was to keep track
of that one thing.

296
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,746
Nice work.

297
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,482
It's a birthday card
for Norma.

298
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:44,616
She won't even tell us
how old she is.

299
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:45,984
Her birthday is today.

300
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:48,487
When do you think
it's going to turn up?

301
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:49,488
You know what,
forget it.

302
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,356
What's the matter with you?

303
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:53,358
What's the matter with me
is that nobody ever has

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,560
what they're supposed to
in this goddamn office.

305
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,533
You know what?
I got bigger fish to fry.

306
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,335
Put the wheels in motion.
"The wheels"?

307
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,469
This isn't a merger,
Harvey.

308
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:06,104
You're talking
about emancipation.

309
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,340
I'm talking about
filing for emancipation.

310
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:11,009
It's a tactic.
He cares about his son.

311
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,210
Nine times out of ten,
he backs down.

312
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,712
And what if he doesn't?

313
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,281
Then we'll be doing exactly
what the client wants us to do.

314
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:17,649
Oh, you mean
break up his family.

315
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:18,984
I mean help his family.

316
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,285
Wow, wonder
what kind of relationship

317
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,586
you had with your father.

318
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,255
Look, my father's
not up for discussion.

319
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:26,024
The only bone of contention
between them is this decision.

320
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,093
The sooner they resolve it,
the sooner they can move on.

321
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,294
The sooner you get paid.

322
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,996
I cut billion dollar deals
for breakfast.

323
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,398
I don't need this.
I told you,

324
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,734
it's what the client wants.

325
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,369
It's what
he <i>thinks</i> he wants.

326
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:40,372
Harvey, I was 11
when my dad died,

327
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,841
and our last conversation
was a fight.

328
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:44,910
If you gave me the choice
to be a pro anything

329
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,512
or to make up with him,
what do you think I'd choose?

330
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:49,848
If we don't do it, he'll find
someone else who will.

331
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,318
If you don't want him to do it,
change his goddamn mind.

332
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,655
Now go.
Fine.

333
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,431
Here's your
goddamn birthday card.

334
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,967
I don't appreciate you
coming into my office saying

335
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,436
that no one at the firm has
what they're supposed to have,

336
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,804
and I don't know what
crawled up your ass today,

337
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,372
but I take care of
my business.

338
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:18,076
I'm sorry, Rach.
You're right.

339
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,211
This isn't about you.
This is about me.

340
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,647
Okay then.

341
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,542
I unplugged it.

342
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,813
And this time, I'm not
stopping you by accident.

343
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,314
I have no idea
what you're talking about--

344
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,083
Don't bullshit me, Donna.

345
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,852
That's the same file you had
in your hand this morning.

346
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:04,055
You ran out of here
like you saw a ghost,

347
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,458
you bit off Rachel's head,
talking about how people

348
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,659
never have the things
they're supposed to have,

349
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,395
and now you're
right back here again.

350
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,597
It's not Dalton Enterprises
you're holding.

351
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,799
That's the memo that Harvey's
been accused of burying.

352
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,569
You know, the fact that
you would even accuse me of that

353
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:20,205
makes me sick.

354
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,539
But if you still
don't believe me, fine.

355
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,309
See for yourself.

356
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:30,515
I don't know what to do.

357
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,484
Tell me what happened.

358
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:33,852
I found it in
the file room that day.

359
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:35,787
It has my date stamp
on it--mine.

360
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,489
We have
to tell Harvey.

361
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,190
He'll know what to do.
No, he won't.

362
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,525
Donna, Harvey's been
operating under the assumption

363
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:41,860
that we never had
this memo, all right?

364
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:43,228
At some point,
that assumption

365
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,596
is gonna bite him
in the ass,

366
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:45,997
and the later it happens,
the bigger the bite.

367
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,132
Nobody
is going to believe

368
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,767
that a file that important
just got lost.

369
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,435
They'll think that
I got rid of it,

370
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:51,803
and that Harvey
told me to do it.

371
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,605
This memo is part
of a legal proceeding.

372
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:55,340
Shredding it is a crime.

373
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:58,209
Like practicing law
without a license is a crime?

374
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,380
Unlike you,
I didn't do this on purpose,

375
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:04,949
and I am protecting Harvey
the best way that I know how.

376
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,685
Allison Holt is gonna
figure out what happened.

377
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,253
And when she does,
her priority's not going to be

378
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,821
protecting you or Harvey.

379
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,024
It's gonna be
protecting the firm.

380
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:14,859
You might be comfortable
putting Harvey in that position,

381
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,728
but I'm not.

382
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,831
So either you tell him,
or I will.

383
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,084
- The answer is yes.
- What?

384
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:55,387
You can have
Halloween off this year.

385
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:58,323
Every July, you sit there
staring at me

386
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,159
before coming in here with
that sheepish look on your face

387
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,728
to ask to--
I have to tell you something.

388
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,795
What?
What is it?

389
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,931
What the hell
were you thinking?

390
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,432
You contacted
the plaintiffs

391
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,134
without their lawyer present
or our lawyer present.

392
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,236
Exactly,
I'm not our lawyer.

393
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,537
I had every legal right to.

394
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,239
You weren't supposed
to interfere.

395
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,042
Neither were you.
How did you even know?

396
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,343
She's not supposed
to tell you anything.

397
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,379
She was
forced to tell me

398
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,347
when I got served
with this goddamn subpoena.

399
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,749
You didn't want
to put them on the defensive,

400
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,484
which is good,
because what you've just done

401
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,718
is put us
on the defensive,

402
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,120
so now I have to spend
the next two weeks

403
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:30,722
prepping everyone from
Jessica to your secretary,

404
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,325
because Travis Tanner is gonna
depose them under oath.

405
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,327
Nobody here knows
a thing about that goddamn memo.

406
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,661
Let them waste
their time with it.

407
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,398
This is why you hire
outside counsel.

408
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,665
You can't see
how reckless that was,

409
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,567
even now, after
it's blown up in your face.

410
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,704
Fine, if you insist on
pre-deposing their depositions,

411
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,973
let's get it over with.
You can start with me.

412
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,442
I already have
your version of events.

413
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,311
Okay, you can
start with Donna.

414
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,982
What's not to understand?

415
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:59,017
Most fathers in the same
situation would either

416
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,319
want to live vicariously
through their children's lives

417
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,654
or sponge off their backs,

418
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,856
but your father,
he's just trying to protect you.

419
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,525
Yeah, look, I know
what he thinks he's doing.

420
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,327
Marco, it's a year
and eight months.

421
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,163
Maybe, but you don't
know what it's like

422
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:12,898
to be better at something
than everyone.

423
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,668
A year and eight months
is 505 days.

424
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,540
12,120 hours
and 727,200 minutes.

425
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,408
Yeah, I know what it's like.

426
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,577
You can do math
when you're an old man.

427
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,112
I can only dominate
till I'm 30.

428
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,880
Maybe, but if you go through
with this now,

429
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,582
you're gonna drive a wedge
between the two of you

430
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,084
that'll last
the rest of your life.

431
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,585
It's already there
because of him.

432
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,153
I'm like the horse
in the stall.

433
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,089
He won't open the gate, and
if it stays shut much longer,

434
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:40,292
I'm gonna go crazy.
All right, you're the client.

435
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,560
I just have a couple
of questions for you

436
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,028
before we can file
with the courts, okay?

437
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,463
Okay, great.

438
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:45,764
Has your father ever
abused drugs or alcohol?

439
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,499
- No.
- Is he a gambling addict?

440
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:48,867
- No, nothing like that.
- Is your home without

441
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,936
electricity,
running water, food?

442
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,003
We don't live in a slum.

443
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,271
Emancipation
requires proof

444
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,240
that your father
is an unfit parent.

445
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,442
We have to think about
how this plays in court.

446
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,044
And telling a judge
that he just wants you

447
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:01,113
to wait until you finish
high school before you make

448
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:04,916
millions of dollars
is not going to cut it.

449
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,086
Look, Marco...

450
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,287
what I saw in
that conference room

451
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,024
is not a father
who was unfit.

452
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,393
I saw a father
who loves his son.

453
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,300
You saw something else
in there, too.

454
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:26,872
You saw how furious he gets
when he's defied.

455
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:29,207
What are you getting at?

456
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,276
I'm getting at what happens
when he feels that way

457
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:35,680
and nobody else
is around.

458
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,884
There's no reason
to be concerned.

459
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,819
These are pro forma questions
I'm asking everyone.

460
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,220
Oh, I'm not concerned,
I'm bored,

461
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,788
so can we just...

462
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,457
Of course.

463
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,726
Do you think you can move
that other there?

464
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,127
It's my good side.

465
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,197
Well, my better side.
They're both good.

466
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,433
I'm just going to start.
Um...

467
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,969
So, when documents
are received into the firm,

468
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,070
they then come to you.

469
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,539
Is that correct?
Yes.

470
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,707
And how do they get
from the mail room to you?

471
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,977
Transporter beam.

472
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,782
Ms. Paulsen, I understand
that your time is valuable,

473
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,851
but I'm here
to prepare you.

474
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,454
And to a jury,
sarcasm plays as obstructive.

475
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:21,126
Obviously, any further mention
of <i>Star Trek</i>

476
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:23,628
may just compound
the problem, okay?

477
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,765
Aye, cap'n.

478
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,034
It's Donna, right?

479
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,503
All right,
so where you from, Donna?

480
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,039
- Upstate.
- Like Utica?

481
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,007
No, Cortland, actually.

482
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,109
Cortland's kind of
in the middle, isn't it?

483
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,544
I'm sorry, what does this
have to do with...

484
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,812
I'm just trying
to get to know you,

485
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:42,047
break down the walls.

486
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,381
You may not
know this about me,

487
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,116
but the truth is,
I'm actually single.

488
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:48,320
- Divorced?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

489
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:51,122
But anyway, I've been
going on all these dates,

490
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,091
and I found that
sometimes the best way

491
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,392
to get
the conversation going

492
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,027
is just start asking
a bunch of questions.

493
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,730
For example, where do you
see yourself in five years?

494
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,899
Well, actually, that's--

495
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,235
'Cause where I see you
is in jail.

496
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:04,903
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

497
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:06,504
You know what Harvey did
with that memo,

498
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,806
and you're going
to tell me right now.

499
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:11,409
Harvey didn't do anything.

500
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,979
Oh, I see.

501
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,782
He didn't have to
because you did it for him.

502
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,051
That's not true.

503
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,820
Then tell me
what is true.

504
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,656
Well, that's easy.

505
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,825
You don't give a shit
about me or Harvey.

506
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,660
This is a witch hunt,

507
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:32,430
and I'm not gonna sit in
this room for another minute.

508
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:36,107
I've worked
with Harvey since

509
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,768
he was a rookie
in the mail room.

510
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:39,212
No way he buried that memo.

511
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:41,214
You didn't see Donna
in that room.

512
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:43,783
I'm not saying
she wouldn't do it if he asked.

513
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,318
I'm saying
he wouldn't ask.

514
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,853
Wouldn't he?

515
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:48,621
Because she's not
the only person I talked to.

516
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,648
Now, a lot of people,
they don't like Harvey.

517
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,349
But even the ones
that love him

518
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,053
say he likes to work
in the gray.

519
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,655
I'd like Harvey
to sign this affidavit

520
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,356
swearing that his office
never received the memo.

521
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,357
Why?

522
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,892
To put with
this motion to dismiss.

523
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,728
If you wanted to file
a motion to dismiss,

524
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,563
you would have
done that already.

525
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:10,000
You want me to sign that thing
to cover your ass.

526
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,735
Do I think it's likely

527
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,337
that this case
is gonna get dismissed?

528
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,241
No, but it's worth a shot,
and to your point,

529
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,209
I'm not just doing this
to cover my ass.

530
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,713
I'm doing it
to cover your ass.

531
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,783
File the motion.

532
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,818
Harvey will sign
whatever I put in front of him.

533
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,059
I give you
one simple task.

534
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,660
Bruno isn't eating,
so you give him milk.

535
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,396
- I did.
- This is half-and-half.

536
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,465
I thought he'd like it.
It's creamier.

537
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,833
Hey, you know what,
maybe next time

538
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,669
I'll just hand my cat over
to Michael Vick.

539
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,246
Is that a cat carrier
in your hand?

540
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,481
No.

541
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,616
Is there a cat
in that thing?

542
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,918
It's called
a feline transportation unit.

543
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,386
Cat carrier.

544
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,387
Okay, they wouldn't call it
a cat carrier

545
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,722
when it costs $400.

546
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,557
- Do they call it a rip-off?
- Okay, you know what,

547
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,592
I don't have time for this.
Besides, I'm late as it is.

548
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,228
I have to ask.
What appointment?

549
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,863
- Dentist.
- With a cat?

550
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,631
- For the cat.
- You take him to a cat dentist?

551
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,966
I can't take him
to my dentist.

552
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,701
Dr. Schneller wouldn't know
what to do with him.

553
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,236
- Dr. Richard Schneller?
- Good-bye, Harvey.

554
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,738
I don't want to hear it.

555
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,972
If it's bad news,
I don't want to hear it.

556
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,440
- You seem upset.
- Of course I'm upset.

557
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,508
I just found out
that Louis and I

558
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,776
share the same dentist.

559
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:26,877
Have you spoken
to Donna yet?

560
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,945
No,
and I'm pissed about it.

561
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,279
I need her to get me
a new dentist.

562
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,647
Well, we have a problem,

563
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,482
whether you want
to hear it or not.

564
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,850
What?

565
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,384
Marco needs to be emancipated
from his father.

566
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,619
But that's not a problem.
That's what we're doing.

567
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,620
No, I don't mean
to let him play.

568
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,856
I mean to keep him safe.

569
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,824
That is directly
from the hospital.

570
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,726
His dad did that to him.

571
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,361
We need to get him away
from his father.

572
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,696
I need to get him away.

573
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,664
I set the hearing,
and I'm going to win.

574
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,932
I'm hearing
a lot of "I"s in there.

575
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,334
- Harvey--
- This isn't housing court.

576
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,702
This is a kid's life.

577
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,237
I know that,
and the only reason

578
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,505
you know that
is because I gave a shit

579
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,039
about this kid's life
in the first place.

580
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,142
You think I didn't think
I was smarter

581
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,943
than the guy
I started working for?

582
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,347
I did, and I was,
and I waited my goddamn turn.

583
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,149
Harvey, I'm ready.

584
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,316
It's time to let me
out of the gate.

585
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,252
Allison's filing
a motion to dismiss.

586
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,888
She's swinging for the fences,
I'll give her that.

587
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,056
You know what, I'm gonna
swing for the fences too.

588
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,424
Mike's going to court.

589
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,627
- I am?
- What's the case?

590
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,162
Emancipation.

591
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,164
- From him?
- I wish.

592
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,431
He doesn't need
a court order for that.

593
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,100
- Our little baby's growing up.
- Okay.

594
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,935
Listen, I need you
to sign this affidavit

595
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,104
that we never received
that memo from Coastal Motors.

596
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,763
Oh, my God!
Oh, I'm--

597
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,199
There are napkins
over there.

598
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,768
I knew he wasn't a lawyer.
I didn't think he was an idiot.

599
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,769
I knew he was an idiot.

600
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,037
I didn't know
he was spastic.

601
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,705
I'm sorry, guys.

602
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,073
When you get this cleaned up,
come see me.

603
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,342
I'll get you a fresh one.

604
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,411
- What the hell was that?
- What?

605
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,046
- You know what.
- It was an accident.

606
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,080
It was intentional.

607
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,582
You ambushed me
with a cup of coffee.

608
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,351
Think I haven't seen <i>Ronin?</i>

609
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,485
It was all
I could think of.

610
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,553
Meaning?

611
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,689
Donna was supposed
to tell you.

612
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,023
Tell me what?

613
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,391
You can't
sign the affidavit.

614
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:25,629
You'll be
committing perjury.

615
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,006
What the hell
were you thinking?

616
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,507
I didn't know
how to tell you.

617
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,643
"Harvey, I found the memo."
Is that so goddamn hard?

618
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,646
You don't understand.
It had my name on it.

619
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,082
I stamped it in.
That implicates you.

620
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,583
Did you keep it
from me four years ago?

621
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,919
I don't even remember
seeing it four years ago.

622
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,420
Then I don't give a shit
what it implicates.

623
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,922
You don't keep it
from me now.

624
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,757
I had never made
a mistake like that,

625
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,225
and I thought
that I needed to--

626
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,860
Look, keeping it from me
isn't a mistake.

627
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,796
It's a decision.
I wanted to protect you.

628
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,765
Lying to me
doesn't protect me.

629
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,867
It betrays me.
Betrays you?

630
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,602
If I had told you
the truth--

631
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,504
You don't
keep things from me!

632
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,538
You keep things from me
all the time!

633
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,007
That's because
I'm your boss.

634
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,175
Well, maybe you shouldn't
be my boss anymore.

635
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,680
I did what I thought
I had to do for you,

636
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,883
and if you can't...

637
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,518
just fire me.

638
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,686
Let me explain
something to you.

639
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,788
That memo doesn't hurt me.
It helps me.

640
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,124
If I had buried it,
we wouldn't have it.

641
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,627
But you found it,
so that's a good thing.

642
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,396
What?

643
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:35,232
Wh-what'd you do?

644
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:37,067
Oh, what did you do?

645
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,236
Allison
had that freaking camera,

646
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,705
and I was--

647
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,840
she implied that we were--

648
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,343
What did you do?

649
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,345
It's gone.

650
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,615
You destroyed it?

651
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,685
I'm not going
to fire you, Donna.

652
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:58,722
I might kill you,
but I'm not gonna fire you.

653
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,157
What are you going to do?

654
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,926
What you should've done
from day one.

655
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,901
Let me get this straight.

656
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,536
Your own assistant
destroys evidence,

657
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:13,570
and you still want
to go to trial?

658
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,938
- Yes.
- No.

659
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,673
You need to cut a deal
right now.

660
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,775
You mean we need
to cut a deal, right,

661
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,210
because we're
all on the same side?

662
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,745
Harvey.

663
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,713
You think I didn't know
what you were up to

664
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,381
with that affidavit?

665
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,849
I was advising my client,
the firm.

666
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,719
You once told me
I was the firm.

667
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,455
She came to me and thought
that you were in on it.

668
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,323
I said no way.

669
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,459
She wanted you
to sign that thing.

670
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,761
I'm the leader of this firm.
I made a decision.

671
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,731
You were happy to do it.
Don't blame me for Donna.

672
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,301
I'm not, but I need to know
if you still believe me.

673
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,303
- I do.
- That's beside the point.

674
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,472
We have a decision to make.
There is no decision.

675
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,640
We need
to cut a deal--today.

676
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,608
You know what,
that's the difference

677
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,809
between us, Allison.

678
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,845
You want to lose small.
I want to win big.

679
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,314
She's the one
who has to try the case.

680
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,448
Regardless of
what Donna did,

681
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,649
I never saw the memo.

682
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,151
Are you gonna
sell a jury on that?

683
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,820
Maybe the same way you sold it
to the Randall family.

684
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,656
We have a window to settle this
before we have to disclose,

685
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,058
but it's closing,
and when it does,

686
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,626
we could offer them
the moon.

687
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,827
They're not gonna take it.
What's the downside of asking?

688
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,462
We went through this
with the nurses.

689
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,199
It tells them we're weak.
We are weak.

690
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,036
Set it up.

691
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,672
And whatever you're thinking,
I don't want to hear it.

692
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,629
Mr. Mendoza, you've
asserted that, as a parent,

693
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:01,631
you have certain rights.

694
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:03,066
Do those include
the right to discipline Marco

695
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,834
as you see fit?

696
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:06,436
Every parent
has that right.

697
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:09,105
The right to teach
your child a lesson.

698
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,673
- Yes.
- When he defies you.

699
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:13,209
If need be.

700
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:15,812
And if need be,
do you get angry?

701
00:28:15,814 --> 00:28:18,114
Do you fly off the handle?
Do you become abusive?

702
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:19,716
No, I would
never go that far.

703
00:28:19,718 --> 00:28:21,050
Mr. Mendoza,
would you agree that,

704
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:22,619
along with those rights,

705
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:25,088
you have certain
responsibilities as a parent?

706
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,956
Of course.

707
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,424
The responsibility
to keep your son healthy?

708
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,927
Marco gets up every day
at 4:30 to train.

709
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:32,428
I think that one's covered.

710
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,497
The responsibility
to keep your son safe?

711
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:36,366
That's the first job
of every parent.

712
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:38,134
Hmm.

713
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:40,603
Let's talk about
May 18th of last year.

714
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:41,838
You took your son
to the hospital

715
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,607
where he was treated
for severe dehydration.

716
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:45,742
Rushed my son
to keep him safe.

717
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,277
What I'm interested in

718
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,379
is how he got dehydrated
in the first place.

719
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,080
He was running laps.

720
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:52,248
Hadn't you had
an argument

721
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,783
about going pro
the night before?

722
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:55,618
Yes.

723
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,922
And you wanted to teach him
a lesson, as was your right.

724
00:28:58,924 --> 00:29:01,057
What?

725
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,593
He questioned your authority,
didn't he?

726
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:05,094
He's done it before,
hasn't he?

727
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:06,562
And you don't like that,
do you?

728
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:08,231
- You are twisting this.
- You got angry,

729
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:10,366
you flew off the handle,
and you became abusive.

730
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:11,734
Objection, badgering.

731
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:13,102
Easy, Mr. Ross.

732
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:14,837
Marco
has never called 911.

733
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,240
He's never reported me
to social services.

734
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:18,274
He's never complained
to anyone.

735
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:19,709
They never do.

736
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:21,811
You think I put my own son
in the hospital?

737
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,546
Oh, I've read this report.
I know you did.

738
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:24,814
And I know you will again.

739
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:27,250
You are a lying
little piece of shit.

740
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:29,619
- And there it is.
- Mr. Mendoza, that's enough.

741
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:35,625
No further questions.

742
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:43,433
Oh, what the hell?
You don't sneak up like that.

743
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:46,336
I wasn't sneaking up.
I was just getting coffee.

744
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:48,204
Yeah, well,
the paralegal needs coffee.

745
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:50,373
I guess the junior partner
needs to get out of her way.

746
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,075
You know what, Louis,
if you treated people here

747
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:53,810
just a tenth as nicely
as you treat your cat,

748
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:56,212
they might not feel about you
the way that you know they do.

749
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:58,214
I'm sorry.

750
00:29:58,216 --> 00:29:59,816
Is everything okay?

751
00:29:59,818 --> 00:30:03,920
No, I just have, like,
a condition with my tear ducts.

752
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:06,422
Oh, my God.

753
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:10,159
I just assumed
that he wasn't eating

754
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,895
because of his toothache...

755
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:16,933
but it turns out
his hygiene was perfect.

756
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:20,336
But of course it was, because
we flossed every day, so...

757
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:24,207
And then they did these tests.

758
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:27,210
And I told the vet,
"money is no object,"

759
00:30:27,212 --> 00:30:31,180
but, uh...

760
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:33,549
it was too late.

761
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,519
Bruno was suffering...

762
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:39,822
Excuse me.
No-

763
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:48,164
- hey.
- Hey.

764
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:52,135
- Is everything okay?
- Not exactly.

765
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:53,903
Okay, I'll come back
when you're finished.

766
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:55,271
I wasn't
talking about you.

767
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:57,206
Not everything's about you,
you know.

768
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,308
Now, you see,
that's where you're wrong.

769
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:02,879
What's going on
with Donna?

770
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:04,180
I don't know.

771
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:06,315
What do you mean?

772
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:08,551
I saw you watching us
the other day.

773
00:31:08,553 --> 00:31:12,488
You know something.

774
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,725
Come on, Mike, how many secrets
are you gonna keep from me?

775
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:18,728
It's not mine.
It's Donna's.

776
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,396
I'm not saying you need
to give me specifics.

777
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,167
I just need to know
that she's okay.

778
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,339
She screwed up,
and it's not small.

779
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:34,677
- What's gonna happen?
- Harvey's going to fix it.

780
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,345
How do you know?

781
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:39,015
You're gonna fix this
situation with Donna, right?

782
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:41,484
- Why should I tell you?
- What?

783
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:42,785
If I hadn't caught you,
when were you gonna tell me

784
00:31:42,787 --> 00:31:44,153
that she had that memo?

785
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:45,588
I wasn't, 'cause
she promised me she would.

786
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,256
Well, what would have
happened if you hadn't been

787
00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:49,492
in my office when Jessica
brought me that affidavit?

788
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:50,693
That would've been
between you and Donna.

789
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:53,396
And I would have
committed perjury.

790
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:55,631
You're right.
I should have told you,

791
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:58,534
or had Donna tell you then
and there, but I was thinking

792
00:31:58,536 --> 00:32:00,870
the fact that she actually
found this thing helps us.

793
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,805
Yeah,
it would've helped us.

794
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,475
She destroyed it.

795
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:07,276
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

796
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:08,644
Whoa.

797
00:32:08,646 --> 00:32:10,046
Harvey, she was
backed into a corner.

798
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:11,380
She made a bad call.

799
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:12,849
Look, we can still--
Tell the truth?

800
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:14,851
How do you think
that's going to play in court?

801
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:20,790
Oh, my God.
Um, I have to go.

802
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,058
You screwed up with Marco,
didn't you?

803
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,392
I'm on it.

804
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:25,394
And this thing with Donna,
just let it go.

805
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:28,831
I'm sure she said she was sorry.
She is sorry.

806
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:32,034
But she never said it.

807
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,106
Didn't expect
to see you today.

808
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,975
I wanted to get you the offer
as soon as I could.

809
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,276
You could have called.

810
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:42,712
No, I couldn't.

811
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:44,547
Tanner's terms.

812
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:45,982
The firm pays
$5 million in damages,

813
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:47,150
as well as all legal fees.

814
00:32:47,152 --> 00:32:49,752
What else?

815
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:51,854
Pearson Hardman
immediately and irrevocably

816
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:56,292
strips Harvey Specter
of his senior partnership

817
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:59,462
and reports him to
the New York Bar Association.

818
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:01,564
I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

819
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:05,735
but I would
take this deal and run.

820
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:14,977
What do you want now?

821
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:17,613
Sell me a vacuum cleaner?
Set of steak knives?

822
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:18,748
I don't want
to sell you anything.

823
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,550
I'm not here to do that.

824
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:22,785
I'm here to tell you
that I'm sorry.

825
00:33:22,787 --> 00:33:26,455
I should have known
about that memo.

826
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:28,024
But I didn't do my job.

827
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:29,892
If I had, you and I
wouldn't be here right now.

828
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:30,893
But we are here
right now

829
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:33,563
because of what you did
to my husband.

830
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:36,199
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

831
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,800
I never should have done it.

832
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:41,904
My mother marched,
Mr. lawyer.

833
00:33:41,906 --> 00:33:45,107
They set dogs on her.
I saw the scars.

834
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:47,743
She said it wasn't the dogs,
it was the men.

835
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:50,913
I say,
put those dogs down.

836
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:54,682
So you think
we should take this deal?

837
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:57,495
I think we have to.

838
00:33:57,497 --> 00:33:59,163
Just say it.

839
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:01,232
You want me
to cut Harvey loose.

840
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:03,100
You've never been afraid
to spill blood before.

841
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:04,902
You means yours.

842
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:06,437
I was actually referring
to when you and I

843
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,272
crossed the other names
off the letterhead.

844
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:10,007
That was for
the good of the firm.

845
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:12,143
Was it?

846
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:16,781
Evidence was destroyed,
Jessica.

847
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:20,284
- Not by Harvey.
- On his watch, therefore...

848
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:21,319
On mine.

849
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:22,753
If this were
anyone else,

850
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,021
you'd be seeing it
the same way I do.

851
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:26,190
I'm not scapegoating him.

852
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,659
You care about Harvey.
I know that.

853
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:29,827
But I also know
that you care about

854
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:31,929
your position in this firm.

855
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,631
A law was broken.

856
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:35,933
Are you really going
to sit by and do nothing?

857
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,139
I've got to call you back.

858
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:44,542
Did you get it?
Got it right here,

859
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:46,377
fully executed emancipation.

860
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,645
You tell Marco yet?

861
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:48,446
No, I wanted you
to see it first.

862
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,747
Nice job.

863
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:50,948
This way I can call him
with the good news.

864
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,918
- Yeah, just one problem.
- What's that?

865
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,786
Marco lied.

866
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:57,521
- What?
- Yeah.

867
00:34:57,523 --> 00:34:59,023
We got backed
into a corner,

868
00:34:59,025 --> 00:35:00,591
and he knew the truth
wouldn't play in court,

869
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:02,960
so he made up a story.

870
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:05,329
If it was a lie, Michael,
then why didn't Oscar say so?

871
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:06,797
Marco perjured himself.

872
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:08,099
You really think his father

873
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:09,500
was going to be the one
to point that out?

874
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:11,202
- That's a lot of conjecture.
- Yeah, it would be.

875
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:13,204
But I went to see Oscar.

876
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:15,806
Turns out he wasn't even there
when Marco ran those laps.

877
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:17,742
But you were.
Nuhuh, it's bullshit.

878
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:19,810
I saw the look
on your face in court.

879
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:22,280
You knew,
and you did nothing.

880
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,618
You got me.

881
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,086
But it doesn't matter,
'cause we won.

882
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:30,521
No, we didn't.

883
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:33,257
'Cause I'm not filing papers
based on a lie.

884
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:34,659
Harvey is gonna make you
regret that.

885
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:37,828
Harvey's not
gonna do shit.

886
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,432
This is my case,
and you are done.

887
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:56,447
♪

888
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:58,416
We need to talk.

889
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:00,418
It's subtle, but Daniel's
strong-arming me.

890
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,419
Not now.

891
00:36:01,421 --> 00:36:03,621
My dad.

892
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:11,595
♪

893
00:36:18,403 --> 00:36:19,804
I was wrong.

894
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:22,406
Am I in
the right office?

895
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:24,842
I went to
the plaintiffs again.

896
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,911
Why?

897
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,379
To tell them
I was sorry.

898
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:31,315
Harvey, there is
a deal on the table.

899
00:36:31,317 --> 00:36:34,085
Allison's right.

900
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:36,454
I shouldn't be the lawyer.

901
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:38,989
I don't even
make a good client.

902
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:42,126
Neither do I.

903
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:45,329
But I've got some hard news
I have to tell you.

904
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,767
Okay, let me guess,

905
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,202
you're here
to take me up on my offer

906
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:53,137
to trade offices.
No.

907
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:56,207
But I did happen
to find these.

908
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:57,441
Who still eats Twinkies?

909
00:36:57,443 --> 00:37:00,244
Who doesn't
still eat Twinkies?

910
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:02,880
What's up?

911
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:05,416
- I need a favor.
- Okay, what?

912
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,685
Is this from
your tennis client?

913
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:09,620
First one.

914
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:11,389
Not as big
as Harvey's.

915
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:12,890
Really?
You're gonna go there?

916
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:15,025
It's probably gonna be
worth a lot of money someday.

917
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,761
- Probably.
- I need it.

918
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:18,129
It's important.

919
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:20,898
What for?

920
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,934
Why don't we
just call that my secret?

921
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:32,410
Daniel,

922
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:36,247
will you come to
my office right now please?

923
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:44,255
Have a seat.

924
00:37:44,257 --> 00:37:46,690
Couldn't we have done this
in my office?

925
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:49,894
Yes, we could have,
but I prefer to do it here...

926
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:52,963
in your old office.

927
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,600
What's this?

928
00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:58,736
I want you to
let Allison Holt go.

929
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,938
- Why would I do that?
- Why you?

930
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,073
Because you brought her in
initially.

931
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:06,110
I am extending you
the courtesy of letting her go.

932
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:08,646
As for why at all,

933
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:11,916
I do care about
my position in this firm

934
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:14,785
and my position
is that we win.

935
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:17,621
We win, Harvey wins,

936
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:18,622
and I win.

937
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,191
Allison Holt can't win,

938
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:21,792
because she doesn't
believe in Harvey.

939
00:38:21,794 --> 00:38:24,695
I can, because I do.

940
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:26,797
- It's your decision.
- It is.

941
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:30,100
But don't try to pass it off
as a courtesy.

942
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:32,369
You're trying
to humiliate me,

943
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:34,605
like you did by summoning me
into your office.

944
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:37,775
I summoned you because
I wanted you to understand

945
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:39,677
who you were
threatening earlier.

946
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,279
I wasn't threatening you.

947
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,815
I was pointing out facts.
Yes.

948
00:38:44,817 --> 00:38:46,650
The fact that,
if I'm not careful,

949
00:38:46,652 --> 00:38:48,252
you'll try to take
this office back.

950
00:38:48,254 --> 00:38:50,221
That's not going to happen.

951
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:55,593
And as for your point
about a law being broken,

952
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:57,495
you're right.

953
00:38:57,497 --> 00:39:00,731
I'm not going to sit by
and do nothing.

954
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:05,202
Louis, can I come in?

955
00:39:05,204 --> 00:39:09,773
I'm a little busy
right now.

956
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:14,144
Where'd you get this?

957
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:17,948
I just know what
a huge tennis fan you are.

958
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:27,291
Rachel...

959
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:33,531
could you just close
the door on your way out?

960
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:36,567
Sure thing, Louis.

961
00:39:56,788 --> 00:39:59,290
Harvey's not here.
He should be back soon.

962
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:01,058
I'm not here
to see Harvey.

963
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,594
Oh.

964
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:07,565
He wanted to be the one to
have this conversation with you.

965
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:08,999
But it's my firm,

966
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,802
and I wanted you
to hear it from me.

967
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:13,504
Am I being fired?

968
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:16,574
Yes.

969
00:40:16,576 --> 00:40:18,576
I appreciate everything
that you've done

970
00:40:18,578 --> 00:40:20,311
for Harvey and for me,

971
00:40:20,313 --> 00:40:23,547
but whatever
my personal feelings,

972
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,650
your actions
have left me no choice

973
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:28,886
but to terminate your employment
at Pearson Hardman

974
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:31,288
effective immediately.

975
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:14,064
♪

976
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:36,286
You said
he was going to fix it.

977
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:39,423
I thought he would.
