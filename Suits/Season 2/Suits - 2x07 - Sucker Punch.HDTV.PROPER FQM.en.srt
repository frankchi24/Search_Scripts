1
00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:03,088
So you did have the document
from Coastal Motors?

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,740
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,808
I wasn't objecting
to his question.

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:09,976
Just his tie.

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,545
I do have to look at it,
you know.

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,581
This is fun,
isn't it, Harv?

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,616
Hanging out, catching up,

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:17,751
learning about your fraud.

9
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,686
I hate to burst your bubble,
Trav,

10
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,254
but there was no fraud.

11
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,389
There was no fraud.
What?

12
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,590
You just said,
you had the document.

13
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,258
Yes. We went back through
the case files.

14
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,260
Found the report.
Whoops.

15
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,995
That's it.
"Whoops"?

16
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,197
Hope, you got that.

17
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,367
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?

18
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,835
All right,
you've made your point.

19
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,171
You made us a settlement offer
that we would never take.

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,773
Let's talk about
one that we would.

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,041
This is a deposition,
not a settlement meeting.

22
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,743
Every meeting
is a settlement meeting.

23
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,311
Fine.

24
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,847
The offer was 5 million,
and Harvey gets disbarred.

25
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:51,084
How about $100 million?

26
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:53,319
And Harvey gets disbarred.

27
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,321
Tanner, you want to take
this to court, go right ahead.

28
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,257
I'd rather watch her
cut you down

29
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,825
than see her cut
a deal anyway.

30
00:00:58,893 --> 00:00:59,993
You know,
I see why hairdo

31
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,528
wants to roll the dice,
but why you?

32
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,297
You just went from
5 million to 100 million,

33
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,899
and you're questioning
why I don't want to settle.

34
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,167
If that's a sticking point,

35
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,568
I might be able to go to
0 million.

36
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,370
But the one thing
I won't budge on is

37
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,172
he gets disbarred.

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,140
I think I'm doing you
a favor.

39
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,375
And what does he--

40
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,177
cause a headache like this once,
twice a month?

41
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,311
Doesn't matter,

42
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,312
'cause he cures more
than he makes,

43
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,380
like when you stuck your nose

44
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,182
into my case last year,
and he beat you.

45
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,283
Crushed him.

46
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,451
Then he took his ball
and went home.

47
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,319
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.

48
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,754
Finishing
each other's sentences.

49
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,022
How cute.

50
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,458
No wonder you won't throw him
under the bus.

51
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,725
Good for you, Harvey.

52
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,194
I mean,

53
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,229
you're throwing her
under the bus.

54
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,230
Watch yourself, Tanner.

55
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,598
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?

56
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,567
Did I offend
your delicate sensibilities?

57
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,268
You want to take
your ball and go home?

58
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,336
I'm gonna take my ball

59
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,270
and shove it up your--
Harvey.

60
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,839
Of course.

61
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,843
Your coifed hair,
your pretty nails.

62
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,445
See? She's the man,
and you're the girl.

63
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,380
You know, it's funny.

64
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,782
I would have thought
she'd prefer someone like--

65
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,983
This deposition is over.

66
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,852
Now what? Is mommy
gonna take you home now?

67
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,890
Wait. That's it.

68
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,993
You got a thing for mommy.

69
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,928
And now it all makes sense.

70
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,231
Because I actually
looked into your mommy,

71
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,299
and it turns out
that the whole time

72
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,068
you were home with daddy,
mommy was out banging--

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

74
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,549
Point, Tanner.

75
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:34,954
I'll see you in court, Harv.

76
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,762
So when did the plan change

77
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,831
from trying to settle
to punching Tanner in the face?

78
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,466
He didn't seem to want
to do the one,

79
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,034
so I did the other.

80
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,103
That's funny.

81
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,337
But he got under your skin,

82
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,906
and that can't happen
when we go to trial.

83
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,408
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.

84
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,943
Are you suggesting
a trial run?

85
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,778
I don't want
a trial at all but--

86
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,348
We already know your position
is to cut me loose.

87
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,783
Not you.
No.

88
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,051
I'm just one of many partners

89
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,419
who don't know what to think.

90
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,321
And if they don't know
you didn't do it,

91
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,090
how is a jury gonna feel?

92
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,759
You're betting everything
on this trial.

93
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,528
Better make damn sure
you can win.

94
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,565
He's an asshole.

95
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,767
He's right.

96
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,035
All right, what?

97
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,202
If we're gonna do this,

98
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,004
I don't want to waste the chance

99
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,239
to tune you up,

100
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,741
but that means we need
a damn good Tanner.

101
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:29,742
Are you saying I'm rusty?

102
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,777
When was the last time

103
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,846
you were in the ring?

104
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,416
We don't need a good Tanner.

105
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,585
We need a nasty Tanner.

106
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,053
Someone who will do anything
to beat me.

107
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,922
Someone who makes you want
to punch him in the face.

108
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,560
Oh, you want me to do what?

109
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,295
I just told you four times.

110
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,997
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.

111
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,365
I'm--I was a little distracted
because I was reading.

112
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,499
Can you just repeat it
one more time?

113
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,001
Look, Louis,
you've had your fun.

114
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,071
When I said the ground rules
were to knock me off my game,

115
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,205
I was talking about the trial.

116
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,540
I know what
you're talking about.

117
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,641
You didn't come to me
because I'm an idiot.

118
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:02,976
No, not because you're one,

119
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,210
in spite of you being one.

120
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,579
I'm the man for the job,
and you know it.

121
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,381
Actually, I had you
at number five on my list.

122
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,382
And what did Jessica
have me at?

123
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,383
Six.

124
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,384
Okay. I get it. I get it.

125
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,418
You're trying to make me mad.

126
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,820
No, I'm trying
to make you good.

127
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,755
You see, the one thing
you have in common

128
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,123
with Tanner
is your hatred of me.

129
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,291
That is true.

130
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,159
But what you don't have
are his skills.

131
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,928
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.

132
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,597
Wait, Harvey. Stop.

133
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,899
You don't think I can win?

134
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,036
I know you can't.

135
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,639
This isn't some bank loan,
junior.

136
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,407
Get out.

137
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,409
I've got a trial to prepare for.

138
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,477
And you know what?

139
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,478
When you lose,

140
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,779
do not come crying to me,

141
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,080
because there's nothing
on this earth

142
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,515
that would be sacred enough
to stop me

143
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,318
from shoving your ass
in the goddamn ground.

144
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,519
Good.

145
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,321
Because those are
the real ground rules.

146
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,722
Oh, I see.

147
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,491
Now, you're asking
to get lit up.

148
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,760
Somebody wants to get lit up.

149

00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:35,064
She would be red,
so...

163
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:36,265
No.

164
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,199
Then those would all be
the same shade

165
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,200
of I-don't-give-a-shit.

166
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:40,503
Call her again.
Yes.

167
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,504
So?

168
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:42,905
How was it?

169
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,440
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.

170
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,008
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.

171
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:47,243
What are you,
in middle school?

172
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,879
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.

173
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,180
Mock trials are for children.

174
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,715
The adults are doing
an in-house trial run.

175
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:55,051
Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.

176
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:57,119
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to,
not potato.

177
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:58,321
What do you need me to do?

178
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,789
What he needs you to do
is help me.

179
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,223
What's this?

180
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,325
You've been drafted.

181
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:03,459
Okay, what round?

182
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,161
Excuse me?

183
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,495
Sports metaphor.

184
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:08,597
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.

185
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:10,232
You've been assigned
by the judge to help me

186
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,268
in pretty boy's trial.

187
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,903
Oh, look at that,
he thinks I'm pretty.

188
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,205
Wait, what judge?

189
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:17,306
His honor, Daniel Hardman.

190
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,942
I'll see you in court,
sweet tits.

191
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,344
No, no. He can't.

192
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,345
- He can.
- I'm not--

193
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:23,446
- You are.
- Harvey--

194
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,214
Listen, Louis is devious,

195
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:26,449
confident, and intelligent.

196
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,552
You forgot ugly, lazy,
and disrespectful.

197
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,220
Now is not the time to quote
<i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

198
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:33,489
Oh, you mess with the bully,
you get the horn.

199
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:34,857
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.

200
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,193
Jessica's going against
Muhammad Ali.

201
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,194
She better be able

202
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:39,495
to beat Joe Frazier.

203
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:41,931
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay. I get it.

204
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,667
You want me to help
Louis think outside the box.

205
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,469
Exactly. Now, how would
you come after me?

206
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,771
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.

207
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,106
Because you and I
are not discussing

208
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:52,041
this trial during this trial.

209
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,409
Oh, and you were right.

210
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:56,212
I know. About what?

211
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,949
Tanner.
It was awesome.

212
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:11,660
Guess you're not going
to let me win.

213
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:12,762
Have I ever?

214
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:13,929
Would I know?

215
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:16,866
Doubtful.

216
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:17,767
Have you ever?
I am right now.

217
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:21,370
Rule number 27:

218
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:25,474
Never beat the person
you're trying to close.

219
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,778
I always hated rule number 27.

220
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:30,613
You couldn't close me
five years ago.

221
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,114
What makes you think
you've got a shot tonight?

222
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:33,115
Didn't.

223
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:34,250
Not couldn't.

224
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,284
And five years ago,

225
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:36,285
it wasn't your legal services

226
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,254
I was interested in.

227
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,489
How does Jessica feel
about an employee

228
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:42,391
who resigned coming back
to consult?

229
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,859
She's onboard.

230
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:44,860
Do you mean
I have to convince her?

231
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:45,861
See that?

232
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,329
That's why I want you.

233
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:50,232
You could've told me
all this on the phone.

234
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,401
Well, I wanted
to see you first.

235
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:56,072
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.

236
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,273
You know, because--

237
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,042
"I didn't call you back
five years ago"?

238
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,144
Oops.

239
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:04,280
You think you didn't call me
back five years ago?

240
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,849
Oh, I know I didn't call you
back five years ago.

241
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,951
Well, I hope
your jury consulting

242
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,186
is better than your memory.

243
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:11,987
I guess we'll have to agree
to disagree.

244
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,255
Because you know I'm right.

245
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:15,925
Because
I'm a bigger person.

246
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:20,262
Which is why I'm gonna come in.

247
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,831
But I want to know,
why'd you call me

248
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,899
instead of Ted Phillips?

249
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,734
Why do you think?

250
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:28,938
They had the document.

251
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:33,042
They kept it to themselves,
and then they destroyed it.

252
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,111
These are the facts of the case,

253
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:37,279
and they are undisputed.

254
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,186
Aren't you supposed
to be over there?

255
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:46,222
You know, I'm just working on

256
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:47,223
something for work.
Yeah.

257
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,291
And just quoting <i>A Few Good Men.</i>

258
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,927
- For work.
- I know.

259
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:54,964
Look, I, um...

260
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:58,334
I have to ask you.

261
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:01,237
Do you think that
it's at all possible

262
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,905
that he actually did it?

263
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:05,574
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?

264
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:07,476
Because I know Harvey.

265
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:09,078
I mean, how could you think
he could do it?

266
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,946
Because I don't know Harvey.

267
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,015
All I know is that he thinks
he's above the rules,

268
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,351
and he will do
whatever it takes to win.

269
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:17,820
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--

270
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:24,226
you don't think
he has integrity.

271
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:27,329
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.

272
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:30,232
Oh, Mike.

273
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,869
What happens to you
if Harvey loses?

274
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,474
I don't know.

275
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,476
But right now,
it's not my job

276
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:42,978
to worry about him losing.

277
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,780
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

278
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,215
guilty is not gray.

279
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,683
You either are or you aren't.

280
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:51,353
And Harvey Specter is guilty
of concealing that document.

281
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:54,790
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.

282
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,258
Says his lap dog.

283
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,327
Says the guy who knows
how to beat him.

284
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:00,129
I'm listening.

285
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:01,263
How?

286
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,432
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.

287
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,934
Do you know
how Harvey beat Tanner?

288
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,101
No.

289
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,169
He threatened to commit
perjury to win.

290
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:09,238
Of course,
it's classic Harvey.

291
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:10,239
He was bluffing.

292
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:11,941
But Tanner didn't know that,

293
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:13,309
and Harvey used against him.

294
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,110
What's your point?

295
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:16,679
My point is you said
classic Harvey

296
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,214
before you even knew
he was bluffing

297
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:20,316
because you don't think
Harvey has any integrity.

298
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:21,784
Nobody thinks
Harvey has integrity.

299
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,952
So then use that

300
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:26,989
against him.

301
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:30,859
Easier said than done.
Thanks.

302
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:32,695
Yeah.
No, you're right.

303
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,063
Maybe it would just be easier

304
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,631
to bug his office
with a dictaphone.

305
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,701
Then use that to get ahead.

306
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,136
I did not use it
for that reason.

307
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:43,906
Yes, you did, because you are
a devious son of a bitch.

308
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,808
- How dare you--
- Shut up. You know it.

309
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,343
I know it.
Everybody knows it.

310
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,012
I did what I did for
the integrity of the firm.

311
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,180
Then why didn't you take it

312
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:52,648
to the managing partner
of the firm?

313
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:53,816
Daniel had a right to know.

314
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,084
And Jessica had a right
to tell him,

315
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:56,185
but you told him.

316
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,519
You sought out Hardman

317
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,655
because if he comes out on top,
you want him to owe you.

318
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,523
He was there when I heard it.

319
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:03,325
He asked, I told him.

320
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:04,960
Oh, so he asked
if Harvey had a secret?

321
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,129
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.

322
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:08,864
Which is as good
as seeking it out.

323
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:10,466
Devious.
You weren't there.

324
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,401
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.

325
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:14,937
Which is exactly
what you need to do to Harvey.

326
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,484
How long
have you been waiting?

327
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,286
How long were
you gonna ignore my calls?

328
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,421
Last I checked,
you haven't called.

329
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,356
I've left you ten voicemails
in the last week.

330
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:35,724
Huh, that's so weird.

331
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,859
I seem to remember
your assistant

332
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:39,161
leaving me
ten voice mails.

333
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,963
You know I don't know
how to dial out.

334
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,431
Is it eight?
Is it nine?

335
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,699
Do you know
how to use your cell phone?

336
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,301
Because if I were
your assistant,

337
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,835
I would have totally programmed
my phone number into it.

338
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:48,570
Oh, wait.

339
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:51,507
I did.
When I was your assistant.

340
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,309
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.

341
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:54,943
Did you come here to
tell me things I already know?

342
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:58,180
No, I came here to see
how you're doing.

343
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:01,116
You came to get me
to do the trial run.

344
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,085
Donna, it's important.

345
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:04,186
Yeah, important for me
to get up there and say

346
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:06,188
I screwed up
trying to protect you?

347
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,523
You did screw up.

348
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,525
Yes.
To protect you.

349
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,060
Which I never asked you to do.

350
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:12,795
No, you just expected me
to do it.

351
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,431
Like I expected
you to fight for me.

352
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:17,099
- I did.
- Really?

353
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,434
Like you fought for Mike?

354
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:20,102
Because that fight,
you somehow managed to win.

355
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,471
Oh, and when you thought
he needed to be fired,

356
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,341
you respected him enough
to do it yourself.

357
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:28,277
Jessica insisted that
she be the one to let you go.

358
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,879
And since when have you ever
done anything Jessica wanted

359
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:34,183
if it wasn't
what you wanted too?

360
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,119
Donna, I need you there.

361
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:40,723
I need you to tell them
that I didn't do this.

362
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,624
I'm sorry, I can't.

363
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:45,060
I've hired an attorney.

364
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:46,929
If this thing goes to trial,
I'm gonna be taking the fifth.

365
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:48,530
So if you need another Donna
at the firm,

366
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:50,632
just have anybody say,
"I decline to answer,"

367
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,935
because that's all you're
gonna get out of me anyway.

368
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:55,371
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.

369
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:59,408
Really?
Really?

370
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,857
You don't get
my kind of track record

371
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,092
just by moneyballing people.

372
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,860
She's the me
of jury consulting.

373
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,962
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.

374
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,998
What kind
of jury would you pick?

375
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:18,666
I already did.
You need men.

376
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,034
That's a mistake.
Women love me.

377
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:21,135
Really?

378
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,270
Because I showed them
your photo,

379
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,238
and they described you
as arrogant,

380
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,174
conceited, cocky...

381
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:27,542
Oh, and arrogant again.

382
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:28,976
What about handsome?

383
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:30,278
Did I not mention arrogant?

384
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:31,512
It's not bragging
if it's true.

385
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,649
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.

386
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,384
Zoe,
I'm still not convinced

387
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,586
I should hire you
instead of Ted Phillips.

388
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:41,255
After all, Harvey never tried
to sleep with Ted Phillips.

389
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:42,990
Who says I never tried to
sleep with Ted Phillips?

390
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:45,460
I can do what Ted can't.

391
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,228
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.

392
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:49,363
He doesn't like that.
You told her?

393
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:50,565
I didn't have to.

394
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:53,468
The partners
don't know what to think.

395
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,635
We don't just need to convince

396
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:55,837
a jury I'm innocent.

397
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:57,538
We need to convince
them I'm innocent.

398
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:58,773
Because if they don't
trust Harvey...

399
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,874
They don't trust me.

400
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,075
And if they don't trust you,

401
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:03,377
and it ever comes to a vote,
he'll win.

402
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:05,613
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.

403
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:06,614
She can read them.

404
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:08,216
And I also know Hardman.

405
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:10,118
I never liked him.

406
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,820
I won't tell Hardman
what I tell you.

407
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:20,128
Welcome back, Zoe.

408
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:25,466
Please state your name.

409
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:27,268
Harvey Specter.

410
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,402
Your full name.

411
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,905
Harvey Reginald Specter.

412
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,577
Do you consider yourself
a liar, Mr. Specter?

413
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:37,578
Of course not.

414
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:39,080
Didn't you recently confess

415
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:40,815
that as an associate

416
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:43,017
you hid an important file

417
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:44,752
belonging to a--

418
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,387
ooh, what was his name?

419
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:47,588
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.

420
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,792
That was a prank.

421
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:51,926
It was a one-time thing.

422
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,661
So you didn't do
anything wrong?

423
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,229
I don't think so.

424
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:56,464
And when asked,

425
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:57,632
did you claim that

426
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,534
you knew nothing about it?
Yes.

427
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,535
Did you ever do anything

428
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:01,736
to remedy the situation?

429
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:02,837
- No.
- Why not?

430
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,105
What was done was done.

431
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,506
"What was done was done."

432
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:08,109
And like you said,
it was a one-time thing, right?

433
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:11,579
- Yes.
- Ah. Was it?

434
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:14,415
Because I think
maybe this is a pattern.

435
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:15,850
Information was hidden,

436
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,451
you claim
you knew nothing about it,

437
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,453
you did nothing to rectify
the situation,

438
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:22,890
and years later, you maintain
you've done nothing wrong.

439
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,225
Your Honor, he's testifying.

440
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,394
Sounds exactly the same
as why we're here today.

441
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:27,895
Except there's
one big difference.

442
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:28,896
- Your Honor--
- This time...

443
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:32,867
A man was killed.

444
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:39,073
No further questions,
Your Honor.

445
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,376
What's done is done, right?

446
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:47,281
The plaintiff calls
Ms. Donna Paulsen.

447
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:51,752
Ms. Paulsen,
did Harvey Specter

448
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,788
order you to shred
this document?

449
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:57,558
I decline to answer pursuant
to my fifth amendment rights.

450
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:00,061
So you don't want
to take this opportunity

451
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:01,462
to state
your employer's innocence?

452
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,130
- Objection.
- You can't object.

453
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:04,799
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...

454
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:06,767
Sorry. Yeah.

455
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,636
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider
yourself good at your job?

456
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:10,004
I do.

457
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,406
Have you ever stated
to one Rachel Zane

458
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:16,143
that you are indeed the best
legal secretary in the city?

459
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:17,645
Mike, you can't.

460
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,614
Donna, I can.

461
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,549
Yes.

462
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:23,551
Ms. Paulsen,
there was a personal date stamp

463
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,086
from five years ago
on the document

464
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:26,954
that you're accused
of shredding.

465
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:28,789
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.

466
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,291
Did it look
like your date stamp?

467
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,525
I decline to answer.

468
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:33,094
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.

469
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,129
Would you believe
that the best legal secretary

470
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:37,298
in the city
didn't know about a document,

471
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:40,334
even though it had what appeared
to be her date stamp on it?

472
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:43,170
I decline to answer.

473
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:45,640
And would you believe that
that same secretary

474
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:47,341
would have destroyed
that document

475
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:51,512
without explicit orders
from her boss?

476
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:58,185
This is gonna be bad,
isn't it?

477
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:02,056
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.

478
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,391
Well, Rachel's not Donna.

479
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,825
She's not guilty,
and she can't be rattled.

480
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,260
You see how I rattled Harvey?

481
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,996
The jury listens to words,
but they respond to fear.

482
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:11,198
And we don't have that...

483
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,767
Yet.

484
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,302
- What's this?
- Subpoena.

485
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,370
You want to depose me?

486
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:17,939
Okay, let's stop playing
<i>tiptoe through the tulips</i>

487
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,040
around the elephant
in the room.

488
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,174
That's not a thing.

489
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:21,108
You know some things
about Harvey,

490
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:22,343
and I need to know them too.

491
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,245
You yourself said
go after the man.

492
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:26,380
What better way to go after the
man than to question the boy?

493
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:27,648
But I don't know anything
about this case.

494
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:30,151
That's an evasive answer,
Mike.

495
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,886
You're hiding something,
and I smell fear.

496
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:33,020
I have to go to the restroom.

497
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,989
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?

498
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:37,925
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.

499
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:39,393
Good.

500
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:42,897
What. Whoa, whoa.

501
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:43,931
Is that a polygraph?

502
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:44,999
- Yes.
- Nope.

503
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,033
You are under oath.

504
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,535
And I'll tell the truth.

505
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:48,869
You bet your ass you will,
or I'll know.

506
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,439
We'll start with an easy one.

507
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,808
What's your name?

508
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,210
Mike Ross.

509
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:57,445
Where do you work?

510
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,547
Pearson Hardman.

511
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:02,950
What do you do for a living?

512
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,218
I practice law.

513
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,554
And where did you attend
law school?

514
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,192
What?
What's the matter?

515
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:15,396
Nothing.

516
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,966
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

517
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:23,904
I beg to differ.

518
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,675
Listen to me.

519
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:31,045
I know why the machine
says you're lying.

520
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,915
You're nervous.

521
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,384
You don't want
to rat out Harvey.

522
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,618
I get that.

523
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:40,588
But it's time you accept
the situation.

524
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,424
This is happening,
and you're going to have

525
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:45,593
to tell me some things
about Harvey.

526
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,727
I accept that.

527
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,629
Then answer
the goddamn question.

528
00:18:56,872 --> 00:19:00,241
I'm proud to say that I have
a diploma from Harvard law.

529
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:05,579
Now it's time that you accept
the situation.

530
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,681
I'm not afraid of you.

531
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,650
I wasn't there,

532
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:13,587
and I don't know anything
that's gonna help this case.

533
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:16,357
Do you want fear?

534
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,259
I'll get you Donna.

535
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,272
The answer's no.

536
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:34,508
I didn't even ask a question
yet.

537
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:36,110
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.

538
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:37,978
And you were gonna say no, but
instead you're gonna say yes.

539
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,947
Oh. That's funny 'cause I
already said no to Harvey.

540
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,849
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.

541
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,351
No, I'm the guy who told you
not to destroy that document,

542
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:45,920
and you're the girl
who promised me she wouldn't.

543
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:48,422
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.

544
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,559
Well, then I guess
I just suck.

545
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,761
Because I'm breaking another one
right now.

546
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,229
I told my attorney
that I wouldn't talk to anybody

547
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,764
at the firm
until after this was over.

548
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,199
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.

549
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,601
I'd rather not go to jail.

550
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,604
I don't do roommates, and I
definitely don't do orange.

551
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:04,972
Nobody's going to jail,
Donna.

552
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,540
You can't guarantee that.

553
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,409
You dragged me
into Harvey's office once,

554
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,077
and you scold me about how much
he loves his job.

555
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,712
Well, if you don't help him
prep for Tanner,

556
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,848
he's gonna lose in court,
he is gonna get disbarred,

557
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:16,717
and he is never gonna be able
to do what he loves ever again.

558
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:18,352
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair

559
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,955
is Harvey taking the blame
for your mistake.

560
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,457
You know what, do whatever
your attorney wants.

561
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:24,658
Come in. Don't come in.
Go to the movies.

562
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:25,793
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.

563
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,995
Because whatever you do,

564
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:30,998
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

565
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:40,813
Complainant would like to call

566
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:44,282
Ms. Jessica Pearson
to the stand.

567
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,817
Sidebar?

568
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,656
This is just an attempt
to make Harvey's attorney

569
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:53,258
look bad in front of the jury.

570
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:54,859
What, you think Tanner's
gonna make you look good?

571
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:56,061
You're a named defendant.

572
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,295
He has a right to call you.

573
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:59,864
Louis, will you excuse us
for a moment?

574
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,839
You think I don't see
what you're trying to do?

575
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,341
You want him to undermine me
in front of the partners.

576
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:10,376
I'm acting
in an unbiased manner.

577
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:11,511
It sure took you
a while to jump in

578
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,545
when Harvey was up here.

579
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:14,848
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.

580
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:18,151
Jessica, you chose
to try this case.

581
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:21,387
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.

582
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:24,491
Either take a knee
or take that stand.

583
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,466
Would you say it's important
to win at Pearson Hardman?

584
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:34,701
You don't get to be one

585
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,569
of the top law firms
in New York by losing.

586
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:38,605
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?

587
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,306
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.

588
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:41,841
Almost always.

589
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:47,680
Is that why he's the youngest
senior partner in firm history?

590
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:49,349
It's a factor.

591
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,483
And how much
did the firm benefit

592
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:53,353
with the Coastal Motors win?

593
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,121
I'd say the profits

594
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,190
were somewhere
in the mid 8 figures.

595
00:21:57,258 --> 00:22:00,560
And if Mr. Specter had lost
those 8 figures,

596
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:04,497
would he have still made
senior partner so young?

597
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,001
- No.
- Mm.

598
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:09,836
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter

599
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:11,804
personally gain
as senior partner?

600
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,206
Oh, it's too soon to say.

601
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:14,741
He hasn't received
his first bonus yet.

602
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:16,676
- Ballpark.
- No.

603
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:19,112
Are you that ashamed
of how much you pay him?

604
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,213
No.

605
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:24,017
Well, then answer
the question.

606
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,119
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?

607
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:30,023
Much less.

608
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,327
So win,
and you're rewarded millions.

609
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,798
Win less, and no matter
how much hard work, dedication,

610
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:44,037
or administrative dominance
is displayed, you get nothing.

611
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:49,776
Quite the incentive
to do whatever it takes

612
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:52,545
to "almost always" win.

613
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:59,953
I have to say, delicious
dinner, fantastic wine...

614
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,488
almost enough to make up
for the mediocre company.

615
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:05,325
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.

616
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:08,194
See, that's funny, because
you were talking about me.

617
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,430
There it is,
the Specter smile.

618
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:12,265
What can I say?
It came with the name.

619
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,133
And you're never fully dressed
without a smile.

620
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,602
Being fully dressed
is overrated.

621
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,171
It is when you look like me.

622
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:22,208
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying
to seduce me?

623
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,410
Did you just call me
Mrs. Robinson?

624
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:27,080
Okay, first of all, I'm younger
than Anne Bancroft.

625
00:23:27,147 --> 00:23:28,648
Anne Bancroft was hot.

626
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,183
Which brings me
to second of all.

627
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,951
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.

628
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,486
I'm hotter
than Dustin Hoffman.

629
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:35,521
- Not in <i>Tootsie.</i>

630
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:40,059
Are you afraid you're gonna lose
this thing?

631
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,794
No.

632
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,997
You should be.

633
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,431
Why, because Louis
had one good direct?

634
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,368
You walk through life like men
want to be you

635
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:50,036
and women want to sleep
with you.

636
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:51,204
I don't always walk.

637
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:52,972
Sometimes I drive fast.

638
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,707
And it's exactly
that kind of response

639
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:56,676
that make the partners think
you're an ass.

640
00:23:56,744 --> 00:23:58,911
Being an ass doesn't make me
guilty of fraud.

641
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,880
If they're right
about who you are,

642
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:01,981
what would make them think

643
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,016
they'd be wrong
about what you do?

644
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,817
Well, why don't you tell me?

645
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:07,387
You're the expert
on warm and fuzzies.

646
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:10,657
You want to know how I know I
wasn't the one to call you back?

647
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:14,360
Because I know why I wasn't
the one to call you back.

648
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:16,529
Let me guess--
you didn't like me.

649
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:18,131
No, I did.

650
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:20,633
But in all the time
I knew you,

651
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:23,469
you never once showed me
any vulnerability.

652
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:25,138
I told you
how I felt about you.

653
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:29,175
But you never showed me.

654
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:32,178
So I had no way of knowing
it's the truth.

655
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:34,247
And you could be telling
the truth now,

656
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:36,549
but if you don't show
the partners some emotion,

657
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,418
they're not gonna believe you
either.

658
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:41,454
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?

659
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,855
Harvey,
when you're a defendant,

660
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:45,992
you need the jury
to protect you.

661
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,194
There's no way
they're ever gonna protect you

662
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:51,731
if they don't care about you.

663
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:56,069
The plaintiff
would like to call

664
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:59,405
Ms. Donna Paulsen
to the stand.

665
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:12,852
You got her to come in?

666
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,455
Just stick to the script.

667
00:25:15,522 --> 00:25:18,458
Harvey won't know
what hit him.

668
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:21,360
Ms. Paulsen,

669
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:25,631
did Harvey Specter order you
to shred that document?

670
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:29,802
I decline to answer pursuant
to my fifth amendment rights.

671
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,237
Did you put your date stamp
on that document?

672
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:35,575
- I decline to answer.
- Um...

673
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:39,612
I'm not gonna ask questions

674
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,983
that you're just gonna plead
the fifth to, so...

675
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:52,391
Had Harvey Specter asked you

676
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,061
to bury something
five years ago, would you?

677
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:56,229
He wouldn't ask me to do that.

678
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:57,864
That's not what I asked.

679
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,433
If he did,
would you do it?

680
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:06,372
Oh, see, you're pausing, which
means you're hiding something.

681
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,573
No, I'm not.

682
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:09,575
See, I think
you'd do anything for him,

683
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:11,744
and I know why.

684
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,479
Is there a question?

685
00:26:13,547 --> 00:26:16,616
Do you love Harvey Specter?

686
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:18,017
What?

687
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:20,019
Do you love him?

688
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:21,988
That has nothing to do with--

689
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:23,956
It has everything to do with.

690
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:27,493
Why did your last boyfriend
break up with you?

691
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:30,429
Ms. Paulsen, why did he
end it with you?

692
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,799
He thought that I prioritized
my work over our relationship.

693
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:34,033
Your work?

694
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:36,135
He asked you to choose
between him and Harvey,

695
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:38,271
didn't he?

696
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:41,274
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?

697
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:47,814
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?

698
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,048
Louis, stop.

699
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,116
It is not that simple.

700
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:53,119
Do you love him, yes or no?

701
00:26:53,187 --> 00:26:54,821
Answer the question.
Louis.

702
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:56,722
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.

703
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,057
Your life revolves around him.

704
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,625
Objection, badgering.

705
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:00,993
You don't have a boyfriend,

706
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:02,495
but the one you did
wouldn't share you with him.

707
00:27:02,563 --> 00:27:04,130
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--

708
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:05,398
Do you love Harvey Specter?

709
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:06,632
Do you love Harvey Specter?

710
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,302
That's enough!

711
00:27:25,452 --> 00:27:28,554
Donna.

712
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:55,648
You crossed the line.

713
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:56,782
Do not do this to me
right now.

714
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,417
You humiliated Donna.

715
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:00,653
You kept pushing and pushing her
for what, for fun?

716
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,921
What, you think
I enjoyed that?

717
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:03,689
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.

718
00:28:03,757 --> 00:28:05,992
You think Tanner
would have stopped?

719
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,095
Travis Tanner does not give
a shit about Donna Paulsen.

720
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:10,830
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--

721
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,698
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.

722
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:18,237
You really want to beat me
that badly, huh?

723
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:20,806
You think
this is about beating you?

724
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:23,809
This whole thing
is about saving you.

725
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:28,214
Everyone is trying to help you
because you screwed up.

726
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:32,051
This is all your fault.

727
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,605
And what just happened

728
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,090
to that beautiful woman
in there--

729
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,005
that's on you--

730
00:28:39,556 --> 00:28:41,556
not me.

731
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:04,977
Are you kidding me?

732
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,279
Go home.
Shoo!

733
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:08,614
Go the hell home.

734
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,082
Look, I didn't know
he was gonna do that.

735
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,316
And if you had known,

736
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:12,751
would you have done one thing
differently?

737
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,919
I am so sorry.

738
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,154
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

739
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,356
Bullshit. Bullshit.

740
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,324
- Okay. Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.

741
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:20,726
I know.

742
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,295
But you know what, sweetheart,
maybe you are.

743
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,198
And I do not mean that
as a compliment.

744
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,699
Look, I did what I did
for the same reason

745
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,369
you did what you did,
to help Harvey, that's all.

746
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,804
Well, that worked out the same
for you as it did for me,

747
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,406
because,
in case you hadn't noticed,

748
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:36,208
in addition to screwing me,
you completely shafted Harvey.

749
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,342
We had a script.

750
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,711
Wait,
you trusted Louis?

751
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,813
You trusted Louis?

752
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:42,981
Yeah, I thought
he would stick to it.

753
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,449
Yes.
Well, he didn't.

754
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,485
And you should have known that,
because that is just who he is.

755
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,620
I am sorry.
But I'm--

756
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,157
People are who they are.

757
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:54,359
Thank you.
Okay.

758
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:55,560
I can fix this!

759
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:06,972
What's all this?

760
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,242
It wouldn't concern you.

761
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,211
Why is that?

762
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,312
Because you want to settle
even if it means

763
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,814
Harvey getting disbarred.

764
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,516
If he loses in court,
he'll get disbarred anyway.

765
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,351
My concern is for the firm.

766
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:21,586
It's not a personal attack
against Harvey.

767
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,823
This whole thing is a personal
attack against Harvey.

768
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:27,959
And you're gonna do something
about it?

769
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:33,765
Tanner's cases, transcripts,
appeals, decisions.

770
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,001
I know he did something illegal,
because that's who he is,

771
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:38,203
and I'm gonna find it,
because that's who I am.

772
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,539
What are you planning on doing
with it?

773
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,240
Leveraging that
for a settlement?

774
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,109
I'm not against settling.

775
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,944
I'm against Harvey
getting disbarred.

776
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,579
You really admire him.

777
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:50,348
- I do.
- Loyalty.

778
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,616
You can't buy that.

779
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,553
No.
You can't.

780
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,426
What are you doing?

781
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:04,796
We worked together
all night once.

782
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,798
Let's do it again.

783
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:12,037
I hope this time turns out
better than the last time.

784
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,441
Now we have them
right where we want them.

785
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:17,909
Either you're better
than I thought you were,

786
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,878
or you have absolutely no idea
what you're doing.

787
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,881
Trust me, the partners
are starting to believe Harvey.

788
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:24,082
Why?

789
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,784
Because he protected Donna.

790
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:27,385
He was also protecting
himself.

791
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:28,787
Yes.
But they didn't see that.

792
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:32,157
They saw a man who cared
about someone else.

793
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,726
His softer side.

794
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:36,628
And we need to give them more.

795
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:38,163
He won't want to.

796
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,031
And we both know Harvey
won't do

797
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,266
what he doesn't want to do.

798
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,768
Everybody knows that.

799
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,636
So what do we do?

800
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,244
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

801
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:53,311
Permission granted.

802
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:54,980
He's hostile.

803
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,281
The day we met,
you were working

804
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,116
in the mail room
of this law firm.

805
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,417
I don't recall that day.

806
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,585
Well, let me refresh
your memory.

807
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,954
An associate
had missed a filing,

808
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,190
so he backdated the postage.

809
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,658
You came to me,

810
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:10,395
and you said if the firm
did not declare misconduct,

811
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:12,230
you would report us
to the D.A.

812
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,633
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.

813
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,734
But what you did want
to keep secret

814
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:17,736
was the fact that you told me.
Why?

815
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:19,271
I didn't want
to get in trouble.

816
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,373
No, you did it
because if we'd won,

817
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,842
an old woman
would have lost her pension.

818
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,344
And if anyone found out
that he was the one

819
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,147
that told me,
then they'd know that you cared.

820
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:30,515
Whatever you say.

821
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:33,819
You pretend like you
don't care, but you do.

822
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:35,821
You care about the people
you work with,

823
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:38,056
you care about the people
you work for,

824
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:41,092
and you care about every one
of your clients.

825
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,162
But you refuse
to let people know.

826
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,231
Is there a question?

827
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,334
I just want to know why.

828
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:53,038
No answer?

829
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,239
Are you embarrassed?

830
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:56,208
Nope.

831
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,576
- Afraid?
- No.

832
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,211
Then why?

833
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,479
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.

834
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,114
Then hold me in contempt.

835
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,383
For God sakes, what the hell
happened to you?

836
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,986
What kind of damage
was done to you?

837
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:11,256
Caring only makes you...

838
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,358
Weak.

839
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:20,065
They think you care,
they'll walk all over you.

840
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:23,535
You weren't weak the day
you walked into my office.

841
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:29,474
You were a man who believed
that to win fairly

842
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:32,344
was more important
than to win.

843
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:35,814
And you still are.

844
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:40,585
And I've never seen anyone
walk all over you.

845
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:45,657
Is there a question here,
Your Honor?

846
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,328
No, there isn't.

847
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,177
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.

848
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,246
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.

849
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,748
Excuse me?

850
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,416
You said you wanted to see
through me, you did.

851
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:14,419
The least you can do is give me
an honest answer.

852
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:16,288
Yes, it was my idea.

853
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,857
Harvey, your partners
loved what they saw in there.

854
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:20,425
You're gonna win.

855
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:21,993
Bravo.

856
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,730
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?

857
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,198
It was so great.

858
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,267
But there isn't one shred
of proof it's true.

859
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,069
Hostile witness,
my ass.

860
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,804
I mean, before that story,
we all believed you did it.

861
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:34,673
And I ask you, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

862
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,142
if he did commit that fraud,
how hard is it to believe

863
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,843
that he didn't concoct
some bullshit on the stand

864
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,613
to get himself off the hook?

865
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:43,014
That's my close.

866
00:34:44,984 --> 00:34:47,652
We have one more witness
to call.

867
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:54,059
Mr. Litt, do you resent
Harvey Specter?

868
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,660
It's complicated.

869
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:56,928
No, it's simple.

870
00:34:56,996 --> 00:34:59,130
Do you resent him
for being better than you?

871
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,966
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.

872
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:03,034
It's so much easier
to criticize someone else

873
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:06,938
than it is to acknowledge
your own shortcomings.

874
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,640
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.

875
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,175
My billables
are higher than his.

876
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,843
My client list
is better than his.

877
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:13,645
Yes, but I didn't ask you
about those things.

878
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:15,146
What are you asking,
Ms. Pearson?

879
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:18,016
Does the witness
resent my client?

880
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,222
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside,

881
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,226
do you think Harvey Specter
deserves to be senior partner?

882
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,030
Yes or no?

883
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,135
Yes.

884
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:38,803
Do you think
he's an excellent attorney?

885
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:45,410
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him,

886
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,412
do you think he committed
this fraud?

887
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,153
No.

888
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,959
Defense rests.

889
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:22,621
Refusing to admit defeat
even after defeat.

890
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:24,222
You really are like Harvey.

891
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,057
I'm not so sure
that's a good thing.

892
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,526
Well, who would you rather be?

893
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:28,827
Someone who believes
it's more important

894
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,796
to win fairly
than to win.

895
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:33,865
Like I said, Harvey.

896
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:35,033
Yeah.
Not in this case.

897
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,968
You both cheated.

898
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:38,537
Excuse me?

899
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:40,806
Louis's testimony pushed it
over the top.

900
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:42,941
But that jury,
they didn't see Louis Litt

901
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:45,510
believing Harvey's innocence--
they saw Travis Tanner.

902
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:50,282
And that is never gonna happen
in court.

903
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:56,021
You do realize that you are
chastising the managing partner.

904
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,656
With all due respect,

905
00:36:57,723 --> 00:37:00,091
it's not gonna matter what you
are if Harvey gets disbarred.

906
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,527
We'll find a way to win.

907
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:06,131
You should be finding a way
to settle.

908
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,400
There isn't
an acceptable offer.

909
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:11,102
Yet.

910
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,939
Not just a pretty face.

911
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,489
I hope you brought
a baseball bat.

912
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:33,258
You want to go another round
with me, you're gonna need it.

913
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:34,693
It doesn't matter what I have,

914
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,894
you're just gonna sucker punch
me again anyway.

915
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,797
Boohoo.

916
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,565
You baited me.

917
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,101
You wanted to catch me
on that tape, and you know it.

918
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:45,737
That's not what I'm talking
about, and you know it.

919
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,305
You want to settle?

920
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:48,673
Let me save you some time.

921
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:49,741
We pass.

922
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,543
You can pass,
you can sign it,

923
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,044
or you could stick it
up your ass,

924
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:55,747
but this is the best
you're getting.

925
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,582
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.

926
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,085
You think I don't know
this was your doing?

927
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,021
Harvey, next time have the balls
to do it yourself

928
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:04,589
instead of sending
your errand boy.

929
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,324
Errand boy?

930
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,326
You got what you wanted,
so stop playing dumb.

931
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:11,296
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.

932
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,805
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.

933
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:23,942
A good deal that costs every
partner at this firm $100,000.

934
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,343
Including me.

935
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:27,178
We share the profits;
We share the losses.

936
00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:29,381
There won't be a loss
when I win this at trial.

937
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:32,450
The only reason
you weren't willing to settle

938
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,286
was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.

939
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,454
And I want to know
how you made it go away.

940
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,757
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?

941
00:38:38,824 --> 00:38:40,825
You blackmailed him
into a settlement.

942
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:43,061
I leveraged a deal
that's good for the firm.

943
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:44,729
I said, "what dirt?"

944
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,331
Not your concern.

945
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,799
It's my concern.

946
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,801
I don't want what you did
biting me in the ass.

947
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,636
You were already bitten.

948
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,205
And the last time I crossed the
line and you found out about it,

949
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:56,174
it bit me in the ass.

950
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:58,243
You cleared Harvey's name
inside the firm.

951
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,578
We both know
that's what you wanted.

952
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,819
Time to move on.

953
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,590
Let's let the partners
put this to a vote.

954
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,370
Hardman got Tanner to settle.

955
00:39:25,438 --> 00:39:27,906
Are you kidding?

956
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:29,808
It worked?

957
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,010
So it was your idea
to use dirt to get a deal.

958
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,714
No, it was my idea to use
Tanner against Tanner.

959
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:37,449
Box.

960
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:39,084
Me.

961
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,420
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.

962
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:44,089
It's okay.
You don't have to.

963
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,256
And I'm not going to,

964
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:46,992
'cause we're not
taking the deal.

965
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:54,199
Because you don't trust
Daniel.

966
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,667
This isn't just about me.

967
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:59,004
Every partner is--
everybody is paying now.

968
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:05,110
Do you have any idea why Donna
showed up to testify?

969
00:40:05,177 --> 00:40:07,679
Because I convinced her to.
What?

970
00:40:07,747 --> 00:40:09,114
Yeah, I made her do
what I needed

971
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:10,382
instead of what she wanted.

972
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,117
I did what you do.

973
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:13,651
And look where that's gotten us,
you, me,

974
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:16,488
Jessica, Louis, everybody.

975
00:40:16,555 --> 00:40:18,156
Take the deal, Harvey.

976
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:20,191
What did Hardman find
in those files?

977
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,659
I don't know,
and I don't care,

978
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:24,329
because he just got every single
one of us off the hook.

979
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:25,997
He can't be trusted,
and you should know that by now.

980
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:29,200
No, what I know is that if you
take this thing to trial,

981
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:33,471
it's gonna cost us all a hell
of a lot more than money.

982
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:39,110
And if you don't know that
by now, after all this,

983
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:43,681
then I don't think I should be
the one learning from you.

984
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,521
This is your decision.

985
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:53,691
So, by a show of hands,
those in favor of settling?

986
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,903
Thank you.

987
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:10,041
Now all those in favor
of going to trial.

988
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,084
Split vote.

989
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:22,020
And it appears
we have a holdout.

990
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,662
I vote we settle.

991
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:42,474
Let the record show
we have settled.

992
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:46,444
Thank you for your time.

993
00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:47,779
In light of recent events,

994
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:51,316
there is one other issue
I'd like to raise.

995
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,185
This lawsuit has caused
some of you to question

996
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:57,789
Jessica's judgment and,
by extension, her leadership.

997
00:41:57,857 --> 00:42:02,627
Allowing this kind of dissention
to fester hurts the entire firm.

998
00:42:02,695 --> 00:42:06,831
Therefore, I am calling
a partners' meeting,

999
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,467
at which point we will vote:

1000
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,872
Either Jessica will retain her
position as managing partner,

1001
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:17,242
or I will resume control
of Pearson Hardman.

1002

1003
