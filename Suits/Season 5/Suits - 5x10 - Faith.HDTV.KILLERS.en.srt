You hung me out to dry.

3
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:04,460
How exactly did I do that?

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,842
By making it seem like
I'm the one

5
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,194
that's taking away
your dream wedding.

6
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:08,929
You are the one taking away
my dream wedding!

7
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:09,930
We're getting married,

8
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,065
and it can be as small
as possible

9
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,600
with just our close friends,
okay?

10
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:15,135
I think we should consider
promoting Jack Soloff

11
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,837
to name partner.
Are you crazy?

12
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:17,971
Hardman's got something
on him.

13
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:19,373
If Hardman has something
on him,

14
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:21,108
then we need to have it
on him, too.

15
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:23,944
You want me gone,
call for a vote,

16
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:26,179
'cause we know what's going on
with Daniel's investor,

17
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:28,282
and Harvey's about to put a stop
to it right now.

18
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:29,850
Why should I believe you
would even live up to

19
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:31,051
your end of the bargain?

20
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,552
Because I don't give a shit

21
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:34,221
about your war with
Daniel Hardman.

22
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:37,257
All I want to do is see you
get down on your knees

23
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:39,793
and say, "I quit."

24
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:41,395
You're breaking the law
every day.

25
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,063
Oh, so now I shouldn't
get married?

26
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:44,131
I'm saying you should quit.

27
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,066
The longer you go,

28
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,301
the less the money matters.

29
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:48,602
You almost got caught,
didn't you?

30
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:50,003
I went to talk to someone.

31
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,271
Who?

32
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,340
You know who.

33
00:00:54,343 --> 00:00:58,211
Mom?
Dad!

34
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,698
Grammy, what are you
doing here?

35
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,567
Where's mom?
I want to give her a hug.

36
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,152
Dad, too.

37
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:06,603
What?

38
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:08,789
You told me not to be mad
at them last night, remember?

39
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:10,390
You said once they got home
I should tell them I was sorry

40
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:11,992
and give them a hug.

41
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:14,995
But they didn't wake me up,
so I didn't get to,

42
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,165

What is it?

45
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:26,139
Your--your parents,

46
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:31,228
last night they were in
a car accident.

47
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:36,149
But they're gonna
be okay, right?

48
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:40,153
Michael, they passed away.

49
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,939

50
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:44,408
No.

00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:46,943
No, they can't be.

wake me up?

I could have gone
to the hospital.

58

They didn't make it to
the hospital, sweetheart,

59
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:05,429

tell you until I had to.

00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,061
whether or not
I should tell my father

150

that my mother was
cheating on him.

151
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,864
And maybe we should
talk about that.

152
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,266
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

153
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:29,368
I came here to figure out
whether or not I should resign.

154
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:31,336
And then you started
thinking about your mother.

155
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,805
And if your brain went
to the one,

156
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,640
then it's connecting it
to the other,

157
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,074
and the best thing
we can do right now

158
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,176
is to try and figure out why.

159
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:38,277
I don't have time
for that.

160
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:39,812
Harvey, you asked me
to block out the day

161
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,347
for an emergency session,
and I did.

162
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:44,416
We have time.

163
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,471
The white ones are best.

164
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,690
You're just here to
make me go in.

165
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:54,026
I am.

166
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:55,561
Because sometimes
we make choices

167
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,262
we're not old enough to make,

168
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,298
and then we regret them.

169
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,266
I don't want that
to happen to you.

170
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:03,468
Why would I regret
not going into that place?

171
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,037
'Cause it's a chance to
say good-bye to your parents.

172
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:06,438
I already missed that.

173
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,710
Mike.

174
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,179
Sometimes when people
lose someone they love,

175
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,814
they get mad at them.

176
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,766
I'm not mad at them.

177
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:19,885
I'm mad at God.

178
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,055
I understand
you're mad at God.

179
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,891
Maybe you're even
mad at me, too.

180
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:30,078
But I came out here
to give you something.

181
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,363
St. William,

182
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:33,282
patron saint of orphans.

183
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:34,666
You know who this is.

184
00:07:34,702 --> 00:07:35,834
I know who
all the saints are,

185
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,252
and I don't want it.

186
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:39,588
I don't want to be
an orphan.

187
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,790
Then don't take it.

188
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,762
Because the truth is,
orphans are alone,

189
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,849
and you're not.

190
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,551
But not going in there

191
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:54,887
isn't gonna change
what happened.

192
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,557
And right now,
your grandmother needs you.

193
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,726
But if you stay out here,

194
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:03,028
she's gonna have to
face today alone.

195
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:11,069
<i>♪
♪</i>

196
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:24,333
<i>♪
♪</i>

197
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,643
Well, it's official, Harvey.

198
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,095
My fingers are way too old.

199
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,430
Like hell.

200
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,982
You can still outplay anyone.

201
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:43,268
You're a terrible liar.

202
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,153
But I got to admit,

203
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:49,908
I do love seeing my boy
in the crowd.

204
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:51,310
Actually, Dad,
there's something

205
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,028
I wanted to talk
to you about.

206
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:55,080
I got something for you, too.
It's important.

207
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,249
The band's splitting up.

208
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:58,583
What?

209
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,552
Lenny says he wants to spend
his golden years with Marge,

210
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,220
and Dave's wrist isn't
getting any better, so--

211
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,522
Well, what about Harry?

212
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,057
Harry's already got an offer
from another group.

213
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:06,558
Well, if they'll take him,
they'll take you.

214
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:09,161
You're not listening, Harvey.

215
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:11,897
I don't want them to take me.

216
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:12,898
I want to come home.

217
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,733
Dad, music is your life.

218
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,135
Look, Harvey, I'm the same age
your grandfather was

219
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,637
when he died,

220
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:20,038
and I've already spent
way too much of my life

221
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:21,373
away from my family.

222
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:23,575
Don't start that.
You've been a great father.

223
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,779
Maybe the cool father,
but...not a great one.

224
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:30,449
And now, I know it's too late
to make that up to you.

225
00:09:30,484 --> 00:09:33,352
I'm just hoping it's not too
late to make it up to Marcus.

226
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:35,053
Anyway, that's my news.

227
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,290
What--what did you want
to talk about?

228
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:40,125
Nothing.
I met a girl.

229
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,927
Great.
What's her name?

230
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:44,096
Scottie.

231
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:46,465
I'm just trying to figure out
the long distance thing.

232
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,717
All I can tell you there is,
if she's the one,

233
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:52,738
you'll know, just like with
me and your mother.

234
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,675
So you didn't tell him?

235
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,976
No, I didn't.

236
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:00,562
But you said that was the
night you decided to tell him.

237
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:01,947
That was the night
I decided.

238
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:04,583
No, you said it as though
it was all one night.

239
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:08,420
I told you it was
all one night

240
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:11,790
because I'm so used to lying
whenever I tell this story.

241
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:12,858
My age--

242
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,092
Why do you lie?

243
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:16,428
Because I was a grown man
when it happened,

244
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,623
and grown men
keep their words

245
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:19,231
when they say
they're gonna do something,

246
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,532
not give in to weakness.

247
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:23,535
But it wasn't weakness that
made you break your word.

248
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,936
It was love for your father.

249
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,205
Then aren't I an asshole?

250
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,792
Because I ended up ruining
everything two weeks later.

251
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:34,880
Louis, I need to
talk to you for a minute.

252
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:35,847
About what?

253
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:37,215
Jack Soloff is
calling for a vote

254
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:40,969
to remove me as
managing partner today.

255
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:42,220
What?

256
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,455
Why the hell would he do that

257
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,856
after you offered to make him
name partner?

258
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,708
Because I didn't offer
to make him name partner.

259
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:48,060
I told him to resign.

260
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,061
What happened to our plan?

261
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,362
It wasn't our plan, Louis.

262
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,230
It was your insane idea,

263
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,398
and I was never
going to do it.

264
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:54,366
Jessica--

265
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:56,301
No, you listen to me.

266
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:57,936
The matter at hand is

267
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,005
making sure that we have
more people on our side

268
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,773
than he and Daniel have
on theirs.

269
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,141
What am I
supposed to do now?

270
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:04,843
<i>You are going to do exactly</i>
<i>what I told you to do</i>

271
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:05,994
<i>in the first place.</i>

272
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:07,546
You're gonna find out
what Daniel has

273
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:11,216
on that weaselly son of a bitch,
and do it before 7:00 tonight.

274
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:13,585
Because if I can't get
enough votes before then,

275
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:16,755
the only way we win is to make
this whole thing go away.

276
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,425
Cancel my day.

277
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:29,711
We have to talk.

278
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:31,029
I'm studying, Grammy.

279
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,681
I don't care what you say
you're doing.

280
00:11:32,716 --> 00:11:34,383
What I say I'm doing?

281
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,301
Father Walker called me.

282
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:37,453
He said you've been
acting out.

283
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,854
Father Walker's a priest.

284
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,322
He thinks you're acting out
if you're chewing gum.

285
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:41,657
Well, I agree with him.

286
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,659
Yeah, and you're not at school
and all I do is get As.

287
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,227
I don't care
what you're getting.

288
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:46,295
I found these in the trash.

289
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,629
So what.

290
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,864
So what?

291
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,866
"The Little Prince,"
"James and the Giant Peach,"

292
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,468
Michael, you love these books.

293
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,702
Yeah, when I was a kid.

294
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,137
Those books were your
connection to your mother

295
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,638
and father.

296
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,542
Yeah, well,
I don't want them anymore.

297
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:01,977
You don't want
this one either?

298
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:04,580
Your mother and I
didn't always get along,

299
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:07,499
but I know that she read this
to you every night

300
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,685
when you were little
because she told me.

301
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,355
And I also know that you'd
never let me read it to you

302
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,058
because you said
it was so special.

303
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:17,626
Like I said,
I'm not a kid anymore.

304
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:18,961
Michael,
I'm worried about you.

305
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:20,496
Father Walker is worried.

306
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,097
I don't care what
Father Walker thinks,

307
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,400
and I don't care about
these stupid books.

308
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,703
Well, I do care,

309
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,938
and I think you'd better go talk
to Father Walker tomorrow

310
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,474
because you're not
getting all As.

311
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,545
He's giving you an F
on your history paper.

312
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:41,717
Louis, what are you
doing here?

313
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:43,151
How did you get past Stacy?

314
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,353
I walked right by her.

315
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,221
Well, in that case,
what can I do for you?

316
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:48,690
I want to know what the hell
you have on Jack Soloff.

317
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,959
I have nothing on Jack
other than his trust

318
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,579
and confidence that I'm
a better attorney than Jessica.

319
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,563
Shut your mouth.

320
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:55,864
You're not fit to
lick her boots.

321
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,433
Good, because that's
your job, Louis, not mine.

322
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,602
Listen to me.

323
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:01,970
Remember when I told you
I'd kill you

324
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,423
if you so much as tell me
the incorrect time?

325
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:05,674
Tell me what you have
on Jack right now

326
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:06,942
or you're dead
in 15 seconds.

327
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,610
I remember when
you did that, Louis.

328
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:11,346
And right after that,
I went straight to my attorneys

329
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:14,616
and told them
you had threatened my life.

330
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:17,519
And now, you've come into
my office and done it again

331
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:18,487
in front of a witness.

332
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:20,055
What witness?

333
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,657
Stacy, did you get that?

334
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,258
<i>I got it.</i>

335
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,526
So as I see it,

336
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:27,429
security will be here
in about 60 seconds.

337
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:29,948
So if you want to kill me,

338
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:31,583
now is your chance.

339
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:32,935
I swear to God,
I will find out

340
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,202
what you're holding
over Jack's head.

341
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:35,537
I doubt that,

342
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,573
and I certainly doubt that
you'll find it by 7:00.

343
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,558
So instead of me telling you
what I have on Jack,

344
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:40,909
let me tell you
what I have on you.

345
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,377
You vote with me today

346
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:44,680
and your sister's company
lives.

347
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:45,948
- What?
- Oh, it turns out

348
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:48,350
my client is looking to get into
the muffin business.

349
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,952
You leave my sister
out of this.

350
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:51,486
Sure thing.

351
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:53,388
As long as you vote
to remove Jessica.

352
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:55,090
I can't do that.

353
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,459
Then I'm not only
gonna buy it,

354
00:13:57,494 --> 00:14:00,262
I'm gonna rip that company
of hers apart.

355
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:01,897
You son of a bitch!
She never did anything to you.

356
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,632
No.

357
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,600
But you did.

358
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,368
And Jessica did.

359
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:08,637
And Harvey did.

360
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,073
So you have a choice,

361
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:14,309
your firm or your family.

362
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:25,687
Michael?

363
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,656
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

364
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,591
People have been calling me
that a lot lately.

365
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:33,061
Maybe it's a sign.

366
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,696
How can I help you?

367
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,848
I need to talk to someone.

368
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,118
I was hoping to do it
under the confessional.

369
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,004
How long has it been
since your last confession?

370
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,839
Aren't you supposed to
ask me that after we started?

371
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:44,840
We have started.

372
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,492
Have a seat.

373
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:48,710
Here?

374
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:49,845
Why not?

375
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,680
Confession's meant to be
good for the soul

376
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,382
and no one's ever said anything
about it having to be done

377
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:56,051
in a little dark box.

378
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,387
Please.

379
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,657
You gave that paper
an F?

380
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,058
It deserves an A.

381
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,127
What about the fact that
you cut the entire afternoon

382
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:06,728
last Tuesday?
I had a doctor's appointment.

383
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:08,063
You even had a note
from your grandmother.

384
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,297
That's right, I did.

385
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,465
The problem is, Michael,

386
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,334
your grandmother wrote me
a note yesterday

387
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,469
thanking me for letting
her book club use the library.

388
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,139
And those two signatures,

389
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:20,042
they don't look the same
at all.

390
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,412
Okay, well, if you're
so sure I did this,

391
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:24,847
then why are you
only giving me an F

392
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:26,581
and not suspending me?

393
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:28,250
Because I don't think
it's a coincidence that

394
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:30,919
you chose to cut class on
parent-teacher conference day.

395
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:33,088
That had nothing
to do with it.

396
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:35,357
Mike, your grandmother told me
about the books you threw out.

397
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,042
Every parent in the world
is obsessed

398
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:38,210
with their kid
cleaning their room.

399
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:39,344
I actually do it,

400
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,129
and the two of you make
a federal case out of it.

401
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,631
You didn't throw out
those books to clean.

402
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,683
You did it because you saw
those kids out there

403
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,301
with their parents

404
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,403
and you just couldn't
deal with that pain.

405
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,373
So you cut class,
you went home,

406
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,608
and you threw away the books.

407
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:55,143
You don't know what I did.

408
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,979
What I do know is that your
parents came here every Sunday

409
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:00,348
and donated money
to pay for that uniform

410
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,517
because they wanted you to
be here getting an education

411
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,769
and not cutting class.

412
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:05,537
I've gotten a perfect grade
on every assignment

413
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:07,089
I've ever gotten,
all right?

414
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,057
And I don't need to go to
your stupid class to do it.

415
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,358
I could have suspended you,

416
00:16:10,394 --> 00:16:11,927
and that would have been
much worse than an F.

417
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:14,196
But you're getting one
or you're getting the other.

418
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:17,966
So why don't you take
one night off from blaming me,

419
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:20,769
and you decided what it is
that you're gonna do?

420
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,839
Harvey,

421
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,972
what are you doing here?

422
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:26,541
I wanted to
ask you something.

423
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:27,959
I was wondering if
I could stay with you

424
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,728
while I do my clerkship.

425
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:32,197
You want to stay with me
for the summer?

426
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:34,032
I promise you won't
even know I'm there.

427
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,417
Are you crazy?

428
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,886
Do you have any idea what the
people around here would think

429
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:38,987
if they found out?

430
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:40,505
Who says
they're gonna find out?

431
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,674
I mean, no one knows anything
about your personal life anyway.

432
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,793
Harvey, what's going on?

433
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:46,094
Things aren't good
at home.

434
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,295
Your brother?

435
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:48,997
It's my parents.

436
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,532
Listen, Harvey,
I know what it's like

437
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,417
to be living in a home
that's not right,

438
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,337
and I also know that you might
be tempted to fix things.

439
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:57,005
But it's not up to
the children to fix things.

440
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,107
What if it was?

441
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,609
Then there's something wrong
with those two people.

442
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,210
No, there isn't.

443
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,879
There's something wrong
with one of them,

444
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:08,650
and I don't know whether to
tell the other one or not.

445
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,020
Look, Harvey, I can't
tell you what you should do.

446
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,891
But I can tell you
if you come work for me,

447
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:18,293
you're gonna have to have
some difficult conversations.

448
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,861
That's work,
this is family.

449
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:23,799
There are no more difficult
conversations than that.

450
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:28,386
But for the record,

451
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:32,007
if you do come work here,

452
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:36,061
we're gonna be family, too.

453
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,665
Hey there.

454
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,800
Your father and Marcus
will be here any minute,

455
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:49,236
and, oh, I made your favorite,
chicken parm.

456
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,454
I'm glad they're not here.

457
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:51,805
It'll give me a chance
to tell you that

458
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,373
I'll pretend
when they're here,

459
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,709
but I am not gonna pretend
when we're alone.

460
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:58,212
Harvey, please,
I'm still your mother.

461
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,279
No, you're not.

462
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:01,415
Hey, hey, hey,
look who's here.

463
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,068
I thought you were
working late tonight.

464
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,953
What's up,
douche nozzle?

465
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,988
You remember Bobby from down
at the shop, don't you, Harvey?

466
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:10,357
<i>He's helping us get</i>
<i>the old Mustang up and running.</i>

467
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,843
That's right, Harvey,
I'm getting the Mustang.

468
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:14,194
And if you think you're ever
getting behind the wheel

469
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,529
of that car--

470
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:16,730
I'm never gonna get behind
the wheel of that car.

471
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:17,781
Because you're jealous.

472
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,832
Because that car's
a piece of shit.

473
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:21,018
Harvey, watch your mouth.

474
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:23,771
Lil, do we have enough for
an extra plate?

475
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:25,339
Sure.
How you doing, Bobby?

476
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:27,941
I'll be good as soon as
I get this grease off my hands.

477
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:29,159
Where's the bathroom again?

478
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,411
It's down the hall, Bobby.

479
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,846
You know what?

480
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:34,131
We don't need an extra plate
'cause I'm not eating.

481
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,649
What are you talking about?
You're home early.

482
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:36,583
Your mother made
chicken parm.

483
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,885
Well, why don't you eat it?

484
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,853
Because I can't stand
chicken parm anymore.

485
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:41,638
Where you going?
Harvey!

486
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,192
This is still my house,
you know.

487
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,528
Is it?

488
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:51,698
So other people know
about you?

489
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:54,735
Not everyone
knows everything, but...

490
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,156
people know that
I don't have a law degree.

491
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,509
You say that as though
it were just a technicality.

492
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,678
And you say that
as if you're judging me.

493
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:07,080
Isn't that what you
came here for?

494
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,215
I came here for advice.

495
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,584
You said you came here
to confess.

496
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,153
But it doesn't matter,
because if--

497
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:14,354
well, if you're looking
for absolution,

498
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,355
I can't give it to you.

499
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:16,391
Why not?

500
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:19,760
Because absolution
requires contrition,

501
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:21,395
and I'm not hearing that
you even think

502
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,629
you've done anything wrong.

503
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:23,664
Because using my brain
to help people

504
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:25,132
isn't doing anything wrong.

505
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:26,834
You're not using
your brain to help people.

506
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,519
You're using it to
fool people,

507
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,838
and you want me to tell you that
you're a good person for it.

508
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:32,072
I am a good person.

509
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:33,774
You're a person that
wants to have their cake

510
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,175
and eat it, too.

511
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:36,743
And I'm afraid that
I'm all out of cake with you.

512
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:37,945
What is that
supposed to mean?

513
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,247
It means that
I've often wondered

514
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,648
whether or not
I did the right thing

515
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,283
by not having you arrested
that day.

516
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,118
That would have completely
screwed up my life.

517
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:48,522
Oh, and look at how not
screwed up it is right now.

518
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:51,024

Yes, I did.

I was hoping
you could explain why

523
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:12,479
we're missing $936
from the collection box.

524

I can't.

525
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:17,150
Well, that's odd,
because this box was in my desk,

526
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:19,920
and I also found this

00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:24,458
Michael, the next time
you want to send a message,

529
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:26,627
just leave me a note.

530
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:28,528
The uniform's not a message.
I'm just returning it.

531
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:31,465
You said I had two options,
get an F or get suspended.

532
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,434
But I thought of a third.

533
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,836
So you're dropping out?

534
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,771
No, I'm going to
public school.

535
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,840
And I'm not saying that
I took that cash,

536
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,575
but if I did, I'd be
smart enough to do the math.

537
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,445
My parents put $3 in the
collection plate every week.

538
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,881
$3 a week for 52 weeks
for six years--

539
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:50,450
$936.

540
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:53,520
And I would have thought that
belonged to my parents

541
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:57,457
and I would have just been
taking it back.

542
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,295
You know, I could
have you arrested.

543
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,479
Then do it.

544
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:03,931
Michael, we both know
how smart you are,

545
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,767
but there's a difference between
intelligence and wisdom.

546
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:08,502
And if you don't figure
that out eventually,

547
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,170
you're gonna have a lot bigger
problems than an F,

548
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,471
because you can't outsmart--

549
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:12,406
God?

550
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:13,607

551
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:16,043
I know you don't believe
in God,

552
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:19,513

Your little brother was
excited to see you

the time of day.

00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:36,023

640
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,316
Quentin, I told you,

641
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:51,952
you mean more to me
than work.

642
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:54,021
Well, actions speak louder
than words.

643
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:55,422
I married you.

644
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:56,857
- You did.
- Mm-hmm.

645
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:59,726
But does Harvey or anyone else
at the office know that?

646

Or even know that I exist?

You know
I'm a private person.

648
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:07,167
I like to keep those parts
of my life separate.

649
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:09,136
What I know is, separate
but equal didn't work out there,

You know where
this is going, Jessica,

653

00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:58,952

671
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:06,393
I went to Paul Porter
and I turned him

00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:08,929
and the three votes that
he comes with.

673
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,197
So we're up by three?

674
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:13,133
No, including Harvey,
we're up by one.

675
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:14,901
No, we're not.

676
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:17,237
Hardman's going after
Esther's company.

677
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:21,274
And he's not going to back off
unless you vote against me.

678
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:23,660
Louis--

679
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:25,028
I know what you're gonna say.
We can stop it.

680
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,914
But I went to Jeffrey to get him
to not sell his shares,

681
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,417
and he told me that Hardman's
offering 40% over asking.

682
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:33,086
Jeffrey agreed not to sell,
but everyone else will.

683
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:36,039
If Hardman can't get the stocks,
he's gonna buy the distributor,

684
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:37,290
and if he can't buy
the distributor,

685
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:38,625
he's gonna go after
the contracts.

Forstman is his backer!

I know.

689
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,472
Well then, you know that
he has unlimited resources,

on multiple fronts.

And I could tell you that
if you side with me,

692
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,478
we'll figure out a way
to save Esther's company.

693
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,897

and you said,
"What does it matter?"

798
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:38,385
Well, you're the one
who led me to believe

799
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,636
she's a hell of a woman.

800
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:40,887
Maybe you did it
for a reason.

801
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,322
What reason?

802
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:43,990
For me to suggest that
maybe she'll understand

803
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:46,493
that you leaving doesn't mean
that you don't care about her.

804
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:48,145
It means that you do.

805
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,263
And what if that's not why
I told you all this?

806
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,965
What if you're wrong?

807
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,167
Then I'll be wrong.

808
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,636
And you'll be able to
handle that.

809
00:31:57,973 --> 00:32:00,173
I spent a lot of time here.

810
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,975
You remember this place?

811
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,777
I remember everything.

I know you do, Michael.

813
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,964
I was always aware of
what a special child you were.

814
00:32:08,016 --> 00:32:09,633
Hasn't changed a bit.

What are you talking about?

817
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:14,354
Michael, I think
you came to see me

818
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:15,722
because when people
are in crisis

819
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:18,692
they're searching for
something more,

820
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:20,060
usually something
they've lost.

821
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,295
I lost my parents,
and I'm not getting them back.

822
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:25,265
No, Michael,
you lost your faith.

for going to Louis.

861
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:32,392

would have done that

if he hadn't come to see you.

what you're thinking.

867
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:42,519
That he never would have
come to see you

Yeah, I can.

Harvey won't be joining us,

00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:23,610
so we may as well get started.

880
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:27,147
We're here because
there's a concern

881
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:31,835
that I no longer have the best
interests of the firm at heart

882
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,555

on the selfish interests

at this point
to change your minds.

887

So...I'll say...

888
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,505
I hope it remains my pleasure to
serve this firm.

889
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,874
I think it's time we vote.

Well, if you're not gonna say
anything to change their mind,

00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:58,678
then I will.

892
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:00,647
You made it.

893
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:02,599
Wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

894
00:36:02,651 --> 00:36:04,334
Okay, fine, you're here,

895
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:06,086
but there's nothing that says
you can plead her case.

896
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:07,187
And there's nothing
that says he can't,

897
00:36:07,222 --> 00:36:08,588
so why don't you
sit your ass down?

898
00:36:08,623 --> 00:36:10,590
Go ahead, then,
get your speech over with

899
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,125
so we can get to the vote.

900
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,460
No speech, just this.

901
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:15,495

902

As of now, the company that's
been targeting our clients

903
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,734
is no longer represented

Of course,
it might take a while

906
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,555
since you've got to go through
the prison switchboard

907
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:26,823
to get ahold of him.

908
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,341
<i>Yep, that's right.</i>

909
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:31,077
That's the kind of man
Jack Soloff and Daniel Hardman

<i>Daniel blamed me</i>
