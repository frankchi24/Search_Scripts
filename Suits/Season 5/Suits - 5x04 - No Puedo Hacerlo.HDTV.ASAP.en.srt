1
00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:03,324
You took this case
without running it by me.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,826
- Jessica--
- That's enough. Dump it.

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,094
Or I will.

4
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,028
You think
this case is a winner?

5
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:08,063
I do.

6
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:09,597
Then what do you say
we do it together?

7
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:11,032
I'm afraid you're gonna end up
hating each other.

8
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,267
If I'm lucky, I'm gonna fight
with him about a lot of things.

9
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:15,753
Why not start with a fight where
we're both on the same side?

10
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,538
This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

11
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:19,223
and I found them
sitting in the copy machine.

12
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,775
You came to work for me.

13
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,050
You knew who I was
when you did,

14
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:23,277
so now it's time
for you to decide.

15
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,412
Are you with me or not?

16
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:26,280
You always said,
once you pick a side,

17
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:27,315
if you're not loyal
to that side,

18
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,716
then who the hell are you?

19
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,251
You should've thought of that
before you picked someone

20
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:32,293
who would do something like this
in the first place.

21
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,090
You ever take sides with
Jack Soloff against me again,

22
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:38,126
I will bury you.

23
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,166
Well, you look happy.

24
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:47,151
Becky just tell Susie
she like-likes you?

25
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,504
Eh, more like Kelton Insurance
just told Robert Zane

26
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,005
they're scared-scared of us.

27
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,006
You got a settlement offer?

28
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,408
Just like he said
we would.

29
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:55,593
I got to hand it to him,
he played them perfectly.

30
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:57,311
Did he now?

31
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:58,379
What?

32
00:00:58,415 --> 00:00:59,415
Nothing.

33
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,015
Look, I take it back
about Becky.

34
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,750
The only one with a crush
around here is you.

35
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:04,385
Sounds like someone's worried
that Robert Zane

36
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:05,720
might be better than him.

37
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:08,689
Nice try, tiger, but did Magic
ever worry about Bird?

38
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:09,690
First of all, yes, he did.

39
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:10,792
Second of all, you realize

40
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:12,043
you're the white guy
in this scenario, right?

41
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:13,811
I know I'm the bigger badass
in every scenario.

42
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:17,081
Okay, Mr. Badass, which one
are you, Magic or Bird?

43
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,266
I think we both know
I'm...

44
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,118
Jordan.

45
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,653
Hey, why don't you go meet
your boyfriend Robert Zane?

46
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,705
I think I just left something
at security.

47
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:28,376
Oh. Look who like-likes
someone now.

48
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,111
Ma'am, the last time
I let someone up

49
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:31,712
that he wasn't expecting,

50
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,481
he threatened
to have me executed.

51
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:36,117
I'm sure he did,
but I'm telling you that--

52
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:38,453
That Gretchen obviously forgot
to phone down, Carl,

53
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:41,122
because we have a meeting
scheduled for right now.

54
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:42,323
That isn't what she just--

55
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,859
Carl.

56
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,365
A meeting with you.
Really?

57
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:53,134
I promise
I'm much better-looking

58
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,569
than whoever
you were supposed to meet.

59
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:57,738
You have no idea
how right you are.

60
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,874
But I could have sworn
you were just on your way out.

61
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,176
Oh, that's not a problem.
The mayor can wait.

62
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:04,846
But I'm not sure
the governor can.

63
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:06,614
Are you trying
to out-name-drop me?

64
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:09,150
If I were,
I think I just did.

65
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:12,587
But I'll let you in
on a little secret.

66
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:14,956
I don't really care
about names that much.

67
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,390
Well, if you don't care
about names, why don't we

68
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:18,726
skip the introductions
and just get down to breakfast?

69
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:20,211
What if I already
had breakfast?

70
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,897
I'm talking about
tomorrow morning, in my kitchen.

71
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,566
Or yours, I mean, you look like
you have a nice place.

72
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:34,041
As tempting as that is,
maybe another time.

73
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:38,079
Good luck
in your meeting.

74
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:44,952
So how's my favorite
pain-in-the-ass lawyer?

75
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:47,488
I thought Louis was your
favorite pain-in-the-ass lawyer.

76
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:50,658
He is, but Louis
isn't responsible

77
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,627
for me getting to work
on this.

78
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:58,332
You're doing the grunt work
on our case?

79
00:02:58,368 --> 00:02:59,967
I pulled some strings--
thought it might give us

80
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,102
a chance
to work together.

81
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,237
You know I'm engaged,
right?

82
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:04,639
Yes, Mike,
that's my plan,

83
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,374
to steal you
from my boss's daughter.

84
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:09,377
It's a thing.
It's been done.

85
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,362
Well, I didn't come here
to steal you.

86
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:13,981
I came here
to thank you.

87
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:14,949
For what?

88
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:15,883
Come on, Mike.

89
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,185
I get fired,

90
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,154
and two days later, I get
an offer from Rachel's father?

91
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,424
Whatever you did,
I owe you one.

92
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,359
Actually,
you owe Rachel one.

93
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:27,128
No shit.

94
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,597
Shit.

95
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,517
Shiiit.

96
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:37,438
By the way, you're
in the wrong conference room.

97
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,712
Okay, Esther,
what are you doing here?

98
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:46,814
What,
a woman can't stop by

99
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,349
to see her brother,
who she loves?

100
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:51,485
Please, you know damn well
we don't love each other.

101
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,755
In that case,
I need a lawyer.

102
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,424
You? For what?

103
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,594
Did you give someone salmonella
with your stupid muffins?

104
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,962
I'm getting a divorce.

105
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,167
Well, good.

106
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:07,935
I knew that guy was dead weight
the second I met him.

107
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,538
I know, I think that was
your speech at our wedding.

108
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,373
And your sympathy
is touching,

109
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:14,659
but I didn't come here
to vindicate you.

110
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:15,743
No, I know you didn't.

111
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,044
You came to get me

112
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,347
to slaughter Jeffrey for you,
and I will.

113
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:21,616
When I'm done with him,
he won't have a pot to shit in.

114
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:23,751
It's "piss in."

115
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:25,820
And, Louis, I don't want you
to slaughter Jeffrey.

116
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:26,787
Why the hell not?

117
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:28,356
Because I want
Harvey Specter to.

118
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,423
Come again?

119
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,025
You said he was
the best attorney in the city.

120
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,927
No, Esther, I told you
he was my best friend.

121
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,296
Which is exactly what you said
about Jeremy Henschell

122
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,081
in tenth grade,
which really meant

123
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,866
you worshipped him
from afar,

124
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:40,368
you wrote in your diary
about him,

125
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:42,436
and you never
actually hung out.

126
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:44,105
Okay, you swore
you never read my diary.

127
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,274
And you swore you didn't spy
on me and Jeremy.

128
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,441
Oh, please,
that was one time.

129
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:48,943
I was on my way
to get a glass of milk,

130
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,111
and for your information,

131
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:51,445
I've been lactose intolerant
ever since.

132
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,913
Louis, are you gonna
get me Harvey,

133
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,498
or do I have to get him
myself?

134
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:57,752
Harvey is not taking on
any new clients right now,

135
00:04:57,787 --> 00:05:00,788
and he's out of town
for the next few years.

136
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:05,626
Louis, I know
what you're doing.

137
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,628
You think I want Harvey
because I don't think

138
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,213
you're good enough.

139
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,182
You're wrong.

140
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,301
I know how good you are,

141
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,685
but this is personal for me,

142
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:16,771
which means
it will be personal for you,

143
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:20,524
and I can't have that.

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,811
So please,
will you get me Harvey?

145
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:28,316
I'll make it happen.

146
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:32,486
Thank you, Louis.

147
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:40,161
That was Esther?

148
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,912
Yes, I know what you're gonna
say--we look exactly alike.

149
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,047
That actually wasn't--

150
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:44,215
I get it--it's like
looking at me in a wig.

151
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,299
I've heard it
a thousand times.

152
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:48,753
Yeah, the resemblance
is uncanny.

153
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,338
What?

154
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,972
I'm just wondering why you're
not getting up to go ask Harvey.

155
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,174
Because I'm not gonna
ask him.

156
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,226
I'm gonna save some time
and tell her he said no.

157
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,394
Louis--

158
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:58,562
Donna, we all know
that Harvey's furious at me.

159
00:05:58,598 --> 00:05:59,730
There's no way
he's gonna do it.

160
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:02,316
Maybe not.

161
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:04,935
But, Louis, she's family,

162
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,988
and if there's one thing that
Harvey understands, it's that.

163
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,109
Where the hell have you been?

164
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,362
Sorry, I got stuck
in really bad traffic.

165
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,747
So you were
in the wrong conference room.

166
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,200
For about 20 minutes.

167
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,786
So what did we get?

168
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:23,754
Want to take a guess?

169
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,922
$90 million.

170
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,007
Want to take a real guess?

171
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,043
That was a real guess.

172
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:29,477
Son, what planet
are you living on?

173
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:30,478
The planet
where you called

174
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,046
to say we got
a great settlement.

175
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,316
$25 million is
a great settlement.

176
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,283
$25 million?

177
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,052
Robert, after fees,

178
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,121
that's less than $70,000
per person.

179
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,956
Then what do you
suggest we counter with?

180
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,691
I suggest we counter
with a trial.

181
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,142
Are you nuts?
You don't go to trial.

182
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,061
You turn up the pressure,
and then you settle.

183
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,163
Going to trial is
turning up the pressure.

184
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:50,848
The second we finish
opening arguments,

185
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,199
that offer is
gonna triple.

186
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:54,201
Look, I've sat across the table
from these two

187
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:55,419
four times
in the last six years,

188
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:56,754
and when they say
this is their best offer,

189
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,739
it's their best offer,
and we're recommending it.

190
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,074
Well, you can recommend
whatever you want.

191
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,208
I'm recommending
we reject it.

192
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,211
You don't give clients
conflicting opinions.

193
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:05,647
You work it out
behind closed doors.

194
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:06,697
Well, maybe that's the problem.

195
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,332
You want to do things
behind closed doors.

196
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,383
I actually want to be honest.

197
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:10,384
Hey, watch yourself, Mike.

198
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:13,020
You tell me this,
would $70,000 per person

199
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,755
be a great settlement
if we were talking

200
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,173
about Laura's life
or Rachel's?

201
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,625
You get out of here!

202
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,859
You don't come back

203
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,694
until you wrap your head
around recommending this offer.

204
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:23,030
And don't you ever
use them against me again!

216
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,780
Don't tell me
he wasn't in here either.

217
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:09,248
He was in here,
all right.

218
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:11,784
What happened?
Did the settlement fall through?

219
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,620
No, it didn't,
but it should've.

220
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:17,189
They gave us a shitty offer.
Robert's ready to take it.

221
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,959
Come on, if it's really
that bad, why would he take it?

222
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,894
Because he knows his clients
will jump all over it

223
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,362
and it's the easy way out.

224
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,397
So you think Robert doesn't care
about his clients?

225
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,532
It sure seems that way.

226
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,601
Mike, I've only been here
a few months,

227
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:32,104
and there are a lot of things
you can say about Robert Zane,

228
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,074
but what you can't say
is that he doesn't care

229
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:36,492
about his clients.

230
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,082
Go away, Louis.

231
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,350
I would, but then
I couldn't tell you

232
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:46,485
about the $50-million company
I'm giving you.

233
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:47,786
And why would you do that?

234
00:08:47,822 --> 00:08:50,256
'Cause I want to make up
for our little misunderstanding.

235
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,524
We didn't have
a misunderstanding.

236
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,093
You went after my money,
so if you're giving me a client,

237
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:55,494
there's some other
misunderstanding

238
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,329
that you're too chickenshit
to tell me about.

239
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:02,468
It's my sister's company.

240
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,136
I'll give you her business.

241
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,905
All you have to do
is handle her divorce.

242
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,389
I don't want
your sister's business.

243
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:08,474
Now get out.

244
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,747
Harvey, this is my family.

245
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:18,751
My sister, she...has never
asked me for anything

246
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:21,020
her entire life,
not once.

247
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:25,157
Now the one time she does,
I just can't let her down.

248
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:28,794
Louis, I'm not
a divorce attorney.

249
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,346
When has a shitty detail
like that

250
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:32,381
ever stopped you before?

251
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,220
All right, I'll do it,
on two conditions.

252
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:41,440
First, you stay completely
out of this case.

253
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:43,142
Done. Second?

254
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:45,377
I'll let you know
when I think of it.

255
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,363
How do I know it won't be
something I can't stomach?

256
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:50,616
You don't, but those are
my two conditions.

257
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:54,620
Okay, Harvey,
You have a deal.

258
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:57,489
One thing.

259
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,992
Promise me you won't
sleep with Esther.

260
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:02,795
Believe me, Louis,
the last thing I want to do

261
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,831
is sleep with your sister.

262
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,418
I'm glad you agree.

263
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,471
I'll let you know
when the paperwork's finished.

264
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,676
I know you didn't wrap your head
around this deal

265
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:19,511
in the last ten minutes,

266
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:21,013
so what are you still
doing in my office?

267
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:23,182
Exactly what you'd be doing
in my place.

268
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:25,451
Robert, I know you said
that you know these two lawyers,

269
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:27,019
but I don't.

270
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:29,321
I need to see for myself
what they will or won't do.

271
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:30,623
And you still want
to counter.

272
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:31,857
I want to at least try.

273
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:33,452
Except you don't want to go
by yourself,

274
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,393
you want me to go
with you.

275
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,395
Yes, I do.

276
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,063
Because you and I both know,
if we don't go together,

277
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,264
we don't stand a chance.

278
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,935
I know we don't stand a chance
either way.

279
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,170
And if I do go, it makes me
look like a fool.

280
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:49,742
Robert, I saved you from looking
like a fool in that courtroom.

281
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:52,277
I came through for you.

282
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:55,047
Now I'm asking you
to come through for me on this.

283
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,549
You and Rachel are
peas in a pod.

284
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,754
Can't believe she's really
worth $50 million.

285
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:03,839
I can't believe you've never
heard of her company.

286
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,158
Do I look like I buy
a lot of potholders?

287
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:07,493
She doesn't just sell
potholders.

288
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,628
She has a brand
like Martha Stewart.

289
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:11,563
Look, I get that you think
she's impressive,

290
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,983
but to me,
she's just Louis's sister,

291
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:16,235
which, as far as I'm concerned,
is strike number two.

292
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:17,403
What's strike number one?

293
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,004
The fact that
she's Louis's sister.

294
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,956
Oh, come on,
Harvey, listen.

295
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,308
Are you gonna take this
seriously or not?

296
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:24,309
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

297
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:25,461
I'm gonna go walk there.

298
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:26,745
I'm gonna shake
this woman's meaty hand.

299
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:29,815
I'm gonna get this over with
as quickly as possible.

300
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:34,804
You?

301
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,355
You've got to be
kidding me.

302
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,856
You two know each other?

303
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:39,391
So you weren't meeting
the governor.

304
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:41,460
You're telling me you were
really gonna blow off the mayor?

305
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,662
The mayor.
You don't know the mayor.

306
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:47,499
I'm so sorry, let me introduce
my soon-to-be former associate.

307
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:48,801
Rachel Zane.

308
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:51,954
Esther Edelstein.

309
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:54,006
It's nice to finally
meet the man

310
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,441
I've heard
such good things about.

311
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:56,575
It's nice to meet
the woman

312
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,912
I've obviously heard
nothing but lies about.

313
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,283
Let's get to it.

314
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:05,384
Yes.

315
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:07,686
I just have to know,

316
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:10,255
were one of the two of you
adopted?

317
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,460
I've been asking that
for years.

318
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:17,329
Hey.
Get out.

319
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:26,438
Shit.

320
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:28,794
Come on, speak up, narcissist,
it's not a freakin' library.

321
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,711
Reminder to thin the walls

322
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:34,897
in the conference room/
make a peephole.

323
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:35,881
What do you think
you're doing?

324
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,049
What happened?

325
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,050
Oh, I was just checking
the sound-proofing,

326
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,017
making sure
they thicken the walls

327
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,119
in the conference room.

328
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:41,887
So if I walk out this door
and I turn to the right,

329
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:43,622
I won't see Harvey
in there with Esther?

330
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:44,977
Esther's here?
I didn't know that.

331
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:46,558
Louis, listening
through the wall

332
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:47,826
is not staying
out of her case,

333
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:49,728
and if Harvey finds out,
he's gonna drop her.

334
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:51,897
Look, it's my sister,
All right?

335
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,532
I just want to make sure
he does right by her.

336
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,607
And you never would have
asked him to take this case

337
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,636
if you didn't trust
that he would do just that.

338
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,672
So put the glass down,
go back to your office,

339
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,641
and let him do his job.

340
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,978
You know it'd be easier
for both of us

341
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,930
if you were wrong
every once in a while.

342
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:13,552
When we decided to get divorced,
Jeffrey and I agreed

343
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:17,189
he would get 20% of the company,
no need to involve lawyers.

344
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:20,559
The next thing I knew,
I got a letter from a lawyer.

345
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,728
Jeffrey doesn't think
20% is enough anymore.

346
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:25,297
No, he doesn't.

347
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,632
Esther, I'm gonna ask you
a question,

348
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,667
and I want you
to answer me honestly.

349
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:31,069
Who's leaving who?

350
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:32,137
It's mutual.

351
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:33,639
It's never mutual.

352
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:36,625
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Who's driving this decision?

353
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:39,629
I am.

354
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,913
Then the answer
to our problem

355
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,915
is for you to stay away
from the negotiations.

356
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:45,918
What?
No, I'm not staying away.

357
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,970
Listen to me.

358
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:48,220
He's going back on your deal

359
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:49,671
because he wants
to prolong the fight.

360
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:50,723
I don't care.

361
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,558
I spent 12 years
building the company.

362
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:54,426
I'm not gonna sit back
and let someone else decide

363
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:55,761
how much
I'm allowed to keep.

364
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:57,013
Then what'd you
come to me for?

365
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,897
Because you're supposed to be
the best.

366
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,816
I am the best,
and I didn't get that way

367
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:02,601
letting someone else
call the shots.

368
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,319
So you're either gonna
let me do that,

369
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,939
or you're gonna get yourself
another lawyer.

370
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:13,372
All right, here's what
I need you to do.

371
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:14,805
You can tell me what you
need me to do in a minute.

372
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,733
First we're gonna talk
about what happened back there.

373
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,851
What happened is,
I laid down the law,

374
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:20,485
she accepted,
I'm the man.

375
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:21,619
Yep, uh-huh.

376
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,288
Okay, I'm not talking
about that.

377
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:25,039
I'm talking about how the moment
you walked through the door,

378
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,641
you looked like you were struck
by a bolt of lighting.

379
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,193
- I did not.
- You most certainly did.

380
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:30,094
In fact,
before you started fighting,

381
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,930
I was afraid the two of you were
gonna go at it on the table.

382
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:32,982
Afraid or hoping?

383
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,232
That's unsavory.

384
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,100
And you making lewd comments
about our client isn't?

385
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:38,002
Lewd comments
about what client?

386
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,571
Harvey likes
Louis's sister.

387
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:41,706
That's funny, 'cause that's
exactly what I came in here

388
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:42,674
to talk to him about.

389
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,342
You like Louis's sister?

390
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:45,677
Not enough to fight you
for her.

391
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,612
Well, you should reconsider.
She's lovely.

392
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:52,817
And I'm leaving.

393
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:57,388
Harvey, why are you
all of a sudden

394
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,224
taking on Esther Edelstein
as a client?

395
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,693
And don't tell me
it's because she's lovely,

396
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,428
because I'm not sure
I believe that.

397
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:05,230
I took her on
because Louis asked me to.

398
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,866
And the last I heard, you and I
were both pissed at him.

399
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,701
And I still am.

400
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,102
But he told me
this was family,

401
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,771
and...I thought
this might be a chance

402
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:15,740
for us all to get
back on track.

403
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:17,342
I like that, Harvey.

404
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:18,393
You just might turn out

405
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,329
to be a half decent name partner
after all.

406
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:23,832
I doubt it.

407
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,783
So do I.

408
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:29,170
Well, frankly, Robert,
I'm surprised

409
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,288
you called
for another meeting.

410
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,056
Surprised
by a routine counter?

411
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:35,126
When the first offer is
as generous as ours, I am.

412
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,795
Just hear the man out,
Will.

413
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:40,798
Campbell v. State Health.
Wilson v. GenRX.

414
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,901
Friedman v. MedFirst.

415
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:44,216
Those are
identical class actions

416
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,169
in which the average payout

417
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:46,905
was $1/2 million
per plaintiff.

418
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,107
They were jury awards,
and two of them were reduced

419
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:50,575
for being
excessively punitive.

420
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,644
Dollar amount was still higher
than what's on the table.

421
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,962
After seven years
of appeals.

422
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:56,114
Yeah, and like we said,
we don't care how long it takes.

423
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,982
We want triple
what you're offering.

424
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:00,285
And I want to skinny dip
with Sofia Vergara,

425
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,153
but<i> no puedo hacerlo.</i>

426
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:04,622
That's Spanish for "we're not
giving you another nickel."

427
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:06,791
And what's Spanish
for "we'll see you in court"?

428
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:07,826
Bring it on.

429
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:08,793
That's enough.
Come on, Will.

430
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:09,961
We're just having
a conversation.

431
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:11,279
Conversation?

432
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:12,830
I gave you
a fair offer, Robert,

433
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,432
because I respect you,

434
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,234
and I thought that
you respected me enough to know

435
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:18,636
that I meant it when I said
it's the best I could do.

436
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:20,872
Then he comes in here
threatening a trial.

437
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:21,940
Well, you know what?

438
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:23,708
You don't like
what's on the table,

439
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,377
we can pull
the whole damn thing.

440
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:31,049
I told you
he wasn't messing around.

441
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:32,124
You were right about that.

442
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,651
Now I'm right
about taking this to trial.

443
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:35,270
You aren't right
about anything.

444
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:36,988
I owed you. I paid up.
We're done.

445
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:38,156
No, we're not done,
and I'm still not

446
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:39,774
recommending this offer
to my clients.

447
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:42,877
Well, that's too bad,
because they already signed off.

448
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:45,897
What?

449
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:48,199
You talked to our clients
before we even went in there?

450
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:49,500
You're damn right I did.

451
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:51,402
We took a shot,
and it didn't work.

452
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:52,870
Now, in the meantime,
we had an obligation

453
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:54,639
to show their offer
to our clients, and I did.

454
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,407
Don't give me
some bullshit justification.

455
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:57,809
You went behind my back.

456
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:00,561
I didn't go behind your back.
I went over your head.

457
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,246
What the hell
are you talking about?

458
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:03,698
You know what the hell
I'm talking about.

459
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,918
I went to your boss's boss,
and you know what?

460
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:08,620
She and I see things
the same way.

461
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:10,822
And as far as I'm concerned,
this case is settled.

462
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,697
Why don't you two have a seat?
I suggest we get right to it.

463
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:21,215
Wait a second,
where's Esther?

464
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:23,334
She won't be joining us,
but I've been authorized

465
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,669
to negotiate
on her behalf.

466
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:28,406
No. No, I'm not agreeing
to anything without her here.

467
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:30,241
That's because you don't really
want to negotiate,

468
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:31,576
you just want to stay
connected to her,

469
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:33,044
and that's not
gonna happen.

470
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,013
I don't know when you decided
to become a divorce attorney,

471
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:36,481
but that's not
how it works.

472
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:37,836
I didn't become
a divorce attorney

473
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,183
because it's
the minor leagues,

474
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:41,869
but this is how it works
with me.

475
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:44,272
What the hell is this?

476
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:46,024
That's our new offer,
nothing.

477
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:46,991
This is bullshit.

478
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:48,826
You thinking
you deserve even 20%

479
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:50,778
of our client's business
is bullshit.

480
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:52,230
So you're either gonna
accept the terms

481
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:55,266
that you and Esther agreed to,
or you can take our new offer.

482
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:57,568
You can threaten all you want,
but my client has a right

483
00:17:57,604 --> 00:18:00,338
to what's his,
and that's half the company,

484
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,508
because 12 years ago, that's
what your client agreed to.

485
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,843
See, I wasn't just gonna be
Esther's husband.

486
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,013
I was gonna be a doctor,
but I put that on hold

487
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:10,915
while Esther got her company
off the ground,

488
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,451
and when I said
I was willing to do that,

489
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:14,786
she said I'd get half.

490
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,355
Which constitutes
an enforceable verbal contract.

491
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,774
So I don't care
whether Esther's here or not.

492
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,075
She promised to spend
our lives together,

493
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:23,594
and she's breaking
that promise.

494
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,296
There's nothing I can do
about that one,

495
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:27,298
but I'm sure as hell gonna
hold her to the other one.

496
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,517
You have no proof
she ever made that promise.

497
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:31,602
Ask your client about it,
because when we depose her

498
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:34,355
under oath,
you can rest assured we will.

499
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,524
You authorized
the settlement?

500
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,909
You want to change
that tone?

501
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:54,144
No, I don't,
because you told

502
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,562
Robert Zane to treat me
like a partner,

503
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:57,263
and then you turned around,
and you cut my legs out.

504
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,032
I told him that
because you were my proxy,

505
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,967
but you're not my proxy
with me.

506
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:03,670
And I don't appreciate
my decisions being questioned.

507
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:04,945
Did you even look
at that offer?

508
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:07,357
Mike, I'm going to explain
something to you that,

509
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,075
based on your approach
to this conversation,

510
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,944
you clearly don't understand.

511
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,379
This trial
will cost millions.

512
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:13,913
And Arcadian has
deep pockets.

513
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:16,149
And they're not looking
to empty them on a gamble.

514
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:17,617
So this is all
just about the money.

515
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:19,986
Were you born yesterday?

516
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,655
The clients are looking
for money.

517
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,889
We're looking for money.

518
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:26,459
The insurance company's
looking to keep money.

519
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:27,694
It's always
about the money.

520
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:30,664
And if you had some balls,
we'd get a whole lot more.

521
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:35,869
Listen to me,
I don't know what you thought

522
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:38,872
marching in here was going to do
other than piss me off,

523
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:40,874
but you're going to march
the hell back out

524
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:43,943
because I have better things
to do with my time

525
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:47,614
than to explain to you
how the world works.

526
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:53,653
Hey, I got your message.

527
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,472
Jeffrey signed the agreement?

528
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:56,940
He did.

529
00:19:56,992 --> 00:19:59,426
All it needs
is your John Hancock.

530
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:07,500
Wait, this doesn't say 20%.
It says 50%.

531
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:10,270
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I forget to mention

532
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,806
that he said you promised him
50% of your company

533
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:14,041
for putting off
medical school?

534
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:17,911
Because you sure forgot
to mention that to me.

535
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:20,547
You have got to be
kidding me.

536
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:21,548
How could you not
tell me that?

537
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,516
Because it was
a throwaway conversation

538
00:20:23,552 --> 00:20:25,719
we had 12 years ago
on the New Jersey Turnpike.

539
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:27,721
Well, it wasn't throwaway
to him, and he's gonna use it

540
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,155
because he's feeling
betrayed.

541
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:30,557
Well, I don't really care
what he's feeling

542
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:33,059
because he's the one
who had the affair.

543
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:38,031
You wanted to know the
circumstances of our divorce.

544
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:39,899
Well, that's what they are.

545
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,651
That's why I'm leaving him.

546
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,903
I am sure you wouldn't
understand what's it like

547
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:47,457
to experience infidelity.

548
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:49,909
I would, and I do,

549
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,212
but that doesn't change the fact
that you made a contract.

550
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,547
What about our other contract?
20%.

551
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,833
The original agreement
supersedes it,

552
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:59,753
and an affair
doesn't change that.

553
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,921
Except he doesn't have
any proof

554
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,840
I ever made
the original agreement.

555
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:05,725
Esther, they're gonna
put you under oath

556
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:08,728
and ask you point-blank
if this happened.

557
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:10,563
And I'm going to say
it didn't.

558
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,482
That's perjury, and I'm not
gonna let you do that.

559
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:13,900
What are you,
some white knight

560
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,518
who never crosses the line
to win?

561
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,403
No, but I'm not gonna let you
make a decision

562
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,571
in the heat of the moment

563
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:19,939
that you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

564
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,609
Well, then you better find some
other way to void this deal,

565
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:25,445
because there's no way
I'm giving my shit bag husband

566
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:28,181
half of everything I own.

567
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:33,953
I need you to find
every loophole there is

568
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:36,256
around verbal contracts.

569
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,674
So Jeffrey was
telling the truth?

570
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,559
Yes, and she'd rather
slit her wrists

571
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:41,461
than give him 50%,
and I don't blame her.

572
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:43,396
Yeah, but she's the one
who's leaving him, so--

573
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,867
He cheated on her,
didn't he?

574
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:51,171
Well, that's between our client
and her soon-to-be ex-husband,

575
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:52,539
and I have no intention
of letting him

576
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:54,507
get the better of her.

577
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:57,010
What?

578
00:21:57,045 --> 00:22:00,213
You're being protective.
It's sweet.

579
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:01,848
Okay, listen to me,
we're protecting Esther

580
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:04,217
because it's our job
to protect her.

581
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:06,052
And if we don't figure
a way out of this,

582
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:07,754
she's gonna lose
millions of dollars,

583
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,089
so you want to make observations
about the two of us,

584
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,742
do it all you want
after we've won.

585
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:14,727
I'm on it.

586
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:22,485
Okay, so final deal memos here,
check authorizations here.

587
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:27,340
Now all we need to do is get
Kelton to sign, and we are done.

588
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:32,278
Mike, I know you think
this deal sucks,

589
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,814
but there is
a silver lining.

590
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,716
We got to work together
again.

591
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,669
What?

592
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:41,621
I was just thinking
about when we started.

593
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:43,156
Who would've thought that
working with you

594
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:45,725
would ever have been
a silver lining?

595
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:47,060
Me?

596
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,061
Yeah, you.

597
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:49,162
What about you?

598
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:50,396
What are you talking about?

599
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:52,365
I have been a gentleman
since day one.

600
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,633
- Really?
- Yes.

601
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,235
Remember the whole
airplane incident?

602
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,171
Do I?
Yes, you were the one who--

603
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:02,492
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

604
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:03,943
Wait a second.
Delta Financial.

605
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,011
What about them?

606
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:06,412
There was a brochure
for Delta Bauer Financial

607
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,081
on Robert Zane's desk.

608
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:09,449
And on top of that,
they were listed

609
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:11,918
as a subsidiary
on Arcadian's annual report.

610
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:13,686
As are 50 other funds.

611
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:16,931
50 other funds that don't have a
brochure on Robert Zane's desk.

612
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:18,180
Mike--

613
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:19,632
Katrina, I need to know
if they're one of your clients.

614
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,749
You know
I can't tell you that.

615
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:21,851
Okay, well,
you just did.

616
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:23,652
Now I need to know
if they own shares of Kelton.

617
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:25,888
I don't know if they own shares,
and I'm not gonna find out.

618
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:28,324
You don't care if Robert Zane
is manipulating a case

619
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,359
to service a hedge fund?

620
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,659
It doesn't matter
if I care.

621
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,994
I can't violate
attorney-client privilege.

622
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,529
You said you owe me.

623
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,397
And you said
I owe Rachel.

624
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:37,500
Katrina, please.

625
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:39,568
You said that Robert is
doing right by his clients.

626
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,504
Well, I just need to know
which clients

627
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:43,405
he's doing right by.

628
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:54,316
Hey.
Do you have a minute?

629
00:23:54,352 --> 00:23:57,319
The last time I asked you that,
you told me the answer was no.

630
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:59,021
And I still gave you
the minute.

631
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:00,589
Well, I happen to be
in the middle

632
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,558
of trying to get Louis's sister
out of a huge mess, so--

633
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:04,043
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

634
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:05,455
Louis promised
to stay out of this.

635
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:07,796
And he is, and I'm not here
because he asked me to be.

636
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,098
I'm here because I care
about him and--

637
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,133
That's not my problem.

638
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:13,302
Harvey, I'm not
the enemy here.

639
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:15,437
And Louis is your partner
and your friend,

640
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:17,139
and right now, he needs
a little reassurance.

641
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:18,841
And I told you before,
I'm not the guy

642
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:20,426
that gives you a hug
when you're scared.

643
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:22,228
I'm the guy that wins
when you need it the most.

644
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:23,345
Why can't you for once--

645
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:24,847
You know what, Donna,
when I came to you for help,

646
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,582
you said that I don't
get to do that anymore.

647
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,137
Well, you don't get
to do this anymore.

648
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:31,587
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

649
00:24:33,157 --> 00:24:35,057
You know what,
Harvey?

650
00:24:35,092 --> 00:24:36,959
Louis was afraid to let you
take this case,

651
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:39,194
and I told him not to be
because I trusted

652
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,629
that at the end of the day,

653
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:43,098
you'd remember
that we're family.

654
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:45,267
But maybe I was wrong.

655
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:47,803
Because I spent 12 years
putting you first,

656
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:51,006
and the day I finally decided
to do something for myself,

657
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,642
you didn't just stop
treating me like family,

658
00:24:53,678 --> 00:24:56,595
you started treating me
like a stranger.

659
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:59,331
And for your information,
that is a thousand times worse

660
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:02,685
than if you treated me
like your enemy.

661
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,167
Louis, did you need
something?

662
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:20,536
I need you to know
how proud I am of you,

663
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,271
'cause seeing you working
like this

664
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:24,907
just reminds me how
you persevered with the LSATs

665
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:27,309
and how you got into law school,
and now--

666
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:28,577
Louis, I'm not telling you
about Esther's case.

667
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:31,463
Well, then what the hell
good are you?

668
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:34,350
Louis, you promised Harvey
you would stay out of it.

669
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:35,634
I just need to know
what happened.

670
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:36,686
What happened with what?

671
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,020
What happened with them.

672
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:39,775
I mean, it's no secret
that I hated Jeffrey,

673
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:43,559
but Esther,
she loved him,

674
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,779
and for them to just--

675
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:49,131
I need to know why.

676
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:54,069
He cheated on her.

677
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:04,213
Well, then you promise me
that the two of you...

678
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:06,298
stick it
to that sack of shit.

679
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:09,418
What do you think
I'm working on?

680
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,818
We're all squared away
on the paperwork?

681
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,204
No, we're not squared away
on shit

682
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,554
until you tell me
whether or not you knew.

683
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:27,957
You want to run that
by me again?

684
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:29,825
Delta Financial,
your client.

685
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,694
Did you know they were
heavily invested in Kelton?

686
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,262
Are you accusing me
of something, Mike?

687
00:26:33,297 --> 00:26:34,680
Because you better watch
what you say.

688
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:35,931
You still haven't answered
my question.

689
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,683
Did you know a subsidiary
of the hedge fund

690
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:40,936
backing our suit just purchased
a huge block of Kelton shares?

691
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:43,305
I am their lawyer,
not a stock analyst.

692
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:46,008
Then maybe you can
explain to me why you have

693
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:48,244
one of their brochures
on your desk?

694
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,780
Okay, listen to me,
Mr. Photographic Memory.

695
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:54,717
Underneath this brochure
are another 35

696
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:56,485
that have been piling up there
for a year and a half

697
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,686
because I'm looking
to invest my money

698
00:26:57,722 --> 00:26:59,088
that someday may be going
to your children.

699
00:26:59,123 --> 00:27:01,156
Wait, you think we want money
that comes from some stock

700
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:02,524
that went through the roof
because you authorized

701
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,326
a settlement
lower than street expectations?

702
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:06,896
Okay, you've said your piece.
Now I'm gonna say mine.

703
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:09,865
I have been a lawyer
and an officer of the court

704
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:12,968
longer than
you've breathed air,

705
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:14,169
and I'm looking you
straight in the eye

706
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:16,672
and telling you
that I am an honest man.

707
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:19,541
You know as an honest man that
now that we've discovered this,

708
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:22,044
we have to disclose it
as conflict of interest.

709
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,115
Then bury it,
deep in the fine print,

710
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,150
because it had nothing to do
with my recommendation,

711
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:32,288
and I'm not gonna let it
blow this goddamn deal.

712
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,837
Since when did this become
a deposition?

713
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:52,641
It didn't, but since you seemed
so anxious to ask Esther

714
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:54,243
about what she said
in the past,

715
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:56,078
I thought I'd just save us
all the trouble

716
00:27:56,113 --> 00:27:57,613
and get it
on the record myself.

717
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:59,682
What?
I never agreed--

718
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:03,319
You promised Jeffrey
50% of your company, didn't you?

719
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:08,424
Yes, I did.

720
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:09,391
Then it's settled.

721
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:10,659
Well, not quite.

722
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:12,861
Now that our client has admitted
that she made the agreement,

723
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:14,213
we'd like to discuss
the circumstances

724
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:15,397
under which she did.

725
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,433
What do you mean
the circumstances?

726
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:19,134
She promised me 50%,
period.

727
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,738
No, she promised you 50%
because you forfeited

728
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:24,053
your admission
to medical school.

729
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:26,208
That's right, and instead
of going to Stanford,

730
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:28,744
I stayed home
and took care of our family.

731
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,012
Then why is there
no record of you

732
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:32,581
ever being admitted
to Stanford?

733
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:35,167
Or any school,
for that matter?

734
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:38,487
Just a pile
of rejection letters.

735
00:28:40,107 --> 00:28:41,156
You lied to me?

736
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:42,925
This is ridiculous.

737
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:44,743
Lots of people
don't get into medical school

738
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,028
on the first try.

739
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:48,630
You were gonna take half
of my company on the first try.

740
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:49,632
30%.

741
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,216
He's not getting
another penny

742
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:53,268
of the business
I built myself.

743
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:55,137
You want to talk
about doing things yourself?

744
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:58,807
Who do you think stayed home
and kept our family together

745
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,526
while you were too busy
baking muffins

746
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:01,810
to make dinner
for your kids?

747
00:29:01,812 --> 00:29:03,812
Don't you dare attack me
as a mother!

748
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,981
You cheated on me!

749
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:09,284
Esther, I'm sorry.

750
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,071
I made a mistake.

751
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:14,456
But I did give up everything
for you.

752
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,709
I put my life on hold.

753
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:18,827
I sacrificed my dream
for yours.

754
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:19,995
I'm never gonna get
those years back.

755
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:21,830
No, Jeffrey.

756
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:24,833
We had everything,

757
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:26,218
and you ruined it.

758
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,972
All right, that's enough.

759
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:33,008
You have our final offer.

760
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,430
This better not be
about Robert Zane again.

761
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:40,749
- Just give me one minute.
- God damn it.

762
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:42,785
One of his clients purchased
shares of Kelton,

763
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,620
and if they acted
on privileged information--

764
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:45,888
I know the law.

765
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:47,322
Well, then you know
it's unethical at best

766
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:50,092
and illegal at worst.

767
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,227
What do you want from me?

768
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:53,663
I want to know
if you think he knew.

769
00:29:53,697 --> 00:29:55,431
What the hell difference
does that make?

770
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,099
It's the difference
between a legitimate settlement

771
00:29:57,134 --> 00:29:58,700
and stock manipulation.

772
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:01,670
You mean it would make him
a fraud?

773
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:05,941
This isn't the same thing,
and you know it.

774
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:07,776
I'm not trying to screw over
my clients.

775
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:09,328
Why would you even bring that up
right now?

776
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,740
Because you begged me
for this case

777
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,448
and a chance to work
with that man.

778
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,715
And if he colluded with them,

779
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,984
we can stick a better settlement
down their throats.

780
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,121
Do you really think Robert Zane
is dirty enough to do that?

781
00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:21,223
I don't know,
but I find it hard to believe

782
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:22,758
that he's dumb enough
not to know.

783
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:26,261
My dad's not dumb.

784
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:27,729
- And he's not dirty.
- Rachel...

785
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:30,065
And the last time
someone called him shady,

786
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:32,501
it was Louis, and you
almost punched him over it.

787
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:33,536
This is different.

788
00:30:33,537 --> 00:30:35,270
This is the same.

789
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:37,473
You were gonna punch him
because an attack on me

790
00:30:37,508 --> 00:30:39,341
is an attack on you.

791
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,660
Well, attack on my father
is an attack on me,

792
00:30:41,712 --> 00:30:42,978
and you're the one
who's doing it.

793
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:44,179
Nobody's attacking anybody.

794
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:47,216
Mike, you once came to me

795
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:50,519
asking me to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

796
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:52,821
and I gave it to you.

797
00:30:52,857 --> 00:30:55,257
So the least you can do
is give it to him.

798
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,935
I was hoping
you had good news,

799
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:10,873
but you're not pouring that
drink because we have a deal.

800
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:13,575
We don't, but we can.

801
00:31:13,611 --> 00:31:16,578
What are you saying?

802
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:21,750
I'm saying they offered 30%,
and I talked them down to 25%.

803
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:23,185
And why should I take it?

804
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,721
Because he's not the one
dragging this fight out anymore.

805
00:31:25,756 --> 00:31:26,855
You are.

806
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,757
And whether or not you believe

807
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,976
he gave up everything for you,
he does.

808
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:36,231
Tell me I don't have the right
to be angry.

809
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:40,953
Do you know why
I never even considered

810
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:42,337
becoming a divorce attorney?

811
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:44,289
Because it's beneath you.

812
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:47,593
Because there are children
involved.

813
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:52,664
When people get caught up
in divorce...

814
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,300
they forget
there are some things in life

815
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,134
that are more important
than money.

816
00:32:03,711 --> 00:32:06,511
Okay, Harvey.

817
00:32:06,547 --> 00:32:08,146
25%.

818
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:18,907
You know,
you're not exactly

819
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:21,093
the Harvey Specter
I was expecting.

820
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:23,128
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

821
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:24,663
A good thing.

822
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:27,866
You're not exactly the
Louis's sister I was expecting.

823
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,484
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

824
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:33,171
A good thing.
Definitely a good thing.

825
00:32:35,843 --> 00:32:40,045
Would you like
to take me home tonight?

826
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:41,763
I would.

827
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,932
But I need you
to sign that first.

828
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:45,117
Why is that?

829
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:48,020
Because then you won't be
my client anymore.

830
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:53,058
A man with a code.

831
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:57,479
Maybe you are a white knight
after all.

832
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:00,616
Come on,
let's get out of here.

833
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,445
Louis, it's midnight.
What's--

834
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,613
Harvey's screwing Esther.

835
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,949
- What?
- Look at this.

836
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:23,750
It's an agreement
that Esther signed

837
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:25,719
that agrees
to give Jeffrey 25%.

838
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,188
That's 5% more than she needs
to pay that son of a bitch.

839
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:29,323
Where did you get this?

840
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:30,390
Well, I was walking
down the hall.

841
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:33,293
I saw two glasses,
a bottle of scotch, and that.

842
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:34,695
He got her drunk,
so he could screw me over.

843
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,199
Okay, there is no way
Harvey would ever do that.

844
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:41,368
You woke me up in the middle
of the night to tell me that?

845
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:44,137
Donna, 5% extra is $3 million.
How do you explain that?

846
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:45,839
- I can't.
- I can.

847
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:47,708
He's trying to get me back
about his compensation

848
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:49,209
by trying to screw over
another Litt.

849
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:50,544
So what I need you to do--

850
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:52,379
Louis, the only thing
that I need to do

851
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,581
is tell you you're crazy
and go back to sleep.

852
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:57,417
And if you do anything
between now and tomorrow

853
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,886
other than confront Harvey
face-to-face, so help me God,

854
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:02,122
you will not have a secretary
in the morning.

855
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,135
Hey.

856
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,105
Hey.

857
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,439
I'm letting it go.

858
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,807
Does that have
something to do

859
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:22,609
with where you've been
so early in the morning?

860
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,478
Yeah.

861
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:25,445
You went to see my dad?

862
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,913
I went to see Emma Powell,

863
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:30,751
asked her how she felt
about the settlement.

864
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:32,252
She said it would
change her life.

865
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:34,321
You said
it wasn't enough money.

866
00:34:34,356 --> 00:34:36,023
She didn't even
mention the money.

867
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:37,824
She said, for her,
the settlement was proof

868
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,793
that Kelton didn't do right
by her husband,

869
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,728
and that was
all she needed.

870
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,497
Okay.

871
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:44,892
So because the plaintiff
was happy,

872
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,533
all of a sudden, you think
my dad's an honest man.

873
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,368
No.

874
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:50,904
I went there to see
if I could let it go.

875
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,142
I know your dad is
an honest man

876
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:58,745
because he's raised
someone like you.

877
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:00,447
You were right.

878
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:04,551
I never should have
questioned his integrity.

879
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:06,186
I was also right

880
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:08,221
that you never
should've taken this case.

881
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,490
No, you were wrong
about that.

882
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:12,793
I told you
we might fight,

883
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:14,561
but it would bring us
closer together,

884
00:35:14,596 --> 00:35:16,563
and it did.

885
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,231
And not just
me and your father.

886
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:19,399
What does that mean?

887
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,635
I mean you and your father.

888
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:24,538
I have never seen you leap
to his defense like that.

889
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:27,808
I did leap to his defense,
didn't I?

890
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,459
You sure did.

891
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,183
You think our daughter
will leap to my defense

892
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,568
like that one day?

893
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,604
She sure will.

894
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,999
Louis, what are you
doing here?

895
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,434
I'll tell you what
I'm doing here.

896
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,670
I'm coming to you face-to-face
about screwing my sister.

897
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,238
Excuse me?

898
00:35:58,273 --> 00:36:00,273
I saw the terms, Harvey.
They're a joke.

899
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:02,809
No, they're what
Esther wanted.

900
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:05,145
And you swore
you'd stay out of this.

901
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,947
Well, it's a good thing
I didn't

902
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,331
because there's no way
she wanted to give away

903
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:09,783
millions of dollars.

904
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:11,918
It's called being charitable
in order to move on.

905
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:13,987
It's called
Jeffrey's a piece of shit,

906
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:15,539
not the March of Dimes.

907
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,490
He should be
getting nothing.

908
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:18,658
Instead of being focused
on what he gets,

909
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:20,594
you should be focused
on what Esther gets,

910
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:21,629
which is to be happy.

911
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,863
Wrong, Litts are never happy,

912
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:23,847
and you're using her
to get to me.

913
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:24,848
How the hell
am I doing that?

914
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,180
You think
I went after your money

915
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:27,601
by changing the firm's
compensation structure.

916
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,035
You did
come after my money!

917
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:31,037
And now you're going after
Esther's to even the score.

918
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:32,506
If I wanted
to even the score,

919
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,924
I wouldn't come
after your sister.

920
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,409
I'd be coming after you.

921
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,477
And for your information,
I convinced her

922
00:36:37,513 --> 00:36:39,146
to be forgiving
by telling her

923
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,447
that there are
some things in life

924
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:41,748
that are more important
than money.

925
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,483
Bullshit!
You don't believe that.

926
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,019
Louis, I didn't take this
to get back at you.

927
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:48,388
I took it because it was
a chance to bury the hatchet

928
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:50,090
and move on.

929
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,925
So either
let these terms stand,

930
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:54,294
or do what you always do
and screw everything up.

931
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:04,855
Robert,
I'm glad you're here--

932
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:07,207
What the hell
did you do?

933
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:09,042
What are you
talking about?

934
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:10,444
I went to see
Emma Powell,

935
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,112
but I swear to God, I did
not undermine the settlement.

936
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,380
I'm not talking about that.

937
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:16,283
I'm talking about you going
behind my back to Arcadian.

938
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,617
I didn't do that.

939
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,819
Oh, you expect me
to believe that

940
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:20,420
after all the shit you told me
the last time I saw you?

941
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:21,638
You can believe it or not,

942
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:22,823
but I'm telling you
I didn't do anything.

943
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:24,624
- Then who did?
- I did.

944
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,694
You said if he colluded
with Arcadian,

945
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:29,963
then we could shove a bigger
settlement down their throats.

946
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,398
But he didn't
have to collude,

947
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:34,301
because Arcadian already had
access to that settlement.

948
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,069
Which makes it
insider trading anyway.

949
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,270
And I pointed out to them

950
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:39,206
that if they were
to divest their shares

951
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:42,008
to our clients who don't
have insider knowledge,

952
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:43,543
then they've done
nothing wrong.

953
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:44,579
No harm done.

954
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,346
The harm is
you lost me my client

955
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:47,814
and made me look
like a fool.

956
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,049
No, Robert, they did that

957
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:50,450
by not telling you
what they did.

958
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:51,852
Which means the client
you lost

959
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:53,353
was breaking the law.

960
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:54,838
And worse than that,

961
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,056
they were lying
to their lawyer.

962
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:57,257
So you think
this is funny?

963
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,776
No, I don't.

964
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:01,695
I think
your future son-in-law

965
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,847
trusted you had nothing
to do with it

966
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,500
and then saved your ass
from committing a crime.

967
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,068
You're...welcome?

968
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,207
Thank you.

969
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:15,876
And you have
my condolences.

970
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:17,677
- For what?
- For having to deal with him.

971
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,046
Oh, you have no idea.

972
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:22,232
Hey, right here.
I'm standing right here, guys.

973
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:25,335
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Mm-hmm.

974
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:29,122
If you guys, you know,
need anything fixed or saved

975
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:31,958
that no one else seems to be
able to do, I'll be right here.

976
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:34,928
Hey.

977
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,430
Hey.

978
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:41,051
What are you
doing here?

979
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:43,603
I wanted to tell you
how grateful I am.

980
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,672
- You don't need to do that.
- Yes.

981
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:47,407
I do.

982
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,711
This whole mess

983
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:56,066
has been the hardest thing
I've ever gone through.

984
00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:57,558
And I wouldn't have
gotten through it

985
00:38:57,586 --> 00:39:00,020
without you reminding me
what's really important.

986
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:06,393
Thank you for that.

987
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,794
Take care, Harvey.

988
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:10,230
Good luck, Esther.

989
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:15,385
Oh, by the way,

990
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,469
Louis wanted me
to tell you

991
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,705
how grateful he is too.

992
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:38,925
- Harvey.
- Louis.

993
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,677
What can I do for you?

994
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:42,178
Remember when I said,
if wanted you

995
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,264
to make up
for the compensation vote,

996
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,683
I would come
to you directly?

997
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:47,834
Well, now I am.

998
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:50,503
Well, what happened to

999
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:53,006
"some things in life are
more important than money"?

1000
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,874
This isn't about the money.

1001
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,377
This is about
making things right.

1002
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:04,651
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1003
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,119
For what?

1004
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,704
I act like I don't know
Esther's beautiful,

1005
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,957
but I do.

1006
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,792
It started when we
were in junior high

1007
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,461
and all the cool kids
would hang out with me

1008
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:17,330
just so they could
get close to her.

1009
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,382
Sometimes it worked,
and sometimes it didn't,

1010
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:25,221
but either way,
when it was over...

1011
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,675
they all acted like
they didn't know me at all.

1012
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,929
So when I thought

1013
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:35,098
you were using her
to get to me, I, uh--

1014
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,101
I wasn't doing that, Louis.

1015
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:40,153
I know.

1016
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,241
I'll take care
of the compensation issue.
