Pursuant to section 28-B of the bylaws,

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:07,551
I am placing Harvey Specter
on immediate unpaid suspension.

3
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:08,952
That vote's not gonna
go well for you.

4
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:10,787
You need to do something
to humble yourself.

5
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:11,788
What is this?

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,057

8
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:15,225
I'm not doing it.

9
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:16,927
Am I mistaken, or did we
not have this discussion?

10
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,228
Don't call me again.

<i>Daniel Hardman's office.</i>

12
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,564
I need to speak
to him right now.

13
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:22,299
<i>He sent two packages.</i>
<i>Either move forward</i>

14
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,668

<i>move forward on the other.</i>

15
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:26,069
Rachel, you have to handle
this meeting by yourself.

16
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:27,103
What?

17
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,338
She knows that
I didn't go to law school.

18
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:29,606
I'm calling the DA's office
right now

19
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,841
if you don't tell me
what the hell's going on.

20
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:31,975
We're engaged.

21
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:32,909
So it is him.

22
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:35,312
Please,
I am begging you.

23
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:36,513
It's done.

24
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:38,281
- She bought it?
- She did.

25
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:39,616
You think I should stop
being a lawyer?

26
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,219
I'm saying if you really
love her, you won't marry her.

27
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:56,733
What are you doing?

28
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:00,971
Just looking at how beautiful
you are.

29
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:04,207
I already said yes,
so you don't have to--

30
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,518
What got into you
this morning?

31
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:18,221
Sometimes I just think about
how we got to be here together.

32
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:20,223
Then I wonder
if I deserve you.

33
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:22,359
And then I wish that we could
just stay here in this bed

34
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:26,029
for the rest of my life.

35
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,497

36

Does--does this have
anything to do

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,275
with the close call
we had?

38
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:40,977
It does.

39
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:44,347
I just don't think I ever
thanked you enough for...

40
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:45,916
having my back.

41
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,819
Don't you know by now that
I will always have your back?

42
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:51,021
I do.

43
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:55,091

46
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,637
we don't show division, and
we don't take it out on Louis.

47
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:10,073
Well, that's gonna be tough,
because we wouldn't even be here

conniving son of a bitch.

49

Harvey, Louis came to me
last night,

50
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:17,080
said he was gonna
flip his vote.

51
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:20,684
So forgive him or not,
don't antagonize him.

There's still a chance
you could get out of this.

Good morning,
everyone.

54
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,893
Harvey, before we vote,
would you like to say something?

55
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:34,130
I would.

56
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:37,033
As far as the official purpose
of this vote,

57
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,669
I'm not gonna insult any of you
by lying to you.

58
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:44,541
I hit Louis, and I apologized
to him in private,

59
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:48,478
but what I haven't done is
apologize to all of you.

60
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:51,948
My compensation has always been
important to me.

61
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,984
Not for the money,
but for what it says

62
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:57,120
about my place
in the firm.

63
00:02:57,154 --> 00:03:00,423
But this isn't a firm.
It's a partnership.

64
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,127
And my partners are
more important to me than money.

65
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:07,931
So, starting today,
I'm reducing my compensation

66
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,199
to the median amount,

67
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:13,236
with the rest going
to all my partners to share.

68
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,040
And I'm doing this regardless
of how you vote today.

69
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:20,043
Thank you for listening.

70
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:25,181
Louis, would you like to
present an opposing view?

71
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,017
Let's just get this
over with.

72
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:30,920
Okay.
We'll do this by secret ballot.

73
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:46,202
The final vote is eight
for suspension, eight against,

74
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:47,804
which means the motion
will not carry.

75
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,907
<i>Therefore, Harvey will not</i>
<i>be suspended.</i>

76
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:52,809
Now, if no one has
anything else,

77
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:54,944
I would like to get
back to business.

78
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:58,448
Actually, I would like
to propose

79
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:01,885
a new piece of business.

80
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,487
Daniel Hardman just signed
a billion-dollar client...

81
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:05,588
What?

82
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:07,757
And in exchange for sharing
that client with us,

83
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,026
he'd like to return to the firm
on a trial basis.

84
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:12,862
There is no way Daniel Hardman
is setting foot in this office.

85
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:14,964
Of course you'd think that,
because that would mean

86
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,232
more money
for the rest of us.

87
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:17,834
Are you kidding me?
I just showed everyone here

88
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:18,968
I don't care about money.

89
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,303
You just showed us
that you'll do anything

90
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:23,706
to get out of a suspension,
including bribing the partners.

91
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,041
Well, you may have fooled
half of us,

92
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:26,309
but the other half
didn't buy it.

93
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:30,480
That's enough.
Daniel Hardman will not return

94
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:32,649
to this firm
under any circumstance.

95
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:34,317
And of course
you back Harvey.

96
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:37,153
This is not about Harvey.
This is about my firm.

97
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,522
It's always about Harvey
and it's clear to everyone here,

98
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,624
whatever he does is
fine with you,

99
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,026
from hitting
another partner

100
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,861
to turning down millions
for this firm.

101

You two-faced
piece of shit.

102
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:48,631
Why don't we let
the partners decide?

103
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,306
I don't have to let
the partners decide,

104
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,335
because this is
my decision,

105
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:55,505
and my decision is, this
god damn meeting is adjourned!

that a partner with his eye

156
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,969
on the future
would be more forgiving.

157
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:58,706
You mean a partner.

158
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,942
You're not here about Daniel.
You're here about me.

159
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,210
You're goddamn right I am.
You promoted me just

160
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,313
to get Harvey to trust you
so you could set him up.

161
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:06,847
- No I didn't.
- Bullshit.

162
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:10,051
No, bullshit is
a gifted lawyer being held down

163
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:12,286
by partners to whom
he's pledged his loyalty.

164
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,488
Which brings me back to
what I just said a minute ago.

165
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:16,057
You think you bought
my loyalty.

166
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:18,292
Mike, you can pick
whatever side you want,

167
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:21,596
but when the dust settles,
and Harvey and Jessica are gone,

168
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,199
they'll be a place for you here
because I respect you.

169
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,768
Let me
tell you something, Jack.

170
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:30,004
When the dust settles,

171
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,873
you're gonna be the one
begging for a place,

172
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:36,777
and I'm gonna be the one
recommending they throw you out.

173
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,152
You really should try
one of those standing desks.

174
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:48,456
It's better on the back
for a woman of your age.

175
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,325
This is a standing desk
for a man of your height.

176
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,294
- Nice to see you, Jessica.
- No, it isn't.

177
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,428
And the last time I saw you,

178
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:56,063
I told you to
stay the hell away from my firm.

179
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:57,398
And a good lawyer
puts aside their feelings

180
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:58,799
when there's money on the table.

181
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,368
Oh, cut the shit, Daniel.
Second you get your foot

182
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:01,469
in the door,
you'll start hatching a plan

183
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:03,237
to put me on the street.
You're right.

184
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:04,672
But thanks to you,
the partners will put you

185
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:06,007
on the street anyway.

186
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,274
What the hell
are you talking about?

187
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,776
The client I was willing
to share with you

188
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,745
is looking
to make numerous acquisitions,

189
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,381
and those acquisitions
would have been new clients

190
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:14,815
for you too.

191
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,418
Instead, we're going to start
targeting your clients

192
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:20,021
as acquisitions,
and everyone we close

193
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:23,491
leaves you and comes
right over to me.

194
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:26,293
And now all the partners
will know why it's happening.

195
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:29,730
And your puppet, Jack Soloff,
tells the partners,

196
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:32,933
"If we let you back,
the bleeding stops."

197
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,802
Which is why I'm here.

198
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:35,970
To thank you.

199
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:38,039
It would be so much
less delightful

200
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:43,110
if you had just said yes
right away.

201
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:45,212
Well the least you could do
is tell me your first target.

202
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:47,948
I'll give you a hint.

203
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:51,886
It's one that's gonna hit you
right where it hurts.

204
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,025
I can't believe that
in a couple of months

205
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,293
we'll be back here
for your wedding.

206
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:00,828
I know, it's amazing.
I can't believe

207
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:02,396
how much we have left
to do.

208
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,464
Mmm, speaking of which.

209
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,599
Mm-hmm?

210
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,001
What's this?

211
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,436
Your wedding announcement
for "The Times."

212
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,305
I know that you're busy,
so I took the liberty

213
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,473
of writing it up.

214
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:13,874
Wedding announcement?
Yes.

215
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:15,242
Um, Mom, I don't think that--

216
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:16,610
I left a couple
of things blank.

217
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:18,679
I wasn't sure
where Mike went for undergrad.

218
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:20,781
Was it Cornell or Columbia?

219
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:23,050
Oh, and was he
on The Harvard Law Review?

220
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:24,218
And they're gonna want
a picture of the two of you.

221
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,253
I was thinking maybe
the Central Park Boathouse?

222
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:30,858
We're not doing
an announcement.

223
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:31,992
What?

224
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,360
Mike and I,
we're not interested in this.

225
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:35,830
I don't understand.

226
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:37,164
When you read your cousin
Nicole's announcement,

227
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,766
you didn't have
a problem with it.

228
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
'Cause something like this
is right for Nicole.

229
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:42,103
It's not right for me.

230
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:44,004
You mean it's not
right for Mike?

231
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,107
Oh, come on, Mom.
What are you talking about?

232
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,174
Two years ago,
you wouldn't have had a problem

233
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,375
with something like this.

234
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,777
Well, it's not two years ago,

235
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:51,545
and this is how we both feel.

236
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,882
So I'm just asking you
to respect my wishes

237
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:59,655
because we have
so much more to go over, okay?

238
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,423
<i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>it's Cutie Pie Cosmetics.</i>

239
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:03,724
Joan's ready to retire.

240
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,392
No one gives a shit
about Joan Walsh's business.

241
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:06,694
It's Nader Communications.

242
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:07,895
<i>Why, because they're</i>
<i>you're client?</i>

243
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,163
No, because
they were Jack's client

244
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:10,598
and now they're my client.

245
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:11,799
So this is all about you?

246
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,334
- Louis, calm down.
- No, this is all about you.

247
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:14,568
You know what?
You're the one who gave

248
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:16,003
Hardman the opening he needed.

249
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,338
- <i>Did you hear what I just said?</i>
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

250
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,706
Yeah, you heard me.
This wouldn't be happening

251
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,107
if you didn't try to suspend me.

252
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:21,242
After you punched me
in the face.

253
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:22,343
If you really want
to know who's at fault here,

254
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:23,477
why don't you take a look
in the mirror?

255
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:24,945
That's enough.

256
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,647
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>what Hardman wants.</i>

257
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,783
He's trying to get us
to turn on each other.

258
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:31,051
Well, the fight is out there,
not in here,

259
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:33,854
and we have to figure out
who Hardman's target is.

260
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:36,257
Where the hell are you going?

261
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,558
You're right,
the fight is out there,

262
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:40,761
but Jack Soloff's in here.

263
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,730
You think it's a good idea
to let him go after Jack?

264
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,498
What's he gonna do?
Make him less on our side?

265
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,333
You're right.

266
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:48,169
There's more important things
to do here anyway.

267
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:49,503
Yeah, and number one
on the list

268
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:51,338
is if you think that Hardman's
really going after

269
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:53,413
Nader Communications,
then we need to get over there

270
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,608
and warn them.

271
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:56,377
It's not Nader,
it's McKernon Motors.

272
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:57,578
It can't be McKernon.
They're too small.

273
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:58,913
Not since we did
that battery deal.

274
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,014
And I know
what you're gonna say,

275
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,782
"Avery McKernon's estate
still owns too much

276
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:04,051
of the stock,"
but not anymore.

277
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:05,085
Who bought it?

278
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,153
It doesn't matter
who bought it.

279
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:07,254
It matters
who the attorney of record is.

280
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,657
- Let me guess, Daniel Hardman.
- Exactly.

281
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,926
Goddamn it.

282
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,360
Harvey, what are you doing?

283
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:14,762
I'm going
to see Dominic Barone.

284
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,730
- Well, then I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

285
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,065
They're my oldest client,

286
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:19,533
and this is something
I have to do.

287
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:21,936
Harvey, this is a client
that you gave to me and Louis.

288
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,304
Yeah, and you were
smart enough

289
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:24,772
to figure out
they were the target.

290
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,106
Now I need you
to use that brain

291
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:29,143
to start figuring out
how we're gonna get out of this.

292
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:30,711
What are you gonna do?

293
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:32,479
I'm gonna look Dominic Barone
in the eye

294
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:35,082
and tell him I'm the reason
this is happening.

295
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:38,818
Jack, I need to talk to you.

296
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,465
You can save your breath,
Louis.

297
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,800
I know what you're here to say.

298
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,268
You're here to tell me
not to go against

299
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,804
your precious
Harvey and Jessica.

300
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,823
No, I'm here to tell you
that you have no idea

301
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:49,441
who you're in bed with.

302
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:52,377
Well, I appreciate
your concern for my well-being,

303
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,013
but I can handle myself.
No you can't.

304
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,348
What difference does it make,
Louis?

305
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,283
It's too late.
It's not too late.

306
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,935
You think if
I suddenly abandon Daniel,

307
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,254
Jessica's just gonna welcome
me back with open arms?

308
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,523
Yes, you don't know
how forgiving she can be.

309
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,291
I trust her.
The only thing she's going

310
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,859
to forgive me with
is a knife in the back.

311
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,594
Jack, listen to me.

312
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,497
Daniel Hardman
treated me like a son.

313
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,833
He promoted me
to senior partner,

314
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,334
used me to take over the firm.

315
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,170
After he lost power,
he turns around

316
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,406
and slaps me
with a sexual harassment claim.

317
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,824
I know.
Monica Eaton.

318
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,787
But what you don't know
is that it was bullshit.

319
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:32,350
He betrayed me.

320
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:34,986
Humiliated me.

321
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,521
And after I finally
confronted him about it,

322
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:39,824
he tells me...

323
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,111
that I got
what I always wanted.

324
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,430
So, Jack, believe me,
if you think this man

325
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,533
cares about you, he doesn't.

326
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,168
I know what kind of man
he is, Louis.

327
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,304
Then why are you siding
with him?

328
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,572
I'll tell you why.

329
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,107
He promised to do something
Jessica never would.

330
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,342
Put my name on the wall.

331
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,344
What if she would?

332
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,445
You're not in reality.

333
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:02,013
Jack, she did it for me.

334
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,282
Even if I wanted
to go with you, I couldn't.

335
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,084
He's got something on you,
doesn't he?

336
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,936
This conversation is over.

337
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,947
Harvey, what the hell?

338
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,448
I just to notification
of a tender offer.

339
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:21,733
They're coming after
my company.

340
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,034
I know,
that's why I'm here.

341
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,102
So they sent
the big guns to fight

342
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,604
because it's a hostile takeover?

343
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,272
I'm not here
because it's a hostile takeover.

344
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:29,374
I'm here because
this whole thing is my fault.

345
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,642
What do you mean your fault?

346
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:31,993
The reason you're
in the crosshairs is because

347
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,379
Daniel Hardman
has a vendetta against me.

348
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,513
You're telling me
we just closed a deal

349
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,582
that ensures
this company's future

350
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,084
and you put it in jeopardy
because you pissed off

351
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,318
your former partner?

352
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:41,486
Yes, that's
what I'm telling you.

353
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,021
God damn it.

354
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,456
Well what do you
want me to do, Dominic?

355
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:46,725
I want you to stop being
an asshole to people.

356
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,910
It's too late for that.

357
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:52,097
But it may not be too late
for this.

358
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,698
Drop us as your attorneys.

359
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:54,683
What?

360
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:57,068
As long as
you're connected to us,

361
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,536
there's gonna be
a target on your back.

362
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,605
You let us go,
there's a chance it goes away.

363
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:01,856
Harvey.

364
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,241
If I was just gonna
cut you loose because

365
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,759
someone hates you,
I wouldn't have hired you

366
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,012
in the fist place,
because we both know

367
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,247
I used to hate you.

368
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,149
Thanks, Dominic.

369
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,851
- So what are we gonna do?
- I'll let you know.

370
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,219
But I'll tell you this:

371
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,022
They want a war,
they got a war.

372
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,062
Hey, Rach, do you have
that Neilson brief for Louis

373
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,096
from last month?

374
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,564
No, I don't.

375
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,615
Are you sure?
Because he keeps telling me

376
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:28,700
that you have it.

377
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,801
And I keep telling him I don't

378
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:30,802
and I have more
important things to do

379
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,337
than sit around
and answer the same question

380
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,205
every other day.

381
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,874
And I have better things
to do with my time

382
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,309
than to be spoken to that way.

383
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,679
I'm sorry.

384
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:45,717
Rachel, what's going on?

385
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:46,851
I just had lunch
with my mom

386
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,754
to talk about our wedding,
and she wants to put

387
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,489
an announcement
in "The New York Times."

388
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,590
Oh, my God.

389
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,658
Did you tell her
that she can't do that?

390
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,160
Yeah.
I made up some story

391
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,678
about it being snobby,
but Donna, that's just

392
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:57,929
the tip of the iceberg.

393
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,980
What are you talking about?

394
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,865
This is her
proposed guest list.

395
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,234
It is 300 people
and it includes

396
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:06,938
the Attorney General
and the Dean of Harvard Law.

397
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,392
What am I gonna do?

398
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:11,493
You're gonna tell her
that you don't want

399
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,178
a big wedding and that's that.

400
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,379
And if I do that,
she's gonna know

401
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,480
that something's not right.

402
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,365
Rachel, this is
the type of argument

403
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,501
that every mother has
with every daughter

404
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,353
about her wedding.

405
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,290
She's never gonna think
that Mike's a fraud.

406
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,231
- How'd Dominic take it?
- He took it fine.

407
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,399
Good, 'cause I have a plan.

408
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,667
Let's hear it.

409
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,634
We go to the last place
they'd ever expect

410
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,836
and we offer to merge.
Where?

411
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:38,937
Fletcher Engines.

412
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,105
Are you crazy?

413
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,107
We go to Fletcher,
they're gonna kick Dominic out,

414
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,708
Jack gains power.

415
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,076
Might as well have
let McKernon get bought out

416
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:46,544
in the first place.

417
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,979
Then the only other option
that's even remotely possible

418
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,115
is we take them private.

419
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,151
That actually might work.

420
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,619
Come to think of it,
why the hell didn't you

421
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,087
just say that to me
in the first place?

422
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,556
Because I knew you'd shit on
whatever my first idea was

423
00:15:58,592 --> 00:15:59,891
and that you'd be open
to the backup.

424
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,359
You're telling me
you set up a straw man idea

425
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,595
to manipulate me
into liking your real idea?

426
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,196
- Yep.
- How long you been doing that?

427
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,598
Peabody versus Danthorpe.

428
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,833
Son of a bitch.

429
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:09,968
All right, smart guy.

430
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,436
Now where are we gonna get
the money for the equity?

431
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,121
I'll tell you where.
Sidwell and Gianopolous.

432
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,589
<i>Is that another</i>
<i>straw man idea?</i>

433
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:15,740
Because you'll never get
the two of them

434
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:18,176
to go in on a deal together.
They hate each other.

435
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,911
Oh, those two hating
each other is exactly

436
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,046
what I'm counting on.

437
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,285
<i>- Hey, Mom.</i>
- Oh, Rachel!

438
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,753
<i>You're just in time.</i>

439
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,022
The caterer dropped off
some samples.

440
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,791
I was just about to try them,
but it'll be much more fun

441
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,792
if we do this together.

442
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:35,593
Okay, Mom,
but before you pout that.

443
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,929
I don't think that
the crostini travels very well.

444
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,931
Mom, please.

445
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:42,100
I know that you have given this
a lot of thought,

446
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,435
but I need to talk to you
about the size of the wedding.

447
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,871
It's way too big.

448
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,706
I have given this
a lot of thought,

449
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,608
and 30 people
at a wedding

450
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,844
isn't going to get
a chef like this.

451
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,928
Right, but I'm not
having a wedding

452
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:54,964
based on the chef,

453
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,397
and I'm not here
to talk about the menu.

454
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:00,118
I'm here to talk about
the guest list.

455
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,820
Rachel, did I ever tell you
what your father did

456
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,222
three weeks
before we got married?

457
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,025
Bought two tickets to Bermuda
and said we're eloping.

458
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,476
And he did that
because he didn't want

459
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:09,994
to deal with my mother.

460
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,230
But you know what stopped me?

461
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,449
I knew that I would regret
doing that to my mom

462
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,067
for the rest of my life.

463
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,603
But I told you
this isn't about Mike,

464
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,071
and it isn't
about eloping.

465
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,106
This is just about
me not wanting to get married

466

You're just not hearing me.
I don't want this big

470
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,948

471
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,449
I'm hearing you,
but I know my own daughter,

472
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,652
and there is something
that you're not telling me.

473
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,870
Okay, Mom.

474
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,255
Yes, there is something
that I'm not telling you,

475
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,974
and that's because
it's really hard for me

476
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,094
to say it.

477

You keep thinking
that this is about Mike.

478

Well, it's not.

479
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,769
This is about you
not accepting that it's

480
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,439
my wedding and it's not yours.

481

Rachel.

482
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,691
And if you can't
figure out a way to accept that,

483
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,528
then I think maybe
we will have to elope.

484
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,889
Jessica, can I talk to you
for a second?

485

No.

487
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,943
I think we should consider
promoting Jack Soloff

to name partner.

to reward our enemy.

00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:22,335
No, I'm asking you

Jessica, you have to
listen to me, please.

496
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:31,060
Hardman's got something on him.

498

I don't know,
but until two months ago,

499
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:37,450
the only thing we knew
about Jack Soloff

500
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:39,769
is that he bills more hours
than anyone but me.

501
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:40,937
So, what, you think
he just woke up one day

502
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:42,739
and became mastermind
of a palace coup?

503
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:44,474
The question isn't
who's in charge between

504
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:47,177
those two,
it's whether Jack is a volunteer

505
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:48,278
or a conscription.

506
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,529
I'm telling you,
I talked to him.

507
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,114
He's doing all this staring down
the barrel of a gun.

508
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:52,081
Then putting Jack's name
on the door

509
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:53,683
only gives Daniel more power.

What are you saying?

If Hardman
has something on him,

512
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:58,332
then we need
to have it on him too.

513

So instead of telling me
that we should promote him

00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:28,978
Good for you.

622
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:30,313
We're pretty sure
the other 80%

623
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:31,981
is gonna want to take our offer,
seeing as it is

624
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,750
ten dollars per share
higher than yours.

625
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:34,884
Bullshit.

626
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,335
Where'd you get
that kind of money?

627
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:39,038
We got it at the United Bank
of Take Your Ass Back To Jersey.

628
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:41,707
So, you can keep coming
after us all you want, Daniel,

629
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:44,677
but they're all going
to end up just like this.

630
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:46,179
Then I'm going
to raise my offer.

631
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:48,014
Ten dollars a share,
because if you two think

632
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:50,466
you can beat me, you can't.

633
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:52,552
- Told you.
- Told him what?

634
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:53,636
That was your ceiling.

635
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:54,804
He thought it was
15 a share more.

636
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:56,055
I thought
you had bigger balls.

637
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,223
Either way, we just
wanted to find out

638
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,691
what it was so we could
come over the top

639
00:23:58,726 --> 00:23:59,942
and crush you.

640
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:01,861
Because our real offer
is 20 more per share

641
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:03,696
and we don't care
who your investor is,

642
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:05,148
there's no way
they're paying more than that

643
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,949
just to fund your grudge.

644
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:08,451
See you around, Daniel.

645
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:12,872
By the way,
Mike pissed in your Bonsai.

646
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:15,491
Yeah, that's right.
Two times.

647
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,148
By the way,
nice<i> Usual Suspects</i> reference

648
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:21,664
back there.
Really, you caught that?

649
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,982
Yeah, I caught it.
What do you think I am?

650
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:25,482
Nothing, I just didn't think
you'd get it.

651
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:26,517
It was so subtle.

652
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:27,768
Trust me, not so subtle.

653
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:29,920
Well, if it was so ham-fisted,
why didn't you just

654
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:31,488
chime in back there?

655
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:33,357
Because I was there
to stick it to Hardman,

656
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:35,576
not clown around
with some quote-fest.

657
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:36,627
That's the difference
between you and me.

658
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:37,995
I can do both
at the same time.

659
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,296
Really?
See, at your age,

660
00:24:39,332 --> 00:24:40,764
I'm surprised that you can
even make it through a meeting

661
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,199
that long without
having to pee.

662
00:24:42,235 --> 00:24:44,301
Okay, why do you always have
to go straight to the prostate?

663
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,569
It's so distasteful.

664
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:46,720
Oh, right.
And you telling Hardman

665
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:50,007
that I'd peed in his Bonsai
was just pure class.

666
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,942
I didn't say
you peed in his Bonsai.

667
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:53,427
I said you pissed in it.
What are you, five?

668
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:54,678
Oh.

669
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,696
And by the way,
you're the one who told him

670
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:56,680
you did it twice.

671
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:57,716
Because you started it.

672
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,617
I had to lean in.
It's called committing.

673
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:01,218
Then how about you commit
to buying the next round

674
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,319
for a change?

675
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,121
I'd love to,
but I can't.

676
00:25:04,156 --> 00:25:06,106
I got to go meet Rachel
at her mom's.

677
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:07,575
Talk about some wedding stuff.

678
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:09,093
Ugh.
I'd love to join you,

679
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:10,894
but I'd rather
have a prostate exam.

680
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,196
There you go.

681
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:13,530
See?
You're leaning in.

682
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:14,632
I'm proud of you.

683
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,733
Excuse me, ma'am,
could you make sure

684
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:17,368
to cut him off
when he starts mumbling about

685
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:20,104
how they don't make shows like
<i>Welcome Back Cotter</i> anymore?

686
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:25,509
♪ ♪

687
00:25:25,544 --> 00:25:26,784
What are you doing here,
Daniel?

688
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:29,880
Just wondering what color
to paint the walls.

689
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:32,249
I've never been partial to red.

690
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:34,118
Instead of commenting
on my wall color,

691
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:36,053
why don't you go back
to your office?

692
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:37,721
Lick your wounds.

693
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:40,157
What wounds?
I'm about to win.

694
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:42,593
You have
a funny definition of win.

695
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:45,646
Since we just blew your
best offer out of the water.

696
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:46,930
Here's a copy of my new offer.

697
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:48,365
It'll be
in "The Journal" tomorrow.

698
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:51,602
There's no way the deal
holds up under this price.

699
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,037
And once your client
figures that out,

700
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,055
your offer falls through.

701
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:58,142
Well, then lucky for me,
my client's Japanese

702
00:25:58,177 --> 00:26:01,345
and the dollar just
took a dive against the yen.

703
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,180
So my deal will hold up
and then some.

704
00:26:03,215 --> 00:26:05,455
You know, I don't give a shit
where your client's from.

705
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:06,950
I don't lose to you.

706
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:08,986
Yes you do.

707
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,155
Because after this deal,
there'll be another one

708
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:15,159
and another one
and another one,

709
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:17,161
because you took my firm from me
and I'm going to take it

710
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:20,397
right back from you.

711
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,800
Get the hell out of my office,
Daniel,

712
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:25,169
before I do something
you'll regret.

713
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:27,271
Speaking of walls,

714
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,506
how does it feel
to have them closing in on you?

715
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:38,716
Son of a bitch!

716
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:42,870
Louis, is something wrong?

717
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,455
See this?

718
00:26:44,507 --> 00:26:46,140
It contains everything
on God's green earth

719
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:48,075
there is to know
about Jack Edward Soloff

720
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,544
from his pirate beard
to his stupid pen

721
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:52,563
that he carries around
like Linus's blanket.

722
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,131
- And...?
- And there's no dirt on him!

723
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,233
There's not one case
he crossed a line on.

724
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:59,636
There's no debts.
Nothing.

725
00:26:59,672 --> 00:27:00,971
Louis.

726
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:02,406
Did you hear me?
Is Soloff did something

727
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:04,975
and Hardman's a part of it,
it is buried so deep,

728
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,477
we'll never even
see the top of it,

729
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:09,012
let alone get
to the bottom of it.

730
00:27:09,014 --> 00:27:10,714
Louis, I'm about to tell you
something I never

731
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:12,950
thought I would.
What?

732
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:14,868
The night that Harvey and Mike
put it together

733
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,938
about Daniel and CM,

734
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:20,190
they got stoned first.

735
00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:21,625
What?

736
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,726
They thought you and Daniel
had them and they were screwed

737
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:24,728
and they figured,
"What the hell?"

738
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:27,197
So they bought some marijuana
and they got high.

739
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:28,966
Are you suggesting
we take the pot?

740
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,100
Worked for them.

741
00:27:30,136 --> 00:27:31,201
Well, it's not
gonna work for me.

742
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:32,302
- Louis--
- Donna look at me.

743
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:33,370
Do I look like someone
who needs to be hungry

744
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:34,605
and paranoid?
Relax.

745
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:35,706
It was just a suggestion.

746
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,341
Well it was
a stupid god damn suggestion,

747
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:39,510
and if that's all you have,
just walk you ass out of here.

748
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:42,279
Louis, what is going on?
Why are you so angry at me?

749
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:43,664
I'm not angry at you.

750
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:46,183
I'm angry at myself.
Louis.

751
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:47,818
After the vote,
Harvey told me it was my fault

752
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,654
and you want to know what?
He's right.

753
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:53,073
Harvey says a lot of things.

754
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,459
- You told me too.
- What?

755
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:57,494
This whole thing started
because I told Jack

756
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,096
that he could
bring up Harvey's compensation

757
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:01,698
for a vote,
and you told me not to.

758
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,668
Well, then maybe
it's my fault too.

759
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:06,703
Because this whole thing
really started when you tried

760
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:10,691
to make things right with Harvey
for me coming to work for you.

761
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:13,510
Donna, are you saying
that you regret coming to me?

762
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:15,412
No, Louis.
I'm saying maybe

763
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:18,081
I had a hand in this too.

764
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:19,416
What do we do now?

765
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:20,968
We keep looking together.

766
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:24,288
And if we can't find anything,
then we tell Jessica the truth.

767
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,830
- Hey.
- Laura, hi, how are you?

768
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:34,164
Where's Rachel,
I thought for sure

769
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,399
she'd beat me here.

770
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:38,268
Uh, Rachel's not coming.

771
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,537
I told her
I wasn't feeling well

772
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:43,023
because I wanted
to talk to you alone.

773
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:44,808
Is something wrong?

774
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:46,026
Yes, there is.

775
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:47,427
Rachel told me today that

776
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:49,580
she wants to
scale back the wedding

777
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:53,350
and that you two are
in sync on this.

778
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:54,551
Sounds like
you don't believe her.

779
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:55,786
Found it hard enough
to believe that she wouldn't

780
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,521
want to put an announcement
in "The Times,"

781
00:28:57,556 --> 00:29:00,924
but that my little girl,
who always dreamed

782
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,893
of getting married
at The Plaza Hotel

783
00:29:02,928 --> 00:29:05,662
now only wants
a handful of people there?

784
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:07,631
I'm sorry, Michael.

785
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:10,801
I just don't buy it.

786
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,203
This is coming from you,
isn't it?

787
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,273
You're right.

788
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:18,492
It is.

789
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:22,095
And I'll tell you why.

790
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:26,016
I don't have a family.

791
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:27,684
I don't have a lot of people
that I can invite,

792
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:29,837
and I asked her
if we could please

793
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:35,459
keep the entire wedding low-key.

794
00:29:35,494 --> 00:29:37,528
And she said that
she would do that for me.

795
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,930
And I understand that.

796
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:43,000
I think it's incredibly
sweet of her

797
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:48,472
to be willing
to do that for you.

798
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:52,342
But...

799
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:54,745
If you could find it
in your heart

800
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,747
to let my little girl
have the wedding

801
00:29:56,782 --> 00:30:00,150
that she's always wanted,
I am telling you,

802
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:03,086
she'll remember it
for the rest of her life.

803
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:15,065
Again?

804
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,700
You know, I'd really prefer it
if I gave you a key

805
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:18,702
so I wouldn't have to wonder
how you keep getting in.

806
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:20,737
And I'd really prefer it
if you checked your cell phone

807
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:21,905
every once in a while
so that I wouldn't

808
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,240
have to keep doing this.

809
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:24,775
- I have a cell phone?
- You do

810
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,843
and if you'd check it,
you'd know that Daniel Hardman

811
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:29,646
topped our bid by 20%.

812
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:31,448
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't.

813
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:33,283
Because the dollar
took a dive against the yen

814
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,802
and it turns out
his client is Japanese.

815
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:36,954
God damn it,
we are not losing

816
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,055
to that son of a bitch.

817
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,389
Why the hell
did you think I'm here?

818
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:40,991
We need to go back to
Gianopolous and get more money.

819
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:42,109
Jessica, he's not going
to pay that much.

820
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:43,493
No one in his right mind would.

821
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,862
Then go to somebody
who's not in his right mind,

822
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:48,265
because that lying bastard
isn't going to stop

823
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,833
until his name is
back up on the wall.

824
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:51,652
Wait a second,
the dollar took a dive

825
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:54,621
against the yen two weeks ago.

826
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:56,039
Which means there's something
else going on here.

827
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:57,958
Oh, I'll tell you
what's going on.

828
00:30:57,993 --> 00:31:01,244
Hardman's been playing with us
this whole time.

829
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:03,163
What are you saying?

830
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:06,883
I'm saying I need to go
see a guy about a thing.

831
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:12,573
Hey.

832
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,641
Where were you?

833
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:16,526
- I was with you mom.
- What?

834
00:31:16,562 --> 00:31:18,328
Didn't you get the message?
She had to postpone.

835
00:31:18,364 --> 00:31:21,231
She didn't postpone, Rachel.
She blindsided me.

836
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:22,532
What are you talking about?

837
00:31:22,568 --> 00:31:23,867
Why didn't you tell me
you were fighting with her?

838
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:25,102
Because mothers and daughters
fight about weddings

839
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:26,336
all the time.

840
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:27,304
But you weren't fighting
about the wedding.

841
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,472
You were fighting
about my secret.

842
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:29,706
And what does that
have to do with anything?

843
00:31:29,742 --> 00:31:30,807
<i>Because she doesn't</i>
<i>even know it.</i>

844
00:31:30,843 --> 00:31:32,292
Because I'm trying
to protect you.

845
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:33,844
I understand that,
but you have to share

846
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,279
these things with me.
<i>Why?</i>

847
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:36,780
'Cause instead of
protecting me,

848
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:38,282
you hung me out to dry.

849
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:39,683
And how exactly did I do that?

850
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:40,817
By making it seem like
I'm the one

851
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,352
that's taking away
your dream wedding.

852
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:47,641
You are the one
taking away my dream wedding.

853
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:48,742
Rachel.

854
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:49,860
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

855
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:50,927
It's just, it's a lot,

856
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,129
and she wanted
to make this announcement

857
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:53,163
in "The New York Times"
and had this huge guest list

858
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:57,267
and the Dean of Harvard Law
and I just--

859
00:31:57,303 --> 00:32:01,071
I don't want you
to get caught.

860
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:02,205
You don't want me
to get caught

861
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,558
or you don't want to marry me?

862
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:06,143
What?

863
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:08,812
I went to see Claire.

864
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:11,882
I know she knows.

865
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:12,983
And I want to know
if that made you

866
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:17,154
have second thoughts about us.

867
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,857
You went to see Claire?
Why...

868
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:22,326
Why didn't you tell me that?

869
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:23,927
Because she told me
that if I really loved you,

870
00:32:23,962 --> 00:32:26,897
I wouldn't marry you.

871
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,098
And I was afraid
to tell you that

872
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,135
because I thought
maybe you feel the same way.

873
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:35,505
Well, it, um,

874
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:39,476
it sounds like you're the one
who's having second thoughts.

875
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:43,447
No.

876
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:47,818
No, I'm not
having second thoughts,

877
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:50,620
but I do hate the idea
that I am somehow dragging

878
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:52,889
you into something
that is gonna ruin your life.

879
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:53,990
You are not dragging me
into anything

880
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:56,226
and you're not ruining my life,
Mike.

881
00:32:56,228 --> 00:33:00,030
I don't care about the plaza
or who comes or--

882
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:01,148
I don't care about any of it.

883
00:33:01,183 --> 00:33:03,917
The only thing
that matters to me is that

884
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:08,472
the man that
I'm marrying is you.

885
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:11,575
And if you take that
away from me,

886
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,877
I don't--

887
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:16,012
Rachel, Rachel, listen,
look at me, look at me.

888
00:33:16,048 --> 00:33:18,315
I'm not going anywhere.

889
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,618
Okay?
We're getting married.

890
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,720
And it could be
as small as possible

891
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:26,990
with just our close friends,
okay?

892
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,892
Okay?
Okay.

893
00:33:35,968 --> 00:33:37,517
I need to talk to you.

894
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:39,236
What is it, Louis?

895
00:33:39,238 --> 00:33:40,838
I couldn't find
what Hardman has on Jack.

896
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:42,172
That doesn't sound like
something you needed

897
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:43,774
to be waiting by the elevators
to tell me.

898
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,625
I've been thinking.
What if we tell him

899
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,981
we'll only make him name partner
if he takes a public stand

900
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:50,864
against Daniel first?
That way, even if he tries

901
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:54,251
to go against it later,
it won't work.

902
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:55,552
Did you speak
to him about this?

903
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:57,254
- I have.
- And?

904
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,388
- He said
he'll be onboard.

905
00:33:58,424 --> 00:33:59,523
And Jessica,

906
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:02,626
I believe him.

907
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:04,961
- Then tell him to come see me
at the end of the day.

908
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:10,834
- Hey.

909
00:34:14,173 --> 00:34:17,641
Turns out
I'm getting married.

910
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,942
Yeah, I know.

911
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,847
I was telling my future
mother-in-law

912
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,200
about how I didn't
have any friends or any family

913
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:31,004
when I realized,

914
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,942
whatever happened between
you and me...

915
00:34:35,978 --> 00:34:38,945
you're the closest thing
to family that I have.

916
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,967
So what do you say
we get together?

917
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:55,929
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

918
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:59,249
- I, uh...
I just want to say,

919
00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:01,184
based on what Louis said
that you're prepared to do--

920
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,053
- Louis has no idea
what I'm prepared to do

921
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:04,588
because the only thing
I'm prepared to do

922
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:07,290
is give you a chance
to come to Jesus.

923
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:08,909
And you're looking at her.

924
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,677
- Come to Jesus about what?

925
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:12,796
- Stop tap dancing, Jack.

926
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:15,165
What the hell does
Daniel Hardman have on you?

927
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,833
- You can ask me that question
a million times.

928
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,768
I'm never even going
to acknowledge its premise.

929
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:20,303
- And you just did.

930
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,205
And if it's that bad,
and Daniel knows it

931
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:24,107
and I don't,

932
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:26,343
then I only have one choice.

933
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:29,312
So, what I'm prepared
to do now is this.

934
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:33,116
Resign tonight
and I'll waive your non-compete.

935
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:35,018
- What?
- Oh, you didn't actually think

936
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:38,088
I was going to make you
a name partner, did you?

937
00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:44,628
- Here's my counter.

938
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:49,165
You resign,
and I waive your non-compete.

939
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,437
- You want me gone,
call for a vote.

940
00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:56,273
- You want me gone,
you do the same thing

941
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:58,074
because I'm a partner
as much as you

942
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,860
and you're the one
on the ropes.

943
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:01,344
- I'm not on shit,

944
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,747
because we know what's going on
with Daniel's investor

945
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:06,082
and Harvey's about
to put a stop to it right now.

946
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:07,684
- If you really knew
what was going on

947
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,819
between Daniel
and his investor,

948
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:12,455
you'd know
it's never gonna happen.

949
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:16,059
- Then I guess we'll just have
to see what we see.

950
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:33,543
♪ ♪

951
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:47,724
- Harvey Specter.
What a nice surprise.

952
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:49,359
Wanna play a little pool?

953
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:51,328
We go for 10,000 a game
in here.

954
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:53,330
- You're playing a lot more
expensive game than that,

955
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,365
funding Daniel Hardman
to be your frontman.

956
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,183
- And you're welcome
to go ahead and prove that,

957
00:36:57,235 --> 00:36:59,903
but he's got full power
of attorney

958
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:01,471
until I get out of here
in two years.

959
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:03,256
- Yeah, I don't care
how many years you have left.

960
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:04,808
It's about to feel
like the rest of your life,

961
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:06,826
because this is where
you're gonna spend it.

962
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:12,899
Bullshit.

963
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:15,452
Only the Bureau of Prisons
can approve a transfer.

964
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:18,588
- I know, but the thing is,
I went to see Sean Cahill today.

965
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:21,091
Turns out he wants you
to testify in a trial.

966
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,026
So, you can call
the Bureau of Prisons

967
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:24,127
all you want.

968
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:25,979
By the time your lawyers
get you out,

969
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:28,298
you're never gonna
be the same again.

970
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,733
I get it.

971
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:31,368
You want me
to stop backing Hardman.

972
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,936
- And you go back
to working on your break

973
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:34,604
and I don't have
to see your face again.

974
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:36,072
- You're living
in a dream world, pal,

975
00:37:36,074 --> 00:37:39,175
'cause that's
never gonna happen.

976
00:37:39,227 --> 00:37:41,044
- Well then here's my advice.

977
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:43,363
When you get to Rikers,
drink bleach.

978
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:45,248
It'll get you
sent to the infirmary.

979
00:37:45,283 --> 00:37:46,633
It's much safer there.

980
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:48,018
Oh, I don't need
to go to the infirmary

981
00:37:48,053 --> 00:37:49,486
'cause I got something
that's gonna keep me

982
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:52,756
as safe as a baby
in his mother's arms.

983
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:53,823
Money.

984
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,375
- You take that chance, Charles,

985
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,843
but if there's one guy

986
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:58,561
who doesn't give a shit
about your money,

987
00:37:58,597 --> 00:38:01,965
he's gonna get you,
and nobody's gonna stop him.

988
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:04,818
- Here's the thing, Harvey.

989
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,805
Nobody doesn't
give a shit about money.

990
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:10,974
Besides, in a week,
I'll be right back here

991
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:14,444
picking off your clients
one by one.

992
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:17,013
You want to stop me,
step down.

993
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:19,382
- What?
- You resign,

994
00:38:19,418 --> 00:38:23,520
his money goes away.

995
00:38:23,555 --> 00:38:24,954
I knew it.

996
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,190
You care about the people there,

997
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:30,093
just like you cared about your
little brother way back when.

998
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:31,995
- No way.

999
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,979
No deal.

1000
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:34,798
- Now, before you give me
an answer--

1001
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,383
you came here tonight
because you know

1002
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:38,234
you're gonna lose anyway.

1003
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,153
So why not save whatever
poor sap it is

1004
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:42,939
while you still can?

1005
00:38:42,974 --> 00:38:44,274
- Why should I believe
you would even live up

1006
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:48,078
to your end of the bargain?

1007
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:51,414
- Because I don't
give a shit about your war

1008
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:53,316
with Daniel Hardman.

1009
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:54,751
And I sure as hell
don't give a shit

1010
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:57,604
about your firm.

1011
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,340
All I want to do
is see you get down

1012
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:03,460
on your knees
and say, "I quit."

1013
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:10,734
- Trevor.

1014
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,335
- Hey, Mike.

1015
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,724
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, hey,

1016
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:20,410
I'm glad you called.
- Yeah, me too.

1017
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:22,512
- Listen, uh,
about the last time,

1018
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:24,114
I said some things--

1019
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:26,049
- Ah, we both
said some things.

1020
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:29,753
But I did some things.
And I'm sorry.

1021
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:33,623
- Well, uh, I have a way
you can make it up to me.

1022
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:36,025
Come to my wedding.

1023
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:37,961
- It means a lot to me
that you want me there,

1024
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:39,262
but I'm sorry.

1025
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:41,414
I can't.

1026
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,966
- What do you mean you can't?

1027
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:44,601
- Look, I'm married now,

1028
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:47,070
and I promised my wife
that that part of my life

1029
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:48,438
is behind me.

1030
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,290
- What does that have to do
with you coming to my wedding?

1031
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:52,575
- She didn't even want me
to meet you here.

1032
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:56,446
Don't you get it?

1033
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:58,381
You're breaking the law

1034
00:39:58,416 --> 00:39:59,949
every day.

1035
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:01,384
- You're judging me?
- No.

1036
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:03,820
I'm not judging you.

1037
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:05,789
Nothing would make me happier
than to raise a glass

1038
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,841
to your new life,

1039
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,326
but I can't.

1040
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:11,362
And you shouldn't either.

1041
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:12,595
- Oh, so now
I shouldn't get married?

1042
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:13,930
- No, I'm saying
you should quit.

1043
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:17,734
Oh, okay.

1044
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:20,136
Well, thank you
for the advice, Trevor.

1045
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:22,372
But I don't think
I'm going to do that.

1046
00:40:22,424 --> 00:40:25,942
- Michael, the longer you go,

1047
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:28,845
the less the money matters.

1048
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,114
The food doesn't taste as good.

1049
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:32,215
The car isn't fast enough.

1050
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:34,217
The view isn't high enough.

1051
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:36,136
And finally you realize

1052
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,687
that you would trade it all in

1053
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:41,391
for one night of going to bed

1054
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:43,026
where you don't have to worry,

1055
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:46,146
"When are they gonna
come for me?"

1056
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:48,231
- You almost got caught,
didn't you?

1057
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:52,485
- No, I didn't.
I just couldn't take it anymore.

1058
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,571
So finally, I went
to talk to someone.

1059
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:56,623
- Who?

1060
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:58,074
- You know who.

1061
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:03,163
I gotta go.

1062
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,052
Take care, Michael.
