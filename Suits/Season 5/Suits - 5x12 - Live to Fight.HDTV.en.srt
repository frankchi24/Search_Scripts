1
00:00:00,096 --> 00:00:01,430
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,720
Mike Ross is a fraud,
and I'm gonna make sure

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,499
he never sees the inside
of a courtroom again

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,329
unless he's wearing
an orange jumpsuit.

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,429
That woman doesn't get
anything

6
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,290
by prosecuting
a fraud like you,

7
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,899
but she would love to get
Harvey Specter.

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,130
I'm not turning
on Harvey.

9
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,269
You gotta listen to me!

10
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,809
I'm throwing you
a goddamn lifeline!

11
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,839
I want to tell Jeff
the truth about Mike Ross.

12
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,279
He told you he loved you,
didn't he?

13
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,679
I just don't want to lie
to him anymore.

14
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,779
Your whole story about how
Louis got his name on the door

15
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,849
is bullshit!

16
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,479
And I came here
to tell you the truth.

17
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,140
It's over.
We're done.

18
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,310
Never even thought
for a second

19
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,619
that you would even
consider

20
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,219
an idea so disgusting
as turning on Harvey.

21
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,780
The only reason
I thought about it

22
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,289
is because I am scared to death
of you going to prison.

23
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,620
I explicitly told you
to stay away from Mike's case.

24
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,759
I don't care.

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,560
Donna, I don't think
you get it.

26
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,399
There is going to come a time
where you're gonna

27
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,830
have to choose
between yourself and them.

28
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,339
If they're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come for me.

29
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,079
Are you saying you
coming back to me?

30
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,710
Yes, I am.

31
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,949
Then I'll see you
back in the office tomorrow.

32
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:08,250
♪ ♪

33
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,559
Dad, you know
I have to practice.

34
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,890
I know you do,
sweetheart,

35
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,629
but there's something
I have to tell you.

36
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,830
What is it?

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
We're moving
to Connecticut.

38
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,369
What?
Why?

39
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,039
Your mom and I think
it's best for you.

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,739
And what if it's not
best for me?

41
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,370
Honey, it is.

42
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,349
And I found us a great apartment
just outside Hartford.

43
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,289
Lot more kids.
You're gonna love it.

44
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,389
An apartment.

45
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,789
That's right.

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,729
It's gonna be so much better
than this big, creaky--

47
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,200
There's something
you're not telling me.

48
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,090
No, there isn't.

49
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,899
Yes, there is.

50
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,599
How do you know that?

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,800
I don't know,

52
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,969
but I do.

53
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,030
Oh, okay, Donna.

54
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,919
My...business hasn't
worked out,

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,819
and your uncle
offered me a job.

56
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,650
I'm so sorry, honey.

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,670
It's okay, Daddy.

58
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,170
I'll let you practice.

59
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,939
Dad?

60
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,370
Will there be a room
for my piano?

61
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,615
Honey, I'm afraid
there won't be.

62
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,140
But your aunt teaches
musical theater

63
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,319
just a few towns away.

64
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,989
I've already signed you up.

65
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,060
Thanks, Daddy.

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,739
Ms. Paulsen.

67
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,039
Could I get you a drink?

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,730
I'm not gonna be here
long enough to finish it.

69
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,170
Oh, you're gonna be here
till I tell you you can go.

70
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,179
Which you're gonna tell me
sooner than you think,

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,849
because I've don't have
anything to say.

72
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,549
I get it.

73
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,689
Harvey Specter was your boss
for a long time--

74
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,189
maybe even more
than your boss--

75
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,329
in which case,
there's no chance in hell

76
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,400
you didn't know that he was
conspiring with Mike Ross

77
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,659
to break the law.

78
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,229
The only thing I know is...

79
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,660
that unless you're gonna
arrest me,

80
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,569
I'm walking out that door
right now.

81
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,039
Good.

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,839
You're as tough
as I expected you to be,

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,679
so for now,
you are free to go.

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,709
I told you
I wouldn't be here long.

85
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,009
You're gonna get the door
for me?

86
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,240
Oh, I'm not opening the door
to be polite.

87
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,290
I'm opening the door so I can
see the look on your face

88
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,150
when you see who's in that room
across the hall.

89
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,159
Dad?

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,459
What the hell did you do?

91
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,229
I didn't do anything.

92
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,629
Turns out your father
got himself involved

93
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,929
in a shady real estate deal
several years ago.

94
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,190
My father has never done
anything wrong in his life.

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,130
Just like Mike Ross
and Harvey Specter

96
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,309
have never done
anything wrong?

97
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,579
Ms. Paulsen, maybe
you should reassess

98
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,709
the quality of the men
in your life.

99
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,049
Let me in that room.

100
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,079
Sorry, not possible.

101
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,179
But next time
you see your father,

102
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,449
maybe you explain to him
you put his life on the line

103
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,280
for the man you work for.

104
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,450
You know, I never thought that
I'd say this to another woman,

105
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,260
but you are
a cold, heartless bitch.

106
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,909
I am,
and I've got a card.

107
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,939
Why don't I just leave that
in your purse?

108
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,070
In case you change your mind

109
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,972
about helping me out
with Harvey Specter.

What are you working on?

122
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,449
I'm just trying to figure out
what Gibbs is gonna do next,

123
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,580
figure out
how to fight it.

124
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,219
Is there anything
I can do to help?

125
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,719
Yeah, you can tell me
what your father said

126
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,189
you should do about me.

127
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,190
How would that help?

128
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,699
Because I can't
really focus on this

129
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,299
while I'm worrying
about that.

130
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,669
He told me to look
in the mirror.

131
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,739
And?

132
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,939
How do you expect him
to react, Mike?

133
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,339
He's angry and he's hurt,
and--

134
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,639
Rachel.

135
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,500
He told me
to get rid of you.

136
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,909
Good.

137
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,210
Why good?

138
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,819
Because you told me
that you would stay with me

139
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,819
no matter what, and when you
keep things like that from me,

140
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,680
it makes me wonder.

141
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,490
But when you tell me and
I see that look in your eyes,

142
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,570
I don't.

143
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,060
Mr. Litt,
I'm all settled in.

144
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,399
I just wanted to say

145
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,899
that I'm so thrilled to be
a part of your te--

146
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,960
Yeah, you're happy
as a clam.

147
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,200
Let's get one thing
straight.

148
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,079
You may have filled
Donna's shoes with Harvey,

149
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,245
but it's not gonna be that easy
filling them with me.

150
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:29,909
Well, if that's how
you want to play it.

151
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,570
I already know that.
I heard all about you.

152
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,940
Yeah?
From Donna?

153
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,019
From Norma.

154
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,419
What?

155
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,420
You knew Norma?

156
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,180
Damn Skippy.

157
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,625

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,370
I've been trying to get
into that game forever.

162
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,660
You know she kept you out,
right?

163
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,369
Ah--

164
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,599
Norma did that to me?

165
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,830
Well, I can't say
as I blame her.

166
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,180
Said it was her only
peaceful night of the week.

167
00:06:57,181 --> 00:07:00,000
30 seconds in,
I can see what she means.

168
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,179
But you could
turn this around.

169
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,749
Play your tiles right with me,
I could put in a word for you.

170
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,049
Oh, anything you could do
would be so appreciated.

171
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,310
Yeah.
That's more like it.

172
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,380
I can do even better.

173
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,589
Please, make yourself at home.
Take the day.

174
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,820
Well, in that case,
I'll see you tomorrow morning,

175
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,230
bright and early.

176
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,400
You're here.
I am.

177
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,670
It's good to have you back,
Harvey.

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,309
Good to be back,
Donna.

179
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,740
All right,
enough sentimentality.

180
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,979
I need you to--

181
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,880
Clear your schedule for
the next two months? Done.

182
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,289
I also gave half your business
to the partners that backed you

183
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,959
and the rest
to Jessica and Louis.

184
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,159
I didn't ask you
to do that.

185
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,689
No, you asked me
to come back to your desk.

186
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,420
I sure as hell did.

187
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,699
What's next?

188
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,029
What's next is,
get Mike into this office,

189
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,490
and I don't want him wearing
casual clothes;

190
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,330
I want him
with his Superman outfit on.

191
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,569
He's gonna need
a hell of a lot more

192
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,230
than a cape and some tights,
because I just got

193
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,539
a special delivery
from the U.S. Attorney's office.

194
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,370
Don't tell me;
she's issued subpoenas

195
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,979
for every case
Mike's ever touched.

196
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,620
She issued subpoenas
for anything

197
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,410
anyone at this firm
has ever touched.

198
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,619
What does that mean?

199
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,389
It means they're not just
after Mike anymore.

200
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,259
They're officially
coming after all of us.

201
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,330
Mike's already here.
I'll get him.

202
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,359
I'm telling you, Harvey,
this move is no joke.

203
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,590
That woman gets in the door,
she will find something

204
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,699
to pressure someone into saying
whatever she wants,

205
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,899
and I'll be damned if I'll
let her rifle through my house.

206
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,100
What exactly
are you saying?

207
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,409
I'm saying we need
outside counsel.

208
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,779
Absolutely not.
There's nobody we can trust.

209
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,379
There is one person
we can trust,

210
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,449
because you already told her
Mike's goddamn secret.

211
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,749
Jessica, I am not bringing
Scottie into this thing.

212
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,119
I'm telling you
I can handle this.

213
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,089
You don't even have a strategy
to stop these subpoenas.

214
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,619
Well, then I guess
it's a good thing I do.

215
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,550
Well, then why don't you stop
patting yourself on the back

216
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,929
and start telling me
what the hell it is?

217
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,229
We go on offense.

218
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,699
What exactly
does that mean?

219
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,129
It means that
we don't have to prove

220
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,729
that she can't subpoena
our records;

221
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,629
she has to prove
that she can.

222
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,190
And she doesn't have
a shred of evidence

223
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,560
proving that you knew
about me.

224
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,269
If she got those subpoenas
in the first place,

225
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,530
she must have something.

226
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,009
Wrong, I worked
in the D.A.'s office

227
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,639
for five years.

228
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,600
Judges give out subpoenas
like candy.

229
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,740
Then I suggest the two of you
get the hell on down there

230
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,920
and take
that woman's candy away.

231
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,589
The fact is, Your Honor,
she has no grounds

232
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,419
to even issue these things
in the first place.

233
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,650
What is he even
doing here?

234
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,730
I'm here
because I'm a lawyer

235
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,280
and I'm innocent
until proven guilty.

236
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,050
And those subpoenas aren't
about coming after me;

237
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,520
they're about
coming after him.

238
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,970
You're damn right they are,
because there's no way

239
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,360
he didn't know
you're a fraud.

240
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,999
Where exactly is your evidence
of either one of those things?

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,599
I see. They're not trying
to fight these subpoenas.

242
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,430
They're trying to get me to turn
over whatever evidence I have,

243
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,879
which I don't have to do
for another three weeks.

244
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,879
You'll do whatever I say
you have to do.

245
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,279
Now, I want to know
what started this whole thing.

246
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,349
We received an anonymous email
from a reputable source.

247
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,389
Yeah, and a stranger
called me the other day

248
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,789
saying you killed
six people.

249
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,389
Can I subpoena her bank records?

250
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,659
You think this is
a joke?

251
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,130
You're damn right
this isn't a joke.

252
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,220
I'm being accused of a crime
based on some bullshit email

253
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,529
no one's even seen.

254
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,629
I'd ask if you have that email
on you, Ms. Gibbs,

255
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,929
but I wouldn't want to put you
in the position of lying to me,

256
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,190
so let's have it.

This is from a general
Harvard faculty address.

259
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:26,340
It is. We are working
on tracking down the sender.

260
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,719
Well, you'd better
find them,

261
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,789
because without
corroborating testimony,

262
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,989
I'll not only quash
these subpoenas;

263
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,789
I'll toss the entire case.

Son of a bitch.
It's Henry Gerard.

266
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,390
Harvey, if Gerard was gonna
say something,

267
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,699
why would he wait
until now?

268
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,260
I don't know,
but it's the only goddamn person

269
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,469
it could be.

270
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,569
All right, then I'm gonna
go see him.

271
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,800
And do what?

272
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,139
I'm gonna get to him
before Gibbs does,

273
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,130
get him to recant.

274
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,400
This isn't testimony.

275
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,179
It's a tip to a crime
you actually committed.

276
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,249
I don't care.
We have leverage on Gerard.

277
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,349
Were you in there?

278
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,485
This woman has her sights
on both of us.

279
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,340
You go up to Boston,
she's gonna have people

280
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,780
crawling all over Harvard,

281
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,419
and you're gonna be the one
who led her to Gerard.

282
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,380
I can't just sit here and wait
for the sword to drop.

283
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,489
Wait a second.

284
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,650
You can't go there,
I can't go there,

285
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,060
but I know someone
who can.

286
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,060
Jessica.

287
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,409
I was wondering when you were
gonna show up at my door.

288
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,809
So you've heard
about Mike Ross.

289
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,609
Oh, everybody's heard
about Mike Ross.

290
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,979
Now I finally know what you were
hiding from me the whole time.

291
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,609
But what I don't know
is how the hell

292
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,810
you let something like this
happen in the first place.

293
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,889
We'll talk about that
in a minute.

294
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,989
But I'm not just here
to apologize

295
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,889
for what happened between us.

296
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,789
I'm here to ask for your help.

297
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,720
You want me to represent
the firm.

298
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,170
If it comes to it,
I want you to represent me.

299
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,369
You got a lot of nerve
coming in here to ask me that.

300
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,799
Jeff, please.

301
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,500
I made the mistake
of not trusting you once.

302
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,839
I don't want to make
that same mistake again.

303
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,470
Then you're gonna have to tell
me the truth about everything

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
right now, and it's not
gonna be protected

305
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:05,140
by attorney-client privilege,

306
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,790
and you're gonna have to trust
that I'm not gonna turn you in.

307
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,380
I was never worried that
you were gonna turn me in.

308
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,159
I was worried about
putting you in a position

309
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,159
where you had to lie.

310
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,029
But I was ready to tell you
that night anyway,

311
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,100
so I might as well
tell you now.

312
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,250
Rachel,
what's going on?

313
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,600
I just got a call.

314
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,670
They took Donna down to
the U.S. Attorney's office.

315
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,120
We have to get down there
right now.

316
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,010
No, we don't.
I'm gonna take care of her.

317
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,989
You go ahead and do what
we were gonna do together.

318
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,689
Harvey, Donna getting
taken in changes everything.

319
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,559
It changes nothing,
so stop talking to me

320
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,490
and do what you
have to do.

321
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,169
- It was Henry Gerard.
- What?

322
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,739
The person who handed me in
was Henry Gerard.

323
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,139
It was an anonymous email.

324
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,309
No way. How would he even know
that you're not a lawyer?

325
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,709
That case we took last year,
he figured it out.

326
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,549
Well, then why would he wait
to turn you in now?

327
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,949
I don't know,
but what I do know is,

328
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,979
you need to get up there and you
need to get him to take it back.

329
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,440
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

330
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,919
That's what you and I are
gonna figure out right now.

331
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,919
Wait a second.
Where's Harvey?

332
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,659
He's got an important
meeting that--

333
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,830
What could be
more important than this?

334
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Louis,
it's a personal matter--

335
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,789
Where is he?

336
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,390
They brought Donna in
for questioning.

337
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,999
Goddamn it, this is
what I was afraid of.

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,229
I'm heading down there
right now.

339
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,720
Louis--Louis,
listen to me.

340
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,229
They're gonna try and put
pressure on Donna

341
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,560
to turn on Harvey,
and the best way

342
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,139
to make that pressure go away
is to make Gerard go away,

343
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,239
which can make this whole case
go away.

344
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,770
Give me the goddamn email.

345
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,740
Now, before you go up there,
we're gonna--

346
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,249
I'm sorry.
Wait a second.

347
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,149
Why would someone who knows
you're guilty

348
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,880
call you
a "potential" fraud?

349
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,119
I-I don't know.

350
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,419
He's trying
to cover his ass somehow.

351
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,520
"A potential fraud besmirching
the sacrosanct name

352
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,029
of hallowed
Harvard University"--

353
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,100
Louis, we really don't
have time for this. Please.

354
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,240
Mike, I know who wrote
this email.

355
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,010
It's not Henry Gerard.

356
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,270
Excuse me, miss.

357
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,420
Are you alone, or can
an old man pull up a seat?

358
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,040
Hi, Dad.
Oh.

359
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,719
So have you
looked over the deal?

360
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,880
I have.

361
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,829
And you see the potential
I'm talking about?

362
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,200
It's a great project.

363
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:33,529
But?

364
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,629
I'm not sure
how wise it is

365
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,060
for you to get
back into development.

366
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,539
I understand you would
feel that way

367
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,810
after what it did to you,
but--

368
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,700
I feel that way
because of what it did to you.

369
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,009
Donna, I told you.

370
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,779
The banks are crazy for
this kind of thing right now.

371
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,609
All I need is $250,000.

372
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,309
I can get a loan
five times the size.

373
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,110
I don't know; that just
sounds really risky.

374
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,949
Aren't you always telling me
that Harvey says

375
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,789
if you want to get ahead,
you need to take risks?

376
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,289
That's why
you came to me.

377
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,729
You're not looking for my money;
you're looking for Harvey's.

378
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,489
It would just be
to secure the loan.

379
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,090
After the bank gives me
the money, he's free and clear.

380
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,499
Harvey's never gonna
go for that.

381
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,069
I mean, even I know
that's not legal.

382
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,040
Donna, people do
this kind of thing all the time.

383
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,060
It's a sleight of hand,
nothing more.

384
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,069
Dad, you're doing fine.

385
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,970
Do you really need to risk
everything again?

386
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,379
Donna, I manage
a real estate office.

387
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,249
Everybody there makes more.
Everybody there is doing better.

388
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,449
I used to be better.

389
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,980
I know I can do this.

390
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,059
Please, all you have to do
is ask Harvey.

391
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,090
If he says no,
he says no.

392
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,169
Dad, I'm so sorry.

393
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,099
Don't worry, sweetie.

394
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,239
People have tried to rattle
my cage plenty of times.

395
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,309
It's never worked before,
and it's not gonna work now.

396
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,839
That's what I told her.
You're gonna be okay.

397
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,270
Donna, can you
give us a minute?

398
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,079
Harvey...

399
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,540
Yeah?

400
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,089
They're saying
this has to do with that deal

401
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,519
I talked to you about
seven years ago.

402
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,619
And?

403
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,559
Is there something
you're not telling me?

404
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,989
The only thing
I haven't told you

405
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,120
is that I'm gonna get him
out of this, no matter what.

406
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,705
What the hell did you do?

407
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:21,130
What are you
talking about?

408
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,880
They didn't bring you in here
if you didn't do something

409
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,530
seven years ago, and if
I'm gonna get you out of this,

410
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,970
I need to know
what you did.

411
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,009
I did what
everybody else did.

412
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,370
I inflated my collateral
because you shut me down,

413
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,540
so don't come in here telling me
this is my fault.

414
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,249
I shut you down
to protect Donna

415
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,810
from getting involved
in exactly something like this.

416
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,319
This is on you,
not on me.

417
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,150
Well, aren't you
high and mighty,

418
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,859
coming in here accusing me
of putting my daughter at risk

419
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,190
when the whole reason
she's in the position she's in

420
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,669
is because of
something you did?

421
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,899
That's right.

422
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,299
They told me this is
because they're trying

423
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,460
to get Donna to testify
against you,

424
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,639
and they want me to help them
get her to do it.

425
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,239
Then why don't you?

426
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,170
Because I know
it would kill her,

427
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,549
and no matter what
you may think,

428
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,050
I would never do anything
to hurt my daughter.

429
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,589
Did you talk to Donna?

430
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,759
I talked to Harvey, and
he said it's gonna be f--

431
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
I don't care what he says.

432
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
What are they
coming after her for?

433
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:14,859
Mike, Harvey asked me
not to--

434
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,629
Rachel, what are they
coming after her for?

435
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,299
They're not coming after her
for anything.

436
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,670
They're coming
after her father.

437
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,060
What?

438
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,569
Turns out he was involved
in some sort of real estate deal

439
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,699
and they're saying it wasn't
on the up-and-up.

440
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,769
Goddamn it!

441
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,099
Mike, calm down.
It's nothing.

442
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,630
Harvey's gonna get them
out of it.

443
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,079
Look, it's really
just a minor violation,

444
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,510
and no one would even care
if it weren't for--

445
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,020
Me. You were just about to say
if it weren't for me.

446
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,021
- Mike, I--
- That's it.

447
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,149
I'm pleading guilty.

448
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,319
I'm gonna take
the reduced sentence,

449
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
I'm gonna do the time,
and all of this

450
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,619
is gonna go away
once and for all.

451
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,489
That's not an option,
and you know it.

452
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,459
The only reason
they went after Donna's dad

453
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,989
is to get to Harvey
and Jessica.

454
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,550
If you plead guilty, all you're
gonna do is help them do that,

455
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,620
so you're either gonna
turn on the two of them

456
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,599
or you're gonna fight this thing
out till the end.

457
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,069
We need to talk.

458
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,099
About what?

459
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,299
About what we're
going to do

460
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,460
if that prosecutor
gets ahold of those subpoenas.

461
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,869
You mean what we're gonna do
about the letter that Mike has

462
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,470
that proves you knew
he was a fraud.

463
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,009
Yes, that's what I mean.

464
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,440
I'm assuming you were
smart enough

465
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,249
to destroy that thing
the second they let you out.

466
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,890
And I'm assuming you
destroyed the affidavit

467
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,880
that you had Rachel sign saying
she knew the truth about me.

468
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,689
I didn't,

469
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,059
but I had the same conversation
with Louis, we worked it out,

470
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,159
and I'm here to tell you

471
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,330
I will get rid of mine
if you get rid of yours.

472
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,799
I knew it;
you're actually considering

473
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,499
turning your back
on me and Harvey.

474
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,969
I'm not turning my back
on anyone,

475
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,539
but we both know
you've done some things

476
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,069
that make me question
whether or not I can trust you.

477
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,600
Well, then,
the least you can do

478
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,079
is find the time to speak
with my attorney

479
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,750
before that ruling
comes down.

480
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:41,840
Your attorney?

481
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,849
I'm sure
you've heard of him.

482
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,750
His name's Jeff Malone.

483
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,550
You're even lower
than I thought you were,

484
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,259
and I didn't even think
that was possible.

485
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,729
Coming from someone
with your moral compass,

486
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,959
I take that
as a compliment.

487
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,995
What gives you the right

488
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:58,590
to come after
my secretary's father?

489
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,729
I'm not the one
prosecuting him.

490
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,269
It just so happens that
one of my colleagues

491
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,769
is going after him on
a completely unrelated matter.

492
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,569
Bullshit, the only reason
you're doing this

493
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,909
is to put pressure on Donna
to come after me.

494
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,239
Well, now that you mention it,
the judge did say

495
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,745
I needed something tying you
to Mike Ross's fraud

496
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,139
in order to get
those subpoenas,

497
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,070
and maybe that something
is Donna Paulsen.

498
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
I should ask her.

499
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,219
You already did ask her,

500
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,449
and now you're
manufacturing

501
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,549
a bullshit case
against an innocent man,

502
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,449
and I'm gonna make sure
you pay for it.

503
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,310
He's not in here
because of what I did.

504
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,219
He's in here
because of what you did.

505
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,750
So instead of blaming me,
take a look in the mirror,

506
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,699
'cause all you have to do
is admit what you did,

507
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,470
and all of this
goes away.

What I want to know is why.

517
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,530
I got a call
about an article

518
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,675
on Mike Ross's meteoric rise
to junior partner.

519
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,900
Problem is, I remember

520
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,050
every student
that's ever gone here,

521
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:23,509
and there is no Mike Ross,

522
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,879
so I double-checked
my file room,

523
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,140
and then I sent this.

524
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,210
Sheila, you are
messing with my firm.

525
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,959
Why didn't you
come to me first?

526
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,689
Because it didn't occur to me
that I had to.

527
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,529
That is bullshit!

528
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,329
You reported it
anonymously

529
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,599
because you didn't want
to look bad.

530
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,170
You didn't trust me
to keep you out of it.

531
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:42,729
No, I reported it
anonymously

532
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,560
because I was ashamed that
it happened on my watch,

533
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,169
but I'm not gonna stand by
while somebody besmirches

534
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,169
the good name
of Harvard University.

535
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,400
You have no proof that
Mike Ross besmirched anything.

536
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,279
Why are you
defending this lowlife?

537
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,579
Because if you'd
come to me first,

538
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,179
I could have stopped
this whole thing from happening.

539
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh, my God.

540
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,719
You knew.

541
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,620
Sheila, please, you don't
know him like I know him.

542
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,399
What exactly are you
doing here, Louis?

543
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,470
I want you to retract
that email.

544
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:18,190
Tell 'em that you made
a mistake; you found the file.

545
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,799
I can't do that.

546
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,230
Sheila, please.

547
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,079
When we broke up,
I forced myself to accept it,

548
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,479
because ultimately I knew
we wanted different things,

549
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,519
but it killed me, because I also
knew that we were soul mates.

550
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,359
But the fact that you're
asking me to do this...

551
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,430
We are not soul mates.

552
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,299
I'm begging you.

553
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,869
At least don't
come forward.

554
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,940
I never was gonna
come forward, Louis.

555
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,140

It's just, last year
my life was in Harvey's hands,

568
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,900
and he told me that my worrying
about what would happen

569

if he lost would only make it
more likely for him to lose.

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,679
if it comes down to it,
what will you do?

Because if it
comes down to it,

579
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,720
you want Mike to consider
turning on Harvey.

Excuse me?

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,569
Do you think
that I don't know

589
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,970
that all your problems
are solved

590
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,479
if I tell them
that Harvey did this?

591
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,415
No, Donna, all of my problems
are solved if Mike tells them.

592
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,970
But, yes, my life gets
a whole lot better

593
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,910
if Harvey takes responsibility
for what he did.

594
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,089
What he did was
give Mike a chance

595
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,389
to make something
of himself.

596
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,689
Which is why Mike's never
gonna turn on him.

597
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,059
But you know what?

598
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,595
I would be lying if I said
it didn't cross my mind

599
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:25,720
that maybe Mike should think
about making a deal.

600
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,999
And you can't tell me that
since they picked up your father

601
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,799
that the thought hasn't
crossed yours too.

602
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,799
Well, thinking about it
and talking about it

603
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,430
aren't the same thing,

604
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,510
and right now, I'm focusing

And?

609

She's not gonna

610

00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,289
Oh, what the hell
do you think she said?

612
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,150
Said she knows you're a fraud,
she's not gonna take it back,

613
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,020
and now that she's figured out
that I've been a part of it,

614
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,460
she can't stand
the sight of me.

All right, then we need
to think of something else--

Oh, did you just hear
what I just said?

617
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,260

What do you want me
to do about that?

621
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,879
I don't know, but if she
doesn't retract that email

622
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
and they find her--

00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,219
No, they're not gonna
find her,

624
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,549
because she sent it
from a general faculty email

625
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,489
because she's ashamed of herself
like she's ashamed of me.

626
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,259
And this is all your fault,
so get the hell out of my office

627
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,230
instead of trying to figure out
a way to cover your goddamn ass!

628
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,199
You can believe this or not,
Louis, but right this second,

629
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,029
I'm actually looking out
for Donna.

630
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,299
I'm sorry, Mike.

631
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,900
Right this second,
I cannot help you.

632
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,650
Good, you're here.

633
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:55,049
Listen, I need you
to take care of--

634
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,449
Before we get
to the game plan,

635
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,780
I need to know what's going on
with Donna's father.

636
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,790
I'm taking care of it.

637
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,959
Did you get Louis
to go see Gerard?

638
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,059
It wasn't Gerard.
It was Sheila Sazs.

639
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,689
You gotta be kidding me.

640
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,150
Louis told his girlfriend
about you?

641
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,790
No, Harvey, you told
your girlfriend about me.

642
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,469
Louis risked his neck
to get Sheila

643
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,569
to take that email back
to save our asses.

644
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,039
What are you
so bent out of shape for?

645
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,939
I'm bent out of shape
because he couldn't do it,

646
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,880
and on top of that, Donna's dad
is only in this mess

647
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:20,300
because of what we did,
and you won't let me help.

648
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,979
That's right, Mike;
I won't let you help,

649
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,249
because you're
under investigation

650
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,549
for being a fraud.

651
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,949
You're under investigation
too, and if we're

652
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,749
supposed to act like there's
nothing to be ashamed of,

653
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,810
then let's act like there's
nothing to be ashamed of.

654
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,519
Okay, that's all
well and good, Mike,

655
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,150
but I'm the one representing
Donna's father, not you,

656
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,429
which means I'm the only one
with a credible reason

657
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,000
to pay a visit to the banker
that gave him

658
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,250
that shitty loan
in the first place.

659
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,920

Right now,
the best thing you can do

663
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,630
is think about what
we're gonna do

664
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,779
if they put it together
about Louis's girlfriend,

665
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,079

we're in deep shit.

How did you find me here?

669
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,870
I remember
every game you have

670
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,315
from our work
on your case.

671
00:26:29,316 --> 00:26:30,970
And I knew I had to find you
at a place

672
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,140
where we couldn't be bothered
by anyone from Harvard.

673
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,589
Because everyone from Harvard
now knows you didn't go there.

674
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,060
Which is why I need
someone from Harvard

675
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:38,250
to tell them
that I did.

676
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,489
Are you crazy?

677
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,789
No, I'm smart.

678
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,350
All they have is
an anonymous tip

679
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,759
and no corroborating
evidence.

680
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,320
You sign this affidavit saying
that I was in your class,

681
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,729
their whole case
gets dismissed.

682
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,760
And what if it doesn't?

683
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,269
Then I go to trial.

684
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,439
This is reasonable doubt.

685
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,210
I get acquitted,
they can never try me again.

686
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,830
Or it's not reasonable doubt,
you don't get acquitted,

687
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,239
and I go to jail
for perjury.

688
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,039
I remember when you were
willing to commit perjury

689
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,340
and we didn't just stop you;
we saved your ass.

690
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,179
I don't care. I'm not
risking everything for you.

691
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,679
This isn't just for me,
all right?

692
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,780
They are coming after everyone
that I care about.

693
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,019
I feel for you, Mike,

694
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,050
which is why I never turned
you in in the first place,

695
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,729
but I can't do
what you're asking.

696
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,299
And what if I
anonymously told Harvard

697
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,199
that you took a bribe
from a student for a grade?

698
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,239
You willing to bet everything
that I won't do that?

699
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,199
You do what you have to do,

700
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,760
but I'm not putting
my life in jeopardy

701
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,600
by signing
that goddamn thing.

702
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,479
Wait a minute,
wait, wait.

703
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,020
What if I had a way
that you could help me

704
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,470
without having to
perjure yourself?

705
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,440
And how exactly
would I do that?

706
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,919
It's right
in your wheelhouse.

707
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,460
We're playing poker too.

708
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,050
I just--

709
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,090
I just need you
to help me bluff.

710
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,999
Harvey, I need to ask you
to do something.

711
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,729
Of course, Donna.
I'd do anything for you.

712
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,590
Well, it isn't for me.
It's for my father.

713
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,760
He wanted to know
if you would consider

714
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,269
investing
in his real estate project.

715
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,430
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

716
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,970
You just said that you would
do anything for me.

717
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,849
I meant I'd consider anything,
and I just did.

718
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,379
You haven't even
looked at it.

719
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,610
I don't need to.

720
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,755
You're family to me,
he's family to you,

721
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:17,980
and you don't invest money
with family.

722
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,059
That's not what you said

723
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,389
when Marcus needed money
for his restaurant.

724
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,050
- That's different.
- Why?

725
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,300
Because Marcus actually knew
what the hell he was doing.

726
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,629
You know what, Harvey?

727
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,229
If you don't want to invest,
don't invest,

728
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,730
but I don't need
a lecture from you

729
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,710
on what a bad businessman
my father is.

730
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,069
Yes, you do.

731
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,130
Oh, really?
Why's that?

732
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,570
Because if I know you,

733
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,809
you're thinking of giving him
access to your 401.

734
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,140
So? What if I am?

735
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,919
Donna, this man lost
your family's money once.

736
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,549
You're gonna give him
the chance to do it again?

737
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,819
Harvey,
this man is my father,

738
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,859
and he has been there for me
my whole life.

739
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,059
And I know what happened
between you and your mother,

740
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,989
but don't you judge him
for what she did.

741
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,450
How dare you? This has
nothing to do with that.

742
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,220
You have a blind spot
when it comes to him.

743
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,429
I'm trying to protect you.

744
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,460
Well, you're not.
You're being an asshole.

745
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,869
And for your information,
keeping me from being there

746
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,769
for my father
isn't protecting me.

747
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,170
It's pissing me
the hell off.

748
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,519
Good, Donna, you're here.
Look, I need you to--

749
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,549
The only thing I need is
for you to tell me what you did,

750
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,780
because I just found out
that they're

751
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,959
formally charging my father
with bank fraud tomorrow.

752
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,859
Goddamn it.

753
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,159
What did you do?

754
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,229
All I did was
strong-arm a banker.

755
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,399
And why the hell would you
need to strong-arm a banker?

756
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,635
Because he had evidence
that needed to get lost.

757
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:38,590
I knew there was something
you weren't telling me.

758
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,599
What the hell happened
seven years ago?

759
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,930
What happened is,
you came to me

760
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,339
asking a favor for your father,
so I went to him

761
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,800
asking a favor of my own.

762
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,849
Bullshit.
You don't ask people for favors.

763
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,479
You force them to do things!

764
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,715
You're goddamn right I do.

765
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:52,679
I told your father
if he took your money,

766
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,240
I'd pull every string I have
to shut his deal down.

767
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,119
You had no right
to do that.

768
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,880
I don't care if I had
a right to do it or not.

769
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,420
I wasn't gonna let you
lose everything

770
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,100
just because you couldn't see
the truth about him.

771
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:06,090
The truth is, you went
behind my back,

772
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,529
and then he did
something illegal,

773
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,929
and now I have to choose
between you and him

774
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,160
because of what you did!

775
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,469
What I did was keep you

776
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,869
from being involved
in this mess.

777
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,769
No, Harvey, what you did
was start this mess

778
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,370
the day you went ahead
and hired a fraud.

779
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,449
What happened?

780
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,310
They're formally charging
Donna's father,

781
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,619
and we need to figure out a way
to get his case thrown out.

782
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,380
Well, then we have to get
my case thrown out,

783
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,820
because then they won't care
about Donna's dad.

784
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,199
And how the hell are we
gonna do that?

785
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,559
I went to see Gerard.

786
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,190
God damn it, didn't I
tell you not to do that?

787
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,840
That was before we knew
he wasn't the one

788
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,160
that tipped them off.

789
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,405
If he wasn't the one
who tipped them off,

790
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:49,730
what the hell
did you go to him for?

791
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,440
I went to him for this.

792
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,310
This is a vaguely worded
statement.

793
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,589
It doesn't even specifically say
you went to Harvard.

794
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,889
It doesn't have to.

795
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,819
It says that he's known me
to be an amazing lawyer,

796
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,180
that I've shown mastery
of the material that he teaches,

797
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,520
and that as far
as he's concerned,

798
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,129
I'm an outstanding student
of the law.

799
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,299
It's total bullshit.

800
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,759
It's not total bullshit,
all right?

801
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,320
If they don't find Sheila
and we do this,

802
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,660
we could get
the whole case thrown out.

803
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,299
Gibbs'll see
right through this.

804
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,460
She'll put Gerard on the stand,
and she'll ask him point blank

805
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,869
if he knows for a fact
that you never went to Harvard,

806
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,630
and we'll have signed
our own death warrant.

807
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,100
She's not gonna do that,
because it violates

808
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,509
the number one rule of being
a lawyer that you taught me:

809
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,470
don't ask a question that
you don't have the answer to.

810
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,610
It's too big a risk.

811
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,285
Harvey, Donna's dad
is at risk,

812
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:35,010
and he's at risk
because of me.

813
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,089
The only way to get him out
is to have me to turn on you

814
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,789
or for us to get
this whole thing thrown out,

815
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,489
so are you on board
with this or not?

816
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,389
We better pray
this bullshit works,

817
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,150
because, if it doesn't,
at least one of us

818
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,620
is gonna end up
in prison tomorrow.

819
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,629
All right,
what are we doing here?

820
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,330
Your Honor, we have a motion
to dismiss Mike Ross's case.

821
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,439
On what grounds?

822
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,009
On the grounds that
I have a letter here

823
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,239
from Professor Henry Gerard
of Harvard Law

824
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,170
saying that Mike Ross
was in his class.

825
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,349
This is ridiculous.

826
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,079
Even if Mr. Ross
were in that class,

827
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,810
it doesn't mean
he was matriculated.

828
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,355
You still haven't shown
any evidence that he wasn't,

829
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:12,280
which is why that document
should get this case dismissed.

830
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,759
This document is

831
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,229
a cryptically worded
piece of shit,

832
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,559
and you're a man
who has a reputation

833
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,629
for crossing the line.

834
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,429
Ms. Gibbs, language.
What are you implying?

835
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,120
Your Honor,
there's a good chance

836
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,760
he coerced this Professor Gerard
into signing this thing.

837
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,139
So our exhibits are
all from blackmail,

838
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,575
but yours are squeaky clean
because you're Mother Teresa?

839
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:31,930
I may not be
Mother Teresa,

840
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,970
but I don't resort to coercion
to get my evidence.

841
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,079
Then what exactly
are you doing

842
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,279
with Donna Paulsen's father?

843
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,879
Care to tell me
what he's talking about?

844
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,779
I'll tell you.
She fabricated a charge

845
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,210
against an innocent businessman
to pressure my secretary

846
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,489
into giving false testimony
against me.

847
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,989
Your Honor,
it's standard practice

848
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,289
to find leverage
against a vital witness.

849
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,689
Oh, is it also standard
practice to have

850
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,120
a federal marshal rough me up
in a holding cell?

851
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,635
Ms. Gibbs, if I find out
there's an abuse of power here,

852
00:32:56,636 --> 00:32:58,660
I will be switching
my focus to you.

853
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,905
Then before you rule
on their motion,

854
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:02,060
the state has the right

855
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,430
to question
this Professor Gerard.

856
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,520
Your Honor, can Ms. Gibbs
and I have a minute alone?

857
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,940
Please.

858
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,849
You think I don't know this
letter is complete bullshit?

859
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,310
I pull this clown
up on the stand,

860
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,889
he's gonna tell me
the truth in a minute.

861
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,459
Okay,
this clown is one of

862
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,229
the most distinguished ethics
professors in the country.

863
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,259
You put him up there,
this case is over for you

864
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,520
before you even get started.

865
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,129
Then why the hell
isn't he here right now

866
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,290
verifying this thing?

867
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,299
Because that kid cares
more about Donna Paulsen

868
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,669
than he does about himself.

869
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,039
What do you want?

870
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,780
I want to make a deal--
that letter for Donna's father.

871
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,770
This is too good for you.

872
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,279
If you really had Gerard,
he'd be down here right now.

873
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,779
If it were up to me,
he'd be down here right now,

874
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,510
but this is Mike's call.

875
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,319
This is a one-time offer,
and the clock's ticking.

876
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,855
You still get to go
to trial,

877
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:52,980
we get Donna and her father
off limits,

878
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,989
and we both live
to fight another day.

879
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,689
I want my subpoenas too.

880
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,420
No way.
Judge said no.

881
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,429
You try to pull this thing
out at trial,

882
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,090
I will rip your professor friend
to shreds.

883
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,179
Your Honor, Ms. Gibbs and I
have come to an agreement.

884
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,809
She's dropping all charges
against James Paulsen,

885
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,010
and we withdraw
our motion to dismiss.

886
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,859
See you next week.

887
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,989
Nice club.

888
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,089
Are you new?

889
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,920
Just visiting.
Not much of a golfer.

890
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,259
Unfortunately,
neither am I.

891
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,590
Harvey Specter.

892
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,959
Jim Paulsen.

893
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,520
I assume this is
about the opportunity

894
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,960
Donna brought you.

895
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,599
It'd be an opportunity
if the numbers added up, Jim,

896
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,860
but they don't.

897
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,639
I don't understand.

898
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,880
I thought you were
the type of man

899
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:43,230
that was willing
to take risks.

900
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,539
I am--but not if it puts
people I care about in jeopardy,

901
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,900
which is why I'm here
to tell you

902
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,210
that when Donna
offers you her 401,

903
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,790
you're gonna tell her
you don't need it anymore.

904
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,480
No offense, Mr. Specter,
but what my daughter does

905
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,319
with her money is
none of your business.

906
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,580
Well, it became my business
when Donna put you

907
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,859
so far up on a pedestal
that she couldn't smell

908
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,359
the bullshit
you were dishing out.

909
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,859
It's not bullshit.

910
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,390
Yes, it is.
I looked at that deal.

911
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,199
There's no way you're getting
the kind of money you need

912
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,735
without doing
something shady.

913
00:35:08,736 --> 00:35:11,630
Inflating my assets
to get a loan isn't shady.

914
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,069
Everybody does it.

915
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,769
That's what everybody thinks
until the music stops,

916
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,000
which is why if you involve
Donna in this deal,

917
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,179
so help me God, I will pull
every string I have

918
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,349
to tie your project up in court
for the next 20 years.

919
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,119
I'm just trying
to make my way.

920
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,989
All I'm telling you is,
you can make it without Donna.

921
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,329
You act as if you think
I don't love my own daughter.

922
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,589
People who love
other people

923
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,660
don't put them in positions
to break the law.

924
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,760
I just got off the phone
with my dad.

925
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,169
He told me the good news.

926
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,930
I told you
I'd take care of it.

927
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,500
What did you do?

928
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,749
It's not important.

929
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,009
Harvey.

930
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,610
We withdrew our motion
to dismiss Mike's case

931
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,785
in exchange for her
leaving you alone.

932
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:01,240
So I hurt Mike's case.

933
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,480
No, you didn't.

934
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,359
The whole thing was based
on a bluff

935
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,659
that never would have
held up anyway.

936
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,199
This way, we at least got
something for it.

937
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,270
Thank you, Harvey.

938
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,539
And I'm sorry
for what I said.

939
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,069
No.

940
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,609
You were right to say it.

941
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,909
I never should have put you
in this position, Donna.

942
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,449
If you want to go back to work
for Louis, I'll understand.

943
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,349
No, you shouldn't have put me
in that position,

944
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,179
but if I was gonna leave you
for hiring Mike,

945
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,440
the time to do that
would have been years ago.

946
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,859
I hope I'm not interrupting
your premature celebration.

947
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,859
You better not be
reneging on our deal.

948
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,229
Oh, no, I'm gonna honor it.

949
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,599
I just dropped by
to serve you with these.

950
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,240
You and your partners are
hereby subpoenaed

951
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:52,230
to hand over every single
document in the entire firm.

952
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
No.

953
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:54,669
No way the judge
granted that

954
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,230
just because we withdrew
our motion to dismiss.

955
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,470
She didn't.

956
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,509
She granted it when
a Sheila Sazs from Harvard

957
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,679
came forward and said she wrote
that anonymous email.

958
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,879
That's right, Mr. Specter.

959
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,580
Your chances of winning
this case just took

960
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,660
a mighty big turn
for the worse.

961
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,090
What are you doing here?

962
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,140
You never came
to see me,

963
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:23,830
so I thought I would
come to you

964
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,169
and find out why
you're so willing

965
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,605
to let all those
dangerous letters

966
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:28,330
just keep floating around
out there.

967
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,839
I think you mean letters that
are dangerous to your client.

968
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,200
Well, I'm holding one
right here

969
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,109
that puts your woman
in a world of trouble, Mike,

970
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,509
so no, no, I don't.

971
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,070
Oh, I get it.

972
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,910
I didn't crumble to Jessica,
so now you're here

973
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,260
to take a shot at
strong-arming me into a trade.

974
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,350
No, see,
I came to see why,

975
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,059
when the woman that's been
protecting you for so long

976
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,989
asks you for a simple
gesture of trust,

977
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,459
you seem to think that all she's
doing is protecting herself.

978
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,020
Because she is
protecting herself.

979
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,760
You're goddamn right
that's what she's doing,

980
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,139
but that's not all
she's doing,

981
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,310
because from the second
that she found out about you,

982
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,100
she's had to lie for you,

983
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,439
and she still treated you
like family,

984
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,070
and it cost her
everything.

985
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,549
Give me a break. Until now,
it didn't cost her anything.

986
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,809
You better watch yourself.

987
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,810
What the hell
are you doing?

988
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:12,880
It cost her
her relationship with me!

989
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,820
You didn't know about that,
did you?

990
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,160
Well, now you do.

991
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,169
So you'll destroy that
if I give you mine?

992
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm an attorney.
I can't destroy evidence.

993
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,680
But you?
You can do whatever you want.

994
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,140
You trust me to do that?

995
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,010
No, Mike.

996
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,920
Jessica does.

997
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,669
Louis, I need you
to sit down.

998
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,230
What is it?
What happened?

999
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,839
Is your father okay?
I'll go down there right now.

1000
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,270
He's fine.
Harvey took care of it.

1001
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,849
Oh, well, then I don't need
to sit down.

1002
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,119
'Cause whatever it is,
if you're okay, I'll be okay.

1003
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,219
Sheila came forward.

1004
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,089
What?

1005
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,160
She admitted she was
the one to write the email.

1006
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,529
That's not possible.

1007
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,900
She promised me
she wouldn't do that.

1008
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,420
I'm sorry, Louis,
but she did.

1009
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,499
I need to be alone.

1010
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,300
Louis, I don't think
this is the time for you to--

1011
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,110
I said get out.

1012
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,640
He did it?

1013
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,710
He did.

1014
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,259
What did you say to him?

1015
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,919
I told him
how much it cost you,

1016
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,720
and then I did
what we talked about.

1017
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,999
Well, it's a good thing
you did,

1018
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
because those subpoenas
just came down.

1019
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,839
Jessica, I don't know
that I've ever been

1020
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,809
much of a spiritual person,

1021
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,839
but I would be lying
if I didn't admit

1022
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,900
that sometimes I think
God has a plan.

1023
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,309
What are you saying?

1024
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,270
I'm saying that maybe
he's trying to show you

1025
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,680
that there's more to life
than Pearson Specter Litt.

1026
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,459
I'm not gonna be
your attorney on this one.

1027
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,359
I think you can find
someone better.

1028
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,989
No.

1029
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,390
I trust you,
and there's no way

1030
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,729
I find someone
that I trust more.

1031
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,060
Then find me when
this is all over,

1032
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,310
and we'll see if we can put
that trust to better use.

1033
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,600
Gretchen, whatever it is,
it can wait till tomorrow.

1034
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,940
This can't wait.

1035
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,519
I want to apologize to you.

1036
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,119
For what?

1037
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,519
When Jack Soloff nominated
Mike Ross for partner,

1038
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,620
I know it hurt Harvey
a little,

1039
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,559
because he wanted to be
the one to do it,

1040
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,590
so I called the "ABA Journal"
to write an article about Mike.

1041
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,340
I wanted to surprise Harvey
with it.

1042
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,740
You're saying the article
that tipped Sheila off was you?

1043
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,470
Yes.

1044
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,279
Why are you
telling me this?

1045
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,310
Because I'm sorry.

1046
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,089
And if anyone ever asks,
I'll deny ever saying this,

1047
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,760
but...I know
you all knew.

1048
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,920
And I'm with you.

1049
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,640
Hey.
Hey.

1050
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,909
What's the matter?

1051
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,209
I know I said I don't want you
to keep things from me,

1052
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,679
but I don't want to keep things
from you either.

1053
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,149
What are you
keeping from me?

1054
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,819
It's actually
good and bad news.

1055
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,190
We had a chance to get this
whole case thrown out today,

1056
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,010
and it didn't work,
but we did get Donna off,

1057
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,350
and for the first time,
I actually started to believe

1058
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,629
we can get out of this thing.

1059
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,029
And why were you afraid
to admit that to me?

1060
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:23,029
Because I didn't want to
get your hopes up.

1061
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,230
And I didn't really
believe it before.

1062
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,170
Yeah, what's up?

1063
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,909
Sheila Sazs came forward,

1064
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,349
which means they're gonna
try and pit us all

1065
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,420
against each other
even more.
