1
00:00:01,265 --> 00:00:04,126
When we started this thing
I was just doing it to kiss your ass

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:05,712
so Jessica would forgive me,

3
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:06,747
but you're the real deal.

4
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:08,215
As far as I can tell,
Jack Soloff

5
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,689
is holding up his end
of the bargain.

6
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:10,984
He's doing more than that.

7
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,786
He just sent out
an email nominating you

8
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,054
- for junior partner.
- What?

9
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:15,322
I'm not sending out
a press release

10
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:18,158
announcing Mike Ross of Harvard
just got promoted.

11
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:19,293
What is this?

12
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:20,927
Am I mistaken, or did we
not have this discussion?

13
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:22,534
Don't call me again.

14
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:24,253
You need to tell Louis you've
been sleeping with Esther.

15
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,487
We slept together
one time.

16
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,622
What difference
does that make?

17
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:28,094
You promised him
you wouldn't do it at all.

18
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,294
I need to tell you something.

19
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,063
- You made a promise to me!
- I'm telling you.

20
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,298
Because he's so messed up
from whatever goddamn thing

21
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,633
happened to him in his pathetic
childhood, he can't--

22
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:35,868
Shut the hell up!

23
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:01,076
Get me Jerry Myers
on the phone.

24
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:02,878
Jerry Myers?

25
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,541
- Louis, what happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

26
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:06,676
Harvey took
a goddamn swing at me.

27
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,661
- That's what happened.
- Oh, my God.

28
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:10,817
Yeah, "Oh, my God," I'm gonna
sue the shit out of him.

29
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:12,213
Okay, Louis, you're hurt.

30
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:14,081
The first thing you need to do
is get some ice and calm down.

31
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,217
Did you not just hear me?

32
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,687
He hit me and then he threw me
into a coffee table,

33
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:22,223
so I am going to
sue the shit out of him!

34
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,574
I don't think suing Harvey
is the answer.

35
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,560
Of course you don't,
because you want to protect him

36
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:30,585
like you did when you lied to me
about what he did to Esther.

37
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:33,753
I told Harvey
to tell you himself.

38
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,322
And I lied to you because I knew
something like this would happen

39
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:38,308
if you didn't hear it
directly from him.

40
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:40,693
Well, it did happen, Donna.

41
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:46,199
Now get me Jerry Myers
on the phone.

42
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:48,368
You want me to do that,
I will.

43
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:53,973
But you've always said
we're a family,

44
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,909
and families keep things
like this in the family.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,300
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,641
I'm not sure if
congratulations are in order,

47
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:09,776
but since we
have no other choice,

48
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:12,178
I'm going to choose
congratulations.

49
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,830
- You saw the memo?
- I did.

50
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,215
You're making partner.

51
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,150
No, Rachel, I'm not.

52
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,251
What do you mean?

53
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,954
Jessica told me
to turn it down.

54
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,709
Said it would draw
too much attention to me.

55
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:24,620
That's crazy.

56
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,072
If you turn it down, you'll draw
even more attention to yourself.

57
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:27,240
That's exactly
what I told her.

58
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,574
And what did she say?

59
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:29,959
She said that if I'm smart
enough to be a lawyer

60
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:31,661
without going to law school,
I should be smart enough

61
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,262
to come up with an excuse
to turn it down.

62
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:34,330
Oh, that's bullshit.

63
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:37,166
You think I don't want this?

64
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:40,039
I do.

65
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:43,776
But we've always known
I was never gonna make partner.

66
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,377
Okay.
What are you gonna do?

67
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,812
I am gonna do the exact
opposite of what I usually do.

68
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,645
Instead of trying
to prove Jessica wrong,

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,330
I'm gonna come up
with a legitimate excuse

70
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:55,650
for why I can't accept it.

71
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,487
Jessica,

72
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:01,222
if I knew you were coming over,

73
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,024
I would have made us
some tequila and eggs.

74
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,576
And I would have
thrown them in your face.

75
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:05,931
Well, that doesn't
seem very nice.

76
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:07,529
I cooked them just like you
like them.

77
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:09,197
You think this is funny?

78
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,845
You assaulted a name partner.

79
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,513
And I'm making jokes
because I don't want to hear it,

80
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:13,781
because he got what he deserved.

81
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,600
I don't care if he
deserved a court martial.

82
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:18,753
That kind of behavior cannot
exist in my firm!

83
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:20,855
- You mean our firm?
- If it's our firm,

84
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,124
then it's Louis's firm, too.

85
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,703
Okay, you made your point.

86
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,820
I won't do it again.

87
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,706
You think I came all the way
down here

88
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,140
just to give you a speech?

89
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,376
You're taking two weeks
starting tomorrow.

90
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,677
Me going on vacation

91
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,446
isn't gonna stop Louis
from coming at me.

92
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,772
Yes, it is,
because if you set foot

93
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:39,757
anywhere near the office
in the next two weeks,

94
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:42,226
I guarantee he will call
for a three-month suspension.

95
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:43,261
Then don't let him.

96
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,712
Harvey, there are
bylaws in place,

97
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:47,631
and the only way to stop him
is you being on vacation.

98
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,033
The only problem
with that is,

99
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,276
everyone knows
I don't take vacations.

100
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:52,328
Oh.

101
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,580
Then why am I
holding your request

102
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,966
that you filled out
two months ago?

103
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,584
Louis is never going
to buy that.

104
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,220
I don't give a shit
whether he buys it or not.

105
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:04,156
But before you go
on your little trip,

106
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,825
you're going to go to him
with your tail between your legs

107
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,896
and tell him
that you were 100% wrong.

108
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,759
Jessica, hey.

109
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,060
What can I do for you?

110
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,930
Well, you can tell me
why you nominated Mike Ross

111
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:28,499
for junior partner and didn't
think to run it by me.

112
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,201
It's an open nomination.

113
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,319
I didn't think I had to.

114
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,004
I didn't say you had to.

115
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,823
- I asked you why you didn't.
- I don't understand.

116
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,171
You were the one
who forced him to work with me.

117
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:41,015
I said work with him,
not nominate him behind my back

118
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,533
just to stick it to Harvey.

119
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:46,687
Jessica, how many times are we
gonna have this conversation?

120
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:49,056
You gave me a chance
to make peace and I took it.

121
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:50,858
And I still haven't heard
one good reason

122
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,743
why Mike shouldn't be promoted.

123
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:57,031
Oh, I didn't say he didn't
deserve to be partner.

124
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,700
Then how about
I retract my memo

125
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:01,702
and let Harvey
nominate him instead?

126
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:04,371
Unless there's some reason
why you don't want that either.

127
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,624
Because instead of talking
to me about this,

128
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:09,543
you should be talking to me
about what happened last night

129
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:11,545
between Louis and Harvey.

141
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:55,139
- How's it going?
- Not great.

142
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:57,057
You haven't found a way
to turn down the nomination?

143
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,226
Oh, I've found 15 ways
to turn it down.

144
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:01,228
But none of them
are good enough.

145
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,614
Come on, one of them
has to be good enough.

146
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,316
Rachel, it's not
about the excuse,

147
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:07,234
it's about me being able
to look these people in the eye

148
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:08,652
and convince them
that it's true,

149
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,120
and I can't do that.

150
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:12,072
Okay.

151
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:13,407
What are you gonna do?

152
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,792
I don't know.

153
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:17,044
I do.

154
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,546
You're doing this.

155
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:20,714
As managing partner,

156
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,334
I am officially giving
you your first case.

157
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:26,086
- Oh my God.
- What?

158
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,839
It's tradition
that the managing partner

159
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:32,726
to give all new junior partners
their first case.

160
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:34,812
- Is that what this is?
- Yes, it is.

161
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,730
Congratulations, Mike.

162
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,315
It may not be what I wanted,

163
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,434
but I really did mean it
when I said you deserve it.

164
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:43,320
Thank you, Jessica.

165
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:48,742
I can't believe
that just really happened.

166
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:53,030
You are the youngest junior
partner the firm has ever had.

167
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:56,583
Mike, I'm so proud of you.

168
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,952
Well, that means there's
only one thing left to do.

169
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,871
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,

170
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:04,792
will you be the associate
on my first case as partner?

171
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:08,295
Yes.
Yes.

172
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:11,632
A thousand times, yes.

173
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:12,766
I don't understand.

174
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,936
Are you saying
you're sorry you hit Louis?

175
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:19,306
I'm saying I'm sorry
I didn't punch him harder.

176
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,808
In that case, I think taking
two weeks off

177
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,059
is the best thing right now.

178
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,026
Because your emotions

179
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,545
are completely ruling you.

180
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,314
Wanting to shut Louis up
isn't being ruled by emotions.

181
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:28,515
It's being human.

182
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,117
And there are other ways you
could have tried to do that.

183
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:31,852
- Such as?
- Walking out the door, for one.

184
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:33,587
I'm not walking
out of my own office.

185
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:34,705
Why not?

186
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,389
Because when someone
points a gun at you,

187
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,055
you don't turn around
and run away.

188
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,825
You take it out of their hand
and you point it right back.

189
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,493
Well, sometimes the best way
to get someone

190
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,263
to stop firing bullets at you
is to take off your armor.

191
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,149
What the hell kind of bullets
are you talking about?

192
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,667
Emotional ones.

193
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:53,652
Harvey, Louis lashed out at you
because he was feeling pain,

194
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:56,188
and instead of showing you his
hurt, he covered it with anger.

195
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:57,756
Well, that's his problem,
not mine.

196
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,892
Actually, I'd say you two
have exactly the same problem.

197
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,126
Excuse me?

198
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:03,310
You did the same thing to him
that he did to you.

199
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,530
Instead of showing your hurt,
you lashed out in anger.

200
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,379
The only difference is,
is that you did it with fists.

201
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:08,680
He did it with words.

202
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,866
Are you saying that I should
tell him I'm in therapy

203
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,050
and talk about
my issues with him

204
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:14,819
so we can sit around
singing<i> Kumbayah?</i>

205
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,140
I'm saying that if you think
Louis should be sorry

206
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,942
for lashing out at you,
the least you can do

207
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,644
is apologize
for lashing back at him.

208
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,967
Louis.
How are you?

209
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:32,669
Cut the small talk.
I'm not interested.

210
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:34,804
In that case,
what can I do for you?

211
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:37,173
You can start by telling me
how Harvey's being punished.

212
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:39,726
- That's between me and Harvey.
- That's funny.

213
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,978
When he was attacking me,
it was between me and Harvey,

214
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:43,396
and I want to know
what you're gonna do about it.

215
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:45,448
And I just said, it's none
of your business.

216
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,733
Then as managing partner,
you should know

217
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:48,451
that I'm suing
your favorite son

218
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,221
for assault and battery.

219
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,261
Louis, you haven't
filed that yet,

220
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:56,763
so why don't you tell me
what the hell you really want?

221
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,865
I want Harvey suspended.

222
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:01,885
Three months, no pay,
no access to clients.

223
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,503
That's not punishing Harvey.

224
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:04,705
That's punishing all of us.

225
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,022
Well, then I'll do it myself,

226
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:07,874
which I have the right
to do under the bylaws.

227
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,976
Louis, I was hoping
you'd calm down.

228
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:12,512
But if you still feel
this way in two weeks,

229
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:13,747
there's nothing
I can do about it.

230
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:15,853
Two weeks? What the hell
are you talking about?

231
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:17,897
You haven't heard.
Harvey's on vacation.

232
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:19,530
Bullshit Harvey's
on vacation.

233
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,798
Harvey doesn't
take vacations.

234
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,783
Louis, you wanted him gone,
and he's gone.

235
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:26,170
And I have his signed
requisition right here.

236
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,505
I don't just want him gone.

237
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,790
I want him humiliated
in front of the whole firm,

238
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,592
not lying on a beach
in Turks and Caicos

239
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:34,403
laughing at some fraudulent
requisition you concocted.

240
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:36,670
Oh, that's a nasty
allegation, Louis.

241
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:37,988
Do you have proof?

242
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,739
You know what, Jessica,
this is no different than me

243
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:41,458
putting Harvey's salary
in the copy machine.

244
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,109
Oh, it's entirely
different, Louis.

245
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:45,228
You did that to rip us apart,

246
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,480
and I'm doing this
to keep us together.

247
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:49,099
So why don't you walk the hell
out my office

248
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:52,135
and think very carefully
about how you want to play this?

249
00:09:58,117 --> 00:10:00,584
All right, before they get here,
let's get our facts straight.

250
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,736
Easy, our client's being
acquired by Google,

251
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,588
but Optela Software
has a buy option.

252
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,006
Claims to have a buy option.

253
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,925
It actually expired
six months ago.

254
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,660
They why are we
having this meeting?

255
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:12,062
Because their lawyers
don't know we know that,

256
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,201
and they're hoping to get
something to go away.

257
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:17,085
Man, I have so much
to teach you.

258
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,071
What, are you my boss now?

259
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:20,706
Oh, how is that different
than before?

260
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:23,792
I could leave
you high and dry right now.

261
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:27,579
You know that, right?

262
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:28,714
Shit.

263
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,132
Mike, it was a joke.

264
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,433
Rachel, I need you to handle
this meeting by yourself.

265
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:33,969
- What? What's wrong?
- Their lawyer just got here.

266
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:35,004
Her?

267
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:35,937
She used to work
at a nonprofit

268
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:37,052
when I was a bike messenger,
all right?

269
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:38,152
We went out a few times.

270
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,450
Mike, please.
I can handle that--

271
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:42,072
No, no, no, she knows
I didn't go to law school.

272
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,623
- What?
- If she sees me,

273
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,891
she's gonna know
I'm not a lawyer, all right?

274
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,059
I need you
to handle this meeting.

275
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:47,560
- Can you do that?
- No, no, no--Mike, please.

276
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:48,762
You have to give me a second
to process what you're saying.

277
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:49,713
Rachel, I don't
have a second.

278
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,599
- I need you to do this.
- Okay.

279
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:54,517
Okay.

280
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:00,919
Hi.

281
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:02,937
- Hi.
- Claire Bowden.

282
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:05,006
Rachel Zane.

283
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,107
Shall we get to it?

284
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,175
Yes, definitely.

285
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:09,411
Let's...let's get to it.

286
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,829
First of all,
I need to inform you

287
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:13,048
that we are prepared
to move forward with a TRO,

288
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,937
unless, of course, your client
has had a change of heart.

289
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,270
You can do that.

290
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:19,456
I just don't see any judge
granting you a TRO

291
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,342
given that your option
has expired.

292
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,394
Actually, it hasn't.

293
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,719
This is a record
of a phone call

294
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,454
between our client and yours.

295
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,705
A phone call during which

296
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:37,091
our client agreed to fix bugs
in your client's software

297
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:38,583
in exchange
for a five-year extension

298
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,161
of our purchase option.

299
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:42,146
I'm confused.
Do...

300
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:45,077
Do you actually want to buy
our client's company?

301
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:46,843
Yes, if there's
a deal happening,

302
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:49,762
we want to be included
in a meaningful way.

303
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,632
I'm sorry.

304
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,723
I'm not authorized
to include you in any deal.

305
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,326
Then pick up the phone
and call your client.

306
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,679
I understand.

307
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,498
You're not authorized to do
that either because a partner

308
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,458
dropped this in your lap
in the 11th hour.

309
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,558
You have no idea.

310
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,026
No, I've been there before.

311
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,701
But I need something
to take to my client.

312
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,630
So, get back to me
as soon as you can?

313
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,448
Yes, absolutely.

314
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,901
Great.

315
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,535
By the way,

316
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,438
how old is the partner
on this case?

317
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:23,640
Why would you ask that?

318
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,808
Because I noticed that
his name was Michael Ross,

319
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,677
and I went out
with a Mike Ross once.

320
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,399
I was just wondering
if it was the same guy.

321
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:33,349
Because if it is, he really
turned his life around.

322
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:37,420
I...I'm sure how old he is.

323
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,422
This is the first time
we've had a case together.

324
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:42,759
So I--maybe he's about 45?

325
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:45,261
- Oh, definitely not him.
- Sorry.

326
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:46,312
Oh, you don't have
to be sorry.

327
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,931
I was just wondering.

328
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,066
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

329
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:05,871
How'd it go?

330
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:07,439
- Not well.
- What happened?

331
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:10,275
What happened was
their buy option didn't expire

332
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:13,195
because it turns out
we made a deal to extend it.

333
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,781
Okay, yeah,
that complicates things.

334
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,983
They're gonna want to squeeze us
for more money to go away,

335
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:21,920
but it's not that big a deal.

336
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:24,618
It's not that big a deal?

337
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,421
It's not that big a deal?

338
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:30,257
You practically ran
from that conference room

339
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,259
to come and hide in here
and left me to deal with a woman

340
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,660
who knows your secret,

341
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,332
and you're gonna tell me
that it's not that big a deal.

342
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,966
I meant having to pay off
Optela is not that big a deal.

343
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,668
You didn't even tell me
how she knows your secret.

344
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:41,353
She doesn't know
my secret, all right?

345
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,521
I told her I went
to law school,

346
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,306
and she found out I didn't.

347
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:45,753
If she sees me now,

348
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:47,472
she's gonna look into me
and then she'll know it.

349
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:48,573
And why did you tell her

350
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:50,041
that you went to law school
in the first place?

351
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,852
- Rachel, it's not important.
- It's important to me.

352
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,137
Because I wanted
to impress her,

353
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:56,240
and being a bike messenger
wasn't gonna do it.

354
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,409
So you lied to her
to get a date?

355
00:13:58,444 --> 00:14:00,177
Yes, I did.

356
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:03,614
Well, you're not the only person
who's lied to her now.

357
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:04,649
What does that mean?

358
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,984
What it means is,
she asked me about you,

359
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,220
and I had to lie
to keep her from thinking

360
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,923
that you're the same Mike Ross
that she knew before.

361
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:15,326
Rachel, I'm sorry.
I...

362
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,245
- Where are you going?
- To work on your case.

363
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,816
As for the aforementioned case,

364
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,451
send our client
his practice depo,

365
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:29,853
and underline
all self-incriminating things

366
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,889
that he's not supposed
to say under oath.

367
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,190
Idiot.

368
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:34,825
Moving on to...

369
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,959
Donna, call security.

370
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,095
I do not feel safe
in my own office.

371
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:39,596
Donna went home.

372
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:40,614
I'm here to speak
to you alone.

373
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:41,965
Why? So you can have
no witnesses

374
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,033
the next time you attack me?

375
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:45,269
No, so I could apologize
to you in private.

376
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,587
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

377
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,771
You're not gonna apologize
your way out of this one.

378
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,747
I'm not here to
get out of anything.

379
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,246
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

380
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,981
I flew off the handle, and
I shouldn't have punched you.

381
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:54,449
You didn't just punch me.
You attacked me.

382
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:55,417
- Louis--
- Bullshit.

383
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,419
This is all bullshit.

384
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,320
There is something
wrong with you,

385
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,922
and there is nothing that you
could ever possibly say to me--

386
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,291
I have been seeing
a psychiatrist.

387
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:04,972
What?
No, you haven't.

388
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:06,373
This is some kind of trick.

389
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:10,344
I've been seeing someone
to get help for panic attacks.

390
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,013
You've been
having panic attacks?

391
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:15,115
- Yes.
- Where?

392
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,066
Look, I don't want
to get into it.

393
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:17,118
Where?

394
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:21,631
In the office.

395
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,766
When?

396
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:25,835
They happen when they happen.

397
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,103
Louis,

398
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:29,706
I am telling you the truth.

399
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,368
My God.
How long have they--

400
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:36,636
They started
a few months ago.

401
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,555
A few--when Donna left?

402
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,140
Yes, when Donna left.

403
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:43,443
But it isn't really
about Donna.

404
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:46,813
That was a trigger--at least
that's what they're telling me.

405
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,582
It goes deeper.

406
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:49,617
My family,

407
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:52,536
my relationships.

408
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:59,100
Let's just say I'm trying
to work through some shit.

409
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,702
So when I said those things,
it struck a nerve.

410
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,888
Oh, it did more
than that, Louis.

411
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
It hurt.

412
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:06,240
You hurt me too, Harvey.

413
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:07,809
I know, and I'm sorry.

414
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:08,943
And it's not an excuse,

415
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,912
but I wanted you to know
why I did what I did

416
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:15,650
and where it was
coming from.

417
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,318
You're not really going
to Turks and Caicos, are you?

418
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,320
I don't know, but I had
therapy this afternoon,

419
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:20,555
and I spent
the rest of the day

420
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:25,960
trying to figure out
the best way to do this.

421
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:30,498
Louis, I'm sorry for Esther.

422
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,034
I'm sorry for lying to you.

423
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:38,339
And I'm sorry
that I attacked you.

424
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,834
I accept your apology, Harvey.

425
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:43,610
Thank you, Louis.

426
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,553
So you're not gonna try
and suspend me?

427
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,054
Suspend you?

428
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,749
Jessica was sure
you'd want to suspend me.

429
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:01,486
Jessica didn't know that you
were gonna say what you said.

430
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,620
As a matter of fact,
I know Jessica

431
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:05,156
only sent you on vacation
to defuse the situation,

432
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,425
so I think you should
come back tomorrow.

433
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,227
- You sure?
- Yes.

434
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,428
They're announcing
Mike's partnership,

435
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,465
and I wouldn't want you
to miss that.

436
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,401
- I appreciate that, Louis.
- It's the least I can do.

437
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:30,799
♪ ♪

438
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:34,614
Can I talk to you
for a second?

439
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,216
If it's about you
becoming senior partner,

440
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,185
I think it's
a little premature.

441
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:42,889
We may have a problem.

442
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:44,257
May or do?

443
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:46,245
The lawyer on the other side
of the Metadesk case

444
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:47,530
knows that I didn't
go to law school.

445
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:48,497
What?

446
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,693
I saw her come
into the office

447
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,517
before the meeting,
so I had Rachel take over,

448
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,302
and she's doesn't know
I'm the same Mike Ross she knew,

449
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,737
and she's not going to, but--

450
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:55,805
Goddamn first case.

451
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,990
Jessica, it's gonna be handled.
I promise.

452
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,508
Now, Rachel and I
will work together,

453
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:00,977
but she'll be out front
the whole time.

454
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:01,978
Well, I guess
we have no choice

455
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,579
but to let her ride it out.

456
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:05,651
But it's gonna look
pretty damn sketchy

457
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,986
if someone finds out you've
handed off your first case.

458
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,490
Which brings me
to my next point.

459
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,192
Jack Soloff has been
asking about it.

460
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,593
Then you better
make damn sure

461
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,196
you keep him from finding out
you put Rachel in charge.

462
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,174
Because the last thing we need
is for Jack Soloff

463
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,570
to start sniffing around
your past.

464
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:22,578
Yeah, I know.

465
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:23,711
Well, if you know
all these things,

466
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:25,179
then why exactly
are you here?

467
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:26,714
Because you trusted me
with being partner

468
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:27,982
and I'm trying to repay

Well, I am, and I opened up
to you about it,

598
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:23,371
and then you looked me
in the eye,

partnership to lure me back.

Yes.

601
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:28,593
I did.

602
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:31,563
Because I wanted you to know
how it feels when someone

603
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:34,883
says one thing to your face
and then turns right around

625
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:23,188
And if you think you're gonna
drag me into your bullshit,

626
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,339
then you have another
thing coming.

627
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,208
Oh, you can abstain
all you want,

628
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,577
but everyone's gonna
know exactly where you stand.

629
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:31,764
They already know
where I stand.

630
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:33,699
And it's not with you.

631
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:45,053
You slapped her
with a lawsuit?

632
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:46,304
Did she call you?

633
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:47,823
No, she called Google,
and then they called me

634
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,257
to tell me they're
pulling out of the deal.

635
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:50,358
- What?
- Yeah, they don't want

636
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:51,359
to run the risk
this thing gets tied up

637
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:52,661
in litigation,
so they're out.

638
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:54,162
- Mike, I can explain.
- No, you don't have to explain.

639
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:55,330
You explained the last time
we talked.

640
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:56,365
Excuse me?

641
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,465
You've got a problem
with Claire,

642
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,150
and you're taking it out
on this case.

643
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:02,170
I don't have a problem
with Claire.

644
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,581
I have a problem
with you lying to her

645
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,916
about going
to law school.

646
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,217
But the reason
I threatened that suit

647
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:09,319
is because she didn't like not
getting her way with me,

648
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:10,987
and she was going to
call you instead.

649
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,189
Well, you stopped
that from happening,

650
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:14,124
and in the process,
you blew up the entire deal.

651
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,194
Did you hear me?
She was going to call you.

652
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:18,678
So I'm sorry that
Google pulled out,

653
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:20,163
but I didn't really
have the chance

654
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,896
to think of
every option--

655
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:23,529
Every option?
There's only one.

656
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,930
You negotiate another price.

657
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:26,031
You think I didn't try that?

658
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,566
The only thing
she would have accepted

659
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:29,034
is being cut in
on the deal, period.

660
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,510
All I know is that if
I'd been there,

661
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:31,937
I would have figured out
a way to get it done.

662
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:34,073
Well, you know what?
You couldn't have been there.

663
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:35,441
And I don't appreciate
you telling me

664
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,710
that I'm not as good as you
when the only reason

665
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,511
I was in that meeting
in the first place

666
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:42,247
was to cover for you.

667
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:47,282
Rachel, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to make it personal.

668
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,584
Well, it sure sounded personal
when you accused me

669
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:51,818
of screwing up
because I was jealous.

670
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,151
Look, I just said
that I'm sorry.

671
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:54,746
I'm only coming down
on you the same way

672
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,554
Harvey would come down on me
in the same situation.

673
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,222
Right, but you're not Harvey,
and I'm not you.

674
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,290
And if Harvey was
talking to you

675
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,708
the way that
you're talking to me,

676
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:04,579
you would be in here right now
telling me what a dick he is.

677
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:14,806
♪ ♪

678
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:17,354
Can I have that, please?

679
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,206
What?

680
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,141
I haven't done your
transcriptions since yesterday,

681
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:22,225
so...

682
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:26,246
Oh, it can wait.
Go home.

683
00:26:26,248 --> 00:26:27,981
What?

684
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:30,767
You went too far
today, Louis.

685
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:33,420
So, you're not really here
to do work.

686
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,805
You're here to once again
take Harvey's side.

687
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:37,040
I'm not taking Harvey's side,

688
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,591
but what you did in
that meeting was wrong.

689
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:40,376
You told me to keep it in the
family, and that's what I did.

690
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:42,628
I meant let Jessica handle it,
and you know it.

691
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
But Jessica didn't handle it.

692
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,715
She tried to send Harvey
to the Caribbean.

693
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,884
Oh, so the only thing that
you could do was blindside him

694
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:51,220
in the same meeting where
Mike is made junior partner?

695
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:52,688
He assaulted me.

696
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:54,306
I understand that, Louis.

697
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:55,724
But what I don't understand

698
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:57,476
is why you're the one
who went in there angry,

699
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,111
and he's the one
who ended up attacking you.

700
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:00,396
- Donna--
- What did you say to him?

701
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:02,231
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

702
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,033
No, you don't, and you're free
to do whatever you want.

703
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:05,568
But when I saw your face
after he hit you,

704
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,654
I felt horrible for you.

705
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:10,873
But since you won't tell me
what you said to him,

706
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:13,909
I'm starting to wonder
if I should.

707
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,373
What's this?

708
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:32,075
I know you had to reschedule
the cake tasting

709
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,661
because of the case, so

710
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,380
I thought I'd bring
the cake tasting to you.

711
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,982
You didn't have to do that.

712
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:41,217
I wanted to, because
I wanted to make sure

713
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:43,820
that you know that no matter
what's going on at work,

714
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:45,555
you're the most important
thing in my life.

715
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:48,224
I know you were just trying
to keep me from getting caught.

716
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,027
And I'm sorry.

717
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:52,964
I'm sorry, too.

718
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:54,230
What for?

719
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,918
Because as much as
I hate to admit it,

720
00:27:57,953 --> 00:27:59,728
I do have a problem
with Claire.

721
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,394
Rachel--

722
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,864
Mike, I was sitting
across the table from her,

723
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,067
and I could see all the reasons
why you were interested in her.

724
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,938
And I--I had to wonder
what would have happened

725
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:13,439
if she'd never found out
that you lied,

726
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:15,675
or if she found out
a year later

727
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,378
after she'd gotten
to know you better.

728
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:20,496
Maybe the two of you
would still be together.

729
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:21,948
- We wouldn't be.
- How do you know?

730
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:24,017
Because it might have taken me
a while to tell you the truth,

731
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:27,153
but from the first second
I looked at you,

732
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:30,290
I wanted to tell you
everything about me.

733
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:32,542
And when I finally did
tell you the truth,

734
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:36,829
you didn't tell me that you
never wanted to see me again.

735
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:41,781
You accepted me.

736
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:44,117
Actually, I slapped you.

737
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:47,187
- And then you kissed me.
- Yeah.

738
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:48,421
And stayed with me.

739
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:50,523
Mm-hmm.

740
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,492
And loved me anyway.

741
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,797
- Jack.
- What can I do for you, Harvey?

742
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:03,066
I wanted to thank you
for standing up for me today.

743
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:06,069
I told Jessica I'm ready
to be a team player.

744
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,721
Maybe now the two of you
will believe me.

745
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,222
Well, I don't know
if I'm willing to go that far,

746
00:29:09,257 --> 00:29:10,873
but I appreciate what you did.

747
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:12,141
Can I speak freely?

748
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,459
Go ahead.

749
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:15,294
You've earned it.

750
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:16,446
I told Mike the reason

751
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:17,947
that I went after you
in the first place

752
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:21,184
was that everything
comes easy to you,

753
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:23,675
but I'm not the only one
that feels that way.

754
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:24,610
What's your point?

755
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:25,645
I may have stopped Louis

756
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,079
from suspending you
for the moment,

757
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:28,814
but that vote's not gonna
go well for you.

758
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,963
You're saying I can do
something to change the outcome.

759
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,405
I'm saying you could do
something to change the way

760
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,088
the partners feel about you.

761
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:37,056
You want me to take
this suspension voluntarily?

762
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,174
If this were a month ago,

763
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,659
I'd want you to take
your name off the wall.

764
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,594
But you need to do something
to humble yourself.

765
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,398
What exactly that is,
is up to you.

766
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,048
How did you get in here?

767
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,483
The receptionist told me
where to find you.

768
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,484
Well, she shouldn't have,

769
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:05,569
so why don't you
find your way out?

770
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:08,088
Claire, I'm here
to apologize.

771
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,825
Look, you got under my skin
when you called me inexperienced

772
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,629
because the truth is I haven't
been doing this very long.

773
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:17,100
So I shot back,

774
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:18,635
and I went overboard
to try and--

775
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:20,737
Show me that you were
better than me.

776
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:24,541
Yes, and I ended up
blowing the deal for both of us,

777
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:25,959
and I'm sorry.

778
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:29,517
Well, they say you
learn from your mistakes.

779
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:30,565
That's the thing.

780
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:32,050
I have already learned,

781
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:37,789
and I think that I have a way
to get both of us a win.

782
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:40,259
GigaDyne. They're a major
client at your firm.

783
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:42,995
What if you were to bring them
the acquisition of Metadesk?

784
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,962
Why would they want this?

785
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:45,197
Because they need
fulfillment software

786
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:47,132
to increase
their sales in Europe,

787
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,251
and we're a perfect fit.

788
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:51,553
You researched my client?

789
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:55,173
Like I said,
I learn from my mistakes.

790
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:03,921
- Hey.
- Oh, don't "hey" me.

791
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:05,490
You're up to something.

792
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:08,025
- Why would you say that?
- I worked for you for 12 years.

793
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:10,461
You think I can't tell
when you're up to something?

794
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:11,463
- Donna--
- Harvey,

795
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:12,597
if you're coming
to me in here,

796
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:13,931
that means you don't want
Louis to know.

797
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:16,200
And I don't work for you
anymore--I work for him.

798
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:19,335
I know that, and I know
what I'm about to ask

799
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:21,202
might put you
in between me and Louis.

800
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:23,271
But I want you to help me
figure out something I can do

801
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:26,240
that'll move the partners
not to suspend me.

802
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:29,110
Then tell me this.

803
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:31,179
What did Louis say to you
that made you hit him?

804
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:32,547
Why are you asking me that?

805
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:33,881
Because you're asking me
to pick your side,

806
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,567
and I need to know
if you deserve it.

807
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,097
Donna,

808
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,782
if you don't know me
well enough to know

809
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,333
that I deserve
your help by now,

810
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,519
nothing I tell you
is gonna matter.

811
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,404
But whether I deserve it
or not,

812
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,673
I guarantee you Louis is going
to have some dirty trick

813
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,508
up his sleeve for that vote.

814
00:32:00,537 --> 00:32:02,503
Louis, I need to talk to you
for a second.

815
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,172
Well, if you're here
to tell me not to play dirty,

816
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,873
you're wasting your breath
because Donna already did it.

817
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:06,909
I'm not here to do that,

818
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,242
because you already
played dirty.

819
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:10,623
I'm here to get you to vote
against suspending Harvey.

820
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:12,572
How the hell have
I already played dirty?

821
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:14,858
You knew my partnership
would mean something to Harvey,

822
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,827
and instead of holding it
outside of your feud,

823
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:19,058
you used it to trick him
back into the firm.

824
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:21,642
Because, Mike, it was
the only way to get justice.

825
00:32:21,694 --> 00:32:23,360
Okay.

826
00:32:23,396 --> 00:32:25,629
If you think that,
then let me put this in terms

827
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:26,997
that you might understand.

828
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:29,900
Harvey is Jon Snow,
I'm his Uncle Benjen,

829
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:32,466
and you used me
to lure him out

830
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:34,366
so that everybody
could stab him to death.

831

That's not the point,
and you know it.

834
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:39,938
The point is,
you betrayed Harvey,

835
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:42,140
the same way that kid
betrayed Jon Snow.

836
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,909
Well, in that case, it was
for the good of The Watch.

837
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,811
Yeah, I'm sure that's what
that kid thought, too.

838
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:49,247
But I guarantee you, he's going
to regret stabbing his friend

- Is that a problem?
- No.

884
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,249
It's just that I told you

885
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:10,751
that I didn't need you
to do any transcribing.

886
00:35:10,786 --> 00:35:13,187
And the way you said it
got me thinking

887
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:16,290
about how you like making
your plans on this thing.

888
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:19,960

892
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,450
I don't even think
you really had panic attacks,

893
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,418
let alone are going to therapy.

Well, I am.

about it,

896
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,555
and then you looked me
in the eye,

897
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:33,757
and you used Mike's partnership
to lure me back.

898
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:35,392
Yes.

899

says one thing to your face
and then turns right around

902
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:45,711
and does the exact opposite,
like you did--

903
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:49,431
He revealed those
things to you,

904
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:53,202
and you recorded him so you
could play it for the partners?

905
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,870
I wasn't trying to record
him saying those things.

Bullshit!

Maybe he does.

is not because of a conflict.

936
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:11,824
It's because this transaction
triggers a background check.

937
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:13,593
- Which means--
- I told you the reason.

938
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:15,346
He's repping another
client and--

939
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:17,081
He's lying to you, Rachel.

940
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,763
You're gonna find this
impossible to believe,

941
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:20,848
but Mike Ross is a fraud,
and he knows that I know.

942
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:22,284
That's why he sent you
in at the last minute

943
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:23,685
when this was his deal
from day one.

944
00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:26,088
Are you crazy? He's a partner
at Pearson, Specter, Litt,

945
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,256
and you said
your Mike Ross wasn't 45.

946
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,524
So the Mike that I know--

947
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,243
Oh, my God, you know.

948
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:37,015
I don't know anything,
except that we just need--

949
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:39,248
I'm calling the D.A.'s Office
right now if you don't tell me

950
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:42,185
what the hell's going on.

951

This isn't about
what I can't do.

How could you be with a man
like that after you found out?

956
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,805
Because I already loved him.

957
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:03,856
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel.

958
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:05,208
I just can't turn
the other way.

Don't you understand
what this is condoning?

Yes, I understand

a year later,

after you already knew

his life around.

The only way

I can't do that.
I'll lose all credibility.

I also wanted to know
why you're letting it go.

Because Rachel
begged me to.

But if you really
want to know the truth, no,

I don't believe that you
