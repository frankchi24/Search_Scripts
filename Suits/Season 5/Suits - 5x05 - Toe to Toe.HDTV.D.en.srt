00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:02,914
I hear you're interviewing
replacements this morning.

2
00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:03,506
I am.

3
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:04,465
Are you good at what I do.

4
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:05,538
I'm great at what I do.

5
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:06,973
Then you start tomorrow.

6
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,127
I'd like to propose a change

7
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,676
to the current compensation
formula.

8
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:11,265
How many partners do you have
in your pocket

9
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,633
if we put your proposal
to a vote?

10
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:14,068
I can get 45%.

11
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,303
I'm gonna get you
the difference.

12
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:17,238
This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

13
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:19,083
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

14
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,652
You came to work for me, so now
it's time for you to decide.

15
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:22,840
Are you with me or not?

16
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:24,141
I just called for a vote,

17
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:25,810
and I hope you've been
saving your money,

18
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:28,375
because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

19
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,978
- Okay, I'm dialing 911.
- It's not a heart attack.

20
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:32,613
It's a panic attack.

21
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:34,848
Remember when I said
if I wanted you to make up

22
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:37,251
for the compensation vote
I would come to you directly?

23
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:38,619
Well, now I am.

24
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,120
Well, let's take a look
at your resume.

25
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:42,789
Witness tampering,
extortion, bribery.

26
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,224
Forgery fits right in.

27
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,792
I actually looked
into your mommy,

28
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:47,961
and it turns out
that the whole time

29
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,916
you were home with Daddy,
Mommy was out banging--

You're absolutely certain
the man

was this Travis Tanner person?

Yes.

36
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:44,017
And yet you're just as certain
the woman wasn't Donna?

37

That's what I said.

38

I know that, but you
haven't said who she was.

39

Why are you looking at me
like that?

40
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:52,926
You know why.

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,261
I don't know who she was.

42
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:56,563
Okay, then let's try this.

43
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:59,265
Why do you think Travis Tanner
all of a sudden

44
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,401
popped into your subconscious?

45
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:03,837
Because I'm in the middle
of a case against him.

46
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,372
Well, since you don't want to
talk about the dream anymore,

47
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:09,342
why don't we talk
about the case?

48
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:21,819
That's not creepy at all.

49
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,694
I was just wondering
why you changed your hair.

50
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:24,989
Hair's the same
as it's always been.

51
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:26,924
You trying to look older?
Younger?

52
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,293
Whatever it is,
it isn't working.

53
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:29,827
Are you finished?
'Cause I'm actually trying

54
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,629
to catch up
on some billables here.

55
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:33,631
Hey, I just stopped by
to give you a little gift

56
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,033
for winning the Zane case.

57
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,335
A gift? You've never
given me a gift after a case.

58
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:38,770
That's not true.

59
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:40,204
Come to think of it, you've
never even congratulated me,

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,906
which means you're
actually here because,

61
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,609
oh, my God, you miss me.

62
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,944
- I did...not miss you.
- Are you okay?

63
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,179
Do you want to come over
tonight?

64
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:49,480
We can watch
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

65
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,482
- Do you want your gift or not?
- That's it?

66
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:53,318
My gift looks a lot
like a folder.

67
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:54,619
It's a case.

68
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:58,589
You and me killing it
against Travis Tanner.

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,974
- Just like old times?
- Just like old times.

70
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:03,410
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Nothing.

71
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,845
He's on his way over with
a settlement offer right now.

72
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,847
Settlement?
That doesn't sound like Tanner.

73
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,849
- Sounds exactly like Tanner.
- How's that?

74
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,317
He's starting off
waving a white flag.

75
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,286
Yeah, he's doing it
just to go behind our backs

76
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,654
so he can attack our flank.

77
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:15,922
So you're saying we need
to watch our flank.

78
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,324
No, I'm saying we need
to attack his.

79
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:22,996
- What?
- I'm just gonna say it.

80
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,066
Every time we go up against
Tanner, it gets brutal.

81
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,068
You just had a panic attack
the other day,

82
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:32,906
so are you sure this is really
what you need right now?

83
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,876
It's exactly what I need
right now.

84
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:39,079
Let's go get him.

85
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,454
Louis?
What's this?

86
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,490
That is a token
of my appreciation.

87
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,893
You told me to trust Harvey
with Esther and you were right.

88
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,094
Now Harvey and I are good.

89
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,395
Well, if you're gonna
give me a gift

90
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,863
every time I turn out
to be right,

91
00:03:58,898 --> 00:03:59,864
then I'm gonna need
a bigger apartment.

92
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:02,267
Well, not every time,
but this time.

93
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:05,036
Your mud club.
I'm going mudding?

94
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,604
Even better.

95
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,239
We are going mudding.

96
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:09,941
Wow, Louis.
I don't know what to say.

97
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,009
This is, um....

98
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,477
- Wonderful?
- Inappropriate.

99
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,179
Oh, come on, Donna.

100
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,513
I don't think you understand.

101
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:16,985
Picture this.

102
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,388
You and me, side by side,
completely naked,

103
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:22,724
our bodies covered
in the juices of Mother Earth.

104
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:25,860
Oh, yeah, now I can see exactly
how it's totally appropriate.

105
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,962
Exactly.

106
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:30,064
And Donna, trust me.

107
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:32,298
When you dip your virgin toe
in the deep warmth of my mud,

108
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:35,067
you're never gonna be
the same again.

109
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:43,745
Jessica, we have a problem.

110
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,147
I went through the bylaws.

111
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:47,683
Turns out the new compensation
structure is in violation

112
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:48,917
of subsection C35.

113
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:50,352
So the vote in itself is moot.

114
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:51,887
So you're saying
we're going back

115
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,789
to the old compensation
structure?

116
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:56,825
No, I'm not saying that.
Subsection C35 is saying that.

117
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,060
There's only one problem.

118
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:01,063
Subsection C35 didn't exist
24 hours ago.

119
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,864
- Jessica--
- Cut the shit, Louis.

120
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,335
Tell me what this
is really about.

121
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,871
It's about me trying to make
things right with Harvey.

122
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:12,140
And I have no problem
with that.

123
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:14,910
But I also need you
to make things right with me.

124
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:16,996
What are you talking about?

125
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,297
That vote was an assault
on my power.

126
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,566
I sneak this by,
I don't get my power back.

127
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,067
It just makes me
the same as you and Jack.

128
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,170
So you're not going to undo
this thing the same shady way

129
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,072
that the two of you passed it
in the first place.

130
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:29,575
Jessica, I told you,
leaving Harvey's compensation

131
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,877
in the copier was an accident.

132
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:34,947
And a man named Santa Claus
climbs down chimneys

133
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:36,882
and leaves presents
under trees.

134
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,518
Okay, fine, I get it.
You don't believe me.

135
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,487
But how the hell am I supposed
to convince the senior partners

136
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,222
to take money
out of their own pockets?

137
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,124
That's your problem.

138
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:49,094
You want to reverse that policy,
bring it up for a vote.

139
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:50,135
Like a man.

00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:44,826
Well, then you know
who I'm here to see.

158
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:47,061
I also know that the very
first time you ever came here,

159
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,564
you walked right past security
and by Donna.

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,533
But like you just said,
I'm not Donna.

161
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,120
I like you.
You filling in for the day?

162
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:56,705
None of your business.

163
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:57,907
Hey, I'm just saying,
when Red gets back,

164
00:06:57,942 --> 00:06:59,108
maybe you want
to come work for me.

165
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,309
I already have a job.

166
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,461
And right now it's
getting your sorry ass

167
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:04,079
into the conference room.

168
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:05,814
♪ ♪

169
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,583
So what are you gonna do?

170
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:08,667
The only thing I can do.

171
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,885
Get Harvey to ask me
for something else.

172
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:11,053
No, not an option.

173
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:12,855
Donna, the only way
I can get this done

174
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,640
is with Jack Soloff's help,
and there is no way

175
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:16,492
that he's gonna reverse
the very same proposal

176
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,661
that put him on the map.

177
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,326
I'll tell you
what Harvey would do.

178
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:22,895
I don't care
what Harvey would do,

179
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,114
because I cannot do
what Harvey would do.

180
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:26,967
What would Harvey do?

181
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:29,169
He'd find a way to make it
worth Jack's while.

182
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,675
Get Rachel to get me a list
of every major corporate merger

183
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,194
pending in the next month.

184
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,079
There is the Louis
I came to work for.

185
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:41,715
You are right. Here I am.
And I'm gonna get it done.

186
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,851
And when I do, you and I are
going for a long, slow mud.

187
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,953
No, we're not.

188
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:53,884
If you're here to check the air,

189
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,619
it's like a sauna
on the 38th floor.

190
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:56,754
Good to see you, Harvey.

191
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:58,489
Nice to know some people
never change.

192
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,957
No witty rejoinder?
What's going on?

193
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:01,158
You slowing down
in your old age?

194
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:02,259
Could be low T.

195
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,328
And I could talk shit
with guys all day,

196
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:06,267
but I'm here because
I care about my client.

197
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,351
Well, then maybe your client
shouldn't have tried

198
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,149
to launch a company
with stolen IP.

199
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,185
That IP wasn't stolen.
Alyssa created it herself.

200
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,067
It doesn't matter whether
she created it or not.

201
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,389
She signed a contract
that says we own it,

202
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:19,459
and it was on our laptop that
she took home on her last day.

203
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,527
And we're not letting you walk
out the door with our property.

204
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,296
Okay, I told you
this isn't about me.

205
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,263
Okay, what do you want,
Tanner?

206
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:25,398
I want to make an offer.

207
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,021
Alyssa is willing
to give you a 15% stake

208
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,523
to drop this whole thing.

209
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,925
She could make it 100%
for all I care.

210
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,476
- We're not settling.
- You don't have to settle,

211
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,712
but you do have to present
that offer to your client

212
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,863
and you know it.

213
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,198
I will, I just need
to get it translated

214
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,033
from bullshit to English.

215
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,035
Harvey, look at me.
That's a fair offer.

216
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,903
No, you look at me and tell me
you're not doing something

217
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,688
behind our backs right now.

218
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,173
- I'm not.
- Well, we are.

219
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,142
Your secretary said
you wouldn't file a TRO

220
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:49,177
until after this meeting.

221
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,361
Oh, we didn't.

222
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,446
Turns out that Miss Lang
has some outstanding debts,

223
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:54,215
so we just went ahead
and bought those up

224
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,983
and put a lien
on her property.

225
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:58,695
The sheriff's padlocking
her offices as we speak.

226
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,864
Harvey, don't do this.
You'll be sorry.

227
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:01,998
Tell that to the judge.

228
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:04,000
We're filing that TRO
in the morning.

229
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,208
I'm telling you,
I'm not the guy I used to be,

230
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:15,128
but if you hit me,
I'm not turning the other cheek.

231
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:17,297
You're gonna get hit back.

232
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:23,855
What are you so happy about?

233
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,924
I told you,
it's exactly what I needed.

234
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,413
You've gone up against
this man how many times?

235
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:33,098
Enough to know that
he's a piece of shit

236
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,966
that'll cross whatever line
it takes to win.

237
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,452
All I've heard so far
is the line that you crossed.

238
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:41,649
Listen, you may understand
some things about people,

239
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,251
but you don't understand
what I do.

240
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,320
Well, it sounds to me like
what you did was attack a man

241
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:46,538
that was waving a white flag.

242
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:47,922
Were you listening?

243
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:50,625
He wasn't waving a white flag,
he was setting us up.

244
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,460
How can you be so sure?

245
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:53,762
Because I know Tanner.

246
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:56,097
Okay, well, if you know so well
what he was capable of,

247
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,700
why was it such a good idea
to pick a fight with him?

248
00:09:58,702 --> 00:10:01,069
Because it's what I do.

249
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:03,905
Well, maybe it's time to
consider changing what you do.

250
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:07,913
Okay, here we go.

251
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,915
What about Gentech
and Orion Pharmaceuticals?

252
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:13,218
Monster merger, contingent fee,
and huge upside.

253
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:15,134
And Cravath is listed
as the attorney of record,

254
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,190
which means if they swap out,
it blows the whole thing up.

255
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,158
Okay, well,
that's the last one.

256
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,127
Shit.

257
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,053
Wait, this has been here
the whole time.

258
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:25,105
What about John Dellmore?

259
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:26,505
They're merging
with Arkin Financial.

260
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,074
Haven't been announced yet,
it's just sitting there

261
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:29,475
- ripe for the taking.
- No, not gonna happen.

262
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,877
Dellmore's been with
Harmon and Shupe for decades.

263
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,511
So what? Harmon and Shupe
is a third-tier law firm

264
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,679
and Shupe is a joke.

265
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,448
She's also
John Dellmore's wife.

266
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:36,832
Well, so then maybe
we can convince Dellmore

267
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,184
that his wife is a trollop.

268
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:39,852
- Louis!
- God damn it!

269
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,487
What is going on?

270
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:44,323
I need Jack Soloff to overturn
the compensation vote,

271
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:46,175
and the only way for me
to do that is to bring in

272
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,760
a big contingent client.

273
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:48,995
And share the money with him.

274
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,581
Exactly!
And none of these people are it.

275
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:52,899
Okay.

276
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,901
Wait, where are you going?

277
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,102
Like you said,
none of these people are it.

278
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,603
It's late,
we're both exhausted,

279
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:58,871
and I've got a test
in the morning.

280
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:00,039
Rachel, please.

281
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,540
Louis, I'm sorry.

282
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,875
We'll work on it
tomorrow morning, I promise.

283
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,610
Rach--

284
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,984
Gentlemen, I don't like granting
TROs without a good reason.

285
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,218
We have a good reason,
Your Honor.

286
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,553
It's called a contract.

287
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:16,588
A contract that explicitly
states that any product

288
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:18,657
Alyssa Lang developed
during her employment

289
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,225
is the property of our client.

290
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:22,461
Unfortunately that contract
is unenforceable.

291
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:25,569
It is unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

292
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,154
Your Honor, I have here a copy

293
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:28,506
of Alyssa Lang's
birth certificate.

294
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,974
She may have signed
that contract,

295
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,677
but it isn't binding because
she was only 16 at the time.

296
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,195
What?

297
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,030
Your Honor, I know this man,

298
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,648
and that document
could have come from anywhere.

299
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:39,244
Get it verified
by the labs at Quantico.

300
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:40,818
All it's gonna prove
is that Alyssa Lang

301
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:43,029
had no legal capacity to sign.

302
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,884
It doesn't matter how old
she was when she signed it.

303
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,252
It was ten years ago.

304
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,271
She's cashed every paycheck
she got since.

305
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:49,522
And you can argue that at trial,

306
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:51,657
but we have laws
protecting minors for a reason,

307
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:52,992
and I'm not granting a TRO.

308
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,143
And one more thing, Your Honor.

309
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,979
We have payment in full,
discharging her debt,

310
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,580
and are requesting her doors
be reopened.

311
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,615
That has nothing to do
with why we're here.

312
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,001
Save it for trial, Mr. Specter.
It's lunch.

313
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:04,237
I'm hungry, and those padlocks
are coming off today.

314
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:07,957
What the hell was that?

315
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:10,426
That was the sound
of your face hitting the canvas.

316
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,711
I suggest you stay down.

317
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,347
I'm not staying anywhere,
you son of a bitch.

318
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,401
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

319
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:19,621
Your client was 16 years old and
you conveniently left that out

320
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,089
of your changed man speech.

321
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,924
I didn't tell you about her
because I knew you wouldn't

322
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,693
listen to a thing I said after
I offered you a fair deal

323
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,895
and you told me to go to hell.

324
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,379
Bullshit.
You didn't tell us because

325
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,944
you wanted to blindside us
in court.

326
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,410
Hey, you're the one who
turned out the lights out

327
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,712
on Alyssa's business while
I was extending an olive branch.

328
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:34,796
Bullshit again.

329
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,214
We both know
that settlement offer

330
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:39,551
was nothing but a distraction.

331
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:42,137
You want a distraction?

332
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,307
That is a draft of Alyssa Lang's
sexual harassment complaint

333
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,858
against your client.

334
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:49,394
As far as our offer goes,
it wasn't a distraction

335
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:50,729
because we haven't
filed that yet

336
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:52,564
and our offer's
still on the table.

337
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,149
I advise you to take it.

338
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:04,419
You didn't believe the sexual
harassment allegation?

339
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:05,820
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

340
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:08,306
Well, for starters,
it came out of Tanner's mouth.

341
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:11,259
And I know Tim Petroff,
and he didn't cheat on his wife.

342
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:12,831
And you're angry at him
for that?

343
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,099
You're damn right I am!

344
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:17,002
There are some things
you just don't do.

345
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:18,337
Like lie?

346
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:20,973
Like threaten to rip
a man's family apart.

347
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,808
Hmm.

348
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,443
What?

349
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:27,212
I just find it interesting
that you talk about family

350
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:29,715
as if it were sacred,
yet you've never married.

351
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,417
You've never had
a family of your own.

352
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:32,685
I don't see any
macaroni paintings

353
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,553
or school pictures
in here either.

354
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,121
And my personal life
is not the topic here.

355
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:37,756
So why don't we get back
to what is?

356
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:40,259
If it was such a good idea
to pick a fight with Tanner,

357
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,144
why were you so angry at him
for doing exactly

358
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:43,279
what you knew he would do?

359
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:46,614
You're the doctor.
You tell me.

360
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:50,683
Okay, maybe because
getting angry at someone

361
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:53,486
is a way to avoid facing
what's going on with yourself.

362
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,495
Oh, good, you're back.

363
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:03,996
Can't be good
if you're out here.

364
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:05,881
Oh, I didn't want you
to get ambushed. There's a--

365
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,434
Tim Petroff of BetaSoft
in my office.

366
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:11,537
He's been wearing out
your carpet for half an hour.

367
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:13,472
Tanner must have sent him a copy
of the complaint.

368
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,175
If you mean that paper balled up
in his fist, I'd say he did.

369
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,444
Thanks for the heads-up,
Gretchen.

370
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,244
Tim, before you say anything--

371
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,497
Sexual harassment?
What the hell is this?

372
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,348
It's only a draft.
It hasn't been filed yet.

373
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,933
And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

374
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,035
It's a goddamn lie.

375
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,503
I have never done anything

376
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,271
remotely resembling
harassing anyone.

377
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,673
- Tim, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.

378
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,504
This is a complete twisting
of who I am.

379
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:40,337
I want this woman destroyed.

380
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:41,922
It's not her.
It's her lawyer.

381
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:43,340
I don't care who it is.

382
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,776
I have a wife and children,
and I want this thing gone.

383
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,478
Then you should know there's
a settlement on the table.

384
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,612
Mike!
Not now.

385
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:49,713
What settlement?

386
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:51,815
A 15% stake in her venture.

387
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,534
Are you out of your mind?

388
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:54,718
You think I'm gonna settle
with these people

389
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,719
based on blackmail?

390
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,987
No one's settling.

391
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,522
Yeah, you're damn right
no one's settling.

392
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:01,308
Now earn your money and blow
this woman out of the water.

393
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,420
You heard him.

394
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,222
Figure out a way to put the
screws to her once and for all.

395
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,690
Harvey.

396
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,475
And I don't want to hear
any shit about my state of mind.

397
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,007
I'm not gonna say anything
about that,

398
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,945
but what I will say is that
if Tanner's willing to make her

399
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,447
do this, what's to say
he's not willing to make her

400
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,715
do something worse?

401
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,734
What do you want to do, Mike?
You want to back down?

402
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,119
No, I want
to get Tanner fired.

403
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,388
It's not legal for us
to talk to her.

404
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,824
There's no law against me
running into her by accident.

405
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:33,304
Rachel, what are you doing here?

406
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:34,699
I've been looking
all over for you.

407
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,442
Don't you mean, "Hey, Rachel,
how did your test go?"

408
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,609
I don't care
how your test went.

409
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:39,844
I just need you to get me
everything you can

410
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,112
on John Dellmore.

411
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,097
Louis, we've already
been over this.

412
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,316
His lawyer's his wife.
You're never gonna sign him.

413
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:46,984
Well, that's just it.
I don't need to sign him.

414
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:49,754
I only need to pretend
to sign him.

415
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,923
Okay.
That's a bad idea.

416
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,024
No, it's not.

417
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,660
If Jack thinks I signed
Dellmore,

418
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,328
and I tell him
I'll give him a piece,

419
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:58,513
he'll know it's worth
a fortune to him

420
00:15:58,548 --> 00:15:59,731
and he'll overturn the vote.

421
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,698
And what are you gonna do
when he finds out

422
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:01,916
the whole thing was a lie?

423
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:04,398
He won't.
I'll make up some sob story

424
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,716
about how Dellmore
made up with his wife

425
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:06,817
and we'll live
to fight another day.

426
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:08,547
He's never
gonna believe that.

427
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:11,448
Rachel, Katrina would have been
on board with this from day one.

428
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:12,615
Okay, Louis, I'm sorry.

429
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:13,950
I am not trying to
rain on your parade,

430
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:17,420
but when Jack finds out,
he's going to hate you forever.

431
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:19,222
Well, I made a promise
to Harvey.

432
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:20,790
And if it's a choice
between Jack hating me

433
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,692
and breaking that promise,

434
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:25,779
I'm picking Harvey
every single time.

435
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,347
What exactly do you need?

436
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,749
I need a way to dazzle
the shit out of John Dellmore.

437
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:34,037
Thank you.

438
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,155
I don't understand.
My bill's been paid?

439
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:37,624
- Yes, sir, it has.
- By who?

440
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:38,858
Uh, by me.

441
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,793
And who exactly are you?

442
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,862
I'm Louis Litt.

443
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:45,114
And not only did I
pay for your check,

444
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:50,151
I also brought you another one.

445
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:52,987
You're donating $50,000
to my charity.

446
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:55,356
Yes.

447
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:57,392
Why would you want to--

448
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:59,727
Because it may not look like it,
but I was homeless.

449
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,496
I spent two years
on the streets,

450
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:03,414
and had it not been for your
family's organization,

451
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,601
I would not be the man
I am today.

452
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,677
Is there anything I can do
to thank you?

453
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,411
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

454
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:14,481
You, sir,
are a true American hero.

455
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,184
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

456
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:27,343
♪ ♪

457
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:31,006
Oh, good, you're here.

458
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,408
What the hell was that?

459
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,009
That was John Dellmore.

460
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:35,778
Yeah, I know who it is.

461
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:37,112
Why was he giving you a hug?

462
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:38,914
Because I just convinced him
to let us handle his merger.

463
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,282
Does that have something
to do with why we're here?

464
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,784
It's got everything to do
with why we're here,

465
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,535
because I knew that you
would never believe

466
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:44,503
that I could close Dellmore.

467
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:45,938
You're right.

468
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:47,990
If I hadn't seen it myself,
I never would have believed it.

469
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,293
And why is that?
Because I'm a grinder?

470
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,128
Here's the thing, Jack.

471
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,396
When you took on Harvey,

472
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:56,065
you pitted the grinders
against the rainmakers,

473
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,132
and that was a good move,

474
00:17:57,168 --> 00:17:58,967
but you want to move
to the next level?

475
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:01,603
We need to be both grinders
and rainmakers.

476
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,805
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

477
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,906
What are you saying?

478
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,907
I'm saying
that we need to revisit

479
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:06,175
the compensation agreement.

480
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,609
No way.
Why would I do that?

481
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,645
Because when
we get this business,

482
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,414
it will be worth a fortune
to us.

483
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,749
- "Us"?
- Yes, us, Jack.

484
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,651
If you are with me on this,

485
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:18,320
I will give you 50 cents
to every dollar that I make.

486
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:27,267
Yeah.
Let's get this done.

487
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:37,327
Careful, it's really hot.

488
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:39,713
A woman once sued McDonald's
for getting burned.

489
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,400
Although I guess you could
just say you got burned

490
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:46,086
and sue them anyway.

491
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,387
Who are you?

492
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,157
Doesn't matter who I am.
It matters who I work for.

493
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,575
Tim Petroff.

494
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,559
You can't talk to me.

495
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,077
I'm just fixing my coffee.

496
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,396
You want to walk away,
walk away, but before you do,

497
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:58,181
I'm gonna say
to nobody in particular

498
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,600
that you should fire
your lawyer.

499
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:01,368
I'm not firing anybody.

500
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:02,953
Well, then you should also know
that falsely accusing someone

501
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,172
of sexual harassment
is a criminal offense,

502
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:06,840
and no matter what
Travis Tanner has told you

503
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:10,043
to convince you that you'll
get away with it, you won't.

504
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,111
There's nothing
in that complaint

505
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:12,779
that isn't factually correct.

506
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:14,564
You are twisting those facts
and you could ruin a man's life,

507
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:16,066
and you know it.

508
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,285
Oh, and how is that different
from what he's doing to me?

509
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,237
- It's completely different.
- Is it?

510
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,906
I worked for that man
60 hours a week for 10 years,

511
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,491
and now that I want
to start my own company,

512
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,043
he not only wants to crush me,

513
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:27,961
but he told people
I stole the idea.

514
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:30,664
If that's not ruining a person's
life, then I don't know what is.

515
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, and as far
as Travis Tanner goes,

516
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:35,002
sexual harassment
wasn't his idea.

517
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:36,219
It was mine.

518
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:37,971
And when he tried
to talk me out of it,

519
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:39,556
I told him he could either
get on board

520
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:42,142
or watch me get
another lawyer.

521
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:59,085
Rachel Zane,
you glorious creature.

522
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,236
- Glorious?
- Yes, glorious.

523
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:02,205
I mean, you were masterful.

524
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:05,091
The charity, his lone lunches
at his favorite restaurant,

525
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:07,127
having Jack show up
at the perfect time.

526
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,396
I mean, you are not only
a brilliant attorney,

527
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:11,398
you're the backbone
of this entire--

528
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,141
Louis, I'm not going
mudding with you.

529
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:14,582
God damn it!
What did Donna tell you?

530
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:15,943
She told me
that if it went well,

531
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:17,645
you would come in here trying
to get a celebratory mud,

532
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,946
and that if it didn't go well,

533
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:20,648
you would try to get
a sympathy mud.

534
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,383
Wait a second, I could have
got a sympathy mud?

535
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,751
No, you couldn't.

536
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:26,003
But the good news is, you got
what you wanted with Jack,

537
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:29,090
and on top of that, Louis,
you really made a difference

538
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:30,874
in the lives
of homeless children.

539
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:32,059
Which reminds me.
After the vote,

540
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,310
I want you to put a stop payment
on that check.

541
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:35,979
Okay, no--that is
a despicable thing to do.

542
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,681
Please, any charity
claiming to do a good thing

543
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,333
is clearly a scam.
I won't have it.

544
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:40,817
So you mean you're cheap?

545
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:42,286
You know what, for someone who
won't throw me a sympathy mud,

546
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,404
you're very judgmental.

547
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:50,015
Louis.
What can I do for you?

548
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,083
You can give me your proxy.

549
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:52,484
Why would I do that?

550
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:55,537
Because you asked me to bring
the compensation issue up

551
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,873
for a vote like a man
and I did.

552
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,205
And is Jack Soloff
aware of this?

553
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,193
Not only aware of it,
he's voting for it.

554
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:03,195
And however did you get him
to do that?

555
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,680
Let's just say that
you wanted me to do this

556
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:07,599
like Harvey would have
and not like I would have,

557
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,269
but I did the best of both.

558
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:12,271
Then you have my proxy.

559
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,036
Harvey, I talked to Alyssa Lang

560
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,488
and there's something
you should know.

561
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,957
Let me guess, she batted
her eyes, told you a sob story,

562
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,191
and now you think she's
some kind of innocent.

563
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,593
No, I don't.

564
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,029
In fact, she told me that the
sexual harassment idea was hers.

565
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,664
And why do I need
to know that?

566
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,933
I think we should consider
taking the deal.

567
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,953
Well, we're not gonna
do that.

Why not?

569
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,850
Because first of all,
there's now way on Earth

570
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:49,885
that Tim's gonna settle.

571
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:51,836
You could convince him
and you know it.

572
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,521
And second of all,
there's no way on Earth

573
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,089
that that suit was her idea.

574
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,274
Harvey, you weren't there,
all right?

575
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,026
Yeah, I didn't have
to be there to know

576
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:00,458
that if Tanner could
convince her to do that bullshit

577
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,126
in the first place,
he could sure as hell get her

to say it was her idea.

579
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:04,896
He couldn't have known
that I was gonna contact her.

580
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:06,097
He could, and he did.

another word about it.

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,792
All in favor?

622
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:45,177
Motion seems to have passed.

623
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:49,966
Next order of business.

624
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,686
What the hell did you just do?

625
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,022
What the hell did I do?
I protected my own interests.

626
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,940
- We had a deal!
- We didn't have a thing.

627
00:23:57,976 --> 00:23:59,275
You think I bought
that John Dellmore stunt

628
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,559
at the restaurant?

629
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:03,029
I was on to you the second
you walked over to my table.

630
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:05,781
I let you give me
that bullshit speech

631
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:08,284
about grinders and rainmakers
just so I could do

632
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,986
what I just did.

633
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:13,039
Okay, I get it.

634
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:15,791
You made your point,
you made a name for yourself,

635
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,627
but, Jack,
you need to undo this.

636
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,245
What makes you think
I could have undone it

637
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:20,880
in the first place?

638
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:22,131
They voted for that proposal

639
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,883
because it put more money
in their pockets,

640
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:25,301
and now it's there to stay.

641
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:28,087
By the way, if you want
to go mudding with someone,

642
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,306
why don't you ask
Harvey Specter?

643
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:33,142
Because it doesn't take a genius
to figure out

644
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:35,177
that he's the one that got you
to carry his water

645
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:36,345
in the first place.

646
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:44,103
Thanks.

647
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:45,855
I got you the special.

648
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:47,490
Did you say no pickles?

649
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:48,524
You didn't say no pickles.

650
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,759
I didn't say,
"Order my lunch."

651
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:51,193
So sue me.

652
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:52,745
You send the notification
over to Tanner?

653
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,829
Two hours ago.

654
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:57,783
Then it won't be long.

655
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:59,452
What?

656
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:01,671
I didn't say anything about your
state of mind after Tim Petroff

657
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:02,838
because I wasn't worried
about it then,

658
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:04,106
- but I am now.
- Mike--

659
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:06,025
- What if it doesn't work?
- It'll work.

660
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:07,576
- And what if it doesn't?
- Then it's on Tanner.

661
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:09,795
No, it's on you, because
I'm telling you right now,

662
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,080
Tanner is not driving
this thing.

663
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:12,982
Well, speak of the devil.

664
00:25:13,017 --> 00:25:15,368
You son of a bitch.

665
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,952
You filed criminal charges
against my client?

666
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:18,020
You're damn right we did.

667
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:19,972
She forged
a fake driver's license

668
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:21,307
and attached it to her W2.

669
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,876
- That's ten years of tax fraud.
- Oh, you piece of shit.

670
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:25,328
This is crossing the line
even for you.

671
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,846
For me?

672
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:29,098
Ever since the day I met you,
all you've done is cross lines,

673
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:31,033
and it started with you
ripping off cancer victims,

674
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:33,202
not to mention every other thing
you've ever done.

675
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:35,287
Hey, I told you
I am not that guy anymore.

676
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:37,790
Yeah, right before you tried
to ruin my client's life

677
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:39,875
with some bullshit
sexual harassment charge.

678
00:25:39,911 --> 00:25:41,894
Right after he padlocked
my client's livelihood.

679
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:43,446
Yeah, you're damn right he did!

680
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:44,747
- Harvey--
- Because if you're on a case

681
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:46,499
against me,
it's just a matter of time

682
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,117
until you eviscerate
someone I care about.

683
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:49,418
Eviscerate?

684
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:51,120
If I was gonna eviscerate
someone you cared about,

685
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:52,204
all I'd have to do
is point out

686
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:53,736
how Donna's no longer
working for you.

687
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,174
- Hey, get out of here, Tanner.
- She's working for Louis Litt.

688
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:56,842
- What did you just say to me?
- You heard me.

689
00:25:56,878 --> 00:25:58,494
And then I'd go up to her
and say, "What happened, Red?

690
00:25:58,529 --> 00:25:59,929
"Did Harvey get tired
of banging you?

691
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:01,630
"Or was he such a lousy lay
that you left him

692
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:03,265
"for the guy down the road
just like Harvey's mom

693
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:04,683
"did to dear, old Dad?"

694
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:07,370
Harvey! Harvey! Stop!

695
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:09,939
Tanner, get out of here now!

696
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:11,273
Go!

697
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,545
You're absolutely convinced

698
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:23,987
Tanner couldn't be
telling the truth?

699
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:25,698
What does it matter?

700
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:27,565
Well, you could be ruining
this woman's life.

701
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:28,700
That's not my problem.

702
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:30,335
So you don't believe
in second chances?

703
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,836
I didn't say that.

704
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:34,672
No, you just said a man you
didn't trust swore he changed.

705
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:37,218
And instead of giving him
a chance to prove that,

706
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,686
you launched an all-out war.

707
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,388
Were you listening
to my goddamn story?

708
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:41,473
Did you hear what he said?

709
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:43,158
That is not a man
that's changed.

710
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:45,126
No, I'm talking about
what you did.

711
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:46,594
You launched an all-out war.

712
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,796
I did that for my client.

713
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:49,030
And for your information,

714
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,965
I've given plenty of people
second chances.

715
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,101
- Like who?
- Louis, for one.

716
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:55,537
Mike.

717
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,539
Donna, Scottie,

718
00:26:57,591 --> 00:27:00,275
my brother, my...

719
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,511
Your what?

720
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:05,924
I thought we were talking
about the case.

721
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,993
We started by talking
about your dream.

722
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,661
Yeah, the one I had
because of my case.

723
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:13,031
Mm-hmm. And you said the woman
in that dream wasn't Donna.

724
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,691
But it doesn't add up,
because the man was Tanner

725
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,693
and you just told me what he
said about her the same day

726
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:18,926
that you had that dream.

727
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:19,927
Yeah, well, I don't care
if it doesn't add up

728
00:27:19,963 --> 00:27:21,163
because I'm telling the truth.

729
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:24,732
And yet you have tells
all over you that say otherwise.

730
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,219
Then you don't know what a tell
is, because I don't have any.

731
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,304
All right.

732
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,990
We'll see who knows
what a tell is.

733
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,509
You want to play poker with me?

734
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:36,778
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

735
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,846
I'm gonna play poker
with you.

736
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:41,682
And when I win,
and you're out of money,

737
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,885
you're gonna
tell me the truth.

738
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,291
And what do I get
when you're out of money?

739
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:49,127
It doesn't matter 'cause
it's never gonna happen.

740
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:58,870
- Hey.
- Hey.

741
00:27:58,906 --> 00:27:59,838
I need to talk to you
about something.

742
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:00,972
What's going on?

743
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,414
I just got a call
from Travis Tanner.

744
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:03,958
He wants me to meet him
in half an hour.

745
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:05,125
Well, you have to tell Harvey.

746
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:06,460
I left him two messages.

747
00:28:06,496 --> 00:28:07,628
He hasn't gotten back to me,
but even if he does,

748
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:09,096
he's gonna tell me not to go.

749
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:10,631
Well, then don't go.

750
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:12,493
You can't go behind
Harvey's back.

751
00:28:12,617 --> 00:28:14,083
That's the thing.

752
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,559
What if going to see Tanner is
more like having Harvey's back?

753
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:17,687
What are you talking about?

754
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:19,282
The client on the other side
of our case

755
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,224
made a fake ID ten years ago

756
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:23,426
and now Harvey's ready
to send her to prison for it,

757
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,061
and he's only doing it
because of Tanner.

758
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,396
Okay, but it's still
Harvey's call.

759
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,664
And if he makes that call
in his current state of mind,

760
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,366
he might regret it
for the rest of his life.

761
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:32,835
What do you mean,
his current state of mind?

762
00:28:36,574 --> 00:28:38,841
A couple of weeks ago,
I walked into Harvey's office

763
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:41,744
and he was having
a panic attack.

764
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,346
Oh, my God.

765
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:44,917
And on top of that, yesterday,

766
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:46,301
the two of them
got into a yelling match

767
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:50,572
that ended
with Harvey punching Tanner.

768
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:52,824
Okay, look.

769
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,543
Do whatever you have to do.

770
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:56,245
Have Harvey's back.

771
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:02,023
Where is he?

772
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:04,409
- I don't know.
- Bullshit, you don't know.

773
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,678
Jessica, I swear I haven't
seen him since last night.

774
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:10,214
Then I need to know,
did he lie to me?

775
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,751
Donna...
I've always trusted you.

776
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:16,087
Now I need you to trust me.

Yes.

779

as a therapist.

No, no, no, no.

792

You're here because your fears
are affecting your work,

799
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:22,569
and now you're trying to find
a time where I failed at my job

800
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,888
so that you can lash out at me.

801

And I'm not gonna
let you do it.

802
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:28,792
No, I just want you to know
what it feels like to be me

803
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,988
in here with you, and if
you're not willing to do that,

00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:33,480
then what the hell good are you?

805
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,137
I killed someone.

806
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,272
What?

807
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,274
I do a lot of work
as an expert witness

808
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,726
in corporate
competency situations.

809
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,612
- You mean substance abuse?
- Yes.

810
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,063

it's high-powered people

But this time
it was different.

813
00:30:56,109 --> 00:31:00,595
A client needed someone
to get his son out of rehab

814
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:02,547
so that he could attend
his mother's funeral.

815
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,549
I knew it was a mistake
to even get involved

816
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:08,687
because he wanted it so badly,
but he was a long-time client

817
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:10,956
and I cared about him,
so I did it.

818
00:31:11,754 --> 00:31:13,821
I evaluated his son.

inside he wasn't ready,

but I gave the go-ahead anyway,

821
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:23,864
and the night of the funeral,

822
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:27,201
he overdosed and died.

823
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:29,103

- Hmm.

824

Oh, let me help you out.

937
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,177
The reason you stopped yourself

is that you were going to say
Louis left it out.

But if you knew that,
and still didn't come forward,

then I can fire your ass
for that, too.

But you're not going to do that

And you can't afford

You're right.
I can't.

945
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:16,683
But I don't care,
because I'd rather fire you both
