1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,723
Previously on Suits...

2
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:04,159
Mike Ross never went to law school.

3
00:00:04,194 --> 00:00:07,729
I knew it, and I hired him anyway.

4
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:09,364
I still can't stay, Harvey.

5
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:10,966
You're making it seem like I'm the one

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,600
that's taking away your dream wedding.

7
00:00:12,636 --> 00:00:15,303
You are the one taking
away my dream wedding.

8
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:16,638
Nothing would make me happier

9
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:18,373
than to raise a glass to your new life,

10
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:19,440
but I can't.

11
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:20,642
Oh, so now I shouldn't get married.

12
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,010
No, I'm saying you should quit.

13
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:23,344
You tell me right now, why are you here?

14
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,780
- It's not that simple.
- Why are you here?

15
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:27,115
Because I'm afraid!

16
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,516
You're calling for an emergency vote

17
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:29,785
of no confidence today?

18
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,687
Take a picture, because
tomorrow morning,

19
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:33,689
those letters are coming down.

20
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:35,356
Why should I believe
you would even live up

21
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:36,558
to your end of the bargain?

22
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,259
Because I don't give a shit

23
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,095
about your war with Daniel Hardman.

24
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,932
All I want to do is see you get
down on your knees and say,

25
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:45,433
"I quit."

26
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:48,770
As of now, the company that's
been targeting our clients

27
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:51,306
is no longer represented
by Daniel Hardman.

28
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:54,642
All in favor of Jessica staying?

29
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,628
How exactly did you get that
termination letter for Forstman?

30
00:00:58,828 --> 00:01:00,148
I agreed to step down.

31
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:02,050
You are not going to step down.

32
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:04,419
You've given up
everything for this firm.

33
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:06,722
It's time someone gave
up something for you.

34
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:08,924
Harvey, you didn't
just give me my dream.

35
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,291
You gave me a family.

36
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,961
But I'm gonna have a
family of my own someday,

37
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:15,296
and I can't have all of this
hanging over their heads.

38
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:16,798
You don't have to do this for me.

39
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,466
I'm doing it for us,

40
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:19,801
'cause as long as you're with me...

41
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:20,869
I'm with you.

42
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:24,606
- Michael James Ross.
- Yes?

43
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:27,642
You're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit fraud.

44
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,994
Michael Ross, I'm Assistant U.S.
Attorney Anita Gibbs,

45
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:47,796
and unlike you, I'm a real attorney.

46
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,197
I'm not answering any questions

47
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,331
until I speak to my lawyer.

48
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,800
I heard you asked for him before,

49
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:54,169
but while we're waiting, I
just wanted to let you know

50
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:57,639
that I'm the one who's
gonna put you in jail.

51
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,041
Nothing?

52
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:03,278
Maybe you think that you've
committed a victimless crime,

53
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,281
but let me assure you, you haven't.

54
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:09,450
By my estimation, you've
worked on 88 legal cases

55
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:11,486
in your so-called career,

56
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,990
and you committed fraud every
time you picked up the phone,

57
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:16,925
mailed a letter, signed your name,

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,794
or appeared in court.

59
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:21,663
Each instance carries a
nine-month sentence,

60
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:22,964
and to tell you the truth,

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,833
I am too tired to do the addition.

62
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,168
Well, I'm not.

63
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:28,569
If what you're saying is true

64
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,305
and there's a limit of
one count per case,

65
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,841
then I'll be going to
prison for 66 years.

66
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:36,278
I've always been good at math.

67
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,545
Well, I haven't.

68
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,647
But what I am good at is putting away

69
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:42,150
fake, cocky tough guys like you

70
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:44,786
and seeing them break.

71
00:02:44,822 --> 00:02:47,355
So here's how this is gonna go.

72
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,325
You play ball, I go easy on you.

73
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,860
You don't...

74
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:54,296
in my experience,

75
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,231
college boys, even fake ones,

76
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,200
don't do well in prison.

77
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:01,937
And if you think your people

78
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:03,638
are rushing down here to bail you out,

79
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:05,040
you've got another thing coming,

80
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:07,909
because I'm gonna keep
you in here all night.

81
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:14,082
Okay.

82
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:17,452
I'll confess.

83
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:20,088
But I want the whole thing on tape.

84
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,263
Harvey, thank God. I
need to talk to you.

85
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,831
Rachel, calm down. What's going on?

86
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,032
- Mike's been arrested.
- What?

87
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,267
Two men from the U.S.
Attorney's Office...

88
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:34,169
they just walked right up to
him, and they arrested him.

89
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:35,503
I don't know what to do.

90
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,671
All right. It's gonna be okay.

91
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:37,973
It's not gonna be okay! He's by himself.

92
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:39,140
- We have to do something.
- I am.

93
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,408
I'm going down there right now.

94
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:41,376
No, you're not.

95
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,344
Jessica, this isn't up for you...

96
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:43,982
Harvey, from this second,

97
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:46,195
you are an unindicted co-conspirator,

98
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:47,271
and so am I.

99
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:48,359
And so are you,

100
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,362
which means none of us can
afford to be anywhere near Mike.

101
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,531
I don't care. Someone
has to do something.

102
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,167
And if it isn't going to be
you, it's going to be me.

103
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,601
You're gonna let her go down there?

104
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,404
Harvey, she can knock on
that door all she wants.

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,604
They're not gonna let
her see him tonight.

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,140
Besides, she's his fiancée.

107
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,042
Seeing him is not gonna
make her look guilty.

108
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,609
It's not gonna make me
look guilty either.

109
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,511
It makes me look like
I'm standing by my guy.

110
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,680
No, what's gonna keep
you from looking guilty

111
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,916
is you and I ripping up
your letter of resignation.

112
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,215
Jessica, I just made a
deal with Forstman.

113
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:15,716
He finds out that I'm still here,

114
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,418
he picks up the phone, calls Hardman,

115
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:19,119
and the two of them
pick this place apart.

116
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:20,755
And if whoever is prosecuting this case

117
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,222
finds out you left on the same night

118
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:24,140
they arrested Mike,

119
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,673
then we may as well turn ourselves in.

120
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,342
Which is why I need to get in there

121
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:31,113
and talk to Mike as his lawyer.

122
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:33,582
Then this is what's going to happen.

123
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,817
You are now his lawyer.

124
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,419
But you do whatever you have to do

125
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:38,686
to work out of your house,

126
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:41,689
because I'm not telling
anybody you resigned.

127
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:46,096
This is AUSA Anita Gibbs
with Michael Ross.

128
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,765
The time is 11:05 p.m.

129
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
Mr. Ross has agreed to confess,

130
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,902
with the stipulation that
he do it on videotape.

131
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:53,471
I actually never said I'd confess.

132
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:54,739
I said I'd talk.

133
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,425
You did say you'd confess.

134
00:04:58,428 --> 00:04:59,728
Maybe I did, but then again,

135
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,864
I also asked to see my lawyer at 9:03.

136
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:02,931
It's two hours later,

137
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,432
and I still haven't
been able to do that,

138
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:05,801
which means anything that I've said

139
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:07,970
between then and now is
not only inadmissible,

140
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,272
it's also evidence that
you violated my rights.

141
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:13,032
Oh, I get it. You just
wanted to get that on tape.

142
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,100
Sure did.

143
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:15,935
And if I don't see my lawyer in an hour,

144
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,837
you better be able to prove
that you've made every effort

145
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:20,707
to contact him and couldn't.

146
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:22,509
I know I'm not supposed
to know these things

147
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:25,845
because I'm not a lawyer, but I do...

148
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:28,415
Because I am.

149
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,216
Okay, you've had your fun.

150
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,651
Now I'm gonna have mine.

151
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,320
Your lawyer actually did
show up about half hour ago.

152
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,155
There seemed to be a
little miscommunication

153
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,557
about what room you were in,

154
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:39,392
but that's all been straightened out.

155
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:40,960
So...

156
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,430
here he is.

157
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,008
Robert.

158
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,243
Oh, I see.

159
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:51,345
You thought you were
gonna see Harvey Specter

160
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,047
come in this room so you two
could get your stories straight.

161
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:56,049
Apparently that's not gonna happen.

162
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:58,619
Now, normally this is the
part where I leave the room,

163
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:02,189
but almost looks like
you want me to stay.

164
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:05,225
Just so you know, we
can't watch or record

165
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:06,926
anything that happens in here...

166
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:09,863
attorney-client privilege and whatnot.

167
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:11,498
But if you're innocent of these charges,

168
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,233
I'm sure you have nothing to fear,

169
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,935
being alone in this room...

170
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:18,338
with that man.

171
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:00,944
What are you doing here, Robert?

172
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,113
Rachel called me and
asked me to help you.

173
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:05,482
- Is she okay?
- No.

174
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,189
She's not,

175
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,825
because she's out there,
and you're in here.

176
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,559
And so you're gonna tell me right now,

177
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:14,429
is this shit true?

178
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:15,730
Listen, I can explain everything.

179
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,731
I don't need an explanation!

180
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:17,966
I want an answer to
the goddamn question.

181
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,301
Lawyers don't ask that question.

182
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:20,735
I'm not asking you as your lawyer.

183
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,004
I'm asking you as a man.

184
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:29,507
You know what the answer is.

185
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:30,875
God damn it.

186
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,015
You wanted the truth,
and now you got it,

187
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,750
but you got to tell me what
are you doing here, Robert.

188
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:42,586
I told you, I'm here because
Rachel begged me to help you...

189
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:45,690
not because I give a shit
about what happens to you.

190
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,023
So you're gonna do exactly what I say,

191
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,759
and I'm gonna help you
get out of this thing.

192
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,664
No, there's no getting
out of this thing.

193
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,132
Oh, yes, there is, and
you damn well know it.

194
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,195
That woman doesn't get anything
by prosecuting a fraud like you,

195
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,164
but she would love to
get Harvey Specter.

196
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,231
I'm not turning on Harvey.

197
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,266
Oh, he would do

198
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,667
the same goddamn thing
to you in a heartbeat.

199
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:07,868
If you think that, then
you don't know Harvey.

200
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:09,170
You better listen to me!

201
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,605
You better get your
head out of your ass,

202
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,607
because I'm throwing you
a goddamn lifeline.

203
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:14,975
It's the only chance you're gonna get

204
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,145
to save what's left of
your miserable life.

205
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,986
I won't do it.

206
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,622
Then you are on your own.

207
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:27,602
Robert, please...

208
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,370
Whatever you're gonna say...

209
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:30,806
don't say it.

210
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:33,870
The truth is, you're doing me a favor,

211
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,272
because after I got you out of this,

212
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:36,773
I was gonna tell you to
stay away from Rachel

213
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,141
for the rest of your life,

214
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:41,078
but I don't have to do it now,

215
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:43,647
because you're gonna wind
up in prison anyway.

216
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:59,522
Louis.

217
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:02,157
- What's going on?
- Donna, I need to come in.

218
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,262
What happened?

219
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,698
Donna, I need you to sit down.

220
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,968
- Louis...
- I said you need to sit down.

221
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,737
What happened to Harvey?

222
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:16,338
Please tell me that he's okay.

223
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:18,407
Mike's been arrested.

224
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:21,010
Oh, my God.

225
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:23,045
- We have to go see him.
- No, no, no.

226
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,413
We can't go anywhere near him.

227
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,549
- What?
- You can't go down there.

228
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:28,751
Louis, so help me God, if
you turn your back on Mike

229
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:30,887
and you claim that this has
nothing to do with you...

230
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:31,988
Just listen to me.

231
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:33,122
You're gonna want to
do everything you can

232
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,824
to get to Mike and express your support,

233
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:36,392
but I am telling you,

234
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,494
that is a bad idea.

235
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,762
Then I need to talk to Harvey.

236
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,130
No, you don't.

237
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,440
You need to stay the
hell away from him, too,

238
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:46,310
and count your blessings that
you don't work for him anymore,

239
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:47,477
'cause if all of a sudden

240
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,346
you start showing up on his doorstep,

241
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,682
you are gonna find yourself next
up on the prosecutor's list.

242
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,451
Louis, this is Mike and
Harvey we're talking about.

243
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:56,153
- They're family.
- I am not saying they're not.

244
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:58,289
I'm saying the more contact
you have with them,

245
00:09:58,324 --> 00:09:59,723
the worse it is for all of us.

246
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:03,260
Okay, I won't go down there.

247
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,501
But I am going to see Rachel,

248
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:07,170
and if you think you're gonna stop me,

249
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,905
you are out of your mind.

250
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,745
I am telling you, I am his attorney.

251
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,813
If you don't let me see him,

252
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,581
I'm gonna break through that door.

253
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,150
You can bluster all you want,
but you're not getting in

254
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:22,518
because he's already with his attorney.

255
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:24,486
- What?
- You dirty son of a bitch.

256
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:25,688
Robert, calm down.

257
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,156
I'm not calming shit.

258
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,891
You brought this kid into my life.

259
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,827
You put my daughter's
future in jeopardy.

260
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,261
- Look, I know you're upset...
- Upset?

261
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:35,631
You're lucky I don't
lay you out right now.

262
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,136
Robert, listen to me.

263
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,138
Mike Ross is a good man.

264
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,607
He came to me from nothing.

265
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,941
I saw something in him,

266
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,576
and you did, too, and
that's why you're here.

267
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,177
No, I was here to get
him to turn on you,

268
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,679
but he's too stupid to do that.

269
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,153
And I don't know if he's gonna
change his mind or not,

270
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:51,487
but I don't care anymore,

271
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:56,092
and I don't give a damn if I
ever see either of you again.

272
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,427
Did you hear that?

273
00:10:57,462 --> 00:10:59,729
He's not Mike Ross's
attorney anymore... I am.

274
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:01,798
So let me the hell in.

275
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:07,303
Robert Zane? Really?

276
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:08,504
I'm hurt.

277
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,040
- Harvey, this is real.
- I know.

278
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,942
And the first we need to figure
out is who tipped them off.

279
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,309
Why the hell do we need to do that?

280
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:14,578
Because if we're gonna
get you out of this,

281
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:16,179
we have to know every damn
thing they have on you.

282
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:17,647
Are you crazy? There's
no getting out of this.

283
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,849
I haven't lost a case before,
and I'm not about to start now.

284
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:21,184
This isn't just some other case.

285
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:22,719
They're gonna check the
facts, and when they do...

286
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:24,253
They're gonna find
what we let them find.

287
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,695
- You can't know that.
- Yes, I can.

288
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:28,696
- That's bullshit!
- This is not bullshit!

289
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:29,964
Look, we can win this case.

290
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,699
I don't care about winning this thing.

291
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:32,667
What the hell is wrong with you?

292
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:34,402
Harvey, I did this!

293
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:49,030
You didn't do shit because
they don't have shit.

294
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,767
What the hell are you talking about?

295
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:56,304
Mike, you're in the Harvard database.

296
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,172
You have a transcript.

297
00:11:58,207 --> 00:11:59,340
You're in the bar.

298
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,309
You're a practicing attorney.

299
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:02,810
Those facts are real,

300
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:04,412
just like every case you ever worked on

301
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:06,347
and every person you've
helped along the way.

302
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,541
Harvey, this woman's not joking.

303
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,844
That woman has to show you're a fraud,

304
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,813
but as far as the world knows,
you're a goddamn lawyer,

305
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,447
and that's the way it's gonna stay.

306
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:17,949
And don't forget...

307
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,450
we don't need to prove you're a lawyer.

308
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,820
She needs to prove you're not.

309
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,190
Rachel, calm down.

310
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:26,457
I can't calm down.

311
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,559
No one will tell me anything.
I can't go and see him.

312
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:29,995
It is the worst moment of his life,

313
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,640
and I'm not there for him.

314
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:32,706
Well, you will be when you can.

315
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:34,074
On top of all that,

316
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,843
I don't know what my dad's
gonna do when he gets there.

317
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,146
You called your dad?

318
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,382
Rachel, I don't think
that was a good idea.

319
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:42,883
Well, I couldn't just sit
here and do nothing.

320
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,117
Mike's been arrested.

321
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:46,987
Jessica's talking about
unindicted co-conspirators.

322
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,789
Okay, well then, he and Harvey
will just have to work it out.

323
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:50,391
And what if they don't?

324
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,889
Rachel, when I was in trouble,

325
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,590
Harvey got me out of it.

326
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,225
This is what he does.

327
00:12:56,261 --> 00:13:00,129
I am telling you, he will
get Mike out of this.

328
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:01,563
It's just...

329
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,467
The thought of him...

330
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,970
in there all alone.

331
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:10,373
He'll be okay.

332
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:13,575
It's just one night.

333
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:23,511
Man, what are you looking at?

334
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:24,579
Nothing.

335
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,348
Your eyes are going up
and down on me, man.

336
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:28,783
It don't feel like nothing.

337
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,786
They all say, "Nothing.
Wasn't doing nothing."

338
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:35,056
It don't matter what you say
and do once you're inside.

339
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:37,459
Little snot like you won't last a week.

340
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:41,420
You hear what I said?

341
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:42,888
You won't last a week in there.

342
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,490
You might not last a night in here.

343
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,858
Listen, man...

344
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,695
Hey! Get your hands off
him, you piece of shit.

345
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,364
You're lucky, but they
won't be here all night.

346
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,599
Yeah, neither will you.

347
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:54,767
Hey, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

348
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,836
Leave him in here with me. It's cool.

349
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,037
I mean, unless you're gonna
let a federal marshal

350
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,873
beat the shit out of me
just to try and scare me

351
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,140
into making a deal.

352
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,347
Agent Ron Da'Mico, right?

353
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:14,145
Yeah, I saw your picture out in the hall

354
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,380
getting a commendation from the U.S.
Attorney.

355
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,083
Of course, you didn't have
a beard in that photo,

356
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,717
but you look the same to me.

357
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:23,020
You're a smart kid.

358
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:25,289
I guess that's how you got away
with what you got away with.

359
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:29,927
But you didn't really get
away with it, did you?

360
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:33,282
I am a marshal, but the
next guy won't be,

361
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,184
and you give him that
know-it-all attitude,

362
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:37,687
and like I said, you won't last a night.

363
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:42,659
Yeah, well, for the record,
I'm not getting sent away,

364
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:45,427
but even if I was, it wouldn't
be a place like that.

365
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:47,864
Oh, if you think you're
going to Club Fed...

366
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,599
You don't know Anita Gibbs.

367
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:52,334
Sleep well, sweetheart.

368
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,466
How is he?

369
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,101
He's in custody.

370
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:15,228
And the bail hearing?

371
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:16,696
I don't know,

372
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,163
because I'm not representing him.

373
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,865
Now, are you done asking me questions?

374
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,200
Because I have a few of my own,

375
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,270
like how the hell could you do this?

376
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,372
Dad, because I love him.

377
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,407
That's sweet, but you
sound like a teenager,

378
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,742
and right now your mother is sobbing,

379
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,143
knowing what you've done to yourself.

380
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:35,379
Dad, Mike is the same man
that you worked with.

381
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:37,081
And you said yourself there are things

382
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,316
that you did in your past
that you're not proud of.

383
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,252
Don't you dare compare me to him.

384
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,410
I am not a fraud.

385
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:45,044
I am not a criminal.

386
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:53,653
Rachel...

387
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:57,190
Rachel...

388
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,832
I tried to get him out,

389
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:01,467
but he's living in a dream world,

390
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,302
and so are you if you
think this boy is done

391
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,336
ruining your life.

392
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,572
Why did you even come here?

393
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,697
I came here to tell you
to look in the mirror

394
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:11,166
and get rid of him.

395
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,105
I can't do that.

396
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,559
Then I can't help you.

397
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,615
I was wondering when you
were gonna pay me a visit.

398
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,650
You know who I am?

399
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:50,984
I know everyone in my crosshairs.

400
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:53,353
Now pass me the cream and
tell me what you want.

401
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,522
I want to know why you
arrested my associate

402
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,090
without just cause.

403
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,692
Because Mike Ross is a fraud,

404
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,327
and I'm gonna make sure he never sees

405
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,895
the inside of a courtroom again,

406
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,830
unless he's wearing an orange jumpsuit.

407
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,184
If you'll excuse me,

408
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:08,018
I have an arraignment to prepare for.

409
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,854
What if I was to tell you off the record

410
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,622
Mike Ross was about to resign?

411
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,457
I'd say that sounds very convenient.

412
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,159
Well, it isn't. I'm
telling you the truth.

413
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:17,260
And if your interest really is

414
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:18,729
in getting him out of the courtroom,

415
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:19,963
he was gonna do it himself.

416
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,531
And why should I believe you?

417
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,533
I can get you his letter of resignation.

418
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:24,935
All you have to do is waive charges,

419
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,638
and I'll get him to agree
never to practice law again.

420
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:31,489
I'll tell you what I'll do.

421
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:34,525
You get me that letter,
and I'll waive his bail.

422
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,726
I don't need you to waive bail.

423
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,060
Whatever it is, he can pay for it.

424
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:39,296
No, he can't. I'll freeze his assets.

425
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:42,833
In fact, I'll make sure that
he doesn't get bail at all,

426
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,035
because hacking into the
bar is a federal crime,

427
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,336
and if he can do that,

428
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:48,271
he sure as hell can flee the country.

429
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:50,509
You have no proof he
hacked into the bar.

430
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,544
Doesn't matter. It's
what he's accused of.

431
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:55,646
So you want to make sure he
walks out of court today,

432
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,482
you bring me the letter.

433
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,507
That better be you calling
down to my office

434
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,043
to explain why your golden boy

435
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:15,145
was arrested for fraud last night.

436
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,080
My golden boy?

437
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:18,848
You're the one that
nominated him for partner.

438
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:21,151
Because you passed him
over again and again,

439
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,986
and I knew there was a reason for it,

440
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:25,388
but now I know what it was.

441
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:27,857
- Just what are you implying?
- I'm not implying anything.

442
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:29,292
You knew that kid was a fraud,

443
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:31,061
and even if you didn't, you should have.

444
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:32,495
So what is it?

445
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,264
Are you corrupt, or are
you just so stupid

446
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,999
you didn't know what was
going on in your own firm?

447
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,468
Watch who you're calling stupid, Jack,

448
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:42,047
'cause you were the only idiot with his
hands in his pockets at that vote.

449
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,271
I didn't have their support then,

450
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,039
but I will now, because Harvey's protégé

451
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:47,141
just got perp-walked out of this firm.

452
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,401
And since then, Harvey's
nowhere to be found.

453
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:52,136
Harvey's whereabouts are
none of your concern.

454
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,738
Well, the partners are concerned.

455
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:55,699
They need a leader they can trust.

456
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
And I'll bet someone's
trying to convince them

457
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,735
that leader is you.

458
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,036
Well, look at that.

459
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:02,439
You do know what's going on
in your own firm after all.

460
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,475
I'm gonna give you some advice
from the throne, free of charge.

461
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:09,346
You attack this firm's
leadership when it's in crisis

462
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,582
over an unproven allegation...

463
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,084
you're gonna look like a bottom-feeder.

464
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,283
And even if they vote me out,

465
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:20,387
they sure as hell won't vote you in.

466
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,206
Donna, what are you doing here?

467
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,708
Gretchen told me you
weren't feeling well,

468
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:31,142
so I dropped by to see how you're doing

469
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,778
and tell you to cut the bullshit.

470
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:34,145
I don't understand.

471
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,415
You've never taken a
sick day in your life,

472
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,549
and Mike just got arrested,

473
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,684
so I want to know what
the hell is going on.

474
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,520
I can't be in the office right now.

475
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,556
Why not?

476
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:46,190
Because I resigned.

477
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,992
What?

478
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,294
Because of Mike?

479
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,229
Because it's the only way to
get Forstman to back off.

480
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,764
I don't care about Forstman.

481
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,166
You're leaving the firm
when we need you the most?

482
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,837
Donna, right now I have to
stay away from the office,

483
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,371
but I'm not leaving anyone.

484
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,506
I'm representing Mike.

485
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,607
So you saw him.

486
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,776
- Last night.
- And?

487
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:05,877
He's hanging in.

488
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,648
I just need this bail
hearing to go smoothly.

489
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:10,382
What do you mean, go smoothly?
What's going on?

490
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,783
The prosecutor's playing hardball.

491
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,285
She's trying to keep him without bail.

492
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,154
Harvey, Rachel is not doing well.

493
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:17,222
You have to get him out of there.

494
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:20,192
Then I need you

495
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,461
to get something from the office for me.

496
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,996
"HI"

497
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:35,835
I understand you've reached
an agreement to waive bail?

498
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,836
We have, Your Honor.

499
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,871
No bail is requested at this time.

500
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,840
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

501
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,842
However, I would like
to introduce a motion

502
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:46,378
to have Mr. Specter removed
as attorney for Mr. Ross.

503
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,612
- What?
- On what grounds?

504
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:48,981
On the grounds that they conspired

505
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:51,951
to defraud the bar association,
every client they ever had,

506
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,452
and the people of the United States.

507
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,954
What's your proof?

508
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,456
This letter showing Mr.
Ross was going to resign.

509
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,091
They conspired to fabricate it.

510
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,293
- We had a deal.
- I don't care what we had.

511
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:04,312
The two of them concocted a story

512
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,414
under the guise of
attorney-client privilege,

513
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:07,783
which they were only able to do

514
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,351
because Mr. Specter is both
his boss and his attorney.

515
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:12,054
I gave you that letter in good faith.

516
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:14,289
You gave me that letter
in a blatant attempt

517
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:16,825
to get me to drop charges
against your co-conspirator.

518
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,127
That is slander and inadmissible.

519
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:22,998
That's enough. My chambers...
ten minutes.

520
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,468
- You gave her that letter?
- I did it to get you out.

521
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,037
I don't care about getting bail

522
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:30,405
if it lands us both in prison.

523
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,873
It's not gonna land us in prison,

524
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:33,141
and it would've come out anyway.

525
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:34,876
We can't just destroy
every piece of evidence.

526
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:36,377
Oh, we can't do anything
with any piece of evidence

527
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:37,979
because she's about to get
you kicked off my case.

528
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:39,581
She has no grounds to kick me off.

529
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:40,916
We didn't conspire to write that letter.

530
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,483
But we conspired to do something else,

531
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,551
in case you forgot.

532
00:21:43,587 --> 00:21:44,986
Then we better come up with something,

533
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,722
and we better come up with it fast.

534
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,063
I'm not in the habit of
removing counsel, Ms. Gibbs.

535
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,965
And I'm not in the habit
of having an accomplice

536
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,586
be the attorney on a case.

537
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,019
I'm entitled to representation.

538
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:01,120
And you had it last night.

539
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,690
Your attorney of record
is listed as Robert Zane.

540
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:06,395
The only reason you
want me off this case

541
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:08,632
is so you can pressure
Robert into making my client

542
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,133
take your bullshit offer.

543
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,801
The reason I want you off this case

544
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:13,770
is because you're an
unindicted co-conspirator.

545
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:15,705
If he's an unindicted
co-conspirator, then so are you.

546
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:16,740
Excuse me?

547
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:17,974
You violated my client's rights

548
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,844
the night he was arrested,
and we have it on tape.

549
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:25,189
That is a complete fabrication
based on the word of a con man.

550
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:26,924
An alleged con man with
a photographic memory,

551
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,159
Your Honor.

552
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:29,461
And what does that have
to do with anything?

553
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:30,862
Because if I'm lying
about a digital tape,

554
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:32,130
then how do I know the serial number

555
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:34,332
of the camera you use
in your interrogation?

556
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,490
RKZ986532.

557
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:41,861
Little piece of blue tape
keeping the battery attached.

558
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,122
You want to remove your motion,

559
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:47,791
or do I have to subpoena that camera?

560
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:49,427
I'll withdraw my motion, Your Honor.

561
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:51,329
You're free to go, Mr. Ross,

562
00:22:51,364 --> 00:22:53,131
and Mr. Specter is your attorney.

563
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,455
All this proves is that you
two were in on this together.

564
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,791
What this proves is you'll
do anything to win,

565
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:07,393
and now the judge knows it, and so do I.

566
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,291
Louis, put down whatever you're doing.

567
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,225
What do you need?

568
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,427
I need you to make sure

569
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,028
there's nothing in the
bylaws Jack Soloff can use

570
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,431
to call for a vote and get me out.

571
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:22,974
Well, I can tell you right now,

572
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,509
he can't do anything for two weeks,

573
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:26,144
but after that, there's nothing
we can do to stop him.

574
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,846
Then I need you to figure out a Plan B,

575
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:28,913
because in two weeks...

576
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,349
Wait a second. Why isn't Harvey here?

577
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,383
What do you mean?

578
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:32,751
I mean it's his firm as much as ours.

579
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,253
He's the one who started
this whole thing,

580
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:37,203
so there must be a reason he's not here.

581
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:38,569
Harvey's working on Mike's defense.

582
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:40,638
Oh, God damn it, that
makes us all look guilty

583
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:42,407
and puts us all in jeopardy, Jessica.

584
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:44,209
That was my reaction too.

585
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:45,543
And then I realized

586
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:48,146
this allows us to communicate
with Mike and each other,

587
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:49,280
and it's all privileged.

588
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,516
Then I want it said right now...

589
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:52,517
Donna stays out of it.

590
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:53,885
That's not gonna be a problem,

591
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,354
because Harvey doesn't
work here anymore.

592
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,355
What?

593
00:23:57,391 --> 00:24:00,748
He resigned to get Forstman to back off.

594
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,148
Well, then let me guess...

595
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:03,817
the prosecutor can't know he did that,

596
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,518
and Forstman can't know he didn't.

597
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:07,153
- Exactly.
- Jesus Christ, Jessica.

598
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:08,688
If Harvey's not here, that even makes us

599
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,056
more vulnerable to Jack.

600
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:12,058
Which is why I need you to step up

601
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:14,160
and figure out a way to
keep that son of a bitch

602
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,695
from taking me out.

603
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,442
Are you okay?

604
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:32,710
I am now.

605
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,433
You're out.

606
00:24:40,468 --> 00:24:44,804
And I have no intention
of ever going back in.

607
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:47,807
What are we gonna do now?

608
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:50,108
I'll you what we're gonna do.

609
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:51,977
We're gonna go on offense.

610
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,412
What does that mean?

611
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,748
It means finding out what she
knows and how she knows it.

612
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:57,350
And it starts with us
getting into a room,

613
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:59,618
making a list of every goddamn person

614
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,253
who knows the truth.

615
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:08,393
Donna, what are you doing in here?

616
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:09,660
I need your help.

617
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:10,828
Don't you mean, "Thanks
for working late, Donna.

618
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:12,163
May I ask for you
assistance with something?"

619
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,498
No, I mean Jack Soloff

620
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,533
is crawling up our collective
asses, and I need you to...

621
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:18,603
- What is that?
- It's a private matter.

622
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:21,239
Mike Ross's employment records?

623
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:22,440
God damn it, Donna.

624
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:23,874
- You're doing work for Harvey?
- Louis...

625
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,478
I explicitly told you to
stay away from Mike's case.

626
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:29,080
And I heard you.

627
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:32,517
I just don't care.

628
00:25:32,893 --> 00:25:37,295
- What did you say to me?
- I said I don't care.

629
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:40,165
Well, I forbid you to do this.

630
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,167
Excuse me?

631
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:45,741
Donna, I don't think you get it.

632
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,009
There is going to come a time

633
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,477
where you're gonna have to choose

634
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:51,263
between yourself and them,

635
00:25:51,264 --> 00:25:54,032
and I am not going to let
you throw your life away

636
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:55,300
for either one of them.

637
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:56,735
You know what, Louis?

638
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,338
If they're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come for me.

639
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:02,073
But until then, if Mike
and Harvey need my help,

640
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:05,344
I'm gonna give it to them.

641
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:07,111
And if you have a problem with that,

642
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:08,947
you might as well fire me.

643
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,827
Robert?

644
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:36,003
When Rachel first told me she
didn't want to work for me,

645
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:39,773
we fought all night.

646
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,411
I didn't think any other
firm was good enough.

647
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:46,465
And then she told me she
was gonna work for you,

648
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,901
and that changed everything.

649
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:51,337
A brilliant black woman,

650
00:26:51,372 --> 00:26:53,806
mentor for my baby girl,

651
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:55,041
someone who could teach her

652
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:56,675
what the world does to people like us...

653
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:58,277
how to get down in the mud

654
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:02,215
and still manage to keep her dignity.

655
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,703
And look at what you taught her instead.

656
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,459
Is that what you came here to tell me?

657
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:15,756
I came here to tell you to fire Rachel,

658
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:18,059
because she won't quit.

659
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,594
And when they come at
him to turn on you,

660
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,232
I don't want her within
1,000 miles of this place.

661
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,034
I'm sorry, Robert.

662
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:29,370
I can't do that.

663
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:32,240
And you know why.

664
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,142
I do...

665
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:42,217
Because it makes him look guilty...

666
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:43,619
which he already is.

667
00:27:43,654 --> 00:27:45,520
And when they ask me to help to get him

668
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:47,589
to turn on you, I'm gonna
recommend that he does.

669
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,258
You do what you need to do,

670
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,360
and I'll do what I need
to do to save my firm.

671
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:52,728
It doesn't matter what you do.

672
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:54,863
Your firm is gonna
crumble all around you.

673
00:27:54,898 --> 00:27:57,599
- Is that a threat?
- I don't have to threaten you.

674
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,868
I don't have to lift a finger,

675
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:01,470
because people are gonna come at you

676
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:04,439
from places you didn't
even know existed,

677
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,776
and I'm gonna enjoy every second of it.

678
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,670
Louis, if you wanted to see me,

679
00:28:16,706 --> 00:28:18,138
you didn't have to send me a message

680
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:19,306
telling me to meet you here.

681
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:20,775
I did that because I
have a foolproof plan

682
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,376
to stop Jack before
he even gets started.

683
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:24,645
- Well, let's hear it.
- Make me managing partner.

684
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,647
- Come again?
- It's the perfect solution.

685
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:28,516
I step in, target's off your back,

686
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:30,951
and we're fine till this all blows over.

687
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,366
I don't believe this.

688
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:34,867
You want my goddamn job.

689
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,369
What? It's not like that.

690
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:38,471
No one thinks that I have
anything to do with Mike.

691
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:39,973
My ethics are beyond reproach.

692
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:42,042
I don't recall them
being beyond reproach

693
00:28:42,077 --> 00:28:44,544
when you used Mike's secret
to get your name on the wall.

694
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:46,316
- Jessica, that...
- Louis.

695
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:47,550
You are out for yourself,

696
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:49,284
and I'm not going to stand for it.

697
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,786
How the hell could you say that to me

698
00:28:50,822 --> 00:28:52,187
after you just told me to step up?

699
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:53,489
You want to step up,

700
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,459
then do what I goddamn told you
to do and don't come to me

701
00:28:56,494 --> 00:29:00,396
with some "I'm not part of this"
Mike Ross bullshit ever again.

702
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,057
I was wondering how long
it was going to take you.

703
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,258
- You heard?
- Everybody's heard.

704
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,727
Scottie, I have something to ask you,

705
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,662
and you're not gonna like what it is.

706
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,665
I can't believe it. You
think I would do that?

707
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,533
No, I know you'd never do that.

708
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,768
Then what are you doing here?

709
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,003
Mike thought it could be you,

710
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,605
and I promised him I'd look
you in the eye and ask.

711
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,239
Okay, so let me get this straight...

712
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:38,689
I keep Mike's secret,
throw a case for you,

713
00:29:38,724 --> 00:29:40,324
and now you're here
taking orders from him

714
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,525
because you don't trust me?

715
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,261
I do trust you, and I told Mike I did.

716
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:47,031
Which is why the real reason you're here

717
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:49,000
is not to ask me if I handed him in,

718
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:50,234
but to tell me to keep quiet.

719
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:52,569
Not to tell you... to ask
you if you're going to.

720
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:53,837
What is the difference?

721
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:54,938
Scottie...

722
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:57,884
Harvey, I am not in your life anymore.

723
00:29:58,085 --> 00:29:59,084
I mean, what makes you think

724
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,485
that they're going to come to me?

725
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,987
'Cause you know how this works.

726
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:03,521
They're gonna dig into my personal life,

727
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:05,156
and when they do,
they're gonna find you.

728
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:07,692
And how many women like me are
you paying a visit to today?

729
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,462
There are no women like
you, and you know that.

730
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,030
What I know is, the last
time you came to me,

731
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:15,166
I told you I never wanted to
hear Mike Ross's name again,

732
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:17,502
and once again, here you are,
asking me to do something

733
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:19,304
for the person that
destroyed our relationship.

734
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:22,273
Scottie, I'm not here to argue with you.

735
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,210
But you still want to know
what I'm going to do?

736
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:27,078
I do.

737
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:30,620
Well, I guess we're just gonna have
to find that out when they come.

738
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:46,616
I need to talk to you.

739
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:48,418
Look, we've already
discussed all there is

740
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:49,719
to discuss about the wedding.

741
00:30:49,754 --> 00:30:51,821
I can't go, so unless you've quit...

742
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:53,556
I was arrested.

743
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:54,557
What?

744
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:55,992
Two nights ago, in my office,

745
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:58,961
two U.S. Marshals grabbed
me out of the blue.

746
00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:01,312
- I'm sorry.
- You can save your sorrys.

747
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:03,114
I want to know if you're
the one who turned me in.

748
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,349
What?

749
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,018
Jesus Christ, I can't
believe you'd think that.

750
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:07,352
Why wouldn't I?

751
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,154
You've done it before, and
you also told Father Walker,

752
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,856
and I still haven't heard
you say that it wasn't you.

753
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:12,223
Well, it wasn't me.

754
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:14,626
Going to Father Walker was about
making things right in my life.

755
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:16,428
Yeah, well, I got a way you can
make things right with me.

756
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:17,629
They're gonna come to you

757
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,031
to put together a case against me,

758
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,933
and I need to know
what you're gonna say.

759
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:22,903
I don't know what I'm
gonna say, Michael.

760
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:24,438
Do you want to write
down my answers for me

761
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:25,772
like you used to before class?

762
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:28,241
Yeah, I do. And this time,
the answer's gonna be,

763
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:30,477
- "I need to speak to my lawyer."
- Wow.

764
00:31:30,512 --> 00:31:33,012
20 years of friendship all
comes down to "lawyer up"?

765
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:34,814
Yeah, it does, and you owe me, Trevor.

766
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:36,116
I can't lie for you, Mike.

767
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:37,417
I'm not asking you to lie for me.

768
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:38,685
I'm asking you to pay me back

769
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,321
for every time in my life
you have screwed me over.

770
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:45,358
Okay.

771
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:47,522
But I'm not doing this
to make it up to you.

772
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:49,223
I'm doing this to make sure my family

773
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:50,725
doesn't get dragged into this.

774
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:52,627
So don't bother me with this again,

775
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,063
or I may just have to tell
them everything I know.

776
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:13,897
I see you can dish it out.

777
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,399
The question is, can you take a punch?

778
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,667
Why don't you put the gloves on?

779
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:17,835
We can find out.

780
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,370
I don't know if you've noticed,

781
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,339
but we're already in the ring,
and you're not in my class.

782
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:22,440
What are you doing here?

783
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:23,707
I just wanted to look you in the eye

784
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:26,477
and ask if you still work
at Pearson Specter Litt.

785
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:27,778
Excuse me?

786
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,614
I stopped by your office
to see if you were serious

787
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,649
about pleading this thing
out, and you weren't there.

788
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,284
So I asked your secretary
when you'd be coming back,

789
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,985
and she got very cagey.

790
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:38,122
And now I find you here, boxing
in the middle of the day.

791
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:39,947
I'm blowing off steam.

792
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:41,314
I don't think so.

793
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,852
I think I was wrong
about you and Mr. Ross

794
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:46,954
fabricating a letter of resignation.

795
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:48,589
And I think Jessica Pearson

796
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:50,290
found out what you two were up to,

797
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,225
and rather than making
herself look like a fool

798
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,493
by handing you in,

799
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:55,462
she forced you both to resign.

800
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:57,064
And now you're on your own.

801
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:58,432
And I think if you
want to write fiction,

802
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:01,401
I hear they got a remedial class at NYU.

803
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:03,891
Maybe I'm wrong.

804
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:07,262
Maybe Jessica knew about
Mike Ross all along,

805
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:11,232
in which case, maybe
you would turn on her.

806
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:13,593
Why don't you get the hell out
of here before I turn on you?

807
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:14,902
I will.

808
00:33:14,938 --> 00:33:16,904
But if I find out you resigned,

809
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,773
that's evidence you're a co-conspirator.

810
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:20,875
And I'll not only get you off this case.

811
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,512
I'll put you behind bars
along with your little pet.

812
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,027
What the hell is this?

813
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,729
You know what it is. It's formal notice.

814
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:43,364
Your services are no longer required.

815
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,799
I don't believe this.

816
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,534
You're firing me? Yes, I am.

817
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:47,902
And I want you to pack
your things up tonight,

818
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:50,171
because you and I don't see eye
to eye on your priorities.

819
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:51,872
Okay, Louis...

820
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,174
just because we had a fight...

821
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:55,335
No, this has nothing to do with that.

822
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:56,803
So you're saying that
this has nothing to do

823
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:57,937
with you lashing out at me

824
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,338
because of the fight we had before?

825
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:01,474
No, it doesn't, because
among other things,

826
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,509
you set your own hours,
you can't take dictation,

827
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:06,680
and to top all that, you
can't read people for shit!

828
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:10,984
What's going on?

829
00:34:15,656 --> 00:34:19,257
You almost went to jail for
helping them once before,

830
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,426
and I couldn't take that.

831
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:26,064
And the thought of
losing you once again...

832
00:34:26,424 --> 00:34:29,092
So you know that they need my help.

833
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:30,393
Yeah.

834
00:34:30,428 --> 00:34:32,695
I do.

835
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,098
Now you're free to go.

836
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:38,272
What made you change your mind?

837
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:40,908
Jessica accused me of not
being a team player.

838
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:44,811
And she was wrong about me, and...

839
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,947
I was wrong about you.

840
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:50,751
Thank you, Louis.

841
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:53,354
I have to go.

842
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,656
No, Louis.

843
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:58,259
You don't.

844
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,815
What are you doing here?

845
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:20,884
Our conversation got cut
short the other night.

846
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,553
So Anita Gibbs sent you here to tell me

847
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:25,188
that if I go to prison, I'm
not gonna come out the same.

848
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,457
You're right. She did.

849
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,659
She wanted me to come here and
scare the shit out of you,

850
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:29,727
tell you about everything

851
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:31,262
that's gonna be happening to you inside.

852
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,863
And who says I'm ever gonna be inside?

853
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,265
Maybe you won't.

854
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,233
But if you do, I'm here to tell you

855
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,034
everything that's gonna
happen on the outside.

856
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,536
Why don't you get the hell out of here?

857
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:41,838
Listen to me. Anita's going
to come to you with a deal,

858
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,607
and it's not gonna be
through Harvey Specter.

859
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,175
And if you're smart, you'll take it.

860
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,610
I said get the hell out.

861
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:49,251
All right, I'll go. Just
let me tell you something.

862
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:51,852
They don't have conjugal
visits in federal prison.

863
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:54,755
And even if they did,
I've seen your fiancée.

864
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,292
She's smart. She's beautiful.

865
00:35:57,327 --> 00:35:58,927
She has a future.

866
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:00,528
Girls like that don't wait around,

867
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:02,630
no matter what they say.

868
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,434
Hey.

869
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,769
Hey.

870
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,838
- There's...
- I wanted to talk...

871
00:36:22,873 --> 00:36:26,542
Sorry. You go first.

872
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:29,678
My father was here.

873
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:33,181
That woman went to him
and offered a deal.

874
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:35,283
Let me guess...

875
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,519
they want me to turn on Harvey.

876
00:36:37,555 --> 00:36:38,854
They'll drop all the charges,

877
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:42,249
and you won't have to
spend a minute in prison.

878
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,516
What did you tell him?

879
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:46,619
I told him that I would
give you the message.

880
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:51,612
That you'd give me the message?

881
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:53,848
Rachel, you know there's no way in hell

882
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:55,583
I am ever gonna turn on them, right?

883
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:57,017
- You know that.
- Yes, I do.

884
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:58,586
- Do you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

885
00:36:58,621 --> 00:36:59,720
It means that you should have told him

886
00:36:59,756 --> 00:37:01,054
that I'm loyal to everyone in my life,

887
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,590
and I would rather go to
jail than betray them.

888
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,924
I did tell him that.

889
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:05,559
So then why didn't you tell
me that you told him that?

890
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:07,094
Because that's not what you asked me.

891
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:08,829
Tell me right now that the
idea never crossed your mind

892
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:09,997
that I should take this deal.

893
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:12,266
Of course it popped into
my head for a second...

894
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:13,868
So you think that I
should just turn on them

895
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:15,302
the second things look bad?

896
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:16,771
That is not what I said.

897
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:19,759
Is that what you're
thinking of doing to me?

898
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,394
How could you even ask me that?

899
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:22,962
I never even thought for a second

900
00:37:22,997 --> 00:37:25,798
that you would even consider
an idea so disgusting

901
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,799
as turning on Harvey.

902
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,167
The only reason I thought about it

903
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,336
is because I am scared to death

904
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:31,537
of you going to prison.

905
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:32,671
Scared of me going to prison

906
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:34,473
or scared that you can't stick around?

907
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:35,942
Are you...?

908
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:39,826
Mike, don't.

909
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:42,429
We need to talk.

910
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,365
We got a problem.

911
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Yeah, we do...

912
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,035
'cause it wasn't Trevor.

913
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:53,371
It wasn't Scottie either,
but that's not our problem.

914
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:56,007
Gibbs came to see me earlier. She
knows I'm not in the office.

915
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,242
What does that mean?

916
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,110
It means she's gonna try
to use it as evidence

917
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:00,711
of Harvey being a co-conspirator,

918
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:03,748
and if she does that,
Harvey can't represent me.

919
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:12,105
What's going on?

920
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,174
They offered Mike a deal.

921
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,009
They want him to turn on you.

922
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,545
Then you're in good company,

923
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,380
'cause they offered me a
deal to turn on Jessica,

924
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:21,915
but that's not our problem.

925
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:23,884
Our problem is figuring
out how to get me back

926
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,386
without Forstman finding out.

927
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:30,108
Wait a second.

928
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,777
It doesn't matter if
Forstman finds out or not

929
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:35,346
if he doesn't have someone on
the inside working for him.

930
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:36,347
What are you saying?

931
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:37,582
I'm saying that if they want me

932
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:38,816
to point the finger at someone,

933
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,685
that means I'm holding a gun.

934
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,297
It's still alive.

935
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,534
Did you think I would let it die?

936
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:58,102
No, but I thought you
might give it away.

937
00:38:58,138 --> 00:39:01,145
Well, I'm more sentimental
than you think.

938
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:02,145
How'd you get in here?

939
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,347
Jessica told me how

940
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,181
when I told her what I
was coming here to do.

941
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,283
And what is that?

942
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:08,719
You need me...

943
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:10,887
because as good as Gretchen is,
she can't be a part of this,

944
00:39:10,922 --> 00:39:12,989
and you know it.

945
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,992
You're saying you're coming back to me?

946
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:19,162
Yes.

947
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:22,132
I am.

948
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,512
Good.

949
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:27,826
Good.

950
00:39:30,596 --> 00:39:33,998
Then we'll see you back
in the office tomorrow.

951
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:36,567
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm coming back.

952
00:39:36,602 --> 00:39:37,936
How did you swing that?

953
00:39:37,971 --> 00:39:41,603
Hasn't happened yet, but I got a
little secret weapon called Mike Ross.

954
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:45,076
Well, then...

955
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:49,175
See you tomorrow.

956
00:39:51,587 --> 00:39:54,053
Donna?

957
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,090
How did Louis take it?

958
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,826
Believe it or not, it was his idea.

959
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,208
Surprised to see me?

960
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,877
As a matter of fact, I am,

961
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,646
but as long as you're here,
I have a question for you.

962
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,849
You want to know if it's true.

963
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,150
Oh, I know it's true.

964
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,719
I want to know why you haven't tried

965
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,086
to deal your way out of this.

966
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,222
You mean why haven't I turned
on Harvey and Jessica?

967
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,657
That's exactly what I mean.

968
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,225
It wouldn't have anything to do

969
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,894
with you wanting to use all of this

970
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,695
just to get your name
on the door, would it?

971
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:33,963
Oh, I'm getting my name on the door

972
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,331
whether you cut a deal or not.

973
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,400
Well, if you don't stop coming
after Harvey and Jessica,

974
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,768
the only door you're gonna be looking at

975
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:39,836
is gonna have bars on it.

976
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,237
What the hell are you talking about?

977
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,405
Let me tell you

978
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,073
what I just got finished
telling Daniel Hardman.

979
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,808
They're coming at me left and right

980
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,844
to admit that someone around here knew

981
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,013
what was going on with
me the whole time.

982
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:52,847
So, if you don't back off

983
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:55,116
trying to take over this
firm once and for all,

984
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:57,185
I'm gonna tell them
that someone was you.

985
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,353
Bullshit.

986
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:00,388
You didn't even know me
until a few months ago.

987
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,190
Well, yeah, but then you
and I worked together

988
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:03,991
so closely on that case.

989
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:06,160
And then I confided in you.

990
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:10,164
And then you made me partner

991
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,801
so that you would always have an ally.

992
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:15,002
There's no way that holds up in court.

993
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:16,371
Good luck telling that to the judge.

994
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:18,144
And this prosecutor...

995
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:21,427
She... she's a real beast.

996
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:23,622
She's gonna come after you
with everything she has.

997
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:27,015
I never did anything to you.

998
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,117
And I'm not leaving my firm.

999
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,320
I don't give a shit whether
you stay or you go.

1000
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:34,622
But Harvey is coming back
here tomorrow morning,

1001
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,292
and if you pick up that phone
and call Charles Forstman,

1002
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:38,860
then I am gonna pick up the phone

1003
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,897
and tell that prosecutor
all about me and you.

1004
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:54,275
I always wondered what
it was like in here.

1005
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,178
It's nicer than I thought.

1006
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,645
Jessica, how'd you find me here?

1007
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,647
You always go mudding when you're upset.

1008
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,117
I always go to the gun
range and the ballet.

1009
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,753
You go to the range when you're angry,

1010
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,254
the ballet when you're depressed,

1011
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:07,655
but mud...

1012
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,224
Heals the broken heart.

1013
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:10,391
I know.

1014
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,227
And I heard about what
you did with Donna.

1015
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:15,897
And I'm here to say I'm sorry.

1016
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,267
You weren't just out for yourself.

1017
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:20,902
But I was out for myself, Jessica.

1018
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,104
Donna showed me that.

1019
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,739
Are you saying you were after my job?

1020
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,806
Of course I wasn't.

1021
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,141
But who the hell am I kidding, you know?

1022
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,409
I mean, I'm not Frodo.

1023
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,677
Once I got that ring of power,

1024
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,380
we all know it would've consumed me.

1025
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:34,482
That's what I like about you, Louis.

1026
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:35,717
You may not be self-aware,

1027
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,886
but if someone holds up a mirror,

1028
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,988
you are not afraid to look.

1029
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:44,793
Thank you, Jessica.

1030
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,828
And the truth is,

1031
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,496
Harvey needs Donna more than I do.

1032
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:50,632
Well, it was a selfless and noble act.

1033
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:52,734
And as far as I'm concerned,
you may not be Frodo,

1034
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,535
but you are Samwise Gamgee.

1035
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,437
Get the f... You read
"Lord of the Rings"?

1036
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,438
Four times.

1037
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,440
I mean, it is about power.

1038
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,342
That's funny.

1039
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,379
I always thought it
was about friendship.

1040
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,948
Good night, Louis.

1041
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,617
You sure you don't want
to have a quick mud?

1042
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,219
Maybe next time.

1043
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,288
- Really?
- No.

1044
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:24,399
How'd it go?

1045
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:27,903
Let's just say Jack Soloff's not
gonna be a problem anymore.

1046
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,604
That's one thing down.

1047
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:33,041
Yeah, it is.

1048
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:36,144
- Look, Rachel...
- I'm not gonna leave you.

1049
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,949
How can you know that?

1050
00:43:40,984 --> 00:43:43,551
All I can tell you is that we've managed

1051
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:46,121
to stay together with this
thing hanging over our heads

1052
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:50,192
for as long as we've known each other.

1053
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:54,229
And if we can get through that,
we can get through this.

1054
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,734
But I still might go to jail.

1055
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:04,405
And if you do, you'll get out...

1056
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,875
and I'll be there.

1057
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:11,313
And it won't be hanging
over our heads...

1058
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,648
ever again.

9999
