1
00:00:01,298 --> 00:00:03,332
You're the most amazing woman
I have ever met.

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:07,436
Are you doing what I think
you're doing?

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:09,372
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,

4
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,740
will you marry me?

5
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,975
- Yes.
- Yes?

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,510
You want my permission
to take Mike

7
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:16,212
and force him
to be your associate?

8
00:00:16,246 --> 00:00:17,647
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

9
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:18,748
I got us something.
It's the perfect way

10
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:19,882
to consummate
our relationship.

11
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:20,917
So just wait right here.
It's in the kitchen.

12
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,718
- Sure.
- I can't let you do this.

13
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:25,388
You're going back
where you belong.

14
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:27,924
You never cared about me.

15
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,225
All you care about is yourself.

16
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:31,194
Louis, I'm not Norma.

17
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:34,397
I told you I'd never let
anything happen to you.

18
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:36,599
And I won't ever.

19
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,100
I should go.

20
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:40,136
Why?

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,271
You know I love you, Donna.

22
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:44,373
You ran away but not before
you told me you love me.

23
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:46,709
I did that because I wanted
to make you feel better.

24
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:48,311
I don't want your pity.

25
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,346
You need to start thinking about
a new secretary.

26
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,584
Harvey has no idea
how lucky he is to have you.

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,820
I'm leaving you, Harvey.

28
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:58,921
You can't just quit.

29
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:00,957
I'm not quitting.

30
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,391
I'm going to work for Louis.

31
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,465
So I told him I'll cave
on the billables,

32
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,300
but if he wants someone
to kiss his ass all day,

33
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:12,535
he'll have to settle for Louis.

34
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,337
And what did he say?

35
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,606
I don't know, but we got paid
and I haven't heard

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,840
from him in a week.

37
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,243
I have to say Harvey,
all things considered,

38
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:22,545
you're taking this whole
Donna-Louis thing in stride.

39
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:26,582
Well, I may have my issues,
but they only make me stronger.

40
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:28,751
Good, because we're about to
walk into a room

41
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:30,920
packed with people who think
they've got us by the balls.

42
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:33,256
Well, I don't care what they
think, cause I'm gonna kill it.

43
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:37,760
What the hell's going on?

44
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,896
What's going on is
I left you five messages

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,831
and you never called me back.

46
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:43,532
The meeting was over an hour ago
and you weren't here.

47
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,034
Five messages?

48
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:47,737
Please, you have to understand,
I lost my secretary.

49
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:49,205
I don't give a shit.
I lost my company.

50
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,239
No, you haven't.

51
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:51,340
We can get them back.

52
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,375
I can take care of it.

53
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:53,709
Bullshit.

54
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:56,712
You can't even
take care of yourself.

55
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:58,381
Sorry, Harvey.
You're on your own.

56
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,291
And then what happens?

57
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:09,525
And then I get up.

58
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,527
And how do you feel
when you get up?

59
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,401
I told you I don't wanna talk
about how I feel.

60
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,363
Then what are you doing here?

61
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:15,898
You know what I'm doing here.

62
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,868
I told you, your sleepless
nights aren't going to stop

63
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,770
until you accept the fact
that your secretary

64
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:21,971
isn't coming back.

65
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,906
And I told you they'll stop
when she does.

66
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,241
So just write me
another prescription

67
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,043
and let me get some sleep
in the meantime.

68
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:28,244
It doesn't work that way.

69
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:29,278
Then how does it work?

70
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:30,546
Why don't we start
with you taking me

71
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,881
through the whole story again?

72
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:33,549
What the hell good
is that gonna do?

73
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,418
You want the truth?

74
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:36,919
I think you might have
left some things out.

75
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:38,554
Well, I didn't,
and I'm not about to

76
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,056
go through this whole
damn thing again.

77
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,891
Then go and find yourself
another doctor.

78
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:43,459
Because I'm not writing
a prescription for anything

79
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,094
without you talking to me.

80
00:02:57,641 --> 00:03:00,876
I...I can't stop
staring at it.

81
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,845
Oh, I noticed.

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,748
Yeah.
So will everyone else.

83
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:07,550
Well, I mean, yeah,
that's the point.

84
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:10,386
For everyone to realize
that you're my property.

85
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Okay.

86
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:12,621
Are you saying you own me now?

87
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:13,923
Oh, hell yeah,
and this here

88
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:16,892
is just like a little collar
for your finger.

89
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:22,064
- Mm.
- Mm.

90
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,499
- Mike, seriously...
- Hmm?

91
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,101
I know we told my parents
last night,

92
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:28,204
but I was thinking that,
in terms of work,

93
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:31,574
maybe we should keep it
to ourselves for a bit.

94
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:33,743
I understand.

95
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,711
- You do?
- Sure.

96
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:40,082
You know, it's like
there's this bubble around us,

97
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:42,685
and you just don't want it
to burst yet.

98
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,854
And you're okay with that?

99
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:47,656
Rachel, you just agreed to spend
the rest of your life with me.

100
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:50,326
Right now I'm pretty okay
with everything.

101
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:53,763
Mm.

102
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:55,064
- Then it's settled.
- Mm.

103
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,132
We'll tell Donna
and that's it.

104
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,833
What?

105
00:03:57,868 --> 00:03:59,468
What about the bubble?
There's no Donna in the bubble.

106
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:01,170
Oh, come on, there's room
for Donna in the bubble.

107
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:03,706
You realize I get to sleep with
whoever's in the bubble, right?

108
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,875
So long as you realize
that my dad's in the bubble.

109
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,143
Donna it is.

110
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,080
Come here.
All right.

111
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:12,448
Remember that thing online?

112
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,183
We're doing it.

113
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:19,688
Donna, what the hell
are you doing?

114
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,257
What does it look like
I'm doing?

115
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,425
I'm getting rid
of these résumés.

116
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,294
No, no. Oh, my God, woman,
are you crazy?

117
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:28,064
I have interviews with Norma's
replacements in ten minutes.

118
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,932
Oh, that's gonna be hard
considering the fact

119
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,567
that I canceled
all your interviews.

120
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,536
Damn it, Donna, those were
the best candidates in the city.

121
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,640
No, Louis, the best candidate
in the city

122
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:40,176
is standing right
in front of you.

123
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,544
But you told me no.

124
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:44,146
And now I'm saying yes.

125
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:47,483
This is the most amazing moment
in my entire life.

126
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,251
Good.

127
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:50,286
I'll get you a temp
for a couple of weeks

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,621
and then we'll get started.

129
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:53,656
Wait, I'm sorry, wait.

130
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,157
You haven't told Harvey yet?

131
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:58,227
I told him. I just--
I have to give him two weeks.

132
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:01,430
Okay, you know what,
on second thought,

133
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,199
as much as I appreciate
the gesture,

134
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,600
I think you should just stay
with Harvey.

135
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,068
What are you talking about?
This isn't a gesture.

136
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:07,236
No, look, you just--

137
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,873
Do you remember
Mike almost became my associate?

138
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:12,475
What am I talking about?
Of course you do.

139
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,311
Well then, you'll also remember
that just as Mike had said yes,

140
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,279
Harvey swoops in
and he takes him back from me

141
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:18,314
at the last second.

142
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:19,515
That isn't gonna happen.

143
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:22,118
What you don't know
is that I left the room.

144
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:24,553
I went to get Mike this cake
that said,

145
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:26,589
"Welcome to Team Litt."

146
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:29,024
Two minutes later, I come back
and there they are,

147
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,661
high-fiving, laughing,
and then they leave.

148
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:35,831
I threw the cake out.

149
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,906
I cannot have that happen again
with you.

150
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,342
Louis, I told you
that isn't gonna happen.

151
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:48,644
Did you not just hear me?

152
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,579
It took Harvey two minutes
to steal Mike back from me.

153
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,414
With you, he has two weeks.

154
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:56,752
So no thank you.

155
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:06,896
Donna, I need to get in touch
with Henderson before lunch,

156
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,831
and I need to get
Braxton a bottle of wine.

157
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:09,932
I took care of all that.

158
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:13,035
Good.
Thanks.

159
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:15,704
Is there anything else
you want to talk about?

160
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,339
Not that I can think of.

161
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:18,674
Did you really think
that if you just acted

162
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,944
like I changed my mind
that I'd change my mind?

163
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,479
Oh, come on, Donna, Louis?

164
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,281
I mean, how long do you think
that's going to last?

165
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,716
It's gonna last however long
I want it to last.

166
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:31,220
- Donna--
- Harvey, this is happening.

167
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:32,521
This is my formal notice.

168
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:34,390
But I have no intention
of leaving you high and dry,

169
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,792
so let's talk about finding you
someone in the next two weeks.

170
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:38,260
- Finding me someone?
- Yes.

171
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:41,063
I already have a list of the top
legal secretaries in the city.

172
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:42,364
You mean you made a list
for Louis

173
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,066
before you decided
to abandon me?

174
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,602
I'm not abandoning you, Harvey.
I'm doing what's best for me.

175
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:48,804
Well, as long as we're doing
what's best for ourselves,

176
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:50,105
you know what's best for me?

177
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,307
Ripping the Band-Aid off.

178
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:52,408
- Harvey--
- So why don't you clean out

179
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:54,510
your desk,
walk yourself over to Louis,

180
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,378
and take that with you?

181
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:02,017
This isn't how two adults who
care about each other move on.

182
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,852
As far as I'm concerned,
two adults

183
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:08,257
who care about each other
don't move on at all.

184
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,627
So, if you're gonna go,
just go.

196
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,155
What the hell are you doing
in here?

197
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,958
Kevin Slattery's been
waiting 20 minutes.

198
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:05,827
- What?
- Kevin Slattery.

199
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,295
Didn't Donna tell you?

200
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,896
No, she, um--

201
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,933
Harvey, what's going on?

202
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:12,967
Nothing's going on.

203
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,235
Why is Kevin Slattery here?

204
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,670
He's looking for a new lawyer,

205
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,971
and I'm looking for you
to close him.

206
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:18,940
- Why me?
- Why not you?

207
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,475
Because everybody
and their mother knows

208
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:21,442
they're going bankrupt
in two weeks

209
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:23,444
and I'm not a bankruptcy expert.

210
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,646
Aren't you listening to me?

211
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,914
He doesn't want to
declare bankruptcy.

212
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,084
He wants you to
fight for him.

213
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,520
Then he's come to me
on the right day.

214
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,128
Kevin, I hear you're looking
for a fight

215
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:41,663
and I understand
we don't have much time.

216
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:45,166
We don't, and I just wasted
half an hour waiting for you.

217
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,735
So, before we get to anything,
you're gonna convince me

218
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,737
why I should go with you
in the first place.

219
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:51,306
Okay, we're done.

220
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,807
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out.

221
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:54,442
- What?
- You heard me.

222
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:57,211
Only one of us is facing
bankruptcy and it isn't me.

223
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,946
So instead of scolding me
for being late,

224
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,141
you needed to be
convincing me

225
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,683
why I should save
your dying company.

226
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:03,551
So, nice to meet you.

227
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,255
Loyalty.

228
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,027
What did you just say?

229
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:15,630
I have a game-changing contract
that's guaranteed

230
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:20,001
to come my way in six weeks
if we can show solvency.

231
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:21,135
Guaranteed by who?

232
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,337
My college roommate.

233
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:23,771
And you tell that
to your bankers,

234
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:26,874
word gets out it's up for bid,
your competitors undercut you,

235
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,949
and your roommate won't be able
to help you anymore.

236
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:33,848
But if we make it six weeks,
we're back in business.

237
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:35,149
And I guarantee
we'll never leave you.

238
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:36,417
Here's the thing, Kevin.

239
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,086
I don't give a shit about
a regional trucking company

240
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,722
that's only going to increase
our billings 1%.

241
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,390
I get you out of this,
your stock's gonna go

242
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:43,858
through the roof.

243
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:45,626
- You want a piece.
- I want 20%

244
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:46,928
No way.

245
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,030
You're the one coming to me.
Okay?

246
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:52,700
80% of something is a whole lot
better than 100% of nothing.

247
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,004
You gonna fight out there
like you just did in here?

248
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,506
This is the preseason, Kevin.

249
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,975
I haven't even broken a sweat.

250
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:08,850
Do you have a second?

251
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,184
Yeah, sure.
What's going on?

252
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,819
- Donna, are you shaking?
- I never should have

253
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:13,688
- expected him to--
- What's going on?

254
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:15,002
You know what?
Never mind. Sorry.

255
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:16,958
Um...

256
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,025
What did you want to
talk about?

257
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,261
You never should've expected
who to what?

258
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,063
What happened?

259
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:24,098
I'm leaving Harvey.

260
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,768
Oh, my God.

261
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:28,202
Why?

262
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:29,904
You remember when I told you
you could never go back,

263
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,406
and then I said
I lied about that?

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,308
Uh-huh.

265
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,245
Turns out I was lying
when I said I lied.

266
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,813
So you're just gonna leave?

267
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,548
No, I'm going to
work for Louis.

268
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:42,884
What? When?

269
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,555
Today.

270
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,656
I'm sorry, Rachel.

271
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,124
You didn't come in here
to talk about this.

272
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,092
- What did you wanna talk--
- No.

273
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:52,527
It's nothing.

274
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,061
It can wait.

275
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,666
- You got something for me?
- When don't I?

276
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,968
I redid your shitty motion to
dismiss on Colter.

277
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:02,236
My shitty motion?

278
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,971
Yeah, your precedents
might as well have been

279
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:05,440
Flintstone v. Rubble.

280
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,909
Listen to me,<i> The Flintstones</i>
is an iconic classic

281
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:09,243
that clearly
conveys the fact--

282
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:10,445
- That you're old?
- Hey, you're the one

283
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,579
who came up
with the reference.

284
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:13,181
Which conveys the fact
that I'm smart.

285
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,683
Wow, somebody took their
confidence booster shot

286
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,884
- this morning.
- Actually, I took it

287
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,885
last night.
And by took it,

288
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,822
I mean I asked Rachel
to marry me.

289
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:23,991
Oh shit, I wasn't supposed to
tell you that, but I just did.

290
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,426
Then I won't say
congratulations yet.

291
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,394
Oh, no, you can still say it.

292
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:27,528
I can also say
I need a list

293
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,330
of every one
of Slattery Corp's creditors,

294
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,598
and I need it yesterday.

295
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:32,433
Now, why would you say that
instead of congratulations?

296
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:33,901
Because we have less
than two weeks

297
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:35,136
to keep them out of bankruptcy

298
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,090
and we can't do that
without knowing every person

299
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:38,573
Kevin Slattery owes a nickel to.

300
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,808
Harvey, that list is gonna be
over 50 names long.

301
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:42,543
There's no way we can get to
all of them in two weeks.

302
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,658
You know what? Instead of
telling me what we can't do

303
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,281
and asking me for a copy
of<i> Brides</i> Magazine,

304
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,317
why don't you just get the damn
list together?

305
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,519
You told him we're engaged?

306
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:53,387
I couldn't help myself.
But I wish I hadn't told him.

307
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,422
Harvey, what's going on
with you?

308
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,456
Nothing's going on.

309
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,292
Congratulations.
There, I said it.

310
00:11:58,327 --> 00:11:59,427
Where the hell is my calendar?

311
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,696
You know, I had it
right here yesterday.

312
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,897
I don't know.
I'll go get Donna.

313
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,099
No, don't get Donna.
I'll take care of it.

314
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,067
What do you mean
don't get Donna?

315
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,069
I said I'll take care of it.

316
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,078
I've got it right here.

317
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,413
Thanks, Rachel.

318
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:33,261
Harvey Specter's office.

319
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,495
No, he's not available
right now.

320
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,997
Can I take a message?

321
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:39,000
Why didn't you tell him
about Donna?

322
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:41,035
Because I knew Rachel knew,
and she'd tell him,

323
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:43,237
and then I wouldn't have to
waste my time with it.

324
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:47,108
Waste time or feel something?

325
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,176
You think I wasn't feeling
something anyway?

326
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,444
And what were you feeling?

327
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,013
Right now,
I'm feeling this deposition

328
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:54,115
- is never going to end.
- This isn't a deposition,

329
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,716
and you're not getting out
of this that easily.

330
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,418
You know what, I'm getting a
little tired of your attitude.

331
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:58,686
And what attitude is that?

332
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,388
The attitude where
I'm not gonna supply

333
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:01,756
prescription narcotics
to someone

334
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,157
who won't tell me
the truth?

335
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:05,526
The attitude that says you know
me better than I know myself.

336
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,562
I never said I know you better
than you know yourself.

337
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:09,430
You said I'm keeping things
from you.

338
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,502
And that's something you know
just as much as I do.

339
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:15,836
Oh, bullshit.
I've been telling the truth

340
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,339
this whole time and I haven't
left out a goddamn word.

341
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:21,742
Okay, Harvey,
if that's how you wanna play it.

342
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:24,078
I do know you
better than you know yourself.

343
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:26,380
I had you pegged about
four seconds after you walked in

344
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,449
my door, which is why I know
you weren't just

345
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:31,852
washing your face
when Jessica walked in.

346
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:34,855
You were washing your
face because you threw up.

347
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,757
And you told yourself that you
were coming down with something

348
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,992
or you had some bad clams.

349
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,860
But I'll tell you
what really happened.

350
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:42,964
You threw up because
you had a panic attack.

351
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:44,165
And you're not coming to me

352
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,500
because you're having trouble
sleeping.

353
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,635
You're coming to me
because you're scared to death

354
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:48,669
that it'll happen again.

355
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:57,872
Mike, can I talk to you
for a minute?

356
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,866
What do you wanna talk about?

357
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,201
Captain Dickhead back there?

358
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:02,736
Look, I think maybe we should
cut him a little slack.

359
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,337
No, I cut him some slack
when he barely acknowledged

360
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:05,305
our engagement.

361
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,373
Then I tried to get Donna
to help him

362
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:07,641
and he bites my head off.

363
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:10,143
What are you doing?

364
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:11,778
Donna's leaving him.

365
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:14,614
And she's going to
work for Louis.

366
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,049
What the hell happened?
They've been through everything

367
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,185
together.
What could possibly--

368
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,687
Oh, my God,
they crossed the line.

369
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,223
It's more complicated
than that.

370
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:24,758
What does that mean?

371
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,560
They crossed the line
years ago.

372
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,728
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

373
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:30,430
I don't need to no anymore.
Of course...

374
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,532
we'll cut Harvey all the slack
in the world.

375
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:33,967
Okay, I am going to stay late
and help him

376
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,535
get everything in order.

377
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:39,673
Hey, just keep in mind
that cutting him some slack

378
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:40,974
is one thing.

379
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:43,643
Doing Donna's job is another.

380
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:45,145
It's just one day.

381
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:47,313
It's not gonna last forever.

382
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,292
- How'd you find me here?
- Easy.

383
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:00,560
I knew after this morning,
you'd come in here

384
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:02,862
and your standard sandwich
of commiseration.

385
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:04,064
I don't have a sandwich
of commiseration--

386
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:07,000
Rueben on rye, with bacon
instead of Russian dressing.

387
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:07,967
Well-done bacon.

388
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:08,968
And if it's all the same
to you,

389
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:10,370
I would prefer
to eat by myself.

390
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:11,738
Fine.

391
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,440
I just came in here
to give you this.

392
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:18,511
You mean...

393
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:20,146
Today is the day
I work for you.

394
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:21,581
Oh, my God.

395
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,817
I can't believe it.
This is really happening?

396
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:24,951
What do we do first?

397
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:26,186
I mean, I'm so goddamn
turned on right now.

398
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,454
I don't know.
Maybe we could get a jump on

399
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,422
some of the things that have
been piling up since Norma.

400
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:31,458
Well, my Dictaphone's at full
capacity, it's about to burst.

401
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:33,326
Well, I could help you
with that.

402
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,061
- Would you?
- Of course.

403
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:37,430
That's my job.

404
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:38,798
Relieving the pressure
on your Dictaphone.

405
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,134
Okay, you know what?
Maybe we're, um...

406
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:42,102
moving too quickly.

407
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,136
Okay.
Well, how about

408
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,537
I just redo your calendar,

409
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:46,773
and index every live case you
have, and then get to know

410
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:50,143
every single inch
of your filing system.

411
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:51,444
I don't think that's moving
less quickly.

412
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,946
Culminating in that
inevitable moment

413
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,080
when your phone finally rings

414
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,716
and I say those
three magic words.

415
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:57,817
Oh, good sweet Jesus.

416
00:15:57,852 --> 00:16:01,821
"Louis Litt's office."

417
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,125
God damn it, woman,
we're going back right now.

418
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,526
Take care of the bill.
10% tip.

419
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,163
Well-done bacon, my ass.

420
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:12,632
He's totally not thinking
about sex right now.

421
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,470
Tell me you found
all 50 creditors.

422
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,672
Not just all 50.
I found the one.

423
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:21,141
How do you know
you found the right one?

424
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:22,942
Because I know exactly
what you're gonna do.

425
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:26,379
Then let me show you how
I'm gonna do it.

426
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,486
You're really gonna make them
do that?

427
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:35,455
- Sure am.
- All of them?

428
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:36,589
Doesn't work with some of them.

429
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:37,724
North or South?

430
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:40,293
Take your pick.

431
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:41,995
Well, Harvey,
that's brilliant.

432
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:44,764
There's only one problem.
It's illegal.

433
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,833
Let 'em sue us.
It's civil, not criminal.

434
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,969
Besides, we're bluffing anyway.

435
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:52,405
What if I told you I have a way
to make it legal anyway?

436
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:55,141
I'd say your idea
better work fast

437
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,210
because we're going over there
in an hour.

438
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:01,848
Vince Sanfillipo?

439
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:03,850
Yes.

440
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:05,718
Is there a reason
you're not turning around?

441
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:07,754
I like to play
a little game with some of my visitors.

442
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,923
For example,
you use Evian skin cream

443
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:11,624
and sometimes you wear
L'Air Du Temps.

444
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:13,726
- But not today.
- Of course I do.

445
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,329
I'm just one generation
away from poor white trash.

446
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:18,097
And I could only dream
of getting out.

447
00:17:18,132 --> 00:17:19,465
Getting anywhere.

448
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,202
Getting all the way to the FBI.

449
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:24,070
A census taker tried to
test me once.

450
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:26,172
I ate his liver
with some fava beans

451
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:27,774
and a nice Chianti.

452
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:29,542
You see a lot, Doctor.
But are you strong enough

453
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:31,878
- to point that high-powered--
- Quid pro quo, Clarice--

454
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:32,912
All right.
That's enough.

455
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,347
We didn't come here
for a quote-off.

456
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,582
No, you didn't.

457
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:37,584
You came here to get me
to give Kevin Slattery

458
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,219
more time, and that's never
going to happen.

459
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,788
Actually, we're here to get you
to buy up every piece of debt

460
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,289
associated with Slattery Freight

461
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:45,425
and then get you to give him
more time.

462
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:46,626
And why would I do that?

463
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,561
Why? Because you're the biggest
debtholder,

464
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:50,230
and if any of the others
makes a claim,

465
00:17:50,264 --> 00:17:52,699
it'll trigger bankruptcy,
and you get 50 cents

466
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,300
on the dollar five years
from tomorrow.

467
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:55,702
You think I'm gonna
double down on a loser,

468
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:57,303
because you can quote
<i>Silence of the Lambs?</i>

469
00:17:57,338 --> 00:18:00,740
No, you're gonna do it because
the day we file bankruptcy,

470
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,976
every truck in that fleet's
going straight to Canada.

471
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,645
And that 50 cents on the dollar
just hit 25.

472
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,080
But that's illegal
and I will sue you

473
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:08,681
and your client
into the ground.

474
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:11,818
Well, it would be illegal if we
hadn't just a bought a defunct

475
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,419
Canadian trucking company
for a dollar.

476
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:14,487
Bullshit!

477
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,022
Your covenants prohibits you
from doing that.

478
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:18,791
Not if we do it before anyone
calls in our debt.

479
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:21,995
Which we did.

480
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:23,062
You're a son of a bitch.

481
00:18:23,097 --> 00:18:24,063
That's exactly what
I thought of myself

482
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,298
when I came up with the idea.

483
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,700
To be fair, I was the one
that came up with

484
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:29,669
the defunct Canadian
trucking company thingy.

485
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:30,770
- So...
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

486
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:31,905
You're a son of a bitch, too.

487
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:32,872
Oh, thanks, Harvey.
I appreciate that.

488
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:34,974
Well, now that we agree
what we are,

489
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,677
the question is, what are you
gonna do about it?

490
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:43,683
What's so funny?

491
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,718
I was just thinking
about that nutbag.

492
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,220
Who starts a meeting off
like that?

493
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:48,655
Yeah, you got to
give him credit, though.

494
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:49,923
It was pretty fun.

495
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:53,059
You think he's gonna do that bit
with the creditors?

496
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:55,413
I don't care if he makes them
put the lotion in the basket,

497
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:56,963
as long as he buys up
their debt.

498
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,631
Or else it gets the hose again.

499
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:02,902
Wait, was she a great big
fat person?

500
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:07,907
Good job today, Mike.

501
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,509
Thanks.

502
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,077
Does this mean
I've earned the right

503
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,980
for us to talk about
the Donna situation?

504
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:15,415
There is no Donna situation.

505
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:17,850
Harvey, come on, I know
you're not touchy-feely, but--

506
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,218
Look, there's nothing
to talk about,

507
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,621
because it isn't gonna last.

508
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:25,992
Okay.

509
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:34,403
- Hey.
- Hi.

510
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,037
I got some Georgio's
reheating in the oven.

511
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:38,407
Oh, you are my hero.

512
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,041
Oh, I know.

513
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:42,644
I mean, who says
that men can't cook?

514
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,146
I think Georgio's does.

515
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,649
- That's a fair point.
- Mm-hmm.

516
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:49,851
So how was your test?

517
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:52,788
Mmm...

518
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:53,755
Whoa, it was that bad?

519
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,990
You studied like crazy.

520
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:57,893
No, it's not that
it was that bad.

521
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:01,129
I just...

522
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,431
I didn't take it.

523
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,733
What do you mean
you didn't take it?

524
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,935
I decided to stay late
and help Harvey.

525
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,070
Help Harvey what?

526
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:10,772
Never mind.
I know what.

527
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,507
Something that would've been
done by Donna

528
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:13,842
and should've been done by
his new secretary

529
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:15,410
except he hasn't hired one yet.

530
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,512
You're the one who said
we should cut him as much slack

531
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:18,580
as he needs.

532
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,348
I meant tolerating him
being a dick.

533
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:22,083
Not you flunking out of school.

534
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:24,352
The last time I asked Harvey
for time off,

535
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,822
he told me
work is my law school,

536
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,557
and he was right.

537
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:33,762
I'm not gonna ask him for time
when he needs me the most.

538
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,298
What?

539
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:37,332
- What?
- I was just thinking about

540
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,334
when I asked you to marry me,

541
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,036
I said how tenacious you are.

542
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,704
Well, I know.

543
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:44,105
It's like you should know what
you're getting yourself into.

544
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,807
But you see what happens
when you don't wear that collar

545
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:47,442
- on your finger?
- Stop it.

546
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:54,449
I can't believe
you're really mine.

547
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:57,452
Now, where would be
the perfect place to...

548
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:58,687
Good morning, Louis.

549
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,322
Holy shit. You just scared
the shit out of me.

550
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:01,790
What are you doing here
so early?

551
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:02,824
It's 8:15.

552
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,060
Well, yeah, but we worked
late last night,

553
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:06,461
and I told you to
take the morning.

554
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:09,631
Louis, it's day two,
I'm not taking anything.

555
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,800
Oh, shoot.

556
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,935
I get it.

557
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,070
You came in early
because you bought me

558
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,605
an expensive gift
and you wanted to

559
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,673
surprise me by putting it
on my desk.

560
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,774
Something like that.

561
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,544
Do you want me to go?
You can still surprise me.

562
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:23,612
Never mind.

563
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:26,281
Uh...
Being that you're here,

564
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:28,316
I have a prospective client
coming in at 9:00.

565
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:30,018
No, you don't.

566
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:31,686
What do you mean?
The asshole canceled?

567
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:33,955
No, the asshole intentionally
showed up an hour early

568
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,724
and I sent him home,
telling him he was an hour late.

569
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:37,526
What, are you crazy?

570
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,960
That was Carl Fields, Donna.

571
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,129
$12 million in billings
you let walk out the door.

572
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:43,899
No, that's 12 million in
billings that's coming your way

573
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,401
because now he knows you're not
someone to be trifled with.

574
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,569
No, you can't know that.

575
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:48,937
Really?
because I just got off the phone

576
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,805
with his secretary, and they're
expecting you to come by

577
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,042
with an engagement letter
in an hour.

578
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,343
Holy shit!

579
00:21:55,378 --> 00:21:56,378
- Oh, shit.
- What?

580
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,445
What's the problem?

581
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,947
I'm still printing
to my old printer.

582
00:21:58,981 --> 00:22:00,148
What,
for the engagement letter?

583
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:01,116
Donna, please,
you've done enough.

584
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,817
Let me take care of it.

585
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:07,956
Like I wouldn't notice.

586
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:11,793
There you go, little fella.

587
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:24,940
Hey.

588
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:26,074
I was--
I was just...

589
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:27,375
It's fine, Louis.
Whatever you were doing,

590
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,450
- it's fine.
- Hey, Harvey,

591
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:29,644
if there are
any hard feelings with Donna--

592
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,046
No, Louis.
No hard feelings.

593
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,280
Okay, but I just want to say,
if there was--

594
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:34,983
I said there's
no hard feelings.

595
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,253
As a matter of fact,

596
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:41,489
why don't you tell Donna
I want her to have this?

597
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:03,511
She's leaving you.

598
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,700
You wanted to see me?

599
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,135
That was an hour ago.

600
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:28,169
Well, I just heard.

601
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,204
And I just heard
the results

602
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:31,206
of your little strong-arm tactic
with Mike.

603
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,641
You mean you heard
that it worked.

604
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:35,777
Oh, I know you got them
to do what you wanted.

605
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:37,045
They bullied
all the other creditors,

606
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,246
bought off all their debt,

607
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,215
and they're going to back off
for eight weeks.

608
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:41,383
Why do you seem pissed?

609
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,485
Because you left a creditor
off the list.

610
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,919
What?
How could that happen?

611
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:47,155
I don't know how it happened,
but I know what it means.

612
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,156
We're gonna get
held hostage.

613
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,624
I'll take care of it.

614
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,227
And if you can't take care of it
and Slattery goes bankrupt,

615
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,021
you better figure out
a way to keep him here.

616
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,330
What's that
supposed to mean?

617
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:57,565
It means Jack Soloff's been
going around the firm

618
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,601
saying you're never gonna
save that company

619
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:01,703
and we don't have a plan
to retain their business

620
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:02,871
when you don't.

621
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:04,839
Since when do you care
about what Jack Soloff says?

622
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:06,708
Since he's a senior partner
with ambition

623
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:08,610
and you dropped the ball
twice in the two days.

624
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,612
If you're so afraid of him,
why don't you just fire him?

625
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:13,615
I'm not afraid of anybody,

626
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:15,850
and I never said ambition
was a bad thing.

627
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:17,218
- Jessica--
- Harvey,

628
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,254
I don't know what's going on
between you and Donna,

629
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,690
but I do know you chose
not to let me in on it,

630
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:23,525
so I'm gonna let you in on this.

631
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,226
If you can't figure out
how to get shit done

632
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:27,562
without her, I will.

633
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:32,100
How'd it go
with Mr. Fields?

634
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,169
Fine, but before you
dislocate your arm

635
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:35,270
patting yourself
on the back,

636
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:36,871
I need you to file those
before you leave today.

637
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,039
All of them?

638
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:40,308
Yes, all of them.
That's what "those" means.

639
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,478
And then I want you to update
my Word Perfect by the morning.

640
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:45,680
Louis, I have tickets
to the theater at 8:00.

641
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,182
Second day and you're already
taking banking hours?

642
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:49,451
Okay, I hardly think
8:00 constitutes--

643
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:51,205
Norma worked till midnight
eight days a week

644
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
and never bunted an eye.

645
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:53,621
- Bunted?
- Yes, bunted.

646
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:54,723
You have a problem
with my words now?

647
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:56,057
Okay, Louis,
I don't know if you

648
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:57,572
skipped your afternoon prunie
or what,

649
00:24:57,593 --> 00:24:59,060
but you're making me
feel uncomfortable.

650
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:00,695
Well, let's get
something straight.

651
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,931
I'm not here to
make your life comfortable.

652
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:05,100
You're here to do that for me.

653
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:06,735
And the next time you print
something to the wrong copier,

654
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,703
get it yourself.

655
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:15,877
I gave you one job--
to find every single one

656
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,812
of Slattery's creditors,
and you screwed it up.

657
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:19,681
- What are you talking about?
- You left one off the list,

658
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:22,417
and as soon as they realize that
we bought out everyone else,

659
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:24,986
they'll know we have a deal
and they'll call in their debt

660
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,354
and the whole thing
will blow up.

661
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:27,956
Wait a second, they haven't
even called it in yet?

662
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,157
No, they haven't
called it in yet,

663
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:30,692
because they're gonna wait
till the last second

664
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:32,006
so they can hold us
over a barrel

665
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:33,528
because you didn't
do your job.

666
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:35,730
and now I gotta find some
leverage on Katzen Financial.

667
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:36,965
I didn't miss
Katzen Financial.

668
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:38,266
Then why weren't they
on the list?

669
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,103
I don't know, they were
on the list when I sent it--

670
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:43,638
Goddamn Rachel.

671
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,073
Harvey!

672
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,641
Katzen was the last name
on that list

673
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:48,443
and the only name on that page,
all right?

674
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:50,044
The printer must have just
run out of paper.

675
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,246
This isn't Rachel's fault.

676
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,314
What am I supposed to tell
Kevin Slattery?

677
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:54,716
"The reason you're losing
your company

678
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,284
is because my associate
didn't load the printer"?

679
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:57,786
I don't know, how about
you tell him the truth?

680
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,187
That the reason he may
lose his company

681
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:00,855
is because you didn't hire
a secretary.

682
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,123
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

683
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:03,525
You know what it means.
Rachel has been killing herself

684
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,326
to take care of you,
and we haven't said anything

685
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:07,262
because we both agreed
to cut you some slack.

686
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:08,530
- We?
- Yeah, we,

687
00:26:08,564 --> 00:26:09,798
but I'm not gonna let you
come down on her

688
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:11,533
for screwing up something
that wasn't her job.

689
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,201
Her job is to do
what I say,

690
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:14,803
and you better wrap your head
around that.

691
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:16,404
No, Harvey you better wrap
your head around the fact

692
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:18,306
that Donna is gone and
she is not coming back.

693
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,942
And I told you, it's not
gonna last with her and Louis.

694
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:24,145
You keep saying that,
but all I see is Donna

695
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,981
outside Louis's office
and no one outside yours.

696
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:29,984
So you better swallow your pride
and ask her for help,

697
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,854
or hire a new secretary,
but either way,

698
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,690
you're done taking it out
on Rachel.

699
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:44,792
Hey, there, you got a minute?

700
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:46,560
Barely.

701
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:49,964
I need those two weeks
you offered me before.

702
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:51,265
I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

703
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Donna, I'm drowning.

704
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,701
This whole thing
with the Slattery deal is--

705
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:55,736
I'm sorry about your deal,
Harvey, but you should have

706
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,638
thought about that
before you turned me down.

707
00:26:57,673 --> 00:26:58,939
So you're punishing me?

708
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:00,541
I'm not punishing you.

709
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,343
But I have a mountain of work,
and even if I didn't,

710
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:03,878
how do you think Louis
would feel if I suddenly

711
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:05,072
started working for you
again?

712
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,181
I don't give a shit
how Louis feels.

713
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:08,883
Well, what about
how I feel?

714
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,718
Which is that you're trying
to undermine my decision.

715
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:13,354
How the hell am I trying
to undermine your decision?

716
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:16,157
What do you call this?

717
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:18,092
That--that was before--

718
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:20,161
Before what?
Before you ran into Louis?

719
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:22,029
Before you needed my help?
What?

720
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:22,997
Donna--

721
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:24,332
Do you know
where I found this?

722
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,200
Louis put it right on top
of the list of secretaries

723
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:29,403
that I have been keeping for you
because I still care about you,

724
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:31,005
and you know what
they both did?

725
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,840
They fed right into
his nightmare

726
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:33,808
that I'm gonna
leave him,

727
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:35,122
which is exactly
what you wanted.

728
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:38,112
Do you know how hard it is
for me

729
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:41,215
to swallow my pride
and come over here?

730
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,417
Do you know how hard it is
for me to say no to you?

731
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:44,752
Then don't.

732
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:46,854
I am asking you
for one little thing.

733
00:27:46,888 --> 00:27:48,622
No, Harvey, it's not
one little thing.

734
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:51,092
Today it's the Slattery deal,
tomorrow's the Weiss merger,

735
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,326
and then the day after that,

736
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:53,527
it will be
a million other things

737
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:56,797
until you think everything is
back to normal.

738
00:27:56,832 --> 00:27:58,966
Well, it's not.
This is the new normal.

739
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,670
This is my desk now, and I wish
I could help you, but I can't.

740
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,472
Donna, please.

741
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:06,173
I'm sorry, Harvey,
you're on your own.

742
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:14,048
And that's when it happened,
isn't it?

743
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:16,550
You had another one.

744
00:28:20,722 --> 00:28:21,922
I don't--I don't want
to talk about it.

745
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:25,459
Step one to making them stop
is talking about it.

746
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:31,098
I couldn't think,
I couldn't see, I c--

747
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:32,533
I couldn't breath.

748
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:33,701
And what did you do?

749
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:35,035
You know what I did.

750
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,171
No, I know.
I need you to say it.

751
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:38,672
Why?

752
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:41,742
'Cause the more you say it,
the less power it has over you.

753
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:48,649
I made my way
into the bathroom,

754
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:55,756
and my heart was p-pounding,
and my chest cracked open.

755
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:03,063
It was--it was like
I was under water.

756
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:07,701
I looked at the stall,
and there was...two shoes there,

757
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:10,337
a piece-of-shit brown shoe,
untied, two guys laugh--

758
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:11,939
Yeah, and then?

759
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:15,276
I ran to the stall, I threw up,

760
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,378
and I just waited
until it was over.

761
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:22,383
And that's the night
you came to see me.

762
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,151
Yeah.

763
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:26,720
And you made up a story
about having trouble sleeping

764
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:30,191
to get antianxiety medication,

765
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:32,827
and you've been taking
a pill a day since.

766
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:33,861
Yes.

767
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:42,069
Busy.

768
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:48,442
Louis...

769
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:49,477
I'm not leaving you.

770
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,245
It says,
"Replacements for Louis"

771
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,648
Right here on top,
"replacements for Louis."

772
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:57,885
That's because that's the list
I made after Norma died.

773
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,386
Then why do you still
have it?

774
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:01,489
Because I was saving it
for Harvey.

775
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:02,690
This is for Harvey?

776
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:05,793
Yes, Louis, because I work
for you now,

777
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:07,928
and I'd like to tell you
to stop questioning

778
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:09,296
whether I'm gonna
change my mind,

779
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:11,011
but we both know
that's never gonna happen,

780
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:15,135
so instead, I'll say...

781
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,871
you need to talk to me about it
when it does.

782
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:18,839
But I did talk to you,
Donna.

783
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:21,075
First, I loaded you up
with work, then I yelled at you,

784
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,910
and then I put the can-opener
on top of that list.

785
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:24,311
I mean, I can't be
more direct than that.

786
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:27,147
Yes, you can, Louis.

787
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:29,783
Because I don't want that kind
of relationship anymore.

788
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:31,886
What's it for?

789
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
What's what for?

790
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:36,991
The can opener.

791
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,459
It's just a can opener,
Louis.

792
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:40,427
No, it's not.

793
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:43,264
Harvey was sending me a message
when he gave it to me.

794
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:45,266
That message wasn't meant
for you.

795
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,500
It was meant for me.

796
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:47,868
Donna, you want me
to talk to you,

797
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:52,573
but now you're not
talking to me.

798
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,909
It was a ritual
that Harvey and I would do

799
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:56,310
before we went to trial.

800
00:30:56,344 --> 00:30:58,579
So the message was,

801
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:03,250
Donna, you'll never have
something like that with me.

802
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:04,365
No, Louis,
that's not what--

803
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:08,322
We should have a ritual.

804
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:12,326
Let's worry about that
after we win our first big case.

805
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:29,083
I was just about to offer you
one of those.

806
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:30,718
Jessica, if you're here
to yell at me again--

807
00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:32,353
I'm not here
to yell at you.

808
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:34,121
I'm here to
apologize to you.

809
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:37,525
Then you can have a drink.

810
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,961
The truth is,
there's a time for yelling

811
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:43,864
and there is a time
for understanding,

812
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:46,100
and a good partner
knows the difference.

813
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:47,935
You mean
a good managing partner.

814
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:51,472
No, I mean
a good partner.

815
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:54,475
The night you found out
Donna was in trouble,

816
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:57,845
the first thing you did
was take the time...

817
00:31:57,879 --> 00:32:01,615
to have a drink with me
about Jeff.

818
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,617
So the least I could do
is take the time

819
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:05,452
and understand
your situation.

820
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,521
You mean, the fact
that I don't have a secretary.

821
00:32:07,556 --> 00:32:09,516
I mean that after 12 years,
the woman you wouldn't

822
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:12,860
come work here without
is now working for someone else.

823
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:14,995
And you want to know why.

824
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,697
I don't need to know why.

825
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:20,401
I need to know if you want me
to undo it.

826
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:22,970
What?

827
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,205
I know you and Donna
aren't me and Jeff,

828
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,976
but you are as close
as two people can be

829
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,544
without being that.

830
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,580
Shit, Harvey,
Scottie leaving

831
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:34,281
didn't throw you off your game
this much.

832
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:38,085
I appreciate the offer.

833
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:42,690
But as long as Donna wants
to work for Louis,

834
00:32:42,724 --> 00:32:44,892
I am not gonna force her
to work for me.

835
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:47,528
Okay.

836
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:57,371
Harvey,
have you thought about

837
00:32:57,405 --> 00:33:00,741
what's going to happen
if she doesn't come back?

838
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:03,043
She will.

839
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:11,719
Wow.

840
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:13,520
Wow what?

841
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:15,389
This Jessica sounds like
a hell of a woman.

842
00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:16,857
What does that have to do
with anything?

843
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:18,225
No, it doesn't.
I-I was just--

844
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:19,860
Look, I don't care
what you were doing.

845
00:33:19,894 --> 00:33:22,930
We've been here
long enough.

846
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:25,766
Hmm, we have.

847
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,601
But I'm not gonna give you
another prescription.

848
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:28,836
You said if I opened up--

849
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,005
I said if you didn't,
I wouldn't.

850
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,673
I didn't say if you did,
I would.

851
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:33,641
They're not
the same thing.

852
00:33:33,675 --> 00:33:34,908
Goddamn it.

853
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:38,312
Hold on, you didn't
let me finish.

854
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:42,116
I'm not gonna write you
another prescription.

855
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,654
I'm gonna give you these.

856
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:48,689
That's enough
for another week.

857
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,262
You want me to come
in here again.

858
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:57,164
Mm, I sure do.

859
00:33:57,198 --> 00:34:00,300
Or you can roll the dice
and spread them out,

860
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:02,936
but you're not getting anymore
without seeing me again.

861
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:12,012
One more thing.

862
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:13,681
These episodes are gonna
keep happening

863
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:17,184
until you accept the fact
that Donna may never come back.

864
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,314
Where the hell have you been
all morning?

865
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:48,449
What are you, my mother?

866
00:34:48,483 --> 00:34:50,117
I was at a meeting.
Why?

867
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:51,318
Remember when you said
Katzen was gonna

868
00:34:51,352 --> 00:34:53,420
wait till the last second
to hold us over a barrel?

869
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:55,556
Well, they didn't.
They sold all of their debt

870
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,292
to Kevin Slattery's
biggest competitor.

871
00:34:58,326 --> 00:35:00,661
They're gonna want to put us
in the ground for good.

872
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:02,129
Well, then it's a good thing
I figured out a way

873
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:04,998
to convince 'em not to.

874
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:06,600
What the hell are we still
doing here?

875
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:07,701
You tell me.

876
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,814
What the hell happened?

877
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:22,883
Atlantic Freight
is my chief rival.

878
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:23,951
If they call in the debt,

879
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:25,686
they'll force me
into bankruptcy.

880
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,121
If they call in
the debt.

881
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:28,489
What is he talking about?

882
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:29,823
He's talking about the fact
that we just came from

883
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:31,358
a meeting with them,
and you're right.

884
00:35:31,392 --> 00:35:33,026
They'd love nothing more
than to put you down

885
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:33,994
once and for all.

886
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:35,028
Goddamn it.

887
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:36,530
But lucky for you,
we told them

888
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:38,265
that if they force you
into bankruptcy,

889
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:40,400
that doesn't necessarily
kill your company,

890
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:42,069
but buying
your name does.

891
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:45,272
So they own me?
That's your brilliant solution?

892
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:47,274
No, they own
the Slattery trademark,

893
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:49,243
which they think
effectively puts you under,

894
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,611
but they don't know
what we know.

895
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:51,578
And what is that?

896
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:52,946
That you have
another contract

897
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:55,082
that doesn't care
about the name of your company.

898
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:56,750
They only care
about the name of the owner.

899
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:59,753
How the hell did Katzen
even know to sell their debt?

900
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:01,655
Because I made a mistake.

901
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,290
You sure as hell did!

902
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:05,592
After asking for 20%
of my company

903
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:07,661
and bragging that
you could save it.

904
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:10,164
Well, it turns out it, you're
just an arrogant mouthpiece

905
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:12,699
that thinks he can
save anything.

906
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:13,767
But you can't.

907
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:17,905
Kevin, nobody hates change
more than I do,

908
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:20,307
but it's coming
whether we like it or not.

909
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:23,210
And if I could save
both your company and your name,

910
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:27,281
I would,
but you're right, I can't.

911
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:30,384
So take the deal, wake up
tomorrow, and go to work.

912
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,799
Hey, Harvey?

913
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:48,569
Yeah.

914
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:51,171
I just want to say
thanks...

915
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:53,674
for not throwing us
under the bus back there.

916
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,975
What do you mean?

917
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:58,345
Well, I mean, you could have
told Slattery the truth.

918
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:01,081
That mistake was
mine and Rachel's.

919
00:37:01,115 --> 00:37:03,116
No it wasn't.

920
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:05,786
You were right,
that mistake was mine.

921
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:15,435
Hey. What are you
doing here so late?

922
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:17,197
You didn't hear?

923
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:18,765
We closed
the Davis brothers.

924
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,334
- That's huge.
- It is.

925
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:23,070
So I thought maybe
this was the perfect time

926
00:37:23,104 --> 00:37:24,471
to start our ritual.

927
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:28,809
Oh, Donna, listen,
I've been thinking.

928
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:29,910
I don't think we don't need
to have a ritual.

929
00:37:29,944 --> 00:37:32,913
Come on.
It's our first big win.

930
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:40,988
That's the same exact cake
I got Mike.

931
00:37:41,022 --> 00:37:41,955
I know.

932
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,091
How did you know?

933
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,659
I'm Donna.

934
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,730
You sure are.

935
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:51,265
What flavor is it?

936
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:53,433
Well, I called Esther,
and she said

937
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:55,002
German Chocolate was
your favorite.

938
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:56,036
I hate German Chocolate.

939
00:37:56,037 --> 00:37:57,671
Which is why I got you
Mocha Fudge.

940
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:59,873
It's perfect.

941
00:38:04,746 --> 00:38:06,813
What can I do for you,
Harvey?

942
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,983
I just wanted to see
if you still had that list.

943
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:11,485
Of course I do.

944
00:39:33,134 --> 00:39:34,468
What's this?

945
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:37,337
Your engagement present.

946
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:38,739
Come on, Rachel,
how long did you think

947
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:40,007
you could keep
that glow a secret?

948
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,108
I'm glowing?

949
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:43,176
Like Times Square
on New Year's Eve.

950
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,478
To me.

951
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:45,812
The rest of the world
can't even see you

952
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:48,215
under that pile of work
you took on to help Harvey.

953
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:49,850
You knew about that too?

954
00:39:49,884 --> 00:39:50,984
Of course I did,

955
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:53,887
which is why
you're getting this.

956
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:56,223
Donna,
you didn't have to--

957
00:39:56,257 --> 00:39:58,392
I didn't,
but Harvey did.

958
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:00,193
And he won't think
to get you two a gift,

959
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:01,328
'cause I was always
the one

960
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,263
who took care of things
like that, so...

961
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:05,432
I don't know what to say.

962
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:06,466
Say thank you.

963
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,934
Thank you.

964
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:10,170
And promise me,

965
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:14,107
no matter what is going on
in my life,

966
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:19,179
you won't feel bad about telling
me all the good things in yours.

967
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:20,981
I promise.

968
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:33,558
What is this?

969
00:40:33,592 --> 00:40:35,227
A copy of <i>Brides</i> Magazine.

970
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,694
Why is it on my desk?

971
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:38,196
How else are you gonna
pick your colors?

972
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:40,632
Colors?
What are colors?

973
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:41,866
How do <i>you</i> know
what they are?

974
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:43,268
Because I'm a grown man.

975
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:44,903
Really? 'Cause you sound
more like a grown woman.

976
00:40:44,937 --> 00:40:46,104
That's very hurtful.

977
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:49,141
I looked everywhere
for that issue.

978
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:51,975
Thanks, Harvey.

979
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,177
Thank me on the way.

980
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:54,578
Where are we going?

981
00:40:54,612 --> 00:40:57,415
To do what we should have done
the day you got engaged.

982
00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:58,516
Nets game.

983
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,217
Are you kidding?

984
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:01,919
Front row.

985
00:41:01,953 --> 00:41:04,788
Holy shit.
Is Jay-Z gonna be there?

986
00:41:04,822 --> 00:41:05,956
Yeah, right next to me.

987
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,890
Next to you?
Wait, this my gift, hey.

988
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,926
I don't care whose gift it is.
I'm not doing that to Jay-Z.

989
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,661
Oh, you know what,
I'll just sit next to Beyoncé.

990
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:12,862
We'll call it a draw.

991
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:15,131
You know what, never mind.
I'm taking Rachel.

992
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,799
Yeah, well, why don't you just
give it to both of us?

993
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,070
Oh, wait, then who would
stay here and do all your work?

994
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,971
Shit.
Was that too soon?

995
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,206
Oh, I'm so sorry, bud.
Let's go!
