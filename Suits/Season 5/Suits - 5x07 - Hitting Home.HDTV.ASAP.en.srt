1
00:00:01,308 --> 00:00:02,966
<i>You walked out of our session</i>
<i>because you didn't wants...</i>

2
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:04,639
- To talk about your mother.
- You're insane.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,401
And you're a self-serving
narcissist

4
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:08,322
Who will do or say anything
to get what he wants.

5
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:11,630
It's my sister's company.
I'll give you her business.

6
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:13,215
All you have to do
is handle her divorce.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,316
All right, I'll do it.

8
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,650
Promise me you won't
sleep with Esther.

9
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:18,236
The last thing I want to do
is sleep with your sister.

10
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:20,489
Would you like to
take me home tonight?

11
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:21,990
I would.

12
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:24,025
Jack Soloff signed
Fletcher as a client

13
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:25,327
and now I have to let
McKernon go.

14
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:27,028
I'm sorry you're in
this position right now.

15
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:28,630
I'm not the one
who put you in it.

16
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:30,298
Jack Soloff is.

17
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,567
This is your last chance
to work with me.

18
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,669
Take it and you
have a future,

19
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:37,873
don't and you can go
ask Daniel Hardman for a job.

20
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:39,741
I'm ready to talk about
my mother.

21
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:01,930
Mom?

22
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:08,904
- Mom?
- Harvey.

23
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,705
What are you--
what are you doing here?

24
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:12,140
I got sent home
from school.

25
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:13,808
I threw up.

26
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:15,176
Oh, well,
let's get you to bed.

27
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:17,212
Hey, Lil,
I was thinking that--

28
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:19,231
- Who's that?
- Honey, you remember

29
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,783
our cousin--
my cousin Scott?

30
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:23,552
- Hey.
- No.

31
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:25,921
Course you do.
He's cousin Judy's brother.

32
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:27,556
I don't feel good.

33
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:29,457
Oh, yeah,
you're burning up.

34
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:31,660
Let's get you to bed.

35
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:34,029
And let's not tell Dad
about cousin Scott.

36
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:36,498
Okay? 'Cause they don't
get along.

37
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:40,635
Come on.

38
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:42,537
You poor thing.

39
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:47,359
"You poor thing."
That's what stuck with me.

40
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:48,810
She said "You poor thing,"

41
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,745
but she didn't give a shit
about me.

42
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:52,347
And did you know
what you saw?

43
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,319
No, I just knew
something was wrong.

44
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:58,920
And you didn't
tell your father?

45
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:01,022
She told me not to.

46
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:02,524
And you trusted her?

47
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,225
I did.

48
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:06,278
Harvey, I never thought
I'd be saying this to you,

49
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,063
but I'm proud.

50
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,031
It took an amazing amount
of courage to tell me that.

51
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,233
- We're not gonna hug, are we?
- No, we're not.

52
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,702
But it does feel good
to end a session

53
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,136
on a positive note
for once.

54
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:23,378
Peterson case, huh?

55
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,347
I remember when I used to
handle that asshole.

56
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,617
Funny, I don't remember
inviting you into my office.

57
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,318
Oh, yeah, that's right,
it must be because

58
00:02:30,354 --> 00:02:31,686
it's something
that I would never do.

59
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:34,889
Listen, Mike, I know I pulled
some shit with you and Louis,

60
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:36,358
but I'm here to
make things right with you.

61
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:38,243
Not interested.

62
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,211
Just hear me out.

63
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:44,432
What the hell is this?

64
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:46,201
It's a case that's
tailor-made for someone

65
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:49,104
with a hedge fund
background.

66
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,572
New York Teacher's
Pension Fund

67
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,741
just lost 30% of their
annual income.

68
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:55,610
They put half their portfolio
in derivatives without hedging?

69
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:57,278
Not just derivatives.
Derivatives created

70
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:59,164
and marketed by Straussbank

71
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:01,249
to increase
their own revenue.

72
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,185
Sorry, Jack,
I don't work with people

73
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:05,520
that I don't trust
and I don't trust somebody

74
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:06,655
who comes to me saying
their trying

75
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,223
to make things right
without a good reason.

76
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,909
You want the reason?
Jessica told me to.

77
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,926
Yeah, well,
she didn't tell me.

78
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,695
And until she does...

79
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:15,513
you can get out
of my office.

80
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,273
The Simon brief
is on your desk

81
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,375
and I moved your Wednesday
noon meeting to five.

82
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:28,510
Why'd you do that?

83
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:29,985
Because Anthony Kimball's
most honest

84
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:30,912
with a drink in him.

85
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,297
And on top of that,

86
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:33,631
I wouldn't want you
to have to work too hard

87
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:36,451
- on your birthday.
- What? It's not my birthday.

88
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:37,686
Oh, come on,
you can tell me.

89
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:39,621
What is it? 48? 49?

90
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:42,741
- The big 6-0?
- A: I'm not the one pushing 60.

91
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:44,159
You better not be
talking to me.

92
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:46,761
B: If it were,
I'd be drinking with someone

93
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,563
a lot prettier
than Anthony Kimball.

94
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,999
Then why is Wednesday night
permanently blocked out

95
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,500
on your calendar?

96
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,608
- Donna.
- Harvey.

97
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:03,111
- You look busy.
- I look busy because I am busy.

98
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,484
Too busy to join me
at Del Posto on Wednesday night?

99
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:13,621
Harvey, we don't need
to do that anymore.

100
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:14,839
Then why did you leave it

101
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,395
permanently blocked off
on my calendar?

102
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,746
Because I did that
a long time ago

103
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:19,928
and when I left your desk
I forgot to undo it.

104
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:21,629
Then why don't we pretend
that you forgot

105
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:23,031
to undo it on purpose?

106
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,632
I don't work for you
anymore.

107
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:25,967
What would we
be celebrating?

108
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:28,586
Instead of celebrating
the day you came to my desk,

109
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,672
how about we celebrate...

110
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:32,273
two weeks of being
on decent terms?

111
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,175
It's only been
a week and a half.

112
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:36,745
Seriously, Donna?

113
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,147
I don't just want to be
on decent terms.

114
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:40,648
I want to get back
to being friends.

115
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:42,584
That's really nice,
Harvey.

116
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:46,771
See you Wednesday night.

117
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,042
♪ ♪

118
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,427
Thank you.

119
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:55,680
Jessica.

120
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:57,315
What a pleasant surprise.

121
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,983
I think we both know
that it isn't.

122
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:01,436
- Pleasant? Or a surprise?
- Either.

123
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,254
Because we also
both know that Jack Soloff

124
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,722
came to see you
before I did.

125
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:05,807
Is there a problem
with that?

126
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,275
There is if you're colluding

127
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,444
with one of my partners
to take over my firm.

128
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,212
Jack came to me

129
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:13,465
asking for advice about
how to land a new client.

130
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,317
He was so determined
I was suddenly reminded

131
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,753
- of Harvey's first client.
- McKernon Motors.

132
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:21,206
A client he cared so much
about he gave up a promotion

133
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:23,358
just to keep his word.

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,893
It's hard to forget
a move like that.

135
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:27,562
It's also hard to forget
your history

136
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:29,531
of worming your way
back into my firm.

137
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,117
So, if you're looking
for someone to mentor, Daniel,

138
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,102
go find yourself
an afterschool program.

139
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:35,520
But stay the hell
outta my house.

140
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:37,021
Jessica...

141
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:40,358
I have no interest
in your shitty firm

142
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,777
and I don't have to
enter your house to damage it.

143
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:44,646
You did that
all by yourself

144
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:46,481
the second you let
Fletcher Engines go.

145
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:47,649
Jack tell you that?

146
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,567
Fletcher Engines
told everyone that.

147
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,703
And you told your entire firm
that you care more about

148
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:54,239
Harvey Specter
than you do about them.

149
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,207
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting

00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:59,077

Clean out your things and get
the hell out of my firm.

164
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:43,779
- What?
- I gave you one last chance

165
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,514
to play nice,
and you blew it.

166
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:47,649
- How did I blow it?
- Oh, you're going to deny

167
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,085
that you've been spreading
word around the office

168
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,587
that I told you to drop
Fletcher Engines?

169
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:53,856
Yes. I'm gonna deny it,
because I didn't do it.

170
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,624
Then how the hell
does everybody know?

171
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:58,494
Because I told them
when I signed Fletcher.

172
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:00,395
Which I wouldn't have done
if I'd known

173
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:01,497
you were gonna drop them

174
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:03,098
because it made me
look like shit.

175
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:05,534
Well, it didn't make me come
out smelling like a rose either.

176
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,402
And your mentor
seems to have known that.

177
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:08,570
He's not my mentor.

178
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:09,855
I went to him for advice,

179
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,807
and all it got me
was almost getting fired.

180
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:13,909
But you said you'd
give me one more chance,

181
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,444
and I've been trying
to take it.

182
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,329
Give me one good example
of that.

183
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:19,248
I approached Mike Ross
to work with me this morning.

184
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:21,650
And by the way,
he spat in my face.

185
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,121
Jessica...

186
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,874
you made your point
and I heard you.

187
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:31,059
If you're just gonna
fire me anyway,

188
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:33,562
why give me the chance
in the first place?

189
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:38,033
A joke?
Uh, do you hear me laughing?

190
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,669
10% is 11% more
than you deserve.

191
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:41,603
I--

192
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,205
What the hell?

193
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,139
This better be important.

194
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:45,340
I was just about
to close a deal.

195
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:46,642
I just heard a rumor

196
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,744
that Jack Soloff
signed Fletcher Engines.

197
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,746
That's ridiculous--everyone
knows we can't sign Fletcher

198
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,980
if we represent McKernon.

199
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:53,682
I'll tell you what
everyone knows, Louis.

200
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:55,150
Jack signed Fletcher.

201
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,852
Jessica forced him
to drop them,

202
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,687
and the only reason Jack
would have done that

203
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:02,024
in the first place is if
you were fired by McKernon.

204
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,325
Harvey, I can explain.

205
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,693
God damn it.
I knew it.

206
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,229
Just wait a minute.
Harvey, listen to me.

207
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,597
Jack set us up.

208
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,065
He acted as if he was
cooperating

209
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:12,000
when all along he was looking
to blow up the deal.

210
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,268
Why the hell didn't you
come to me when it happened?

211
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:14,736
Because we wanted
to fix it ourselves.

212
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:16,338
Wanting to fix it yourself

213
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,839
is the cause of every problem
you and I have ever had,

214
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:19,141
and now you're teaching
that bullshit to Mike?

215
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:21,043
You know what, Mike and I
worked on that deal together,

216
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,477
and we kicked ass.

217
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,780
I'm happy, Mike's happy,
Dominic's happy,

218
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:26,098
and I'll tell you why.

219
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,110
Because I'm a damn good
attorney, and you know it.

220
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:29,851
So if that's the only thing
you came in here for,

221
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:31,954
I would like to close
my deal now.

222
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,263
Mr. Specter,
Esther Litt just called.

223
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:43,665
She has an urgent matter.
Needs to see you right away.

224
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,284
Did she say
what it was about?

225
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:47,436
No. Just not to tell
her brother.

226
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:56,311
Oh, so this is where the little
people get their caffeine.

227
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:59,514
I'm guessing you're not here
to have a breakfast bar.

228
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,617
I've never had a breakfast bar
in my life.

229
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,519
I want to thank you
for taking on that pension case

230
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:06,255
- with Jack Soloff.
- I didn't take on

231
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,556
the pension case
with Jack Soloff.

232
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:09,424
- Yes, you did.
- Jessica, no.

233
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,692
You can't make me work
with that man.

234
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:12,194
I can make you work

235
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:14,129
with the goddamn window
washers if I want to.

236
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,498
And if you don't do this,
you might find yourself

237
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,835
dangling 50 stories
above the ground.

238
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,503
- Why?
- Because I asked Jack

239
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:22,871
to make peace,
and you're the one

240
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:25,307
he chose to reach out to,
so you're the one to do this.

241
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:27,309
I guess I meant
why don't you just fire him?

242
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:29,211
If I fired every
ambitious attorney

243
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,579
that ever took me on,

244
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:34,082
there'd be nobody left here
but me and Harold Gunderson.

245
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,184
Wait a second--you know
who Harold Gunderson is?

246
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:38,053
I know who everybody is.

247
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:39,488
And before you say
one more word,

248
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:42,357
if I ever start handing out
pink slips for troublemakers,

249
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,626
you'd be the first in line.

250
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,011
Right.

251
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:50,432
I came here as soon
as I got your message.

252
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,967
I don't do that
for most people.

253
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,902
So much for hard to get.

254
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:55,270
I think we're past that.

255
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,005
Did Jeffrey
get greedy again?

256
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,774
No. A man named
Kenneth Jackson

257
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:00,776
is claiming
my nut-free muffins

258
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:02,744
put him
in anaphylactic shock.

259
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,446
What happened?
Too much gluten?

260
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:05,847
- Not enough gluten?
- Harvey,

261
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:08,216
this isn't funny.
This is my company,

262
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:11,086
and my entire brand
is based on quality.

263
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,754
I'm sorry.
I'll take it seriously.

264
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,989
Thank you.

265
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:15,557
Don't thank me.
Thank Louis.

266
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:18,577
Because he's gonna
handle this case.

267
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:19,695
What?

268
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:21,697
This is a business matter,
not personal.

269
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:23,332
And I'm not stealing
Louis's client.

270
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,134
You're not stealing me.
You already handled my divorce.

271
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,071
Are you gonna tell me that Louis
is a better lawyer than you?

272
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,106
No. I'm gonna tell you
that he's a damn good lawyer,

273
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,591
and he'd do anything
to project you.

274
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:33,775
That's not the point.

275
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,877
I need this to go away
quietly,

276
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:38,347
and Louis doesn't do
anything quietly.

277
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:40,515
- Then tell him that.
- He never listens to me.

278
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,634
Then get him to listen
or get another law firm,

279
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,020
because I'm not
taking this case.

280
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:47,956
Harvey, I don't need
another firm.

281
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:49,741
I need you.

282
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,460
You know what I think?

283
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:53,462
I think you want to go
out with me again,

284
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:54,796
and you came to me with this

285
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:56,048
because you're afraid
to say it to me.

286
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,299
I don't believe you!

287
00:10:57,334 --> 00:11:00,135
You think I concocted
a lawsuit against my own company

288
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,887
just to tell a man
I've already been with

289
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,222
that I like him?

290
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:05,390
Sure looks that way.

291
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:06,842
In that case,

292
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:10,345
I guess I do have
the wrong man for the job.

293
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:13,682
Thank you for taking the time.

294
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:19,738
♪ ♪

295
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,340
Please let him know
I'm here.

296
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,942
Esther.

297
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,476
What are you doing here?

298
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,312
I thought I was very clear
yesterday.

299
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm not taking
your case.

300
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:40,014
You were clear.

301
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,016
I'm here to see Louis.

302
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:45,253
But it's nice to see
your ego's as strong as ever.

303
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,923
I'm sorry...and I didn't mean
to be such a dick yesterday.

304
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,192
It's okay, Harvey.
I know what you did.

305
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:53,077
You accused me of what
you accused me of,

306
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,479
so I will go to Louis.

307
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,830
So you're not mad at me?

308
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,832
It was actually sweet...

309
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,969
in a dick-ish sort of way.

310
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:03,204
That's my specialty.

311
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,840
Thanks, Harvey.

312
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:08,193
Hi, Esther,
I'm Donna Paulsen.

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,112
You're the best thing

315
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,280
that's ever happened
to my brother.

316
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,650
Oh. Well, you don't know
the half of it.

317
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:18,670
Anyway, I hope I didn't
put you to too much trouble

318
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,121
- on short notice.
- Oh, nonsense.

319
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,140
Louis was thrilled when
he heard you were coming in.

320
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,391
What was so goddamn important

321
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:24,993
that I had to cancel
my entire morning?

322
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,294
I swear he was
happy to do it.

323
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,562
And you and I
are having lunch

324
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,764
the second whatever it is
you're here for is over.

325
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,966
- Want a sip?
- Is that a prunie?

326
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,836
No! I can't believe
you still drink that crap.

327
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:37,005
You know I've got
Grandma Gertie's spastic colon.

328
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,606
What he hell
are you doing here?

329
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:40,074
I'm being sued.

330
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:41,476
Holy shit.

331
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,411
Your shitty muffins really
did give someone salmonella.

332
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,713
It's not salmonella,
and Louis, this is serious.

333
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:47,548
- It's my company.
- All right, I'm sorry.

334
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,384
Well, does he have
a leg to stand on?

335
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,585
Of course not.

336
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,787
I do an audit of every
supplier every three months.

337
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,322
Are you sure?
Because if we're gonna

338
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,690
go after him with
everything we've got--

339
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,558
Louis, we're not going
after him at all.

340
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,227
I want to settle this
quickly and quietly.

341
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,262
Esther...

342
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,898
you settle,
you look guilty.

343
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:06,167
This is a shakedown,
pure and simple.

344
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,685
I know that,
but I don't care.

345
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,103
This is a business
decision.

346
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,505
And that's why I'm trying
to stop others

347
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,106
from doing the same thing.
I'm telling you,

348
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:13,374
- I know what I'm doing.
- I didn't say you don't.

349
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,759
No, you're just telling me
how to do my job.

350
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:17,345
Louis, I came to you
because you're my brother,

351
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,915
and I am telling you,
this is what I need.

352
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,868
All right, we'll settle.

353
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,787
Thank you, Louis.

354
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,422
No, thank you.

355
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,023
For what?

356
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,092
For not going to Harvey.

357
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:35,396
Once he handled
your divorce,

358
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,699
I would have thought you'd want
him to handle everything.

359
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:43,104
♪ ♪

360
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:46,324
Harvey,
make yourself comfortable.

361
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:47,742
Can I get you a mimosa?

362
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,143
No, thanks.
I just stopped by

363
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,379
to eat my morning bagel
and ask why Jack Soloff

364
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,382
tried to sign Fletcher Engines
and you didn't tell me.

365
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,017
I didn't tell you because
I was busy fixing it.

366
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,719
And did fixing it
involve figuring out

367
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,220
that he went
to Daniel Hardman?

368
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,390
As a matter of fact,
it did.

369
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,192
You saw Hardman.

370
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:06,194
I did,
and it didn't take long,

371
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,495
because he's back
in New York.

372
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,663
Let me guess.

373
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,465
He said he had nothing to do
with any of this.

374
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Yep.
He said he was

375
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:12,900
just giving Jack
some helpful advice.

376
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,252
Well, I think it's time
we gave Jack

377
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,903
some helpful advice
of our own,

378
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,672
like get your ass
another job.

379
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,724
Now, Harvey,
I met with Jack.

380
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,877
He says he's done
confiding in Hardman,

381
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,013
and I've decided to consider
the matter closed.

382
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,981
You telling me you trust
that clown?

383
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,683
Now, I may look
damn good for my age,

384
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,468
but I wasn't born
yesterday.

385
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,720
You want to know how deep
it goes with him and Hardman,

386
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,255
- don't you?
- I sure as hell do.

387
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,190
Which is why I asked Mike
to work with Jack

388
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,425
and play nice,

389
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,994
and you better not
get in the way.

390
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:43,631
This doesn't look like

391
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,233
a "forgive me
for being a dick" card.

392
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:47,418
It's not.
It's a 28-page interrogatory

393
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,903
for Straussbank.

394
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,738
Thanks.

395
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,839
What are you doing?

396
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,355
You told me you don't
work with people

397
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:54,842
you don't trust.

398
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,444
Neither do I.

399
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,062
You don't have to trust me
to understand

400
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,547
that the shady shit
at Straussbank

401
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,249
starts at the top.

402
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:02,550
All the way to the top?

403
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,619
There's a 50-50 chance
that the CEO knows.

404
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,220
The CFO had to know.

405
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,822
All we have to do
is get their emails.

406
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:09,340
That's easy.
We agree not to pursue

407
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:11,926
criminal charges, they'll
hand emails over right now.

408
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,461
We can't give up the threat
of going to prison.

409
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,096
That's what gives us leverage.
We have to go to court.

410
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,798
Going to court
will take forever.

411
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,449
I just went through
the same thing with Robert Zane.

412
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,967
Why don't you pick up
the phone

413
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,036
and ask him
who turned out to be right?

414
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:23,404
You know,
I heard you were cocky,

415
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,972
but I had no idea.

416
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,742
You're the one who came
to me looking to make peace.

417
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:30,845
You wanna make peace
or not?

418
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,518
All right.
We'll try it your way.

419
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,157
Rachel, what can I do
for you?

420
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,892
I heard about Esther,

421
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:46,661
and I was hoping
I could help.

422
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,862
I appreciate the offer,

423
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,497
but I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

424
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,698
And I'm not trying
to interfere.

425
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,366
I just thought it would
be nice to learn

426
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:54,302
from the most talented,
diligent,

427
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:55,903
and respected partner
that we have here.

428
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:57,105
Yeah, you're just trying
to butter me up.

429
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,389
Is it working?

430
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,408
Handsome.

431
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:01,959
Listen to me.

432
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,961
She's my sister.

433
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,147
She's being sued.

434
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,949
Last time she had a problem,
she went to Harvey,

435
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:08,983
but this time
she's coming to me,

436
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,218
and I'm not gonna farm
any of it out.

437
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:11,285
Can you understand that?

438
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,653
The reason
I want on this case

439
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,122
is that I admire Esther
and her company,

440
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:16,290
and if someone's coming at her
with a frivolous lawsuit,

441
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:19,293
then...I don't care
how little I do.

442
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,229
I just want to help you.

443
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:27,268
Paperwork's right here.

444
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,089
Your Honor, as you can see,

445
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,605
there's been clear negligence
at best,

446
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,309
- deliberate deception at worst.
- Not to mention

447
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:37,245
a breach of fiduciary duty.

448
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,679
I'm inclined
to agree.

449
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:40,014
Your honor, the only
thing that's clear

450
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,549
is his clients chose
a risky investment.

451
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,251
That's not deception
on our part.

452
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,219
The deception is he created
those derivatives,

453
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,388
he knew how risky they were,
and he sold them to us anyway.

454
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,123
I have $2 billion
in investment funds.

455
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,791
You think I review
every investment?

456
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:52,560
I don't know, but you sure
as hell reviewed this one.

457
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,829
- And where's your proof?
- We don't have any...yet.

458
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,944
Which is why we're requesting
access to these emails.

459
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,466
This isn't about
getting their emails.

460
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:00,885
This is about determining
if trial's moving forward.

461
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,086
And it is.

462
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:04,172
I'll set the email
discovery hearing

463
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,556
- for three weeks.
- Three weeks?

464
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:06,841
Uh, your Honor,

465
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,009
my wife has surgery
in three weeks.

466
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,343
I'd like to request
an additional month.

467
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:11,646
Bullshit she has surgery.

468
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,231
Scheduled C-section
at Columbia Presbyterian.

469
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,099
Then put someone else
on the case.

470
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:17,185
- That's not how it works.
- If I may...

471
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:19,987
If we agree not to pursue
criminal charges in this matter,

472
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:22,690
will you give us the emails
within the week?

473
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,158
You agree to that
right here,

474
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:25,826
I'll give 'em to you
tomorrow.

475
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:28,112
Then we have a deal.

476
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,547
Wanna tell me what kind of
kickback you're getting?

477
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,205
- Excuse me?
- You went behind my back.

478
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:40,490
I didn't do anything
behind your back.

479
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:41,236
I did it in front of
your face.

480
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:43,131
You know what I mean--
you gave up on leverage

481
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:44,895
by handing him a get out
of jail free card,

482
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,262
which means you're either
in their pocket

483
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:47,463
or you're using this case

484
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:48,597
so you can sign them
once it's over.

485
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,232
- What did you just say to me?
- You heard me.

486
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,885
You shook that guy's hand like
you were his goddamn cousin.

487
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,004
You listen to me.
If they wanted to be my client,

488
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,906
I'd take them.
But I didn't do that

489
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,840
to kiss his ass.

490
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,141
I did it to
get what we needed.

491
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:00,443
We already had
what we needed.

492
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:01,544
No, we didn't.

493
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,212
We had a hearing on it
in seven weeks,

494
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:05,607
and that C-section bullshit
was just the tip of the iceberg.

495
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,450
Between now and then,
they'd have figured out a way

496
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:08,684
to put it off
for another two years.

497
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,119
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

498
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:13,589
I said I would try it your way,
and it didn't work.

499
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:15,925
Well, now those emails
are coming.

500
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,978
Are you gonna help me
or not?

501
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,986
Louis, I need to talk
to you--we have a problem.

502
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,421
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong

503
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:29,505
is Kenneth Jackson's
lawyer.

504
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:30,806
Her name's Lisbeth Wexler,

505
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,208
and this isn't her first
frivolous suit.

506
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:33,643
Well, it never is
with these people.

507
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:34,777
That doesn't mean
we can't settle.

508
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:35,978
Okay.
You don't understand.

509
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,279
I went through dozens
of her cases.

510
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:38,447
Every time she gets
an offer,

511
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:39,949
she threatens
to go public with it.

512
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:41,350
- Shit.
- What?

513
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,918
That's exactly
what I was afraid of.

514
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,186
Okay, well, then you know
it's not a big deal.

515
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,355
We can handle it, but we
can't give them an offer.

516
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,490
No, you don't understand.

517
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,125
I tried to tell Esther
this might happen,

518
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,359
but then she made me promise

519
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,161
that I would make this thing
go away without any trouble.

520
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:53,596
Okay, well, if we don't do
something other than settle,

521
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:56,849
she's in for a hell
of a lot more trouble.

522
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,005
He didn't really say that.

523
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,708
Oh, not only did he say it,
but I had to transcribe it

524
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,877
word for word
off his Dictaphone.

525
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,649
- What?
- No, I just realized

526
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:14,950
I haven't thought about
Jack Soloff

527
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:17,086
and his bullshit
for two hours.

528
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:18,621
Glad we did this, Harvey.

529
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:20,523
Me, too.
We should do it more often.

530
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,392
Well, I'm not sure how Mitchell
would feel about that.

531
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,527
Who's Mitchell?

532
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:25,644
He's the man
that I've been seeing

533
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,563
for the last six weeks.

534
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,465
He's...

535
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,668
he's smart
and he's funny and...

536
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,538
best of all, he has nothing
to do with the practice of law.

537
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm happy for you,
Donna.

538
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,875
Thanks.

539
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,378
And the reason I told you

540
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,547
is so that you'll know
that I'm not jealous

541
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,716
when I say...

542
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,884
you need to tell Louis

543
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:50,719
you've been
sleeping with Esther.

544
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,388
- What?
- Oh, please.

545
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,223
It took me all of two seconds
to put it together

546
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:56,392
after I saw you two mooning over
each other this morning.

547
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:57,777
It's not what you think.

548
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,779
We bonded together
during her divorce proceedings.

549
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:02,281
Harvey, you said
you wanted to be friends.

550
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:03,699
This is me
being your friend.

551
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,702
Friends don't accuse
each other of things.

552
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:08,704
I'm not accusing you.
I'm looking out for you.

553
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,905
How is that
looking out for me?

554
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,407
Because, like I said,
you need to tell him.

555
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,409
Well, you know what?
I don't need to do that

556
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,911
because, for once,
your radar is off.

557
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:17,283
We haven't been
sleeping together.

558
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,378
We slept together one time.

559
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:19,582
What difference does
that make?

560
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,250
You promised him
you wouldn't do it at all.

561
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:24,503
Donna, Louis isn't rational
on his best days

562
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,639
with issues that don't
involve his sister,

563
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:28,641
Now, how is he going to take it
if I do what you're asking?

564
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:29,809
And how do you think
he's gonna react

565
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:31,093
when he finds out
you kept this from him?

566
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:33,679
- He's not gonna find out.
- Yes, he is.

567
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,491
Because I didn't have
to be me to see the way

568
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,066
you two looked at each other.

569
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:40,436
And someday Louis is gonna
see that, too.

570
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,772
Donna, I appreciate you
telling me this as a friend.

571
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,692
Now, as a friend,
I'm telling you

572
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,744
to mind your own business.

573
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,505
I was right.
You cut them some side deal.

574
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,340
What the hell
are you talking about?

575
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:02,491
I went through
all their emails

576
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,294
and I found them nothing
tying them to anything.

577
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,229
Which means you knew
they would leave some emails out

578
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,731
and you let it go
to get something out of it.

579
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:10,332
I didn't know they would
leave anything out,

580
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:11,500
but I thought they might

581
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,056
and I am gonna get
something out of it,

582
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,150
but it's not
what you think.

583
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,888
- What are you talking about?
- Your idea

584
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:17,406
of threatening prison
was right,

585
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,074
but nobody
ever went to jail

586
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,744
for selling
shitty securities.

587
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,345
They go to jail
for destroying evidence.

588
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:25,764
So, instead of proving
to some jury

589
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,650
that doesn't understand
securities law

590
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:30,886
that these guys knew the risks
of their investments--

591
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,928
All we have to do is prove
they deleted some emails.

592
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,662
I'm sorry.

593
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:41,597
Take a seat.

594
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,751
You know that's
the second time in two days

595
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,603
that you jumped right to me
being the bad guy?

596
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:49,238
Well, you have to admit,
my experience

597
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,339
with how
you treated me and Louis

598
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:52,608
was you being the bad guy.

599
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:54,210
Fair enough.

600
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,278
But were you there
when Louis lied to my face

601
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,080
about backing me in a meeting?

602
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:59,565
Or when he told Jessica

603
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:02,685
that I did something awful
that he, in fact, did?

604
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,053
No, I wasn't.

605
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:05,854
But you do know him

606
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,523
and what he's capable of.

607
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,658
And you're somehow
on good terms with him.

608
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:10,759
I'm on good terms with him

609
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,261
because I've seen
other sides of him.

610
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:13,896
Well, I have
other sides, too.

611
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:17,166
I may have done
some office backstabbing,

612
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:19,752
but I have never done
anything to indicate to you

613
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,170
that I would
do something illegal.

614
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:24,990
Which is what you
came in here accusing me of.

615
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,509
Okay, Jack.

616
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:29,361
You can have a chance
to show me another side

617
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:30,879
of yourself, too.

618
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,621
I told you
to settle this thing!

619
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,755
And I'm trying to.

620
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,890
Then why did I just
get a notice that the FDA

621
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,292
is investigating my company?

622
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:45,928
- What?
- What did you do?

623
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,200
I was gonna settle,
but then Rachel found out

624
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:53,002
their lawyer has history
of blackmailing companies

625
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,753
so our only option
was to counter-sue.

626
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,524
You filed a counter-suit against
my explicit instructions?

627
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,776
You know what, Esther?
You came to me for help,

628
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,278
and I don't tell you
how to bake your muffins.

629
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:04,280
Because you don't know the
first thing about my business.

630
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:05,581
And you don't know
the first thing about mine.

631
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,349
I don't have to.
I know you.

632
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,084
And you've got a chip
on your shoulder

633
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,320
the size of Montana
and when it comes out,

634
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:13,222
- you make everything worse.
- You know what, Esther?

635
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:14,957
I was right to do
what I did.

636
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:17,059
And, for once,
I'm not gonna let you

637
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,334
treat me like
I'm less than you.

638
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:19,762
Less than me?

639
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:21,196
Yes, less than you!

640
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:22,731
I'm always your
buffoon brother.

641
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,883
- Well, not this time.
- You had no right to do this

642
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,652
- without asking me!
- I didn't ask you because

643
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:28,454
- you wouldn't have listened.
- No, you never listen!

644
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,473
Which is why I wanted to go to
Harvey in the first place!

645
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,945
- What?
- You heard me.

646
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:38,514
How could you
betray me like that?

647
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,916
I wasn't betraying you.

648
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:43,886
I was looking out
for myself.

649
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:46,422
If you were looking out
for yourself,

650
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,123
then why did you lie to me
about going to him?

651
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,458
Because you're
always jealous

652
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:51,960
whenever I ask anyone else
to do anything.

653
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:55,130
You're my brother, Louis,
not my boyfriend.

654
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,498
If you wanted Harvey so much,
why don't you go to him

655
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,000
right now?

656
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:02,304
I can't.

657
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,307
Because when I went to him,

658
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,944
he told me
I should trust you.

659
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:12,414
- He really said that?
- He didn't just say that.

660
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,751
He said you were
a damn good lawyer.

661
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,786
I am a damn good lawyer.

662
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:24,793
But I should have
told you.

663
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:26,462
Well...

664
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:28,297
What are we
gonna do now?

665
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:32,968
That depends on if you
think you can trust me or not.

666
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,687
I can.

667
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,279
- Morning, Louis.
- Good morning.

668
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:01,215
Where the hell were you?
I text you like 18 times.

669
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,650
Yes, and if it had been
an emergency,

670
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:04,805
- I would have called you back.
- It was an emergency.

671
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:06,554
Louis, running out of
paper clips is not an emergency.

672
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:08,656
I know,
it's just that I...

673
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:10,491
needed you,
and I couldn't reach you,

674
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:12,827
and that's never
happened before.

675
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:16,297
I was having dinner
with Harvey.

676
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,865
- Harvey?
- Yes.

677
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,533
We're trying
to stay friends.

678
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:22,269
- Friends?
- Yes, friends.

679
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:25,222
I'm not going back
to him, Louis.

680
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,342
What?
I know that.

681
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:29,477

682
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:30,578
It was fine.

683
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,680
He didn't happen
to bring up Esther, did he?

684
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:33,948
What?
Why would he do that?

685
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:35,750
Because apparently,
she went to him

686
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,084
before she came to me.

687
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,552
Well, he did handle
her divorce.

689

You're right.

Harvey would never
make a promise like that to me

then the rest get to line up
for orange jump suits.

780
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:57,384
That's enough.
We're leaving.

781
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,820
What do I have to do?

782
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,265
Esther, what are you
doing here?

783
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,335
I came to
give you this.

784
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,970
This is a $100,000 check.

785
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,371
It's for Kenneth Jackson.

786
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,256
- We're splitting this.
- No, we're not.

787
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:20,341
You were right.

788
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:22,209
I never should have
tried to settle with him

789
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:23,978
in the first place.

790
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,280
You saved me
more than that.

791
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,948
I don't know what to say.

792
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:30,284
Say you'll forgive me.

793
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:35,356
I don't think
you're a buffoon, Louis,

794
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:37,324
and I never have.

795
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:41,895
But I didn't realize
how good a lawyer you were

796
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:44,498
until I saw it myself.

797
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,433
I appreciate that.

798
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,820
But I know how hard
you worked

799
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,338
to make your business
happen,

800
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:52,740
and I know
what you gave up,

801
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:54,375
and there wasn't
a snowball's chance in hell

802
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,378
that I was gonna let
someone take advantage of you.

803
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:00,147
Thanks, Louis.

804
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:02,366
Thank you.

805
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:04,084
Hey.

806
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:07,755
Do you wanna
get dinner tonight?

807
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:11,358
I can't tonight.
How about tomorrow night?

808
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,961
Tomorrow night is perfect.

809
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:16,930
What do you say
we also invite Donna?

810
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,899
That'd be really nice.

811
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:30,210
Come by just to tell me
how impressive I was today?

812
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,346
I came by to ask you
why you still don't trust me.

813
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:33,580
Who says I don't trust you?

814
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:35,215
You didn't tell me
that evidence

815
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,234
was obtained illegally.

816
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:40,587
Jack...I told you
the truth.

817
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:43,307
Those emails weren't
obtained illegally because...

818
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,792
they weren't even real.

819
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:45,759
What?

820
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:47,394
I know how traders talk.

821
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,563
I know exactly
what they'd say, so...

822
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,166
I just wrote them myself.

823
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:53,934
Are you shitting me?

824
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:55,736
Take a look.

825
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,672
I lied to you

826
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,774
because to get them to believe
they were illegal

827
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,876
I had to get them
to believe they were real.

828
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,514
And you needed me to be
pissed to help you do that.

829
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,666
Told you to trust me.

830
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,655
You know what?

831
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:15,889
I do.

832
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,524
So to tell you
the truth,

833
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,659
when we started
this thing,

834
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,627
I was just doing it
to kiss your ass

835
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:22,613
so Jessica
would forgive me.

836
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,331
But...

837
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,101
you're the real deal.

838
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,737
I see what Harvey
sees in you.

839
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,174
Thanks, Jack.

840
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:38,245
Maybe now you can give
Harvey a second chance too.

841
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,951
It's just everything
comes so easy to him.

842
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,853
Jessica plucks him
from the mailroom.

843
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,522
Youngest senior partner ever.

844
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:50,657
Well...

845
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,126
I been busting my ass
for 20 years.

846
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,379
Nobody ever does anything
like that for me.

847
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,916
Well, I'll tell you
something, Jack.

848
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:03,303
He's got his own problems
just like everyone else.

849
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,173
And if you want to
get along with me,

850
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:09,309
you better figure out
a way to get along with him.

851
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:15,411
Gretchen, were we at
with the Cabrillo claim?

852
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:17,298
- I have to go.
- I'm not Gretchen.

853
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:18,394
And that's too bad
for you,

854
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,362
because she's still
in the habit

855
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:20,296
of covering for you.

856
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:21,631
Covering for me for what?

857
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,533
I told you Louis was gonna
find out about Esther.

858
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,335
And I told you
it's none of your business.

859
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,836
Well, it became my business

860
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:28,404
when Louis asked me
about it yesterday,

861
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:29,739
and I had to lie to his face

862
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:31,207
just to get him
to leave it alone.

863
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:32,642
I didn't ask you
to do that.

864
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:34,010
Yes, you did,
and you know it.

865
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:35,445
Donna, I don't have
time for this.

866
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,146
- I have an appointment--
- What appointment?

867
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:38,514
I checked with Gretchen

868
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,850
so you couldn't get out
of this with some made-up thing.

869
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:42,752
- Your calendar's empty.
- You know what, Donna?

870
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,520
One thing I learned
the hard way

871
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:47,223
is not to tell your
secretary everything.

872
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:48,624
Be careful, Harvey.

873
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,493
Because you're about to learn
the hard way

874
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:52,362
that I may have lied
to Louis about this once,

875
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:55,465
but I am never,
never gonna do it again.

876
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,335
Harvey?

877
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,411
Harvey, where have you been
for the last 40 minutes?

878
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,472
What are you talking about?

879
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:03,439
I mean, you scheduled a session

880
00:33:03,475 --> 00:33:05,375
so that we could
explore your mother,

881
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,876
and you've been telling me
some meaningless story

882
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:09,078
about when you got stung
by a bee.

883
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:11,681
I got in a fight
with Donna.

884
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,383
Fight about what?

885
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:14,384
She wants me to tell Louis

886
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,052
that I slept with
his sister.

887
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,987
Why, exactly, does she
want you to do that?

888
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:20,256
Because I promised Louis
that I wouldn't,

889
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,651
and she thinks
he's gonna find out.

890
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,643
Why would you make
a promise like that to Louis

891
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:25,194
if you had no intention
of keeping it?

892
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,896
I had every intention
of keeping it.

893
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,197
It's Louis's sister.

894
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,533
But then I met her, and...

895
00:33:30,568 --> 00:33:31,667
it happened.

896
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:33,636
Well, why don't you
just tell him that?

897
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,171
Because he's like
a four-year-old,

898
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:36,606
and on top of that,
he doesn't own her.

899
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,241
- She's his sister.
- But this isn't about

900
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:39,926
his relationship
with his sister.

901
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,778
It's about his relationship
with you.

902
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,279
You made him a promise.

903
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,014
Yeah, and as long as he doesn't
find out I broke it,

904
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,482
- it doesn't matter.
- And in light of the story

905
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,650
you told me the other day,

906
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:49,335
that's probably what someone
you know very well

907
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,738
said to herself.

908
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:54,157
Are you shitting me?
You're comparing me to her?

909
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:55,258
I most certainly am.

910
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:56,926
Right down to you putting
Donna in a position

911
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:58,227
- not to say anything.
- Donna is not

912
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,263
an eight-year-old boy,
and I'm not cheating on my wife.

913
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,764
No, but you're putting
two people you care about

914
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,566
in positions
to feel betrayed.

915
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:05,001
- Betrayed?
- Yes.

916
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,602
Like when someone has an affair
with someone else.

917
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:08,070
Okay--you don't get
to say that to me.

918
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:09,655
It's my job to say
things like that to you.

919
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:10,940
Then you don't know
what you're talking about,

920
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,391
because I've lived
my whole life

921
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,911
<i>- not</i> to be her.
- And when people do that,

922
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:17,647
they very often become that very
thing in a different way.

923
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,348
Well, I'm not goddamn her!

924
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:21,250
Well, then, you better
take a look in the mirror.

925
00:34:21,302 --> 00:34:23,486
Because you made a promise,
snuck behind someone's back

926
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,538
to break it, and when
confronted with that fact,

927
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:27,290
you're denying
all responsibility.

928
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:29,892
That sounds like
an affair to me.

929
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,032
You wanted to see me?

930
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:39,702
Do you know how hard I worked to
get a view like this?

931
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,938
Full scholarship to Vassar.

932
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:43,506
Three years Harvard Law,

933
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:45,775
and one year
as the first black woman

934
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,677
to clerk in the Third Circuit.

935
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:51,714
And I'm not going to waste
all that hard work

936
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:56,018
just to let someone

1091
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:56,912
making a goddamn decision
for themselves.

1092
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:58,030
Well, that decision ended

1093
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,532
with her walking out of here
near tears

1094
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,450
because she didn't have
all the facts,

1095
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:03,118
like the fact that
you're a serial womanizer

1096
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,170
who can't stand when
anyone else

1097
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:05,287
- has anything.
- Shut the hell up!

1098
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,039
So he takes whatever
woman's in sight...

1099
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,624
- I'm telling you.
- Because he's so messed up

1100
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:10,376
from whatever goddamn
thing happened to him

1101
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:12,428
- in his pathetic childhood...
- Shut the hell up!

1102
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:14,430
He can't--
