1
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:01,349
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,615
You think that I don't know
that all your problems

3
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:05,326
are solved if I tell them
that Harvey did this?

4
00:00:05,426 --> 00:00:07,951
I would be lying if I said
it didn't cross my mind

5
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,119
that maybe Mike should think
about making a deal.

6
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,273
And now that they've taken in
your father, you can't tell me

7
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:14,013
that the thought
hasn't crossed yours too.

8
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:16,605
Thinking about it and talking
about it aren't the same thing.

9
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:19,823
I got a call about an article
on Mike Ross' meteoric rise

10
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,291
to Junior Partner.

11
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,577
The problem is
there is no Mike Ross.

12
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:25,162
You reported it
anonymously,

13
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:26,580
because you didn't want
to look bad.

14
00:00:26,632 --> 00:00:28,382
I reported it anonymously

15
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,584
because I was ashamed
that it happened on my watch.

16
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:32,753
I loved you, and you let
some stupid secret

17
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:34,888
come between us because
you couldn't trust me with it.

18
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:37,391
All you have to do
is admit what you did,

19
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:38,926
and all of this goes away.

20
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:40,594
Sheila came forward.

21
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:42,729
She admitted she was the one
who wrote the e-mail.

22
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:45,265
You and your partners
are hereby subpoenaed

23
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,735
to hand over every single
document in the entire firm.

24
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,907
Harvey, I'm not sure
this is the best idea.

25
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:56,577
We need to know what she has.
What's the downside?

26
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:58,495
The downside is
that we move up the trial.

27
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,415
Mike, this trial's coming,
whether we like it or not.

28
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,617
And the more time we have
knowing her game plan,

29
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:07,204
the better off we'll be.

30
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:09,289
Holy shit.
What?

31
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,125
I took the LSATs
with this guy.

32
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:12,626
So what?

33
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,129
So he can give Gibbs something
she doesn't even have on me yet.

34
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,548
Yes, but to do that, he'd
be ruining his whole career.

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,383
Which means, even
if he remembers you,

36
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:21,051
he's more afraid of you
than you are of him.

37
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,437
So calm the hell down.

38
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:25,389
All right, let's make
this quick.

39
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:26,974
Your Honor,
making it quick is exactly

40
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,642
what we're asking you to do.

41
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,477
She hasn't handed over
her discovery yet.

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,112
I'm still building a case,

43
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:33,947
and we haven't even set
a date for the trial yet.

44
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,983
And the check's in the mail,
and all the other things

45
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,535
people say when they don't wanna
do what they have to do.

46
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,091
What I have to do
is protect the public

47
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:42,002
from the likes of you.
All right, that's enough.

48
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,824
Get that discovery to them
by the end of the day.

49
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,993
In that case, we'd like to ask
that the day of the trial

50
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,544
be set in the next two weeks.

51
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,796
Objection, Your Honor,
she's had weeks to--

52
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:51,665
You can't have it both ways,
Mr. Specter.

53
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,384
You can't demand discovery
and ask for more time.

54
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,003
Trial starts in two weeks.

55
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,308
Jessica, we have
a problem.

56
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:02,703
Thanks for pointing
that out, Jack.

57
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,011
I had no idea.

58
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:05,479
I'm not talking
about the trial.

59
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:06,847
I'm talking about this.

60
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:07,981
What the hell is that?

61
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:10,267
An Op-Ed in the Journal.

62
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,686
"There is no way
on God's green Earth

63
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:15,355
"that at least one
of the three name partners

64
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:17,558
"at Pearson Specter Litt

65
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:21,445
didn't know what was going on
under their own roof."

66
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:24,665
"God's green Earth."
Who wrote it?

67
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,999
A partner at Skaaden.

68
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:27,501
If it wasn't them,
it would've been someone else,

69
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:29,703
because they smell blood.
I don't care what they smell.

70
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:31,538
I've given up everything
for this firm,

71
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,290
and if anybody tries
to take it from me,

72
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:36,376
they'll have to pry it
from my cold, dead hands.

73
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,545
- And what's your goddamn plan?
- Excuse me?

74
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:40,547
Jessica, our reputation's
taking a beating.

75
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,715
We need to rehabilitate it.

76
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,767
That means pro Bono,
and you know it.

77
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:46,136
One free case is not going
to move the needle,

78
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:47,387
no matter how worthy it is.

79
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:48,722
I'm not talking
about one case.

80
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:50,390
I'm talking about
a series of cases

81
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:53,277
for our clients'
most valued charities.

82
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,447
Oh, this better not be
another scheme, Jack.

83
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,782
You think this is a move?

84
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,784
Now why would I ever
think that after you tried

85
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:04,238
to take my firm from me six
times in the last ten minutes?

86
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,872
I did try
to take over from you.

87
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:08,625
But I've been at this firm
my entire career,

88
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,210
and I am fighting for it now.

89
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:11,995
- And you think I'm not?
- I'm sure you are.

90
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:14,167
But you're also the reason
I'm holding this indictment

91
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,382
of our firm
in the first place,

92
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:17,134
because what they're
saying is true.

93
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,635
And don't you dare
try to tell me

94
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,886
you didn't know
about Mike Ross,

95
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:21,755
because we both know you did.

96
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,599
What the hell do you want?

97
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,484
Oh, since you made me come
all the way down here,

98
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,937
I thought I'd save the taxpayers
some money on hiring a server.

99
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:38,272
A server for what?

100
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:40,440
For your fiancée. I'd like
to ask her some questions.

101
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:41,742
Get the hell out of here.

102
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:43,777
You want to serve a subpoena,
you serve it to her.

103
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,946
Well, then I wouldn't get
to see the look on your face.

104
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:48,081
Did you really think I wouldn't
hit you where it hurts?

105
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:50,834
I was saving
your weakest spot for last.

106
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:52,336
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

107
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:59,543
- What?
- You know what.

108
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:01,712
It's time we give that woman
a taste of her own medicine.

109
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:03,297
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

110
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,215
It means we hire a lawyer
from an outside firm,

111
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,134
and we dig up dirt on someone
she cares about.

112
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:09,303
- Are you out of your mind?
- You saw what she did to Donna.

113
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,271
It's only a matter of time
before she tries to pull

114
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,773
the same shit with Rachel.
Mike--

115
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:14,441
Harvey, you're the one
that taught me that when someone

116
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,193
puts pressure on you,
you put it back on them.

117
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,028
I also taught you if you're
gonna take a swing at someone,

118
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:20,280
you better knock them out,
and if we pull the shit

119
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:21,948
that you're talking about
and get caught,

120
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:24,701
all that happens is
I get thrown off this case,

121
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,703
and it's game over.

122
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,622
Harvey, I can't stand by
and watch while the people

123
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,657
I care about get attacked,
and neither could you.

124
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,992
Mike, I promise you,

125
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:33,910
I will be there for Rachel
every step of the way.

126
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,295
In the meantime,

127
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,831
I need you going through
every one of those boxes.

128
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:39,750
Because if that woman
is ready to go to trial,

129
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,501
she's got a lot more
than an e-mail

130
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:44,104
from Louis' girlfriend.

142
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,245
- Rachel Zane.
- Yes?

143
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,863
My name is Anita Gibbs.
I'm the--

144
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,031
Yes, I know who you are.

145
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,367
I'm flattered you came
for me personally.

146
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,535
But we aren't supposed to talk
for another three days,

147
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:27,037
and I don't have my lawyer
with me, so--

148
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:28,839
This isn't
a formal interrogation.

149
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,040
That won't be necessary.

150
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:32,376
Then I'll tell you
what is necessary.

151
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:34,211
You're going to put in writing
that anything I say to you

152
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:35,379
is inadmissible.

153
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,047
I suspected you'd
say that, which is why

154
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:41,468
I prepared this.

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,471
I understand if you'd prefer
to ask somebody who's actually

156
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:48,392
completed law school
if that's legally binding.

157
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:50,193
I'm perfectly capable
of determining

158
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,729
if this is legally
binding or not.

159
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,114
and I'm not going to let you

160
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,483
bait me into saying
anything to you.

161
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:57,567
Well, that's fine with me.

162
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:59,736
I'm not looking for you to talk.

163
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,488
I'm looking for you to listen.

164
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,414
Well, it's official.

165
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,632
No matter what
happens at trial,

166
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,417
this firm isn't surviving
Mike Ross.

167
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,085
I know about
the editorial, Louis.

168
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:16,420
What editorial?

169
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:19,556
I'm talking about the summer
associate applications.

170
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:20,757
- How bad is it?
- Three people.

171
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,926
Not just any three people,
the three people that never

172
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:24,811
should've made it to Harvard
in the first place.

173
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,263
Goddamn it.

174
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,315
Sheila's sending us
the bottom of the barrel.

175
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,100
She's giving us
the sludge that grows

176
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:34,237
at the bottom of the barrel.
Then...

177
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:38,775
I think it might be time to
start looking beyond Harvard.

178
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:40,610
Yeah, that's a great idea.
You know what?

179
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:41,611
We should start shitting
in the urinals

180
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:42,612
while we're at it.

181
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:43,697
I'm not talking about

182
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,615
the University
of Arizona, Louis.

183
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:48,618
I'm talking about Columbia,
Yale, Stanford--

184
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,121
And I'm talking
about appearances.

185
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:53,590
We break our rule and suddenly
hire outside of Harvard--

186
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,126
We already broke our rule
for Rachel with Columbia.

187
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,961
Please, that was different,
and you know it.

188
00:06:57,963 --> 00:06:59,763
No. It was because of Mike,

189
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,015
which makes it the same
goddamn thing.

190
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:04,968
One way or another, we are
going to keep this firm going.

191
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,304
So if you don't wanna go
outside of Harvard to do that,

192
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:10,140
then I suggest you go up
to Cambridge,

193
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:11,808
and convince Sheila
to start feeding us

194
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,977
some worthy
goddamn applicants.

195
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,566
<i>♪
♪</i>

196
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,702
Okay. So first
you pick me up,

197
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,987
then you bring me
to my favorite café.

198
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,572
What can I say?
I do my homework.

199
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,407
As do I, Ms. Gibbs,
which is why I'm not falling

200
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,825
for you pretending
to be my friend.

201
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,243
You're right.
I'm not your friend.

202
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,661
But I am willing
to pull some strings

203
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:33,797
to get the man you love
into Columbia Law School.

204
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:35,999
And if you think that I'm
gonna buy that fairy tale,

205
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,931
the only strings you're trying
to pull are mine.

206
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,003
The only fairy tale here
is the one where you believe

207
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:42,222
you get out
of this thing unscathed.

208
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:44,057
Okay.
We're done here.

209
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:45,675
Rachel, I'm just trying
to give you your options.

210
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:46,760
I know my options.

211
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,562
Then you know you have
no spousal privilege,

212
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:50,013
which means you're going to
have to tell the truth,

213
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,481
and put your fiancée away.

214
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:53,483
Or you're gonna have
to plead the Fifth.

215
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,736
Or I can say that
he didn't do this.

216
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:57,988
Perjuring yourself is
the same as taking the Fifth,

217
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:59,406
as far as your future
is concerned.

218
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:00,690
What the hell
does that mean?

219
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,492
I'm saying that someday
you're going to face

220
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,368
the character and fitness
committee of the Bar,

221
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:06,079
and I seriously doubt they're
going to admit somebody

222
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,197
who did that.

223
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,448
Are you trying to
intimidate a witness?

224
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,202
Because yes, someday
I will face that committee,

225
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:14,538
but tomorrow they're going
to be hearing about you.

226
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,124
I'm your only way
out of this mess.

227
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:20,377
Just give me the people who are
actually responsible for it,

228
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:23,430
and I'll see to it that both
you and Mike can practice law

229
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:24,931
for the rest of your lives.

230
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:34,224
Please tell me
that's the last one.

231
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:35,609
It is.

232
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:37,861
Except for the hundred
in the other conference room.

233
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,563
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

234
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:41,398
Trial Strategy 101.

235
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,949
Bury the other side
in paperwork,

236
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,785
so they can't find
what they're looking for.

237
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,069
And what are we looking for?

238
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,904
Gibbs' trial strategy.

239
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:50,624
Somewhere in these boxes
are the pieces

240
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,626
that she is putting together
to make her case.

241
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:54,077
We find them,
we know specifically

242
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,412
what we have to fight.

243
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:59,166
And what specifically might
those things look like?

244
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:02,919
Witness lists, interviews,
anything to do with Lola Jensen,

245
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,138
utility bills from when I was
supposed to be at Harvard--

246
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:06,923
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

247
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:09,342
- Why are you writing this down?
- So I can remember it.

248
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:11,595
And because we need a system.

249
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:14,097
And because you've never done
doc review before.

250
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:16,433
I don't believe it.

251
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:17,934
How you've been a legal
secretary this long,

252
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:20,070
and never have done doc review.
I will tell you how.

253
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,272
Because I'm the best damn person
you've ever seen

254
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:24,157
at reading people,
anticipating needs,

255
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,742
and generally
dominating everything.

256
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:26,860
So, in this situation,

257
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:28,612
you're going to be
absolutely no help at all.

258
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:30,447
- None whatsoever.
- I'm getting Rachel.

259
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:36,503
What's that?

260
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:37,704
What does it look like?

261
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,556
It looks like something
I don't have time for.

262
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:40,957
Well, make time.

263
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,677
Jessica, we've got a thousand
boxes of shit to go through,

264
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:45,879
and I've got trial in two weeks.
What?

265
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,597
That's right.
The date's been set.

266
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,266
So I'm sorry that I can't have
a doughnut with you right now,

267
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:51,017
but I've got something a little
more important to deal with.

268
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:53,470
Harvey, I understand, but
our clients are being circled.

269
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:54,638
Our reputation's getting
tanked,

270
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,556
and we're getting sent
shit associates.

271
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:57,974
And Mike Ross
is facing prison.

272
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:00,026
And you're handling
one thing,

273
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,229
while I'm handling
everything else.

274
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:03,980
- Jessica--
- No, never mind, Harvey.

275
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:06,816
It's clear that you
really don't care

276
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:08,285
about keeping
this firm together.

277
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,903
I resigned to keep
this firm together.

278
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,621
Well, it sure doesn't seem
to be working out that way,

279
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:13,206
does it?

280
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:20,964
Great, I'll have my secretary
set up a meeting for Monday.

281
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,083
If that meeting's about your
pro Bono bullshit,

282
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,384
cancel it.
What?

283
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:27,721
You said it yourself, Jack.
Other firms smell blood.

284
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:30,757
Well, you don't get a shark
to back off by playing nice,

285
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,176
you do it by clubbing him
in the face.

286
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:35,428
They come after our clients,
we go after theirs.

287
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,314
Clients aren't the ones
writing editorials

288
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:39,983
for "The Wall Street
Journal", Jack.

289
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:41,518
You want to poach
an attorney.

290
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,437
I wanna poach
a whole goddamn department.

291
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,156
That is definitely
another way to go.

292
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:47,691
It's the only way to go,

293
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,110
because if we didn't do what
we're saying we didn't do,

294
00:10:50,162 --> 00:10:51,995
this is what we do.
I get it.

295
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,414
You're trying to convince
the world we're innocent.

296
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:56,700
Jack, I don't give a shit
if my enemies think

297
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:58,118
I'm innocent or not.

298
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,454
I give a shit whether they
think they can take me down,

299
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:02,789
which is why
I'm not going to cower

300
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:05,208
in some pro Bono corner,
trying to convince them

301
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,626
that I'm friendly.

302
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,962
I'm going to kick some ass,

303
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:11,798
and remind them
that I'm fierce.

304
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:22,475
There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

305
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:25,111
Rachel, we need your help.
Where have you been?

306
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:26,279
With Anita Gibbs.

307
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:27,781
What? How did you
let that happen?

308
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:29,482
Because she ambushed me
on the street,

309
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:30,900
with a document that said
our conversation

310
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:32,235
would be inadmissible.

311
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:33,570
And if she did that
is because she didn't want

312
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:35,205
to talk to you, she wanted
to get in your head.

313
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,741
Mike, I know what
she wanted to do.

314
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,459
What did she say?

315
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:44,914
She said that she could
get you into Columbia,

316
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,550
and that you could be a lawyer
after all this is over.

317
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:48,718
Rachel, she's lying--

318
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:49,886
You think I don't know that?

319
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,338
Well, we've already
been over this.

320
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,173
The only way she is gonna help
us is if we help her

321
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:54,507
put Harvey and Jessica away.

322
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,926
Yes, Mike, I know that,
but we didn't go over the part

323
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,429
where I don't get into the Bar
because I took the Fifth.

324
00:11:59,431 --> 00:12:00,597
Oh, goddamn it!

325
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,432
This is exactly why I wanted
Harvey to be there.

326
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:04,017
She got into your head.
She didn't got into my head.

327
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:05,735
She dangled our dream
in front of me,

328
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,937
and I know
that we can't have that.

329
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,739
It doesn't mean
I can't handle this.

330
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:14,744
It doesn't seem
like you're handling it.

331
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,112
- I am.
- You're crying.

332
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:18,782
No. I'm releasing my emotions
so that I can persevere

333
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:22,202
instead of denying them
and losing my mind.

334
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:23,870
Which I can't do today,

335
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,622
because I have a meeting
with the dean.

336
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:27,540
Now, I came in here
to be alone

337
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:28,792
so I can deal with my shit,

338
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:31,344
so if you don't mind,
I would like to be alone

339
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,679
so I can deal with my shit.

340
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,882
Hey, did you find something
in the discovery?

341
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:47,994
Yeah, sure as hell did.

342
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:50,413
I just discovered that Gibbs
picked up Rachel.

343
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,580
What?
She arrested her?

344
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,553
No, she pulled up to the curb
with some document.

345
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,251
I don't give a shit what she
pulled up with.

346
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:56,502
Rachel should know
not to go with her.

347
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:58,004
Yeah, and that would've been
an excellent thing

348
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,306
for her lawyer to tell her,
except her lawyer wasn't there.

349
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,590
- Excuse me?
- You promised me

350
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,426
that you would be with her
every step of the way.

351
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,428
I promised I'd represent her
at a deposition,

352
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,146
not babysit her
24 hours a day.

353
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:09,598
Maybe instead of getting mad
at Rachel, it is time for us

354
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,350
to figure out
how to go after Gibbs.

355
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:12,935
- This again.
- Yes, this again.

356
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:15,271
I told you she was gonna go
after Rachel, and now she has.

357
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:17,156
And I told you if you're
gonna go after someone,

358
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:18,441
you better knock them out.

359
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,660
Then you better figure out
a way to knock Gibbs out soon,

360
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:23,079
because if you don't, I will.

361
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:35,458
Louis.

362
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,376
What are you doing here?
What?

363
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,061
You thought you could lie to
my face and get away with it?

364
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:40,379
- I never lied to you.
- Really?

365
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:41,764
Because you swore
you wouldn't come forward

366
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,215
about that e-mail,
but you did.

367
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,101
And you you're pulling
this associate shit.

368
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:46,802
I didn't come forward.
They found me.

369
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:48,437
And I'm not pulling
any associate shit.

370
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:49,889
Then what do you call
this pathetic excuse

371
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:51,640
of a candidates list?
I call it inevitable.

372
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,809
Because our students can read.

373
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,144
- The editorial.
- Yes.

374
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:57,146
The editorial.

375
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,066
So you're not
sending us sludge.

376
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:02,318
Louis, I'm not
doing anything.

377
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,489
Your firm is being investigated
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

378
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:09,241
And no one is going to risk
their career on a place

379
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:11,210
that may not even exist
in a month.

380
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:14,463
They might,
if you convince them to.

381
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:17,083
- Louis, I can't do that.
- Sheila, please.

382
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,135
I came here once before,
hoping for a second chance

383
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,336
and you wouldn't
give it to me.

384
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:21,670
What does that
have to do with this?

385
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:23,055
Because if we'd gotten
back together then,

386
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,473
I wouldn't even be
at the firm now,

387
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,175
but I am.

388
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:28,511
And it's all I have.

389
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:32,098
I understand you not giving
me a second chance then.

390
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:37,069
But I'm begging you...

391
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:38,988
give my firm one now.

392
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:43,609
Louis, even if I wanted to,
it won't work.

393
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,694
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

394
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:48,030
Because they're going to ask me
if I think it's a good idea

395
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:51,333
for them to work at Pearson
Specter Litt, and I don't.

396
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,503
- Sheila--
- Louis.

397
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,756
Please don't ask me
to lie to them.

398
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:05,181
What are you doing?

399
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,849
I'm just wondering
if you're gonna stay in here

400
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,050
going over stuff all day.

401
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,969
What else would I be doing?
Going to the ball game?

402
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:11,554
I don't know, Harvey,

403
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,189
I thought maybe you'd be doing
something to get Anita Gibbs

404
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:14,273
to back off Rachel.

405
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:16,058
Donna, she threatened
to go to the Bar.

406
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,060
It's a bullshit hypothetical
that she couldn't do

407
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:19,445
until after Rachel testified.

408
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,063
Which is after
the trial starts,

409
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,648
and that's what I'm
goddamn working on.

410
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,533
Harvey, all I'm saying is

411
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:26,902
that when Mike gets worked up
about something,

412
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:28,584
he doesn't tend to make
the best decisions.

413
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,039
Well, if he doesn't work
on the discovery,

414
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:32,491
he's gonna go to jail, so...

415
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,677
what do you want me to do?
I don't know, Harvey.

416
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:36,629
But you better at least
go talk to Anita Gibbs,

417
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,664
because Mike gave you
a warning loud and clear.

418
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:41,250
If you don't do something,
he will.

419
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,096
Jack, I don't often come
outside for my coffee,

420
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:56,432
but when I do is because
I'm feeling the need

421
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:57,817
for a little alone time.

422
00:15:57,852 --> 00:16:00,269
Well, I came out here because
I knew you wouldn't want

423
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,405
anyone hearing
what I have to say.

424
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,741
Are you here to tell me
you can get the job done?

425
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:08,444
No, I'm here to tell you
if you want me to get it done,

426
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:10,830
you're going to have
to open your wallet.

427
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,615
I'm not paying you
more money,

428
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,200
just to get you to
poach a department.

429
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:15,701
I'm not talking about me.

430
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:18,871
I'm talking the real estate
division of Baker Hostetler.

431
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:21,173
- How much do they want?
- Double what they're making.

432
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,793
Are you insane? That's what
broke Dewey Ballantine.

433
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,679
You can't have two classes
of partners.

434
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:28,264
Then we can't poach
a department,

435
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,466
because they're the only ones
even willing to come here,

436
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,434
considering what's going on.

437
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:37,640
Then make the offer.

438
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:40,976
And let me have
my goddamn coffee in peace.

439
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:49,485
Ms. Scott,

440
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:51,120
there's a Harvey Specter
here to see you.

441
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:53,239
He says it's urgent.

442
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,406
Send him in.

443
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,760
I don't believe it.

444
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:00,429
You have some balls pretending
to be Harvey to get in here.

445
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:02,198
Well, you did call me
"Baby Harvey" once.

446
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,732
I don't give a shit
what I called you.

447
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,384
Get out! Now!
Scottie, Scottie, please.

448
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,336
Listen, I knew you would
never agree to see me,

449
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:08,387
and I need to talk to you.

450
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:10,556
About what?

451
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,007
I need someone
to bring an action

452
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:14,093
against Anita Gibbs' sister.
Are you insane?

453
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:16,011
Listen to me.
She's not just coming after me.

454
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:18,814
She's coming after my fiancée.
I don't care.

455
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,733
If I do that, I might as well
call the woman up,

456
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:22,735
and tell her that I'm in
on your whole bullshit too.

457
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,019
We get someone
from your firm--

458
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,654
Not to mention I told Harvey
that I never

459
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,190
even wanted to hear
your name again.

460
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,193
He didn't tell you
about that, did he?

461
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,946
Well, I guess
he hasn't changed,

462
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:35,364
because he didn't
tell me about you

463
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,032
until it was too late either.

464
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,785
So I am sorry
about your fiancée,

465
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:41,370
but I need you to go now.

466
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,955
Scottie, this woman
is not gonna stop

467
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:44,540
until she gets
what she wants.

468
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,675
And what she wants
is Harvey.

469
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,378
So I'm not asking you to do
this for me and Rachel.

470
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,013
I'm asking you
to do it for him.

471
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,227
Is that an invitation
to your <i>bar mitzvah?</i>

472
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:06,528
because I'm busy that day.

473
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,030
It's a motion
to have you sanctioned

474
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,698
for improperly
contacting a witness.

475
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,400
I didn't improperly
contact anyone.

476
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,735
Oh, bullshit.

477
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:14,203
You got Rachel Zane alone
so you could offer her

478
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:15,404
a deal to turn on me.

479
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:16,956
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

480
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:17,991
You listen to me.

481
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,408
You've been pulling shit
like this

482
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,160
from the second
this thing started.

483
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:23,212
You denied my client access
to his attorney,

484
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,047
you fabricated charges
against Donna,

485
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:26,642
and now you're tampering
with a witness.

486
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,084
And all witness tampering
would do is hurt my own case,

487
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:30,970
and why on God's green Earth
would I do that?

488
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,472
Why did you just say?

489
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:35,424
I said you're insane
if you think that--

490
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:36,976
No, you said,
"on God's green Earth,"

491
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,261
which is exactly
what that editorial said.

492
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:40,562
I remember because I thought,

493
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,982
"What person under 80
uses that phrase?"

494
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,984
Well, looks like I found her.

495
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,602
I don't know
what you're talking about.

496
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,154
You sure as hell do, because
you planted that goddamn thing.

497
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,324
You have any proof?
No, you don't.

498
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,277
But even if I did plant that,
it would only have been

499
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,945
because there's no way
that one of you

500
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:58,280
did not know
what was going on.

501
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,782
And until one of you
admits that,

502
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,700
I'm going to take apart your
firm brick by brick.

503
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:03,752
So you want to file that thing?
You go ahead.

504
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:06,038
It's not going to stop me
for one second.

505
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:16,343
Rachel, please.

506
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:19,797
Have a seat.
Thank you, Dean.

507
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:22,933
I have to say I've
so been looking forward

508
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:25,219
to my first student review.

509
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:26,887
And ever since
your first interview here,

510
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,856
you've done nothing
but impress me.

511
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:31,525
Which is why I'm sorry
to have to bring this up now.

512
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,060
Bring what up?

513
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:35,729
The fact that your last LSAT
score was significantly higher

514
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,197
than your previous ones.

515
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:41,568
That is because I studied
incredibly hard the last time.

516
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,407
Did you study hard? Or did
your fiancée study hard for you?

517
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,959
You think Mike took
the LSAT for me?

518
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:50,127
I think he's been indicted

519
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:51,628
for more serious crimes
than that.

520
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:52,796
And now there are allegations

521
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:54,272
that he's taken the LSATs
for people.

522
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,751
I can't believe this.
I took that test myself.

523
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:00,671
And I have a responsibility
to protect the reputation

524
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:01,889
of this university.

525
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:03,474
And how exactly
are you proposing

526
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:05,092
to protect that reputation?

527
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:07,094
By expelling
any dangers to it.

528
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:10,597
Unless, of course,
for some reason

529
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,233
these allegations against him
are dropped.

530
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:16,770
Anita Gibbs called you,
didn't she?

531
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:18,439
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

532
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,823
I'm simply giving you
the courtesy

533
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,579
of letting you know
that if I have to choose

534
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,612
between your future
and this university's,

535
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:27,364
I'm not choosing you.

536
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,833
Well, then, please,
tell Ms. Gibbs

537
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,703
thank you for the courtesy.

538
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,429
Scottie, what are you
doing here?

539
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:44,214
I can't believe
you sent him to me.

540
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:45,766
- Sent who?
- Oh, don't give me that.

541
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:46,850
The last time
you came to me,

542
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:48,435
you said it was
because Mike made you.

543
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:50,137
Well, this time,
you made him.

544
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:51,522
-I didn't made him do anything.

545
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:52,856
Well, then, you taught him
well, because he came to me

546
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:54,024
and pulled on my heart strings

547
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,309
to get me to do
something for you,

548
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:56,944
but this time
the answer is no.

549
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,063
I am not going after
Anita Gibbs.

550
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:01,315
Scottie, I would never ask you
to do something like that.

551
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,534
That's funny, because you
asked me to throw a case

552
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,868
to keep Mike
from getting caught.

553
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:07,071
Throwing a case doesn't put
a target on your back.

554
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:09,289
If you really wanted to keep
a target off my back,

555
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:11,492
you never would've told me
about Mike in the first place.

556
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:13,660
Scottie, I didn't tell him
to do that.

557
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:15,829
Well, then, I guess you two
are having the same problem

558
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:19,133
we did: You don't talk
to each other.

559
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:22,052
Since you chose him over me
it's not my problem anymore.

560
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,637
I didn't chose him over you.

561
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:25,172
Yes, you did.

562
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:26,390
And whether you choose
to admit it or not,

563
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:27,391
it was Mike's secret

564
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:29,093
that broke us up
in the first place.

565
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:43,440
You let her in here
without telling me?

566
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:44,942
I was in the conference room,
going over discovery.

567
00:21:44,994 --> 00:21:46,610
What are you going to do?

568
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:47,995
I don't know what I'm gonna
do, but whatever it is,

569
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,663
I'm gonna do it right now.
Harvey, calm down.

570
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:51,865
I'm not gonna calm down,
you told me to go after Gibbs

571
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,667
to stop Mike from doing
something stupid,

572
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:55,836
and I did, and all that did
was waste our time

573
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:57,204
like I said it would.
Harvey.

574
00:21:57,256 --> 00:22:00,090
Gibbs is attacking Rachel,
the woman he loves.

575
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:02,126
You of all people should be
able to understand that.

576
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:03,343
I don't give a shit.

577
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:05,629
He had no right to go after
someone I love.

578
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:08,215
Okay, you know what, Harvey?

579
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,717
Mike is the one on trial here,
not Scottie.

580
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,386
And all he did was ask her
to do something.

581
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:14,438
So maybe the thing that you're
really upset about

582
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:15,722
is that she was right.

583
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:24,314
Well, how did it go?

584
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:27,234
We've known
each other a long time, Jack,

585
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:30,737
and I'd really like to help,
but it's not gonna happen.

586
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,739
You said if I could
get them double--

587
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,659
I said it would take at least
double just to get me to ask.

588
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:37,377
I did, and they laughed me
out of the room.

589
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:38,912
What if I could
get you more?

590
00:22:38,914 --> 00:22:40,464
There's no number that's
going to get them to come

591
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,466
to Pearson Specter because they
don't believe there's gonna be

592
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:43,501
a firm to come to.

593
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:46,086
Then why did you ask
to meet me here?

594
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:48,505
Because after I asked them
about your offer,

595
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:50,174
I asked them about mine.

596
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,426
What are you talking about?

597
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:54,344
I told them a former
fraternity brother of mine,

598
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:55,896
who happens to be
a kick-ass lawyer

599
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:58,265
might be looking for a change.

600
00:22:58,317 --> 00:22:59,850
You're offering me a job?

601
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:02,436
Jack, Pearson Specter's
a sinking ship.

602
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:03,770
We've taken on some water.

603
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:05,689
You've taken on an ocean.

604
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,441
Why the hell would
you wanna stay there?

605
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:08,942
I'll tell you why.

606
00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:11,828
Because if that ship sinks,
I'll find myself another job.

607
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:12,946
But if it doesn't,

608
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:14,615
I have the chance to be one
of the captains.

609
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,918
If I come to you now, I'll
never be more than a lifer.

610
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:21,121
As my friend,
tell me I'm wrong.

611
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,958
You're not wrong.

612
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:38,805
<i>♪
♪</i>

613
00:23:39,892 --> 00:23:41,475
Don't tell me they printed out

614
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,777
a special evening edition
on us too.

615
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:45,229
Not yet.

616
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:50,651
I read it, by the way,
on the flight up to Boston.

617
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:55,072
And did it fire you up?

618
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:59,243
Pissed me the hell off.

619
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,333
You couldn't get it done
with Sheila, could you?

620
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:11,004
Jessica, she didn't send us
the candidates on that list.

621
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:14,091
They were the only three that
even asked to be submitted,

622
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:16,677
and it was because
of bullshit like that.

623
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,183
People are scared
to come here.

624
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:24,735
They are.

625
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,821
I tried to get Sheila to make
them unafraid, but I couldn't.

626
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:30,691
That's all right.

627
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:32,373
It's all right, Louis.
It's not your fault.

628
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:34,945
<i>♪

629
00:24:34,997 --> 00:24:38,999
Once word got out about Mike
this was bound to happen.

630
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,667
What I learned
from hiring Mike

631
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:44,371
was that not all great lawyers
went to Harvard.

632
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,459
What are you saying?

633
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:53,463
I contacted Stanford,
Yale, Columbia, Penn,

634
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:56,683
and all the rest...
Top 20 law schools.

635
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:01,555
I officially opened up the doors
to Pearson Specter Litt.

636
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:03,724
I know how much you hated
to do that, Louis,

637
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:07,811
but sometimes we need to do
what we have to...

638
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:10,030
to survive.

639
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,615
Is there anything else
I can do?

640
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,785
No, there isn't.

641
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,373
Right now, we just need to
get through this trial,

642
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:22,659
and pray to God
that Harvey gets

643
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:25,512
Mike goddamn Ross
off the hook.

644
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,437
Hey.

645
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,605
Hi.

646
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,309
You're doing dishes.

647
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:48,061
So?

648
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,312
So you hate doing dishes,

649
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,363
which means
something's wrong.

650
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,399
Nothing's wrong.

651
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,989
What's going on?

652
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:03,994
I don't even know
if I should say it,

653
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,629
because the last time I did
you got so mad.

654
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,997
You thought I was
gonna leave you.

655
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:08,415
And you say you want me
to share things with you,

656
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,667
but I don't know if you do,
because when I do

657
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:13,136
you seem to get so upset
that I--

658
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:16,590
I get it. You want to talk
about making a deal.

659
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,892
I don't know
what I wanna do.

660
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:24,231
I just--

661
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,399
She said that she could
get you into Columbia,

662
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:27,400
and you're right.

663
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:28,768
It got into my head.

664
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,020
Rachel, we've been
over this.

665
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,822
She was lying.

666
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,991
That was before I knew she
was able to get to the dean.

667
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,259
What are you talking about?

668
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:37,861
I had my meeting
with him today,

669
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,262
and I thought he was
going to tell me

670
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,731
how well I've been doing,
and instead...

671
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,950
he threatened to expel me.

672
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:48,588
Okay.

673
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,007
Okay, that--that doesn't mean
that it was Gibbs.

674
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,043
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't there, all right?

675
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,213
But it's not crazy to assume
that they would question

676
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,715
whether or not you knew about me
without talking to Gibbs.

677
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:01,051
Is it crazy for them
to mention a crime

678
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,137
you haven't even been accused of
without talking to Gibbs?

679
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,555
- What?
- They said there are rumors

680
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,940
of you taking the LSATs
for people

681
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:10,310
and they're accusing you
of doing that for me.

682
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,734
Well...at least now
I know what I need to do.

683
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,740
Harvey.

684
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,408
I know how we can stop Gibbs
from pressuring Rachel.

685
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,745
Does it involve going
to Scottie without telling me?

686
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,413
- Harvey.
- Goddamn it, you had no right.

687
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:32,132
I had every right,
because I knew Gibson

688
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,501
would keep crossing lines,
and that's exactly what she did.

689
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,585
What are you talking about?

690
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:36,753
She manipulated
the Dean of Columbia

691
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,004
into threatening
to expel Rachel.

692
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,256
Where's your proof?

693
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:42,008
They accused her of having me
take the LSATs for her,

694
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,843
and the only problem is,
there's no record of me

695
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,262
ever having
being accused of that.

696
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,898
- The guy you saw in court.
- Yes, his name is David Green.

697
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,433
He must've told Gibbs about me,
and then she used that

698
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,152
to get the dean
to strong-arm Rachel.

699
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,520
That's abuse of power.

700
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,438
I told you, the only problem
with that theory is,

701
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,940
David Green tells Gibbs
about you,

702
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:57,991
and his career is done.

703
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,576
Then he must've told her
anonymously.

704
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,994
Which doesn't help us,
'cause we still don't have

705
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,662
any proof that she
contacted the dean.

706
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:05,782
No, we don't, but it wouldn't
be that hard for me to get.

707
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,951
No, it could be a setup.
It's too risky.

708
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,869
This whole goddamn thing
is too risky,

709
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,038
but right now Rachel's future
is in jeopardy,

710
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,624
and if I have to risk tacking on
a few years to save her,

711
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,710
is not even a close call.

712
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,380
All right.
Do what you have to do.

713
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,132
Just don't get caught.

714
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:29,973
You're knocking.

715
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,809
That means it's either bad news
or you want something.

716
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,312
- I couldn't get the department.
- Don't tell me.

717
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:38,114
They said we're in no position
to poach anybody.

718
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,482
That's exactly
what they said,

719
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,484
right before they
offered me a job.

720
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,487
So you're here to tell me
you took it.

721
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,623
I'm here to ask you
if you want me to take it.

722
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,326
What the hell difference
does it make what I want?

723
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:52,495
Jessica, when I left Boston,
people said I was a traitor

724
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:55,832
and that I thought I was
too good for my own hometown.

725
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,500
Well, it wasn't true.

726
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,169
But I knew
the real test for me

727
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:00,804
wasn't making it
in my own hometown.

728
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,339
It was making it
in the toughest city

729
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:04,224
in the world, and as far
as I'm concerned,

730
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:08,511
I haven't done that yet.

731
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,847
You want to be made
name partner.

732
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,683
I wanna know if it'll ever
even be on the table.

733
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:17,103
I could say yes
to that right now,

734
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,357
but how would you know
you could trust me?

735
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,409
I have no other choice.

736
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:26,413
And how do I know
I can trust you?

737
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,702
What's this?
You know what it is.

738
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,209
It's what Daniel Hardman
has on you.

739
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,045
Now you have it too.

740
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,556
David Green.

741
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,226
What are you doing here?

742
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,360
So you do remember me.

743
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,396
Of course I do.

744
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,613
You're the guy
we're prosecuting.

745
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:01,731
The fake lawyer.

746
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,900
Oh, I'm more than that
and you know it.

747
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,068
What are you talking about?

748
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,870
You hired me
because I'm smart.

749
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,239
What you don't know is that
I have a photographic memory,

750
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,658
which means I have
your drivers license number

751
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,576
from seven years ago memorized.

752
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,246
Not that it matters, because
I also made a copy.

753
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:18,915
Like I made a copy of all
my clients' licenses.

754
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,333
That doesn't prove anything.

755
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,719
Maybe not, but I also remember
every answer I put down

756
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,721
on a 104 question test.

757
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,396
If that's not proof,
I don't know what is.

758
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,924
What do you want?

759
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,926
I want proof that Anita Gibbs'
pressuring the Dean of Columbia

760
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,728
to expel Rachel Zane.

761
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,646
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

762
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,934
Okay, they went
to law school together.

763
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:39,903
There's your connection.

764
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,523
Circumstantial public record
not good enough.

765
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,108
I do what you're asking
and get caught,

766
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,110
and my career at the U.S.
Attorney's office is over.

767
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:48,328
I give what I have
to the D.A.,

768
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:49,829
and your career as a lawyer
is over.

769
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:51,197
If you do that, you only
implicate yourself.

770
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,499
Yeah, maybe
you didn't notice, asshole,

771
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,374
but I'm already on trial,
and now you're coming

772
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,618
after the woman I love.

773
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,921
And the truth is you don't
deserve to practice law.

774
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,756
Maybe I don't either,
but she does.

775
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,458
And, believe me,
when it comes to this,

776
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,295
I really don't give a shit
about me or you.

777
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:07,267
And what if I can't find
what you're looking for?

778
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,631
You know what, David?

779
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,802
You might not have been smart
enough to get 178 on the LSATs,

780
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,305
but I'm pretty damn sure
you're smart enough to do that.

781
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:25,648
What's this?

782
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,033
That's what
you're gonna sign.

783
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:31,871
This says you're dropping
a charge

784
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:34,290
of malicious prosecution
in exchange for me admitting

785
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,575
a sanctionable offense.

786
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,710
And for backing the hell off
going after Rachel Zane.

787
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,078
- Is this a joke?
- No.

788
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,914
And neither is getting
the Dean of Columbia Law

789
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:42,215
to do your dirty work.

790
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,583
I don't know what
you're talking about.

791
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,051
You know exactly
what we're talking about.

792
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:46,503
And unless you want us
to tell the world

793
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:47,670
that you intimidated a witness

794
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:49,839
by colluding with your old
law school buddy,

795
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:50,890
you're going to sign that.

796
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:52,142
You don't have
a shred of proof

797
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,726
that I had anyone do anything.

798
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,762
I have a copy of an anonymous
tip sent to you,

799
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,180
saying I took the LSATs
for people,

800
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,182
and a record of a phone call
from your office

801
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,734
to the Dean of Columbia
ten minutes later.

802
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,986
That's no proof of anything.

803
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,071
It's proof enough for us
to sue Dean Herrick

804
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:06,322
for every penny
he's ever made.

805
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,857
You think when we get him
in a deposition

806
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:08,909
he isn't gonna crack?

807
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:19,035
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

808
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:20,453
Smart enough to outwit
a U .S. Attorney.

809
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,005
And if we can do it here,
what makes you think

810
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,206
we won't be able to do it
in court?

811
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:24,874
Because court is not about
bullshit like this.

812
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,176
It's about facts.

813
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,595
And the fact is, you're not
a goddamn lawyer.

814
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,479
You got it done.

815
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:50,730
- How'd you know?
- Because you're doing

816
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:52,015
that puffy chest thing you do

817
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,766
when you feel really good
about yourself.

818
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:55,018
I do not do
a puffy chest thing.

819
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,319
Yes, you do.
And relax,

820
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:58,855
because I love you
and your chest.

821
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:00,857
Well, I love you
and your chest.

822
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:02,408
- Hey!
- Oh, that came out wrong.

823
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:05,328
Seriously,
I meant your mind.

824
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,196
Your brilliant legal mind.

825
00:33:07,248 --> 00:33:11,668
Well, if it wasn't for you
and your brilliant legal mind,

826
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:14,370

Louis.

834
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,066
I need to talk to you
for a second.

835
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:44,367
What now?

836
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:45,868
Jack Soloff wants to know

837
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:49,155
if we'll someday consider
making him name partner.

838
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,074
Why the hell
would we do that?

839
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:53,626
Because I sent him
to poach a department

840
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,161
and instead
they offered him a job.

841
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:56,162
I get it.

842
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,247
Nobody wants to come here,
so your answer

843
00:33:58,299 --> 00:33:59,665
is to give our in-house enemy

844
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:01,667
the promotion
he's always wanted.

845
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,920
Louis, you're the one
who wanted me to do it before.

846
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:05,471
And you talked me out of it.

847
00:34:05,507 --> 00:34:06,923
Because you were right.

848
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:08,758
Just like you used to be right
about everything.

849
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,426
But now it seems like you're
wrong about everything.

850
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:12,011
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

851
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:13,730
I just heard back from
the last of those 20 schools.

852
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,515
And it turns out they have
a lot more in common

853
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,433
with Harvard that we thought,
because none of them

854
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:18,684
wants to do anything
to do with us

855
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:21,154
because our leadership sucks.

856
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:23,072
You watch yourself, Louis.

857
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:24,357
I don't need to watch myself.

858
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,026
I need to light a fire
under your ass.

859
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:29,028
Because our future
is slipping away,

860
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,696
and offering Jack
name partner

861
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:32,615
or praying to God
that Harvey

862
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,000
just gets Mike off the hook

863
00:34:34,035 --> 00:34:35,918
isn't going to stop it
from happening.

864
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:37,920
Okay, Louis.

865
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:41,791
You want to do something
more than pray,

866
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:45,461
Harvey gets Mike acquitted,

867
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:48,798
then you get your ass back up
to Harvard

868
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,936
and you make sure Sheila
doesn't show up to that trial.

869
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:05,582
Hi, Donna.

870
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:07,050
Is there, um...

871
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:09,002
is there something
I can help you with?

872
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:10,804
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry

873
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,555
about what happened
with the dean.

874
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:14,891
And I'm glad
that Mike took care of it.

875
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:19,179
Thank you.

876
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:26,102
I'm sorry that...

877
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:28,071
that I didn't come to you
with this whole thing,

878
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,272
but I-I...

879
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:31,074
They were pressuring you
to turn on Harvey

880
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:32,609
and based
on our last conversation,

881
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:34,527
you didn't think I was the right
person to talk to about that.

882
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,029
As usual, you're right.

883
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:40,950
Rachel, I got upset
because I didn't want to think

884
00:35:41,002 --> 00:35:42,335
about what I do
if I have to choose

885
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,837
between my dad and Harvey.

886
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:45,955
Because this whole
situation sucks.

887
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:49,092
And we may have to make
hard choices,

888
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:52,045
and I want you to know
that no matter what you do,

889
00:35:52,097 --> 00:35:53,963
you're my friend.

890
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:57,967
And I will always love you.

891
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,970
I will always love you too.

892
00:36:07,446 --> 00:36:08,561
Thank you for coming.

893
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,780
I only came here
because I don't want you

894
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:12,899
or Mike Ross or anyone else
from this firm

895
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:14,868
showing up at my firm
ever again.

896
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:17,487
So what can I do for you?

897
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,656
I was thinking
about what you said

898
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,324
about me not admitting
things to myself

899
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:22,542
and I wanted to
talk to you about it.

900
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:24,394
Why?

901
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,712
I wanted you to know
the truth.

902
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:27,330
And what exactly
is the truth?

903
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:29,048
Our relationship didn't
end because of Mike.

904
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:31,334
It ended because I wasn't
ready to confront

905
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:34,170
what was wrong with me,
and I don't know

906
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:36,005
if I'll ever be ready,
but...

907
00:36:36,057 --> 00:36:38,475
I've been seeing someone, and
I wanted to tell you about it.

908
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,844
And why does it matter
that I know that?

909
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:43,596
Because if I ever get out
of this in one piece,

910
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:47,517
I want to know if is okay
to call you again.

911
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,104
Harvey, it's always okay
to call me.

912
00:36:51,156 --> 00:36:53,940
I've actually been going
to therapy myself,

913
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:56,860
and I don't know
where I'll be

914
00:36:56,912 --> 00:37:01,164
when this whole thing
is over.

915
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,034
But I do hope that you get out
of this thing in one piece.

00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,988
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

927
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,911
Rachel.

928
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:53,299
Have you thought about what may
happen when this is all over?

929
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:56,469
You mean if Mike
goes to jail.

930
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:00,807
I mean even if he doesn't.

931
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:02,091
What are you talking about?

932
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:04,427
Even if he is acquitted,
there is an excellent chance

933
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:05,595
he will be thrown
out of the bar

934
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:07,207
and never be able
to practice law again.

935
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:08,598
It wouldn't matter,
because Mike is prepared

936
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,266
to never practice
law again anyway.

937
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:12,268
And sometimes people think
they're prepared

938
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,687
and they're not.

939
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:16,155
I don't understand.

940
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:18,775
Rachel, Mike is going to
have to watch you do

941
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:22,695
what he dreams of doing, and
if he's anything like Harvey,

942
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,627
he probably thinks he can do it
better than you.

943
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,115
And there is a possibility

944
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:28,167
that he might resent you
for it.

945
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:31,955
I appreciate the advise.

946
00:38:31,957 --> 00:38:33,673
But Mike is not like that.

947
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:38,294
Then I'm sorry
I overstepped my bounds.

948
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:48,271
Louis.

949
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:50,723
What are you doing here?

950
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:52,609
We've been over this.

951
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:53,726
There's nothing I can do--

952
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:55,028
I'm not here
about the associates.

953
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:56,562
I need you to take this.

954
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:58,364
- What's that?
- It's a ticket to Argentina.

955
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,732
I need you to go there
until the trial is over.

956
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,567
And why would I do that?

957
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,653
Because the prosecution has
no power to subpoena you there.

958
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:05,822
Let me get this straight.
You want me to flee the country,

959
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:07,707
so you can protect yourself.

960
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:11,411
I want you to flee the country
so you can protect yourself.

961
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:13,129
- Louis--
- Sheila, you take that stand,

962
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:14,998
and you're gonna say things
that hurt us,

963
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,133
which means Harvey is going
to say things that hurt you

964
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:18,501
and I will not be able
to handle that.

965
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:21,170
The truth isn't gonna
hurt me, Louis.

966
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:25,091
Isn't it true, Ms. Sazs,
that while you claim

967
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:27,810
no one had unauthorized access
to the Harvard file room,

968
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:29,929
there were times you were
derelict in your duties?

969
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:32,015
I've never been
derelict in my life.

970
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:33,599
Then how does that explain
the fact that there's a man

971
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:35,518
in this courtroom
that had unauthorized access

972
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,602
to that very room?

973
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:37,987
- Louis, please.
- Was it because you had

974
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,072
a relationship with that man?

975
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:40,757
A relationship
that ultimately failed?

976
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:41,924
- That's not--
- Relevant?

977
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,443
It's more
than goddamn relevant!

978
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:45,445
Because when he broke up
with you,

979
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:48,114
you started this vicious rumor
to get back at him.

980
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,033
That's a lie.
Those are all lies.

981
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:51,868
It is a lie that you had sex
with that man,

982
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,753
and left him alone
in the supposedly

983
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:55,204
impenetrable Harvard
file room?

984
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:56,756
Louis, this could
cost me my job.

985
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:59,375
Goddamn it!
Harvey is not gonna care.

986
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:03,880
No.

987
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:05,214
It's not a lie.

988
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,433
And if you did that
with him...

989
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:12,021
why should we believe

990
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:14,557
you didn't do that with others?

991
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:18,945
I'm sorry.

992
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,948
Sheila, I'm only trying
to protect you.

993
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,900
If you really wanted
to protect me,

994
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:26,202
you wouldn't tell Harvey
those things in the first place.

995
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:27,870
He's gonna want me
to tell him.

996
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:29,655
Anything I know
that would help.

997
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,792
You asked me
to not make you lie.

998
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:35,211
Please, don't ask me
to lie to him.

999
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:37,413
Okay, Louis.

1000

Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

1010

Because there's an expression
about that.

1011
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,443
It says, "if you're
thinking it, you're a fool."

1012
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:08,745
You heard her.
She said,

1013
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,446
"the fact is that I'm not
a goddamn lawyer."

1014
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:11,948

to see me being
a goddamn lawyer.

You try that,
all they're gonna see
