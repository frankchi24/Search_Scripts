1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,682
- I'm leaving you, Harvey.
- You can't just quit.

2
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:05,849
I'm not quitting.

3
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:07,351
I'm going to work for Louis.

4
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:08,936
Your sleepless nights
aren't going to stop

5
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:10,104
until you accept the fact

6
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:11,739
that your secretary
isn't coming back.

7
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:14,191
And I told you
they'll stop when she does.

8
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:15,826
This is my formal notice,
but I have no intention

9
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:17,778
of leaving you high and dry,
so let's talk about

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,113
finding you someone
in the next two weeks.

11
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:20,447
Do you know
what's best for me?

12
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,116
- Ripping the Band-Aid off.
- Harvey--

13
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:23,117
So why don't you
clean out your desk

14
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:24,668
and walk yourself
over to Louis?

15
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,203
Hey, Harvey, if there are
any hard feelings with Donna--

16
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,871
No, Louis, no hard feelings.

17
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:28,956
Okay, but I just want to say
if there were--

18
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,674
I said there's
no hard feelings.

19
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,292
Jack Soloff has been
going around the firm

20
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:33,794
saying you're never gonna
save that company.

21
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,547
Since when do you care so much
about what Jack Soloff says?

22
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,265
Since he's a senior partner
with ambition.

23
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,380
I called your father today.

24
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:41,602
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,
will you marry me?

25
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:44,054
Yes.

26
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:55,449
How come I never get
to pick the places we eat?

27
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,117
Because I don't want
chicken nuggets for dinner,

28
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:59,787
and you could take a break
from them yourself.

29
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,205
I don't see
a little healthy heart

30
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,823
next to this
duck liver mousse.

31
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:05,826
Very funny.
I got Mike to try it.

32
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:07,544
I can't help it
if the man is whipped.

33
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,197
Speaking of which,
let me see that ring

34
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:11,799
your mother
keeps talking about.

35
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,467
Ooh.

36
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:15,502
Okay. I guess he knows
what he's doing.

37
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:19,673
Well, he's marrying me,
so obviously.

38
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:21,425
While we're on the topic...

39
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:30,818
- This is a prenup.
- Yeah. I had Tom draw it up.

40
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:33,187
It's actually
a standard boilerplate--

41
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,905
I don't wanna start
my marriage

42
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,490
planning how
it's going to end.

43
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:38,358
Rachel, that is not what
a prenup is for,

44
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,726
and you know that.

45
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:41,802
It's to isolate assets
in order to protect yourself.

46
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,230
I don't have assets
to protect.

47
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,698
Yes, you do.

48
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:48,085
Right.

You're talking
about your money.

50

I haven't taken a dime
from you

51

from college.

52

Yeah, maybe not,

53

Timing couldn't be better.

160
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,783
You know what?
Bring it up.

161
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:58,835
Thank you, Louis.

162
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,892
What was that?

163
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:07,594
- What was what?
- That.

164
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:10,297
That was Jack Soloff wanting
to run his proposal by me.

165
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,100
Yeah. A bullshit proposal
designed to cut Harvey's salary.

166
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,101
You're picking
a fight with him.

167
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:15,268
No, I'm not.

168
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:16,470
I'm letting him
bring up his proposal

169
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:18,138
at the meeting,
so I can smack it down.

170
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,473
Why would you do that?

171
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,058
Because I saw the look
on Harvey's face.

172
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,642
He's jealous of us,

173
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:24,444
and I want the chance
to back him publicly.

174
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,813
Louis, Harvey
might be upset about us,

175
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,365
but encouraging people
to go after him

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,284
just so you can have his back
is a huge mistake.

177
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,890
You were at Millstein Swain
for seven years.

178
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,245
When Ellen Swain retired, I
decided it was time to move on.

179
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:41,044
Why not go to another partner
in the firm?

180
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,746
Because I didn't think
any of the other partners

181
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:44,164
were good enough.

182
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,582
I appreciate the honesty.

183
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:47,501
And I appreciate being
the first person you called in,

184
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:49,469
and if you're as good
at reading people as they say,

185
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:51,588
I'll also be the last.

186
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,807
- Is that a fact?
- Call anyone you want.

187
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:56,343
I'm the Deion Sanders
of legal secretaries.

188
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,812
- Deion Sanders?
- I'm quick on my feet.

189
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:00,167
I know how to
intercept a problem.

190
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:01,732
Yeah, but Deion Sanders?

191
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,484
If you prefer another era,
Dick Butkus.

192
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,020
Either way,
no one gets by me.

193
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,856
You don't look
like Dick Butkus.

194
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,109
No, I don't.

And I'm telling you

Michael is not leaving Nike.

I'm not here about Michael.

I'm not letting you do that.

226
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,136
I'm not asking
for your permission.

227
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:39,571
And I don't give a shit--
I'm not letting you sell

228
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,127
your company
for pennies on the dollar.

229
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:42,608
Where the hell
is this coming from?

230
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:44,176
It's coming from the fact that
life is short,

231
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,144
I'm burnt out,
and I'm ready to move on.

232
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,529
Life is short?

233
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:48,897
That's your reason
for not thinking this through?

234
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:50,065
I don't want
to think it through.

235
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:53,318
I might change my mind
and not do it at all.

236
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,988
Okay, Teddy,
you want to sell?

237
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,323
Sell, but we built this company
from the ground up.

238
00:08:58,325 --> 00:09:01,159
Give me a week
to get you a better offer.

239
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:03,879

they're giving me.

241
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,166
Then I'll take it.

242
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:13,255
By the way,
where's Donna?

243
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,390
- She moved on.
- You see?

244
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,175
That's what
I'm talking about.

245
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:18,393
Life is short.

246
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,895
Donna moved on
to something better.

247
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,014
She didn't move on
to something better.

248
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,315
What do you mean?

249
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,516
She's working for Louis.

250
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,351

What the hell happened?

251

253
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,906
Ah.

254
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,061
If she's working for that
asshole, something happened.

255
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:35,060
Teddy, you say you know
when it's time to move on,

256
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:38,530
it's time to move on
from this topic right now.

257
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,199
Okay, Harvey.

258
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:45,370
All I'm saying is Mrs. Keebler
out there ain't no Donna.

259
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:54,763
Twice in two days?

260
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,265
People are gonna get
the wrong idea.

261
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,716
Well, they can think what
they're gonna think,

262
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:59,551
but it's not going to stop me
from giving my boy

263
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:01,603
an engagement gift.

264
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,522
- You're giving me a case?
- It's not just any case.

265
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:06,024
This is right up your alley.
Do-gooder lane.

266
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,809
- All right.
- Listen, Mike.

267
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:09,645
These people got the shaft
for one reason.

268
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,897
They're poor, and no one
gives a shit about 'em.

269
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,466
They need a hero,
and you're that guy.

270
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:15,567
Why aren't you that guy?

271
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,235
Oh, I am that guy,

272
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,571
but you're the one
getting married to Rachel Zane.

273
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:21,907
The same Rachel Zane
that I almost got fired,

274
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,409
and then you gave me
a second chance.

275
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,244
So this is your way
of making it up to me?

276
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,546
Listen, Mike,
talk to the plaintiffs,

277
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,414
listen to their stories,
and I promise you

278
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:31,466
it'll break
your little bleeding heart.

279
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,970
Thank you, Jimmy.

280
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,420
Yeah, you bet.

281
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:37,839
What if I can't get
Jessica to sign off?

282
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,591
Then I'll just
take the case back

283
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,677
and get you a decanter
or some shit.

284
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,180
So it's unanimous.

285
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:46,848
From now on,
all first-years are required

286
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,601
to bill 2,800 hours
and bring their own lunches.

287
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,653
Congratulations, Louis,
another generation

288
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,822
of associates
smacked into submission.

289
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:55,657
Now, if you'll excuse me,

290
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,159
I think I'm done
with this meeting.

291
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:58,493
Harvey, please,
we still have new business.

292
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,112
Speaking of which,
I'd like to propose a change

293
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,614
to the current
compensation formula.

294
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:03,949
Excuse me?

295
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,500
Well, since taking over
the committee,

296
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:07,452
I've been evaluating
pay structures,

297
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:09,588
and I think it's high time
that this firm

298
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,957
put a larger emphasis
on billable hours.

299
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,626
Why don't you stick
to the 48th floor, Jack?

300
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,962
I take it you have a problem
with my proposal.

301
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,263
You're damn right I do.

302
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:20,182
I just took on the sale
of a man's company,

303
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:22,601
and my entire fee
is contingent-based.

304
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,469
Because you operate
as your own entity,

305
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:27,556
while the rest of us are members
of a team known as this firm.

306
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:28,890
No, because I bring in

307
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,442
a truckload of money
for this firm.

308
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,944
Well, like I said, special rules
for Harvey Specter.

309
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,945
You know what, Jack?
That's enough.

310
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,864
The current system
works fine,

311
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,865
and I don't appreciate
you speaking to Harvey

312
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,116
in such
a disrespectful manner.

313
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:39,701
- Are you shitting me?
- Harvey, I'm sorry.

314
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:42,070
Save your sorries, Louis.
This meeting's over.

315
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:43,455
Harvey, listen.
I'm on your side.

316
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,050
Yeah. I don't need you
on my side, okay?

317
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:46,375
- I have shit to do.
- Wait.

318
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,376
I haven't even brought up
my proposal yet

319
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:48,527
for the men's bathroom.

320
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:50,328
You want to finish
being king for a day?

321
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,413
Be my guest.

322
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,665
Enjoy your coffee
and your 50 sugars,

323
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:56,551
and go for it, but like I said,
I have shit to do.

324
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,144
Stanley was a good man.

325
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,063
Never missed a day of work,

326
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:10,098
provided for his family.

327
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,602
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

328
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:16,855
What did happen?

329
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,256
Like I told
the other lawyer,

330
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,443
he went to the hospital
with chest pains.

331
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:23,945
They said it was nothing.

332
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:25,697
He kept complaining.

333
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:28,266
Stanley never complained.

334
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:31,336
Two days later
they released him.

335
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:34,306
Stanley went to sleep
in our bed that night.

336
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:37,259
And he never woke up.

337
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:39,211
No.

338
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:40,879
He didn't.

339
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,764
Are you sure the hospital
released him

340
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,966
because the insurance company
cut his stay?

341
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:47,352
He was sick, Mr. Ross,

342
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,638
and they just sent him home.

343
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,857
There are over 200
other people

344
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:54,893
who had the exact same thing
happen to them.

345
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:56,394
You think
that's a coincidence?

346
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:58,113
No, I don't,

347
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,482
which is why I'm considering
reopening this case.

348
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:03,068
So what's stopping you?

349
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,319
Well, for one thing,
I want to know

350
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:05,704
why your other lawyer
dropped out.

351
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,906
Because they worked that man
to the bone.

352
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:10,242
He almost lost
his entire practice,

353
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:13,745
but I was told that you're
with a big, powerful firm.

354
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:16,631
I am...

355
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,083
but I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

356
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:19,801
to get them
to sign off on this.

357
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,804
So what are we
supposed to do?

358
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,756
You're supposed
to sit tight.

359
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,344
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

360
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:30,929
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

361
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:31,980
You stormed out
of the meeting

362
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:33,098
that we were supposed
to run together.

363
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,900
I didn't storm out,
I walked out

364
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,018
because you were doing
a shitty job running it.

365
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,353
What are you talking about?
I had your back.

366
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,605
After you let that clown
come after my salary.

367
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:41,857
I didn't let him
do anything.

368
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:44,326
I defended you,
and then you smack me down,

369
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:46,161
after which I had
to postpone a presentation

370
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:47,579
that I was
very passionate about.

371
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:50,582
It's a bathroom, Louis.
It smells sometimes.

372
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:51,937
So why don't you
just go in there,

373
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:53,702
do what people do in there,
and get out of my face?

374
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,370
You know what?
Donna was right.

375
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:57,839
I should have never tried
to make things right with you.

376
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,091
- Make things right with me?
- Yeah, Harvey.

377
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:03,011
I let Jack do that so that
I could put him in his place

378
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:05,463
and show you that I had
your back, but you can't see it

379
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,799
because you're too damn jealous
of me and Donna.

380
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,935
- What did you just say to me?
- You're jealous.

381
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,470
You know what, Louis,

382
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,689
if I was so upset
about the two of you,

383
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:16,641
why am I still paying
her salary?

384
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,310
Bullshit.
The firm pays her salary.

385
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:19,728
Not all of it.

386
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,147
You see, when I brought her
over here from the DA's office,

387
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,282
Jessica wouldn't hire her
because I was an associate,

388
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:26,034
so I paid her salary.

389
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,319
And then I made partner,

390
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:29,821
and I didn't think it
was enough, so I paid her more.

391
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:33,158
And again and again
and again.

392
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,410
So I've had enough
of you telling me I'm jealous.

393
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,078
Yeah, well, Donna
doesn't work for you anymore.

394
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,380
She works for me,
and the only person

395
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:40,549
who's gonna be taking care
of her salary--this guy.

396
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,000
- You got that?
- Fine by me.

397
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:43,585
But before you say that,

398
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,420
you better know what you're
getting yourself into.

399
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,138
Oh, yeah, I know what
I'm getting myself into,

400
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:49,891
because you can't put a price
tag on a woman like that.

401
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,132
I need to talk to you.

402
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,300
Let me guess.

403
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:01,169
You got into a pissing contest
with Harvey,

404
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,504
he told you he's been
covering Donna's salary,

405
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:05,840
you, out of pride, said that
you were going to take it on,

406
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,425
and now you're here to find out
how much you're on the hook for.

407
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:08,760
- Nothing like that.
- Oh, good.

408
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,094
- Then what is it?
- Everything you just said.

409
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:11,262
- Louis--
- Jessica, please.

410
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:12,647
- I just want to see the number.
- Okay, Louis.

411
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:13,865
You want to see the number?
Here's the number.

412
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,684
Thank y--
holy goddamn shit.

413
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:18,186
Are you sure you didn't
accidentally add a zero?

414
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:20,238
Yes, I'm sure.

415
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,357
Is there any way
the firm can--

416
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,192
The firm is not going
to pick this up.

417
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:26,494
Harvey knew that, and he chose
to pay her more anyway.

418
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,662
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

419
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,163
Well, it seems to me
you have two options:

420
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,559
You can tell Donna that Harvey's
been augmenting her salary,

421
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:32,700
and you don't want
to do it anymore.

422
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,836
- Negatory.
- Or you can pay it yourself.

423
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:36,587
- Not happening.
- There is a third option.

424
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:38,706
I can send her
back to Harvey.

425
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:40,758
How dare you?

426
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,386
What do you mean I'm not liquid?

427
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:55,690
Who told you
to only save 10% cash?

428
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:57,308
Well,
I don't care what I said.

429
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,476
Does my podiatrist
listen to me

430
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:00,695
when I tell him
I have hammertoe?

431
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:02,864
Is everything okay, Louis?

432
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,149
- Everything's wonderful.
- Okay.

433
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,452
Actually, it occurred to me

434
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:10,872
that we have not discussed
a very important subject.

435
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,957
What is it?

436
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:15,960
Donna, money's
a very sensitive issue.

437
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,161
Mm-hmm.

438
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,663
And I think you should be
fairly compensated.

439
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:21,716
I mean, I know how hard it was
for you to leave Harvey for me,

440
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,334
and I am forever grateful.

441
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,336
- It's just that I--
- Louis, shh.

442
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:27,672
I don't need a huge raise.

443
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:30,224
The standard 2%
is more than enough.

444
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,844
- 2%?
- Yes.

445
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:34,345
You have a huge heart,

446
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,931
but I already make more
than every other secretary

447
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,182
at the firm, so--

448
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:40,685
- 2% it is.
- Thanks, Louis.

449
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:42,737
Don't mention it.

450
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,866
Hey, do you have a second?

451
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,567
I need your legal advice
about something.

452
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,836
Yeah, of course.
What is it?

453
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:01,372
My fiancée left this prenup
in the kitchen.

454
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:04,275
I'm just wondering
if you think I should sign it.

455
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,379
Mike, it's not
what it looks like.

456
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,298
It looks like your father
had a prenup prepared

457
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,716
for you to make me sign.

458
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:13,217
Then it's exactly
what it looks like.

459
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,852
And I'm guessing
you don't want me to sign it?

460
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:16,220
No, I don't,

461
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:18,222
because he's been trying
to control me my entire life,

462
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:19,891
and I'm not gonna
let him do that with this.

463
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:21,659
Has it occurred to you

464
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:24,228
that maybe your father is only
doing this because he loves you?

465
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,730
I don't really care
why he's doing it.

466
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:27,865
Great marriages
don't start with contracts.

467
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,567
- I know that.
- Then why are you grilling me?

468
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,235
Hey.

469
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:33,538
Because there's a reason that
you didn't tell me about this,

470
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:36,741
and I need to know
what it is.

471
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:39,243
My dad said
he doesn't know the man

472
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:43,297
that I'm choosing to marry,

473
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,167
and I just--

474
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:49,320
I didn't want
to tell you that.

475
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:53,140
- Well, I found out anyway.
- Yeah.

476
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:56,594
Rachel, in the future,

477
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,312
I want you to feel comfortable
telling me this stuff

478
00:17:58,348 --> 00:18:00,765
in the first place.

479
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:02,600
I will.

480
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,527
Mr. Specter, I wanted to--

481
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:13,778
You're still here?

482
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,329
I don't leave
until you leave.

483
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,031
Well, in that case, what time
is my meeting with Adidas?

484
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,165
11:15.

485
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:20,585
I moved your 11:00 to 3:00
and your 3:00 to 5:00.

486
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,586
- Did you line up--
- Buyers?

487
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,454
I did
but not for another week.

488
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,039
Nike and Puma are overseas,
and you said

489
00:18:25,091 --> 00:18:26,707
Reebok didn't matter
if the other two can't be there.

490
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,209
God damn it.

491
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,127
- There's one more thing.
- What difference does it make?

492
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,963
I can't delay the sale
if I don't know

493
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,855
why my client is dumping
his company on a whim.

494
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:35,683
That's the one more thing.

495
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:37,268
Mr. Doyle's best friend died

496
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,936
a month ago
of pancreatic cancer.

497
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:40,354
He was 46.

498
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,606
How'd you know that?

499
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,524
Something he said to you
just before he started

500
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,526
talking shit about me
stuck in my head.

501
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:47,144
What exactly was that?

502
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:49,814
When people say "life is short"
two times in 30 seconds,

503
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:51,983
it's usually right
after somebody died.

504
00:18:51,985 --> 00:18:53,734
I take it you were listening
to our conversation.

505
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,903
That's what
good secretaries do.

506
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,289
- Sorry about the Keebler thing.
- You didn't say it.

507
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:00,491
Besides, it doesn't take
Albert Einstein to figure out

508
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:02,326
why you hired somebody
that look like me

509
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:03,961
to replace somebody
that look like her.

510
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:05,079
Listen, Gretchen, I--

511
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:07,298
You don't have to worry
about that with me.

512
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,333
I prefer my men manly.

513
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:14,505
Am I not manly?

514
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:16,507
Well, if you have to ask...

515
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,350
Mike, how you doing?

516
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:27,568
Robert.

517
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:28,936
What can I do for you?

518
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:31,272
I heard you wanted me
to sign a prenup.

519
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:32,990
I did.

520
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,108
I hope
you didn't take it personally.

521
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,776
Of course not,
I'm happy to sign it,

522
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:37,194
but Rachel did say
that you don't know

523
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:40,281
what kind of guy I am,
so I thought I'd come here

524
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,835
to show you that this is
the kind of guy I am.

525
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:46,621
You're going
after Kelton Insurance?

526
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:48,372
It's not about
who I'm going after.

527
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,174
It's about
who I'm representing.

528
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,176
I'm putting my ass on the line
for 200 people

529
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:54,011
who have no one to fight
for them other than me,

530
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,796
so if you're worried that
I'd go after Rachel's money

531
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:57,014
if something went wrong--

532
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,432
You're not
that type of guy.

533
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,934
No, I'm not.

534
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,769
I respect that.

535
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:02,887
Thank you, sir.

536
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,306
But let me
tell you something.

537
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:08,309
I used to be one
of those people,

538
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:11,562
and I scratched and clawed
my way to where I am today,

539
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,147
which is why I know

540
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:15,116
when you come from nothing
and you make yourself

541
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,817
into something,
you're always waiting

542
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,749
for the day they're gonna
come and take it away.

543
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:21,372
I'm telling you
that I come from nothing,

544
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:22,573
and I would never do that.

545
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,375
I'm not saying
you're gonna take it.

546
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,543
I'm saying
you might do something

547
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:27,244
that makes
someone else take it.

548
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:28,579
What do you mean?

549
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:30,081
You're learning at the feet
of Harvey Specter

550
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,382
and Jessica Pearson,

551
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:32,667
and they know
something I know.

552
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,152
You're gonna be
a great lawyer.

553
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:38,222
You're gonna
crack some eggs,

554
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:39,924
and you never know
when someone's gonna come at you

555
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,393
to take what's yours
for something you did.

556
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,562
- Robert, I would never--
- Let me finish.

557
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,233
I'm telling you this
because you're gonna be family.

558
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:53,604
You might not have crossed
any lines yet, but you will.

559
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:57,324
I'm just trying
to protect my baby girl.

560
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:01,445
Jessica,
you wanted to see me?

561
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:03,581
Actually, Louis
wants to see both of us.

562
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:04,865
Then let's get it over with.

563
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,534
Okay.

564
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:07,952
I would like to propose

565
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:09,453
a revamping
of the pay structure

566
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:11,122
under the following guidelines.

567
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,874
We increase the percentage
of billables the partners get.

568
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:16,127
We decrease the percentage
of contingent fees

569
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:17,762
- by an offsetting amount.
- What?

570
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:18,929
That's what Jack Soloff
said yesterday.

571
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:20,297
No, this is different.

572
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,600
I've capped the amount
it affects any one partner.

573
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:23,968
You got to be shitting me.

574
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,770
I know you're wondering why
I'm proposing this.

575
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:27,972
It's crystal clear
why you're proposing it.

576
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:30,474
You get the exact amount
to cover Donna's salary,

577
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:31,559
and you take it
out of my paycheck.

578
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:32,611
Louis--

579
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:33,561
This has nothing to do
with that.

580
00:21:33,613 --> 00:21:34,613
Jack had a great idea.

581
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:35,730
It just needed
some fine-tuning.

582
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:37,348
Fine-tuning?
You're the one that said

583
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:38,866
you only let him
bring it up

584
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,234
so that you can
smack it down.

585
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:41,485
Is that true?

586
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,654
Yes. Maybe, but I had
some time to think about it.

587
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:44,989
Jack put something
on the table,

588
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,457
and it's our duty
to follow through on it.

589
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:48,492
Oh, bullshit--you're only
following through on it

590
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:49,960
because you're a cheap
son of a bitch.

591
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:50,996
Harvey.

592
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:52,129
I don't want to hear it,
Jessica.

593
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:53,831
Yesterday, he accused me
of being jealous.

594
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:55,203
Today, he's coming
after my money.

595
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:56,467
- No, I'm not--
- Shut up.

596
00:21:56,502 --> 00:21:58,469
We both know Donna
going to work for you

597
00:21:58,504 --> 00:21:59,670
has nothing to do with you.

598
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:01,138
- You got lucky.
- Lucky?

599
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:02,923
Like a monkey
who won the lottery,

600
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,509
so the least you can do is
be a man, pay her yourself,

601
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:07,261
or suck it up
and tell her the truth.

602
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:08,429
All right. That's enough.
We're not doing this.

603
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:09,681
- I am a name partner.
- Louis.

604
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:11,015
No. He has no right to--

605
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,517
I will slap the taste
out of your mouth.

606
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:20,407
Thanks, Jessica.

607
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:22,026
I appreciate you being
on the same page.

608
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:23,027
Oh, we're not
on the same page.

609
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,411
What are you talking about?

610
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:25,863
I wanted the two of you
to run that meeting yesterday

611
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:28,065
to see if you were okay
with each other, but you're not.

612
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:30,668
He may be cheap,
but he's right.

613
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:32,419
You are taking your
Donna anger out on him,

614
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:33,871
and it needs to stop.

615
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:34,923
I don't have Donna anger.

616
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:36,540
Oh, like hell you don't.

617
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,342
And if you don't admit that
to yourself,

618
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,795
I'll slap the taste
out of your mouth too.

619
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:52,734
What you working on there,
Mike?

620
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:56,771
Um, nothing.
Just some cleanup.

621
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:58,023
What can I do
for you, Jessica?

622
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:00,241
You can tell me why
you reopened a case

623
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:01,609
against a major
insurance company

624
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,779
we were never a part of
to start with.

625
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:06,448
Um, I reopened it

626
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,583
because I looked at it
and it's a winner.

627
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:09,784
Well, I also looked at it,

628
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:12,203
and I say it's a loser.

629
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:13,255
Jessica, look--

630
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:14,422
You took a case
on contingency

631
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,125
where every plaintiff
is dirt poor,

632
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:18,676
which means, even if we win,

633
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:20,628
compensation for lost wages
is nothing.

634
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,963
You're leaving out
punitive damages,

635
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:24,215
and Harvey takes cases
on contingency all the time.

636
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:25,884
Yeah, he takes them
to make money,

637
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:27,302
not to save kittens
in trees.

638
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,471
And I just told you
this is going to make money.

639
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,056
And that's what you said
about Liberty Rail,

640
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:32,273
and instead of making money,

641
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:34,242
it almost ended
with Donna behind bars.

642
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,144
No one is going to jail
for this.

643
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:38,863
No, they're not, because it's
going to cost a fortune to fund,

644
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:41,449
and I'm not laying out that kind
of money on a long shot.

645
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:43,318
Jessica, look.
I promised myself that I--

646
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,036
I don't care
who you promised.

647
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,155
You took this case
without running it by me,

648
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:49,290
and you did it
because you knew I'd say no.

649
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:50,959
- Jessica--
- So that's enough.

650
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,995
Dump it, or I will.

651
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:04,506
I need to talk to you.

652
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:05,840
Really?

653
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,092
'Cause the last time
you talked to me,

654
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:09,427
you told me to open my mouth,
and you slammed it shut.

655
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,896
Because you wanted to go after
Harvey, but now I'm on board.

656
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:14,399
- Why should I believe you?
- Answer me this.

657
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:16,067
How many partners
do you have in your pocket,

658
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,735
if we put your proposal
to a vote?

659
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,104
I can get 45%.

660
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,355
Well, then the reason
you can believe me

661
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:21,606
is that I'm gonna get you
the difference.

662
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:23,691
How you gonna do that
if you don't have the courage

663
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:25,410
to back my plan
at your own meeting?

664
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:27,495
By showing everyone
at this firm exactly

665
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,780
what Harvey makes.

666
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,117
Now I know
you're bullshitting me.

667
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,169
You'd be fired
if you did that.

668
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:35,920
Not if I do it by accident.

669
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:42,293
Can you believe
that sneaker brings in

670
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:44,379
over a billion dollars
from China alone?

671
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:46,047
With earnings like that,
makes me wonder

672
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,433
why you're trying
to rip off my client.

673
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,135
Buying a man's company
for a fair price

674
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:51,769
is hardly ripping him off.

675
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:53,521
But it's not a fair price.

676
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:56,274
You gave my client 48 hours
to take your offer.

677
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,443
I'm gonna give you five minutes
to take mine.

678
00:24:58,478 --> 00:25:00,278
Double your money,
or I walk out the door.

679
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:01,396
That's ridiculous.

680
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:03,148
What's ridiculous
is you preying on a man

681
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,066
who just lost
his lifelong friend.

682
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:07,202
I'm a businessman,
not a grief counselor.

683
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:08,620
Then let me counsel you
on this.

684
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:10,488
Because he's grieving,
I have the ability

685
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,060
to go to the board
and delay this sale.

686
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,625
But you're not going to,
because you know

687
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,493
it'll drive down
the price even more

688
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:17,912
when he eventually
wants to sell anyway.

689
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:20,081
You're right,
it will,

690
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,883
but I'll tell you what,
Mr. Polk,

691
00:25:21,918 --> 00:25:23,918
it'll still be worth
more than your offer.

692
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,554
And after my client's grief
passes,

693
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,640
he may still want to sell,

694
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:30,175
but it sure as hell
won't be to you.

695
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:38,227
♪ ♪

696
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:56,784
I got to call you back.

697
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,786
How the hell
did you get in here?

698
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:01,756
I fired your assistant
ten minutes after I fired you.

699
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,291
Guess Amy still knows
how to get a person through.

700
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:04,542
Congratulations.

701
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,127
You made your way in.
You can make your way out.

702
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,546
Not before I give you
the chance to make $20 million.

703
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:16,304
Mm-hmm. What makes you think
I want to get in the business

704
00:26:16,356 --> 00:26:17,939
of underwriting
class-action lawsuits?

705
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:19,814
Because you're in the business
of making money,

706
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,476
and before you say no,

707
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:23,144
I'm gonna give you
20% off the top.

708
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,312
It's the best deal
out there.

709
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:27,949
Well, that's not
good enough.

710
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:31,319
25%.

711
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,988
Are you authorized
to do that?

712
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,957
No, you're not.

713
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:38,312
Knowing you, you probably don't
even have the authorization

714
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:39,661
to come to me
in the first place.

715
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:41,713
I came to you because this is
our chance to make it right.

716
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:43,998
Bullshit.
You need money.

717
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,917
That's the only reason you're
standing here in front of me.

718
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:48,503
Jonathan,
I could have gone anywhere.

719
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:50,972
I came to you for the same
reason I went to Walter Gillis,

720
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:52,090
to make it right.

721
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:53,725
Pick up the phone
and ask him.

722
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:01,816
I'm not Walter Gillis.

723
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:05,520
Tell Amy I said "thank you"
for getting you past security,

724
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:08,022
'cause now I'm gonna call
every investment banker I know

725
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:10,024
and tell them to pass
on your offer

726
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:12,360
because Mike Ross
can't be trusted.

727
00:27:23,757 --> 00:27:24,956
What the hell is this?

728
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:26,374
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

729
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,843
Yes, you do. This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

730
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:30,795
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

731
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:32,130
Donna, I need you to put that
back where you found it,

732
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,215
and I need you
to put it back now.

733
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:35,967
- I won't do it.
- That was not a request.

734
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:37,051
- That was an order.
- I don't care.

735
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:38,936
- I'm not gonna let you do this.
- See?

736
00:27:38,972 --> 00:27:40,855
I knew that you would jump
at the first opportunity

737
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,390
you had to take his side
over mine.

738
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:44,225
This isn't me
taking Harvey's side.

739
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:47,395
This is me stopping you
from making a huge mistake.

740
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,530
And if he did the same thing,
you wouldn't be stopping him.

741
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,449
Harvey would never
do anything like this,

742
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:53,067
and if he did,
I sure as hell would.

743
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,569
- Oh, bullshit.
- No, Louis.

744
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:55,737
It's not bullshit.

745
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:58,039
You have no idea
how many times

746
00:27:58,074 --> 00:27:59,874
I kept him from
going overboard with you.

747
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,949
- It was half my goddamn job.
- Well, you know what?

748
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:03,161
You didn't stop him
every time,

749
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,603
and you're not stopping me
this time.

750
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:06,798
Now, give me that thing.

751
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,166
Okay. Fine.
You don't want to put it back?

752
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:09,250
- I'll do it myself.
- Louis--

753
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:10,468
No. Donna, you know what?

754
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:12,086
You came to work for me.

755
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,388
You knew who I was
when you did,

756
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:14,756
so now it's time
for you to decide.

757
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:15,890
Are you with me or not?

758
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,470
While I'm not opposed to
unexpected gifts on my desk,

759
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,889
I do prefer
if they're made of chocolate.

760
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:45,941
Got it.

761
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:48,476
Next time I leave you
a signed prenup,

762
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:49,778
it will be made of chocolate.

763
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,565
Why did you sign it?

764
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:55,700
- I went to see your dad.
- You did what?

765
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:56,985
I wanted to show him

766
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,953
what kind of man
his daughter was marrying,

767
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,405
because I wanted him
to trust me.

768
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:04,075
Mike, he doesn't trust anybody,
which is exactly why

769
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:07,162
I'm not interested
in his marital advice.

770
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,747
But like you said,
I would appreciate it

771
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,299
if in the future,

772
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,751
you tell me if you're gonna
do something like that.

773
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:16,504
You're right, I should have told
you before I went over there,

774
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,841
but for the record, instead of
getting him to trust me,

775
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:21,643
I ended up trusting him.

776
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,061
- Mike--
- Rachel, listen to me.

777
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,847
I know you think that
he's doing this to control you,

778
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:31,252
but he thinks he's doing it
to protect you.

779
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:33,688
And the truth is
that I never had a father

780
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,358
who could do something
like that for me, so...

781
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,695
I think that you should try
and see where he's coming from.

782
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:59,430
What's that?

783
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,050
It's your new offer.

784
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:06,187
- It's twice the money.
- It's what I do.

785
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,306
And that's why
I pay you so much.

786
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:09,941
I didn't do it
for the money, Teddy.

787
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,559
I did it because you
were getting ripped off,

788
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:12,810
and I'm not gonna let
that happen to you,

789
00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:17,232
no matter what
the circumstances.

790
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,566
You found out.

791
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:21,569
Why didn't you
tell me what happened?

792
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:24,489
Because I didn't want you
to try and stop me.

793
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,157
You still could have
come to me.

794
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:27,458
And tell you what?

795
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,794
That my best friend
from when we were seven died

796
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,663
out of the blue?

797
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:33,331
I hadn't spoken to him
in 20 years,

798
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:35,333
because we got into a fight

799
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:39,420
over some woman whose name
I can't even remember.

800
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:42,056
And now I don't give a shit
about the sneaker business.

801
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,975
Well,
I would have understood.

802
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,978
Would you have?

803
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:50,064
Look, Harvey,

804
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,817
I appreciate what
you did for me.

805
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,603
If I'm ever back in business,
you'll always be my lawyer.

806
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:59,023
I'll always be your friend.

807
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,415
- Louis, do you have a second?
- Oh, I don't know.

808
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,701
What animal are you gonna
call me now? An iguana?

809
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:11,085
I'm not gonna call
you anything.

810
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,254
I'm here because I want
to put everything behind us.

811
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,839
Well, aren't I lucky?

812
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,709
Louis, please.

813
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,428
You were right.

814
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:24,465
I was a dick in that meeting
and again in the bathroom

815
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:27,185
and again with Jessica.

816
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,137
I said some things
that I wish I could take back,

817
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,389
but we've been friends
with each other for a long time,

818
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:36,945
and I don't want
to throw that away.

819
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,314
You really mean that?

820
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:40,782
I do.

821
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,317
Come here.

822
00:31:46,623 --> 00:31:49,490
Harvey, this is amazing.

823
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,493
I never thought
you would come to me and--

824
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:54,629
- Oh, shit.
- "Oh, shit" what?

825
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,131
I forgot. I have to put a bid
on an item on eBay.

826
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,634
- What?
- A Mongolian...

827
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,052
praying mantis piano ballet.

828
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,170
Good talk.

What's that for?

836
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,442
It's a retainer.

837
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:27,528
I am looking
for some legal advice.

838
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,113
I don't think
you can afford me.

839
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:31,866
It won't take long.

840
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:34,752
I just want you
to take a look at this.

841
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,123
You got Mike to sign this?

842
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:41,926
My dad did.

843
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,211
Then why are you
coming to me?

844
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,346
Because you once told me
that you have a father

845
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:46,881
just like mine.

846
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,851
Let me guess, you think Robert
is trying to control you?

847
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,519
He did manage
to construct a situation

848
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:54,222
where the two
most important men in my life

849
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:58,593
are making decisions
about me without me.

850
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,695
You know what I think?

851
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,498
I think this has nothing
to do with your dad,

852
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,533
and you know it.

853
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:10,906
Mike.

854
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:14,826
Yes. Mike.

855
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:17,495
That's the real reason
why you're coming to me,

856
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:19,414
even though
you told yourself it wasn't.

857
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,483
- It could protect me.
- It could.

858
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:25,420
It could also
do something else.

859
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:27,688
Undermine my relationship.

860
00:33:27,724 --> 00:33:29,290
Believe me.

861
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:32,260
I learned that one
the hard way,

862
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:35,096
which means you need
to ask yourself,

863
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:39,667
how much do you
really love Mike?

864
00:33:39,702 --> 00:33:42,837
I love him all the way.

865
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:44,872
Then don't sign it.

866
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:50,711
On the house.

867
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,617
And, Rachel,
as far as your father goes,

868
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:59,353
he and I don't always
see eye to eye,

869
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:01,823
but I do respect that man.

870
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:04,392
And if he is anything
like my father,

871
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:05,726
for all of his faults,

872
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:07,161
he would take a bullet

873
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:10,965
before he'd let anything
happen to his little girl.

874
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:13,017
Thank you.

875
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,227
Uh, okay.

876
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:24,979
Harold and I
ponied up last time

877
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,647
because it was
a special occasion,

878
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,366
but tonight drinks
are on you, my friend.

879
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,784
That's fair.

880
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:33,571
As much as I appreciate it,
Jimmy, I got to return the gift.

881
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:34,956
- What?
- Yeah.

882
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,073
- I can't take the case.
- No, no, no.

883
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:37,542
What do you mean
you can't take the case?

884
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,410
Jessica won't lay out
the money for the man hours.

885
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:41,496
Okay, then get somebody else
to lay out the money.

886
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,831
Mike, investment banks
are taking stakes

887
00:34:43,883 --> 00:34:44,883
in shit like this now.

888
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:46,000
You, of all people,
should know that.

889
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,084
You think
I didn't try that?

890
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,336
It didn't work.

891
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,505
God damn it, Mike.

892
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:52,723
You always said
you gave a shit about people.

893
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,225
And you said that
I could return this case.

894
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,677
I don't care what I said.

895
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,513
Jimmy,

896
00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:00,815
what the hell
is going on here?

897
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,184
Okay. One of the victims
was my uncle Keith,

898
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:05,153
but I didn't tell you about him
because my cousin came to me

899
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,737
and asked me
to make it right,

900
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:10,691
and I promised her
that I would.

901
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:13,995
It's just I don't have the juice
at my firm,

902
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,746
and I was--

903
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,198
I was too ashamed
to tell you.

904
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,934
- Jimmy--
- No, Mike, listen.

905
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:22,370
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you straight up.

906
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:25,423
But, please,
these people need your help.

907
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:33,714
What can I do for you,
Jack?

908
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:36,184
You can explain to me

909
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:39,053
how the hell you justify
making this much money.

910
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,555
Where'd you get this?

911
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:42,056
Was left in the copy machine.

912
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,774
- By who?
- I don't know.

913
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,393
But now I do know
why you pissed

914
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:46,894
all over my idea
at the meeting.

915
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:48,563
This is confidential.

916
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:50,481
It was confidential.

917
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,900
Now, every senior partner's
seen it,

918
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,402
and people are furious.

919
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,037
I earn every penny I make.

920
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,406
We'll see about that.

921
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,624
What are you talking about?

922
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:03,578
I just called for a vote
tomorrow on my proposal,

923
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,129
and I hope you've been
saving your money,

924
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:08,633
because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

925
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:26,639
So this is why you said,
"Oh, shit."

926
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,807
What's that?

927
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:29,375
Oh, you know what it is,

928
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,810
because you're the one
who left it

929
00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:32,445
in the goddamn copier.

930
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,814
Oh, my God, Harvey,
I was making copies

931
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:36,816
of everyone's salaries for
my records, and I must have--

932
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:37,984
Bullshit, Louis.

933
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,735
You did this
to come after me,

934
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:42,655
and after I apologized,
you ran and tried to stop it.

935
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,874
Harvey, please,
what's done is done,

936
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:46,325
and like you said before,
we're friends.

937
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:48,628
We can move past this, and we
can fight the vote together.

938
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:50,997
There's no way I win the vote
after people see this.

939
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:52,632
You want to get past it?
Admit what you did.

940
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,166
That's automatic termination.

941
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:55,334
Then we'll fight that
together.

942
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:56,335
- Harvey, I can't.
- Louis!

943
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:57,887
Jessica tried
to fire me once.

944
00:36:57,922 --> 00:36:59,338
I can't give her the chance
to do that again.

945
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,340
Well, you know what?

946
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:02,174
It's gonna happen again,

947
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,810
because I know what you did.

948
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:07,430
You know what?
That's enough.

949
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:09,015
And you come at me
flinging accusations,

950
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:10,182
well,
you better have proof.

951
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:11,651
You have proof, Harvey?

952
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:14,403
Yeah, I didn't think so.

953
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:20,743
Harvey, you don't get
to come to me

954
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:21,744
at all hours
of the night anymore.

955
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:23,446
I'm here
because your new boss--

956
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:25,197
- I know why you're here.
- Then you know what he did.

957
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,282
And I need you to admit it,

958
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:28,167
so I can block
their bullshit vote.

959
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:29,785
And get Louis fired?

960
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:31,954
He wouldn't be in this mess
if you'd have just stopped him

961
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,372
from doing this
in the first place.

962
00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:35,925
Harvey, if I knew Louis was
gonna do something like this,

963
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,209
and I'm not saying I did,

964
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:39,345
then I would have
told him to his face not to.

965
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,713
But if he went ahead
and did it anyway,

966
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:42,515
then I'm not gonna
go behind his back to fix it.

967
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,717
Because you always said,
"Once you pick a side,

968
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,052
"if you're not loyal
to that side,

969
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:47,053
then who the hell are you?"

970
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:48,437
Then you should have
thought of that

971
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:50,056
before you picked someone who
would do something like this

972
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:51,557
in the first place.

973
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,976
You want to know
what kind of man Louis is?

974
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:56,228
This whole thing started
because he wanted to prove

975
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,363
to you that he had your back,

976
00:37:57,398 --> 00:37:59,315
because he thought
you were jealous of us.

977
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,951
No, this whole thing started

978
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:05,037
because I told him that
I've been paying your salary

979
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:06,739
since we came to the firm,

980
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:09,575
and he was too cheap
to pay it himself and too weak

981
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:13,462
to tell you the truth.

982
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,514
And if you've kept that
from me for 12 years

983
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,335
and you're only just telling me
now, then maybe you are jealous.

984
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,426
Mike, how'd you get in?
Give you a key already?

985
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:30,262
No. Laura let me in.
She said you'd be back here.

986
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:31,264
I don't know why.

987
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:34,266
I'm trying
to find something tasty.

988
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:36,736
There's not one damn thing
that's bad for you

989
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:37,903
in this entire house.

990
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:39,155
Then I guess it's a good thing

991
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,108
I didn't tell her
that I brought you these.

992
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,078
Oh, chicken nuggets.

993
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:47,780
Rachel made them herself.

994
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:50,032
Deep-fried, not baked?

995
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:51,167
You're welcome.

996
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:52,668
She sign that prenup?

997
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:56,372
No, but she sent those
because she realized the prenup

998
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:59,625
was about love,
not control.

999
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:02,845
Then I respect her decision.

1000
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,263
What changed her mind
about me?

1001
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:05,681
You really want to know?

1002
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:07,032
- Mm-hmm.
- Jessica.

1003
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:08,551
Oh, shit.
What did she say?

1004
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:10,302
I got to know that secret.

1005
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:11,554
I don't know
what she said to Rachel,

1006
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:14,940
but I know
what she said to me.

1007
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:16,942
So that's why you're here.

1008
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:20,146
You know those people that
I told you I was fighting for?

1009
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:25,451
Jessica's not
gonna go for it.

1010
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:26,719
I get it.

1011
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:29,288
Too much money to lay out
for too little payoff.

1012
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:33,959
But you said you came from
the same place as these people.

1013
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:38,247
Robert, they need someone
like you to fight for them,

1014
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:41,133
and I can't do it.

1015
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:43,752
So I'm asking you to.

1016
00:39:43,805 --> 00:39:45,045
You think this case
is a winner?

1017
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:46,639
I do.

1018
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:50,509
Then what do you say
we do it together?

1019
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:54,680
What are you doing here,
Louis?

1020
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:56,565
I notice you didn't come
to the vote this morning.

1021
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:59,401
No, I didn't. I was busy
closing a deal for my client.

1022
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:01,570
Let me guess. You had 'em
backdate your sale to yesterday,

1023
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:03,022
so it falls
under your old pay structure?

1024
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,674
No, Louis,
that's something you would do,

1025
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:07,526
because unlike you, I don't
actually care about the money.

1026
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:08,861
You expect me
to believe that?

1027
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:10,446
I don't care whether you
believe it or not.

1028
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:13,699
My compensation package
was about recognizing what I do.

1029
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,034
Money was just a consequence.

1030
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:16,752
That's why I didn't mind
sharing it with Donna.

1031
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:18,254
- Now, get out.
- No.

1032
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:21,090
You did care about the money,
because it was the last thing

1033
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,092
you had that separated you
from me.

1034
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:25,344
- Excuse me?
- I got name partner.

1035
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:28,047
I got Donna,
and that drove you nuts.

1036
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,132
So you shit on me
at the meeting,

1037
00:40:30,184 --> 00:40:32,101
and then you pretended
to apologize.

1038
00:40:32,136 --> 00:40:33,636
I did apologize, Louis.

1039
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:35,221
I came to you
like a man,

1040
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:37,973
and then when I gave you
the chance to make it up to me,

1041
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:40,109
you choked,
like you always do.

1042
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:41,477
Well, how you like me now?

1043
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:43,779
Because the only thing you
had left was that you made more.

1044
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:45,481
And now you don't,
and I win.

1045
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:48,901
You didn't win anything.

1046
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,286
What are you talking about?

1047
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:53,405
I'm talking about the fact
that no matter what you get,

1048
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,124
you're always wanting more.

1049
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:57,459
And the problem
with always wanting more is

1050
00:40:57,495 --> 00:41:00,079
that the second you get it,
it can always be taken away.

1051
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:01,330
You're not reversing
that vote.

1052
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:02,715
I'm not talking
about the vote.

1053
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,085
I'm talking
about what you value most.

1054
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:07,137
That's right.

1055
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:09,421
Might not happen today
or tomorrow,

1056
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:12,258
but it's gonna happen, because
I'm gonna make it happen.

1057
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,094
One day, you're gonna walk
into your office,

1058
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:16,962
and she's gonna be gone.
