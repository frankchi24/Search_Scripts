Avery McKernon

I ever brought into
the firm.

3
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:06,883
I have stacked my engines
up against Bronson

00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:08,885
and everyone else's
in the world, and mine win,

00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,253
because I make sure
they're designed

6
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,388
better than anyone else's.

7
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:12,889
And that's the speech
you're gonna give.

8
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:14,674
I said I was giving you
50% of McKernon.

9
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:17,260
I didn't say I was keeping
the other 50%.

an upgrade in representation?

the worst mistake
you ever made as a therapist?

- I killed someone.
- What?

18
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:38,081
A client needed someone
to get his son out of rehab

19
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:40,083
so that he could attend
his mother's funeral.

I knew deep down inside
he wasn't ready,

the go-ahead anyway,

of the funeral...

I took a look at the man

that I'm the man in charge.

111
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:11,961
But you're not
the man in charge,

112
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:13,997
because Harvey gave you and Mike
McKernon Motors to share.

113
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,298
But Dominic
doesn't know that,

114
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,916
and Mike and I gave him
a card at the same time.

115
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,334
And Mike's says "associate,"

116
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,136
and mine says
"Pearson Specter Litt,"

117
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,171

the "Pearson Specter" like I always do.

118
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:24,173
Louis, did you not hear
what Jessica said

119
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,341

all the pettiness?

120
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:26,509
Yeah, that was

a certain amount
of non-pettiness in me,

124

needs to come out somewhere.

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,350
Okay, Louis, you want Dominic

Mm-hmm.

127
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:37,520
Then you need to stop worrying
about who he called

128
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:39,689
and start worrying
about what he needs,

Well, maybe this
will knock the cobwebs out.

139
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:02,045
He said the last time

of one Rachel Zane.

146
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,890
I told him if he didn't
behave himself,

147
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:15,391
I'd kick his ass myself.

148

You'd do that,
wouldn't you?

149

I sure as hell would.

150
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,562
And if you don't get
in there this second,

00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,915
Rachel, this man
is an asshole,

160
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:41,334
and he was willing to let
an innocent person go to jail.

161
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:44,053
And now I'm an innocent person
who could go to jail.

162
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,388
What?

163
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:47,890
I'm being accused of making
unauthorized trades.

164
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,726
- By Morello?
- I don't work there anymore.

165
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:51,094
I work at Butler Trading.

166
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,736
Good for you.
Were they authorized or not?

167
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:55,098
I swear to God
I didn't do one thing

168
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,733
they don't know about.

169
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,851
And let me guess,
you don't have any proof?

170
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:02,071
No, I don't...

171
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:03,690
because that's the way
things work.

172
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,158
What does that mean?

173
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:07,527
It means he's saying
they checked his trades

174
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:09,445
enough to decide
it was okay with the risk

175
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,080
but not enough
to put it in writing.

176
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,532
Okay, but why wouldn't
they put it in writing?

177
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:14,117
Because they would rather
say I went rogue

178
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,035
than pay a $2 million fine.

179
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,754
Here's the problem, Sam.

180
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:20,590
Why should I believe you,
when the last time we met

181
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,759
you were the one
who was willing to put

182
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:24,127
an innocent person away?

183
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:26,379
Because I didn't know
she was innocent.

184
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:30,383
And the truth is...
I didn't care.

185
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:33,469
But you did.

186
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,305
I'm telling you...

187
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:38,775
I didn't do this.

188
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,562
Please, I need your help.

189
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,397
If I find out
you're lying to me,

190
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,149
this time I won't
just threaten you.

191
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:49,089
I will beat the shit
out of you.

203
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,738
Donna, could I talk to you
for a minute?

204
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,813
Yeah, if you can tell me
where the honey is hiding.

205
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,032
Hey, hey, hey.

206
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:37,820
Oh, sneaky little bear.

207
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,204
So what's on your mind?

208
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,405
Okay, so I'm trying to plan

209
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,790
something special
for our wedding.

210
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,208
What?
We're getting married?

211
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,327
Mike, this is so sudden. I'm
gonna have to think about it.

212
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,995
And what about Rachel?
Oh, who cares about Rachel?

213
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:48,547
- I love you.
- Are you finished?

214
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,716
- Do I have to be?
- Donna, I'm serious.

215
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,551
Okay, what do you need?

216
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,086
Rachel told me
it was her fantasy

217
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:56,338
to get married on her birthday
at The Plaza Hotel.

218
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,390
So I called to arrange it,
but then--

219
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,342
They're booked
for the next five years.

220
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:01,677
How did you know that?

221
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,896
Same reason you came to me
for help--I know what I know.

222
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,898
Well, I need someplace
just as good.

223
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,316
There is no place
just as good.

224
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,567
So what am
I supposed to do?

225
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,569
You already did
what you're supposed to do.

226
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,654
You came to me.

227
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,658
Now, put Brody back
and don't hide him this time.

228
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,193
You named the bear?

229
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:20,195
You want me to help you
or not?

230
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:27,619
Paul Gilroy.

231
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:29,254
Yes.
And you are?

232
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,925
I'm the guy who's gonna
keep Sam Tull out of jail.

233
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,593
And how are you
gonna do that, Mister--

234
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:36,044
Specter.

235
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:38,347
Harvey Specter.

236
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:41,800
You're gonna pay that fine
and admit what you did.

237
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:44,803
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, Mr. Specter,

238
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:47,306
but there's no way I'm admitting
to something I didn't do.

239
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:48,557
Whether you admit it or not,

240
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,976
you're gonna write a check
either way.

241
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,112
It's up to you whether it's
for $2 million or $30 million.

242
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:55,447
My associate seems
to be running late,

243
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:58,116
so go ahead, take me for
a walk down Bullshit Lane.

244
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,902
We're suing you
for $30 million.

245
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:02,070
Well, I must have fired
five other people,

246
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,907
because wrongful termination's
capped at $5 million.

247
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,792
We're not suing you
for wrongful termination.

248
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:09,077
We're suing you
for malicious prosecution.

249
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,879
You can't do that.
I'm not a prosecutor.

250
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,748
No, you're not,
but you're framing my client

251
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,716
for a crime
he didn't commit.

252
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:16,134
So it's up to you, Paul.

253
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,253
Write the little check
or the big check.

254
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:21,256
Ball's in your court.

255
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:29,264
Dominic, you're here early.
How are you?

256
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,599
Good.

257
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:32,267
In fact, I was just thinking
about the last time I was here.

258
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:33,769
You were helping me
become CEO.

259
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:35,604
Oh, come on, you pretty much
became CEO all on your own.

260
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,573
Well, it doesn't matter
how I got there.

261
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,775
You're gonna
help me stay there.

262
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,577
What's that?

263
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:44,112
The future
of battery-powered engines.

264
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:46,782
We need it,
or we don't survive.

265
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,367
I'm guessing there's a catch.

266
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,085
The catch is
it costs a fortune.

267
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,789
But I have a handshake deal
with the CEO of Range Tech.

268
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,123
We started
as mechanics together,

269
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,708
and if I can close
in two weeks,

270
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,128
he'll sell me the whole company
at a price I can afford.

271
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,432
If I can't,
he puts it on the market.

272
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,934
We'll be out of business
in ten years.

273
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,970
What's going on?

274
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,136
You guys starting
the meeting without me?

275
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:09,554
No, Dominic
just got here early,

276
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,056
but the headline
is he wants us

277
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,891
to close a handshake deal
to buy Range Tech

278
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,142
within the next two weeks,

279
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:15,644
and I was about to tell him
that we could.

280
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:17,980
Well, I'm sorry,
but we can't.

281
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,314
What do you mean
you can't?

282
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:21,316
I mean there's no way that
we can close a deal like this

283
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:22,951
in two weeks without skipping
due diligence.

284
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,153
No, Louis, he's known
the CEO for 30 years.

285
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:26,571
So we don't have to skip it,

286
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:28,824
but we can do
a streamlined version.

287
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:30,626
Okay, well, then we might
as well not do it at all.

288
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:31,994
We don't get it done
in that time,

289
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,295
I can lose this deal.

290
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,330
They put a clock on it.

291
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,580
And why would they do that?

292
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:36,965
I'll tell you why,

293
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,601
because they know
you won't pay attention

294
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,469
to whatever it is that they're
trying to slide by you.

295
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,220
Slide something by me?

296
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:44,423
This is my friend.
We have a handshake deal.

297
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,141
A handshake deal
doesn't mean shit.

298
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,676
- Louis!
- It's okay, Mike.

299
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:49,845
Obviously Louis
doesn't get me.

300
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:54,016
Because to me, a handshake deal
means everything.

301
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,186
So you do whatever due diligence
you can in the next week,

302
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,188
because if you mess up
my deal,

303
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,691
I'll be looking
for a new law firm.

304
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,366
Paul Gilroy's
lawyer called.

305
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:12,368
That was fast.

306
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:13,702
Want the bad news
or the worse news?

307
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:14,836
Why don't you give me both

308
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:16,038
and let me decide
what kind of news it is.

309
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,339
Not only are they not
paying the fine.

310
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,758
They also filed a motion
to have our suit dismissed.

311
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,630
- Man, I should've known.
- Should've known what?

312
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:27,849
That you were full of shit
when you said Dominic calling me

313
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,384
to set up that meeting
didn't bother you.

314
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:30,852
I don't care who he called.

315
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,521
I did what I did in there
because the client comes first.

316
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:34,389
Bullshit, you antagonized me
and then Dominic.

317
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:35,807
Oh, what meeting
were you in?

318
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,526
I wasn't antagonizing him.
I was protecting him.

319
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,777
Oh, really?

320
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:40,395
By shitting all over his idea
and then pissing him off?

321
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:41,813
I don't care
if we pissed him off.

322
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:43,398
He doesn't need a friend.

323
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,067
What he needs is for us
to be great lawyers.

324
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,035
Louis, you have a history
of getting bent out of shape

325
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,487
over hierarchy,
so don't tell me

326
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:50,072
that has nothing to do
with this.

327
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,406
Okay, fine, Mike.
You know what, you're right.

328
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,325
I did get bent out of shape.
<i>Did.</i>

329
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,494
But then I got over it,
because as I said,

330
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:57,079
the client comes first.

331
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:58,521
You really expect me
to believe that?

332
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,549
Mike, a few years ago,
Dominic spent 90% of his time

333
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,833
under the hood.

334
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,218
He is rushing into this

335
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,170
because he feels it's his only
chance, and you know it.

336
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,839
You think Harvey would sign off
on this without due diligence?

337
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,727
And let me guess, you expect me
to do all the work?

338
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:13,729
No, you take half,
I take half.

339
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,181
We do the work together.

340
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,856
Oh, you're not hearing me.

341
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,908
- Oh, I'm hearing you.
- No, you're not.

342
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,777
I'm calling on behalf
of Michael Jordan.

343
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:30,662
I don't care who
you're calling for.

344
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:32,497
We're booked on that date.

345
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh, but your assistant,
Ginny, said that the Smiths

346
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:37,502
might be willing to, um--

347
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,005
First of all,
it's Patricia, not Ginny.

348
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,007
And it's the McMillans,
not the Smiths.

349
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,542
So, if you don't have
anything else, then--

350
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,460
You know what?
That was a legitimate question,

351
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,262
and it would be nice
if you weren't so rude.

352
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:49,598
So the least you can do
is messenger over a brochure,

353
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,849
because if you don't,

354
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:53,051
Mr. Jordan is gonna call
the manager of The Plaza

355
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:55,721
and get your ass fired.

356
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,611
Louis, I need
to talk to you.

357
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:03,886
I was just on my way
to see you.

358
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,397
About the pending
EPA investigation?

359
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:06,929
- Shit.
- I thought you'd be gloating.

360
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,066
You're the one
who wanted this.

361
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:09,484
I didn't want this.
I feared this.

362
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,536
If Dominic buys Range Tech,
he's in huge trouble.

363
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,155
And if we tell him that
without having a solution,

364
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:14,289
he'll fire us.

365
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,540
That's the thing.
I have a solution.

366
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,336
I found a company
that has a battery division

367
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:18,460
that we can buy.

368
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:19,661
Now, we just have
to approach them and--

369
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:20,879
No. Did you not just
hear what I said?

370
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:22,214
We cannot jeopardize
his deal.

371
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:23,548
We won't be jeopardizing it

372
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,000
if we can get them to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

373
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,468
And the only way we'll be able
to get them to do that

374
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:27,719
is if they're our client.

375
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:29,554
Well, then it's
a good thing they are.

376
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,889
You found one
of our own clients?

377
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:31,973
You're a genius.

378
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,141
Yeah, there's only
one problem.

379
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,393
They're Jack Soloff's client.

380
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:35,927
Forget it, we need to find
another company.

381
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,145
There is no other company.

382
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,263
Mike, there is no way
that Soloff

383
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,765
will work with us on this.
He hates me.

384
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,600
Then we have to find a way
to make him un-hate you,

385
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,735
because I'm telling you,
this deal is good for Jack,

386
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:45,070
and it is good for us.

387
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:47,906
There has to be a way.

388
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:50,108
Well, then you talk to him.

389
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,860
Are you--are you saying
you want me

390
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:53,612
to negotiate with Soloff
on my own?

391
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,580
I'm saying we're a team,
and there's a better chance

392
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:57,282
of Soloff saying yes
to you than to me.

393
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,789
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

394
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,173
What are you doing here?

395
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,958
I was just getting an NDA.
What are you doing here?

396
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,010
I am actually here for you.

397
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:12,431
I'm making copies of a brochure
from The Plaza Hotel.

398
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,099
Wait, so you got it done?

399
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,301
No, I called them,
and they were dicks,

400
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:18,220
and they got pissed at me.

401
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,522
So you failed?

402
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,307
Okay.

403
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,109
If by "failed,"

404
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:25,811
you mean
I got the name

405
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,279
of the wedding planner,
her assistant,

406
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:28,447
the couple getting married,

407
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,565
and a brochure
with their letterhead on it,

408
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:32,317
then, yeah, Mike,
yeah, I failed.

409
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:34,486
Whoa, Donna, are you sure
you can handle this?

410
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,121
Do you ask a chef
who's cooking

411
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,540
if the meal's gonna
turn out okay?

412
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,709
No, you sit back,
you behave yourself

413
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:43,462
until you get the best
duck<i> à l'orange</i>

414
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:44,963
you've ever tasted.

415
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:46,918
Yeah, I don't really like duck
with orange stuff.

416
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:48,550
- Get out.
- Gone.

417
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:56,641
I like the way
you operate.

418
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,343
Excuse me?

419
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:00,762
Never let them
see you sweat.

420
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:02,430
What makes you think
I'm sweating?

421
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:03,982
My eyes.

422
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:05,767
You may have fooled Opie
with that metaphor,

423
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,686
but we both know you got
duck<i> à la</i> shit.

424
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:10,655
Okay, new girl, I don't know
who you think you're talking to,

425
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,440
but this is what I do.

426
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:14,776
What you do.

427
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:16,444
I've been doing
shit like this

428
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:19,614
since you was an itch
in your daddy's pants.

429
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:24,953
Hang on, did you just
quote<i> Lethal Weapon</i> to me?

430
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,755
You got that?

431
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,541
Maybe you do have
something.

432
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:32,594
Good luck
with your duck, Red.

433
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:38,049
Mr. Tull, how long have you
been working at Butler Trading?

434
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,634
Almost three years.

435
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:40,936
And how much money
have you made

436
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,304
for their clients
over that time?

437
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,773
Approximately $150 million.

438
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,057
So let me get this straight.

439
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:47,809
You made a trade, lost money,
they did nothing.

440
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:50,445
But the day they find out
that they have to pay a fine,

441
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,397
they said you were acting alone

442
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,115
and they're letting you
go to jail?

443
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:55,483
Exactly.

444
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:56,985
And how do you know
they signed off on your trade?

445
00:15:57,037 --> 00:16:00,405
Because everyone knows that
they sign off on every trade.

446
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:02,908
And, ultimately,
who would be responsible

447
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,493
for stopping a trade
that violated regulations?

448
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:07,913
Paul Gilroy.

449
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:10,248
So it couldn't possibly be that
you knew what you were doing,

450
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,168
you kept it secret, and that
all of this is your fault?

451
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,086
It could be,
but it isn't.

452
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:16,321
Well, that's interesting,

453
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:18,256
because we have somebody
who says it is.

454
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,424
And who the hell is that?

455
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,842
- Mr. Tull's therapist.
- What?

456
00:16:20,894 --> 00:16:22,677
A therapist can't testify
against their own patient.

457
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,512
She can if we paid for it
and he signed a waiver,

458
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,348
which he did.

459
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,686
Mr. Tull, your therapist's
testimony is coming,

460
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:35,357
and when it does, your ability
to cut a deal goes away.

461
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,942
Drop this matter,

462
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:40,695
and no one ever knows
you saw a therapist at all.

463
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,667
You went to see
a company-provided therapist,

464
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:47,118
and you never told me?

465
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,336
I didn't think it mattered.

466
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:50,121
Well, it goddamn does.

467
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,457
Did you tell this woman
you did this?

468
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:54,009
No, because
I didn't do this.

469
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,961
Well, they're not bringing her
in to testify to that.

470
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,462
I told her that I felt guilty,

471
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,180
as if the whole thing
was my fault.

472
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,682
I never said it was.

473
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:01,883
Well, you might as well have,

474
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,218
because that's what
it's gonna sound like.

475
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,803
- Harvey--
- How could you be so stupid

476
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,688
to confide your feelings
to a stranger?

477
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:08,189
Because I needed help.

478
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:10,475
And if you're not gonna talk
about your feelings,

479
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,477
you might as well
not see a therapist at all.

480
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,369
You better hope
there are therapists in prison,

481
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:15,981
because if I can't
stop her from testifying,

482
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,116
that's where
you're gonna end up.

483
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:34,833
Mike Ross, what brings you
down to my office?

484
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:36,334
I'm here with a proposal
from Louis.

485
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,346
You're here because
Louis wants something from me,

486
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:39,721
but he's too afraid to ask.

487
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:41,006
He's not afraid.

488
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:42,674
He just sent me here
because he figured

489
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:44,676
you might hear it better
coming from me.

490
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:45,927
Well...

491
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:47,562
McKernon Motors wants
to make an investment

492
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,264
in battery technology.

493
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:52,183
We'd like to quietly negotiate
with Tanaka,

494
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,686
and we need your help
getting them to sign this.

495
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:57,689
And why would I do that?

496
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:58,940
Because it's huge money,

497
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,525
and now that
contingent compensation

498
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:02,744
is back at the firm,
it's huge money for you.

499
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:05,196
And the last time Louis came
to me with an offer like this,

500
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:06,414
it was bullshit.

501
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,616
Well, I'm not Louis,
and this isn't bullshit.

502
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,702
Then I guess I just
have one question.

503
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:12,834
How much of the deal are you
authorized to give away?

504
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,956
50%, and that's
more than fair.

505
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,542
Maybe it is,
but I want all of it.

506
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:19,794
You know this helps
your client, right?

507
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:22,047
I don't give a shit.
All of it or none of it.

508
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,381
It's gonna be none of it,

509
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:25,050
and you're just taking money
out of your own pocket.

510
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:26,885
I don't care,
because this isn't about money.

511
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,054
It's about getting even,
so run along.

512
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:31,222
Go tell Louis I'm not
lifting a finger to help him

513
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:32,807
unless I get everything.

514
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:35,393
Wow, you really are a dick.

515
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:37,562
I take it that means
you know where I stand.

516
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,946
Jessica, hi.
What can I do for you?

517
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:57,364
How's the wedding
planning going?

518
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,449
Oh, well, we're still
looking for a venue,

519
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:01,868
but things are moving along.

520
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,371
I hear a lot of couples fight
during this time.

521
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,673
Well, I happen to have
a fiancé who's smart enough

522
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,709
to leave everything to me.

523
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:11,428
But that is not
why you're here.

524
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:14,047
I want to know
how Harvey's doing.

525
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,849
With our case?

526
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:20,103
No, I just want to know
how he's doing.

527
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:23,357
He's doing fine.

528
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:26,109
Keep an eye on him.

529
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,445
I will.

530
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:35,452
What are you doing here?

531
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,120
You're coming
to my offices tomorrow

532
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,489
to testify against my client
and you didn't tell me?

533
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,957
I didn't tell you
because this is the first

534
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:41,993
I'm hearing about it.

535
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,543
Bullshit, I saw it.

536
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,962
You got subpoenaed to testify
against Sam Tull.

537
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,381
And until you just
burst in here,

538
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,166
I had no idea
he was your client.

539
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:50,801
Well, it doesn't matter
because you're not showing up.

540
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,719
And you're going to stop them
from arresting me, are you?

541
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,471
Because that's what
will happen if I don't.

542
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:56,673
Then get yourself someone
like me and get out of it.

543
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:57,924
For your information,

544
00:19:57,976 --> 00:19:59,476
I have been to three
different men like you,

545
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:01,228
because I care about Sam,

546
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:02,512
and you know better than I do

547
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:04,231
that once he signed that
release, I have no choice.

548
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,066
Well, I have a way
to get you out of it,

549
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,350
and you're gonna do it.

550
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:09,352
They ask you something
that's gonna send him to jail,

551
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:10,405
you lie.

552
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:11,521
I can't do that.

553
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:13,190
You can, and you will,
and they'll never know.

554
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,324
I'll know.

555
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,826
And even if I didn't,
I have notes,

556
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:17,944
and if they found those,
I'd be going to jail.

557
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:19,863
Then destroy them,
because he's innocent,

558
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,748
and he trusted you
with everything.

559
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:23,500
And if that doesn't
mean something to you,

560
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:27,454
then why the hell should anyone
ever trust you with anything?

561
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,706
Harvey, this isn't about us.

562
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:32,709
No one can ever make me
do that to you.

563
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,629
I'm sure Sam Tull
thought the same thing.

564
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:42,719
Well?

565
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:44,221
It's not gonna work.

566
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:45,439
He said no?

567
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:47,057
He said he wants
100% of the deal.

568
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:48,809
- Piece of shit.
- I know.

569
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:50,644
So...

570
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,113
I don't know. We're gonna have
to think of something else.

571
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:59,286
Give it to him.

572
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:02,372
- What?
- I said give it to him.

573
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,574
Louis, hey,
I know we're under the gun

574
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,409
with this Dominic thing,
but I really don't think

575
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:08,295
it's a good idea to let him
push you around like that.

576
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,996
I'm not letting him
push me around.

577
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:12,916
I'm listening to my leader.

578
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:14,334
What are you
talking about?

579
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,636
Remember when you asked me where
the new Louis was coming from

580
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,754
and I told you from me?

581
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:18,922
It wasn't from me.

582
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,891
It was from Jessica.

583
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,226
She asked me to stop
the pettiness once and for all.

584
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:26,179
And if I can't do that now,
I'll never be able to do it.

585
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,267
Okay, then I guess
all we have to do

586
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,936
is figure out a way
to sell the idea to Tanaka.

587
00:21:32,988 --> 00:21:34,187
Oh, trust me.

588
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,156
If I can do this,
I definitely can do that.

589
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:43,413
♪ ♪

590
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:51,705
Louis, what the hell
have you done?

591
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:54,424
What? I'm setting up
for our meeting with Tanaka.

592
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:55,792
Are you kidding me?

593
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:56,960
This isn't<i> Gung Ho.</i>

594
00:21:57,012 --> 00:21:58,345
Louis, they're gonna
take one look at you,

595
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,629
they're gonna
run out the door.

596
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:00,964
No, they're not.

597
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:03,216
Mike, Tanaka's a Japanese
company steeped in tradition.

598
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:04,708
I don't care
what you think they are.

599
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,769
This is offensive.

600
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,304
There's absolutely
nothing offensive

601
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:08,889
about showing respect
for another culture.

602
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:10,140
And what do you know
about their culture?

603
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:11,608
Mike, trust me.

604
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:12,859
When I was in junior high,

605
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:15,695
we had an exchange student
stay with us.

606
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:16,731
Ooh, Suki.

607
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:17,781
Here we go.

608
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:18,816
She was far from home

609
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:19,950
and proud of her culture,

610
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:21,234
and she set up
everything in this room

611
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:22,452
to make herself
feel comfortable,

612
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:24,371
right down to giving
my father this very kimono

613
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,072
and laying out a map
of her hometown.

614
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,444
Louis, I want you
to listen to me.

615
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,075
They are gonna be here
in 45 minutes,

616
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:30,660
and if you are still
dressed like that

617
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:32,329
and this room
still looks like this,

618
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,164
Dominic is going
to fire us.

619
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:35,665
They're not gonna be here
in 45 minutes,

620
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:38,385
'cause they're here
right now.

621
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,387
Mr. Tanaka-San.

622
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,676
Who did this?

623
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:48,762
I did.

624
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,647
That is a map of Shikoku.

625
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:52,015
My family is from there.

626
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,651
I know.

627
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:55,986
How?

628
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,821
Because we do
our homework, sir,

629
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:01,024
just like we did
our homework on this deal.

630
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:04,327
I think we are going
to get along very nicely.

631
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,864
Please.

632
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,367
What are you doing?

633
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,918
Get the tea.

634
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,670
- You want--
- Yeah, get the tea.

635
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:16,172
Okay.

636
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:24,214
♪ ♪

637
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:29,436
Oh, you must be
the future McMillans.

638
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:32,188
I would say sorry I'm late,
but I am not sorry.

639
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:34,891
So let us begin
discussing the details

640
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:36,393
of your first wedding.

641
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:38,111
I'm sorry.
You are?

642
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:40,113
Oh, my name
is of no consequence.

643
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:41,898
What is, is that my company
has taken over

644
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,401
the planning service
of The Plaza Hotel.

645
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:46,453
Here's our brochure.

646
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:49,539
Mm, I can see by the look
on your faces

647
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:52,325
that bitch Patricia,
she did not tell you.

648
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:53,410
Bitch?

649
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:55,495
We love Patricia.

650
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,913
Well, she's no longer with us.

651
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:59,549
As I was saying, the menu
will no longer be optional.

652
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:02,168
We'll be serving
duck<i> à l'orange,</i> escargot,

653
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,336
and foie gras.

654
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,088
But we're vegan.

655
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,139
What is that?

656
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:07,590
- It's--
- It doesn't matter.

657
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:08,925
We are French.

658
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:11,344
You eat what we serve,
or you do not eat.

659
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,013
Can we taste it?

660
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,682
Oh, would you like me to just
show you my naked body

661
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:19,653
before we go out to dinner
and you want to sleep with me?

662
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:22,772
I need to go
to the restroom.

663
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:26,993
Okay, so here's
what's gonna happen.

664
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,194
She's gonna want to drop me,

665
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:29,529
and you're gonna drop
The Plaza Hotel.

666
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:31,031
- What?
- Cut the shit, John.

667
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,450
I did that so you could
have some cover.

668
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,035
I did some checking,

669
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:37,921
and you either need to change
the location of your wedding,

670
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:41,624
or I'm gonna tell her
about your mistress.

671
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:43,710
Yeah.

672
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:51,301
Dr. Agard, when did Sam Tull
start seeing you as a patient?

673
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:52,969
Approximately
six months ago.

674
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:54,261
And why did he
start seeing you?

675
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,140
He said his job involved
taking risks,

676
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:58,892
and it was causing him stress.

677
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:01,478
So he wanted
to stop taking risks?

678
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,645
No, he wanted to continue.

679
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:04,314
Oh, I get it.

680
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:05,982
He wanted to continue
with the risks,

681
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:07,901
he just wanted
to feel better about it.

682
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:09,069
Yes.

683
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,653
And were you able
to help him feel better

684
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:12,122
about taking these risks?

685
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,873
Um, uh, we made progress.

686
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:16,409
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

687
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,379
And after you helped him
feel good about taking risks,

688
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:24,050
did he reveal that he then lost
$50 million on one trade?

689
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:27,670
Dr. Agard, you are under oath.

690
00:25:27,723 --> 00:25:28,922
And if you will not answer,

691
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,174
I will have a judge
compel you to answer.

692
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:32,509
Yes.

693
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:35,011
And how did he say he felt
about losing $50 million

694
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:36,563
on one trade?

695
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:38,264
He said he felt
guilty about it.

696
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:40,984
So he came to you
to continue taking risks

697
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,936
until he finally
lost $50 million

698
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,654
and then admitted
to being guilty.

699
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:45,772
That is not what she said.

700
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,991
I'm sorry,
he just felt guilty.

701
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,576
You want to drop this now,

702
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:52,662
or do you want us to hand
this tape over to the SEC?

703
00:25:57,586 --> 00:26:00,203
Dr. Agard, did you want to give
the testimony you just gave?

704
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:02,088
- Of course not.
- And why is that?

705
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:03,540
Because I care
about my clients.

706
00:26:03,592 --> 00:26:04,958
Is it possible that
you didn't want to give it

707
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,376
because it's not true?

708
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:07,877
No, it's not possible.

709
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,379
You couldn't possibly
have been pressured

710
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,549
to give false testimony
against your wishes?

711
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,551
No, I couldn't have.

712
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,219
Have you ever been
pressured to do something

713
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:19,305
you didn't want to do
by a client before?

714
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:20,890
Let me rephrase.

715
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:23,393
Isn't it true that you released
a client that you cared about

716
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,528
from rehab
for no reason

717
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:28,231
other than you felt pressure
from a different client

718
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,617
who was actually paying
the bills?

719
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:32,368
Dr. Agard,
you're under oath,

720
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:33,703
and if you will not answer,

721
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:36,906
I will have a judge
compel you to answer.

722
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:37,991
Yes.

723
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,576
And did this person die
of an overdose

724
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:41,327
less than 24 hours later?

725
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:42,712
Yes.

726
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:44,714
So if you let yourself
be pressured

727
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:46,166
when someone's life
is at risk,

728
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:47,467
what's to make us think
you're not doing

729
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:49,085
the exact same thing
right now?

730
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:03,231
You arrogant piece of shit.

731
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,233
Watch yourself.
This is my office.

732
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:06,651
Well, I don't care
what it is.

733
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:08,069
How dare you betray me
like that?

734
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:10,288
- I tried to warn you.
- You didn't warn me.

735
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:12,206
You asked me to lie for you,
and I told you I wouldn't.

736
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:13,908
I asked you to lie
for Sam Tull--

737
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,377
This isn't about Sam Tull,
and you know it.

738
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:17,578
What the hell
are you talking about?

739
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,997
I opened up to you
so that we could build trust,

740
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,166
not so that you could
humiliate me.

741
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:23,785
I humiliated you
to help a man

742
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,086
you say you care about.

743
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:26,337
And our fighting
about your mother

744
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:27,588
had nothing to do with that?

745
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,923
- Excuse me?
- You walked out of our session

746
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:30,591
because you didn't want
to talk about your mother.

747
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:32,727
And the second
you had the chance

748
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:34,896
to permanently damage
our relationship, you took it.

749
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,097
You're insane.

750
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:37,682
And you're
a self-serving narcissist

751
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,901
who will do or say anything
to get what he wants.

752
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:42,770
I did what I did in there
to protect my client.

753
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:44,906
And I don't give a shit
if it hurt your feelings or not,

754
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:46,107
because you betrayed him

755
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,775
just as much
as I'm betraying you.

756
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:49,777
And you may be the one
who's crying about it,

757
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:53,698
but he's the one who's been
accused of committing a crime.

758
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,117
If you're lucky,
someday you're gonna realize

759
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,003
what's really going on here,
and when that day comes,

760
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,455
I hope you find someone
to help you,

761
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:03,341
because it isn't
going to be me.

762
00:28:08,298 --> 00:28:12,600
Mike, put that coffee down
and check this out.

763
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:15,520
It's a map of Scarsdale--
where I grew up.

764
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:17,305
Tanaka returned the favor.

765
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:19,307
Actually, Louis,
I got that for you.

766
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,776
You did?
Why?

767
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,978
Because you were right
and I was wrong,

768
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,397
and as crazy as it seems,

769
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:28,900
you and I actually make
a pretty good team.

770
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,485
Now all that's left

771
00:28:30,537 --> 00:28:32,987
is calling Dominic
to set up a meeting.

772
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:34,489
Why don't you do it?

773
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:35,656
I can't.

774
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:37,708
I got to go hang my map.

775
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:44,582
Dominic, what are you
doing here?

776
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:46,167
I was just about to call you.

777
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:47,699
To say what,
that you blew up my deal?

778
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,253
- Because I already know.
- What?

779
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:51,005
That's right. Range Tech
called me after they heard

780
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:52,840
that I was negotiating
with another company.

781
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:55,560
Problem is, I wasn't negotiating
with another company.

782
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:58,012
My lawyers were
without my consent.

783
00:28:58,014 --> 00:28:59,397
Okay, calm down, Dominic.

784
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:01,065
There was a problem
with Range Tech.

785
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,018
I told you that I didn't want
there to be any problems!

786
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,269
Well, if you'd bought them,

787
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,071
their problems were gonna
become your problems.

788
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:08,940
But just calm down
and take a second,

789
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,525
because we brought you
a solution.

790
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:11,859
Which is what?

791
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,744
Mike, don't call Dominic.
Tanaka pulled out.

792
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,415
Pulled out of what?

793
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,866
It doesn't matter.

794
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:20,334
You're both fired.

795
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,959
- Harvey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, Rachel.

796
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:29,710
- Sam Tull's been arrested.
- What?

797
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:32,213
Gilroy's lawyer gave
formal notice to the SEC.

798
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:34,055
They won't pay the fine
under any circumstance.

799
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,299
God damn it.

800
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:36,717
Gretchen, get Paul Gilroy
on the phone.

801
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,885
Harvey, what are you
gonna do?

802
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:39,353
Tull can't go to prison
for this.

803
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:41,055
- No one's going to prison.
- But how do you now that?

804
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,224
We didn't think he'd be
arrested in the first place.

805
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:44,775
I don't care
what we thought.

806
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:46,611
It's not gonna happen because
I'm not letting it happen.

807
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:48,446
I've got Mr. Gilroy
on line one.

808
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,982
Are you out of your mind?
You contacted the SEC?

809
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,483
They contacted me.

810
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:55,069
And I'm not the one who filed
a malicious prosecution lawsuit.

811
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:56,737
No, you're the one
who got his ass kicked

812
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:58,990
in a deposition then turned
around and asked for more.

813
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,409
I didn't get my ass kicked,
Mr. Specter.

814
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:03,995
That idiot therapist did,
and she no longer works for us.

815
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,630
But you still
don't have any proof

816
00:30:05,665 --> 00:30:08,082
that I authorized those trades,
and you never will.

817
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:09,917
So I suggest
you stop harassing me

818
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:12,637
and focus on getting
your client out of jail.

819
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,090
You heard the man.

820
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:17,592
We're dropping the lawsuit?

821
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:19,093
No, we're doubling
the damages.

822
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:21,646
Get it done.

823
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:26,234
You son of a bitch.
You set us up.

824
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:28,769
I'm sorry, Louis, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

825
00:30:28,821 --> 00:30:31,072
Oh, bullshit. You told
Tanaka not to make a deal.

826
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:32,273
Yes, I did.

827
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,358
At first, it looked like
a good idea,

828
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,943
but then I did
my due diligence,

829
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:37,862
and lo and behold,
it didn't.

830
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:39,247
Was that before or after

831
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:40,865
you leaked our meeting
to Range Tech?

832
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,116
I have to say, I'm appalled.

833
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:43,951
I mean, after you've been
so aboveboard

834
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:45,620
in all your dealings with me,

835
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:47,288
to think that I would
go behind your back

836
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,874
and leak news of that meeting
with no possible chance

837
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:52,627
of it being linked back to me,
that's really offensive.

838
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,428
It is linked back to you,
plain as day.

839
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,264
Then I guess you two
must have some sort of proof,

840
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:57,965
because if you don't,

841
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:01,636
you can walk yourselves
the hell out of my office.

842
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:04,138
It's one thing for you
to have your feud with me,

843
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,475
but you just cost your firm
a huge piece of business.

844
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:10,778
Let me explain to you
what I already told him.

845
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:14,031
This isn't about business.
It's about getting even.

846
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:29,830
Harvey,
do you have a minute?

847
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,916
If you're here to tell me
to drop that countersuit--

848
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,408
I'm not telling you
to drop anything.

849
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,336
I'm just saying in addition
to attacking Gilroy,

850
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,388
we should be getting proof
that Sam got the authorization

851
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:38,556
for those trades.

852
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:39,840
We don't have any proof.

853
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:41,342
We can if we get
some of the other traders

854
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:42,843
to come forward
and say how it went.

855
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:44,512
They'll never testify
to that.

856
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:46,397
Harvey, that therapist
was the company therapist.

857
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,265
Those traders saw her
on a regular basis

858
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:49,734
to keep their shit together.

859
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:51,289
So, if Sam opened up to her
about work,

860
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:53,187
then some of the other traders
must have too.

861
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:54,572
She can't speak to that.

862
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:55,940
Of course she can.

863
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:57,692
If Tull waived privilege,
then they all did.

864
00:31:57,694 --> 00:31:58,909
You know that.

865
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:00,411
It doesn't matter.
You saw what I did to her.

866
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,029
She's not gonna
want to help us.

867
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:04,031
It's not about helping us.
It's about helping her client.

868
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,249
I can't ask her
to do that.

869
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:08,536
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

870
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:13,124
- Harvey, what's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

871
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:15,760
How did you know those things
about her in that deposition?

872
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:16,927
Because I did.

873
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:18,212
Does it have something
to do with the fact

874
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:19,430
that you've been having
panic attacks

875
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:20,965
and that she's
your therapist?

876
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:22,883
- Because if it does--
- This conversation is over.

877
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:24,552
Look, I am not trying
to butt into things

878
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:27,438
that don't concern me,
but this isn't about you.

879
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:29,774
This is about keeping
Sam Tull out of prison.

880
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:50,726
What the hell
are you doing here?

881
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,228
You two don't work
for me anymore.

882
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,543
Just give us a minute
to explain.

883
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:54,847
There's nothing to explain.

884
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,599
You blew up my deal
and ruined a friendship

885
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,067
because you thought
you knew better than me.

886
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,568
We do know better
than you.

887
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:00,853
You're an arrogant
son of a bitch.

888
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:03,155
Dominic, this is a draft
of a class-action lawsuit

889
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,523
headed Range Tech's way

890
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:06,742
the second
the EPA's report comes out.

891
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,111
That's the same report
that your friend kept buried.

892
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,496
And if you'd bought them,

893
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,997
that suit would have
been headed your way.

894
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,115
So, yes,
we blew up the deal,

895
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,250
but that man
was never your friend.

896
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,085
You lied to me,
and worse than that,

897
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,620
you didn't respect me.

898
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,622
I am sorry. I shouldn't
have antagonized you.

899
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,340
And I shouldn't have said
that rushing through this deal

900
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,209
without doing due diligence
was feasible.

901
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:25,044
You see, the bottom line is,
is that we were both right

902
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:26,595
when we tried to do
this deal with Tanaka.

903
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,380
And now that we've got
nothing to hide from you,

904
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,966
there is nothing to stop us
from finding you someone else.

905
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,021
So, instead of standing here
kissing my ass,

906
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,107
why don't you get to work
doing that?

907
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:49,652
If you're here to apologize,
I'm not interested.

908
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:51,320
I'm not here to apologize.

909
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,155
I'm here because I need
to look at your files.

910
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,324
There really is no end
to your arrogance.

911
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,792
I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't

912
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,377
the only way to keep Sam
out of prison.

913
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,129
I'm not giving you
Sam Tull's file.

914
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,547
And I'm not asking for it.

915
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,333
I want to see all the files
of the other traders you saw.

916
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:05,634
Are you out of your mind?

917
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,671
No, I'm not. They all signed
the same waiver Sam did.

918
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:11,507
Some of them must have admitted
the way it works at Butler,

919
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:14,009
and it's in your notes.

920
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:15,811
Let me see
if I have my facts straight.

921
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,848
You eviscerate me,
justify it,

922
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,016
and then waltz back here
as if nothing happened.

923
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:23,352
I know something happened,
but now is not the time.

924
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,654
You mean now is not the time
as long as you need a favor.

925
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,490
Oh, God damn it,
you're not doing me a favor.

926
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,492
You're helping your patient,
the one you said

927
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:32,077
you went to see three different
lawyers to keep from betraying.

928
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,529
And if you hadn't
betrayed me,

929
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,531
you wouldn't be
in this position right now.

930
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,999
What do you want me to say--
I'm sorry?

931
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,417
As a matter of fact, I do.

932
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,202
You think I wanted
to depose you like that?

933
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,370
It made me sick.

934
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:43,038
I hated every
goddamn second of it,

935
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,175
because I know all you've
been trying to do is help me,

936
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,544
and the only reason
I didn't apologize before

937
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:51,046
is because if I knew
it kept Sam out of prison,

938
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:54,049
I'd do it all again.

939
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:01,390
Now, are you gonna help me?

940
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,442
Harvey, even if
I wanted to help you,

941
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:06,028
it--it doesn't say
those things in my files.

942
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,396
I need them anyway.

943
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,898
I just told you they
don't have what you need.

944
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,566
I know that,
and you know that,

945
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,234
but they don't know that.

946
00:35:12,286 --> 00:35:13,786
You're gonna try
and bluff them?

947
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,070
It won't work.

948
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,639
You saw what I did
in there to you,

949
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:18,908
and that was something
I didn't want to do.

950
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,794
Trust me,
they won't know what hit 'em.

951
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:30,502
We get fired by McKernon Motors,

952
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:32,388
and you didn't tell me
and you didn't tell Harvey?

953
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:33,889
- Wait, Jessica--
- God damn it.

954
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:35,674
We didn't tell anyone
because we were fired

955
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:37,426
for less than a day,
and then we fixed it.

956
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:38,677
Oh, you fixed it?

957
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:40,229
Yes, it was all
a misunderstanding.

958
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,480
Now Dominic's back on board.

959
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,015
I don't give a shit
that Dominic is back on board

960
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:44,387
and neither does
Fletcher Engines.

961
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:45,651
- Fletcher Engines?
- That's right.

962
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,770
In the less than a day that
you were fired by McKernon,

963
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:50,072
Jack Soloff signed
Fletcher as a client,

964
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,490
and now I have
to let McKernon go.

965
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,858
That son of a bitch.

966
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,243
Jessica, he set
this whole thing up.

967
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,694
Oh, and I'm sure you did
nothing to antagonize him.

968
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,663
I did do nothing.
I swear, I wasn't petty.

969
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,365
I trusted him,
and then he used that trust

970
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:01,000
to stab us in the back.

971
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,117
Jessica,
you have no idea.

972
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:03,786
Louis has never been
more right in his life.

973
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:05,671
You can't dump McKernon.
It'll kill Harvey.

974
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,206
Well, we can't goddamn
represent them now,

975
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:08,507

976

We can if you tell Jack
he has to drop Fletcher.

977
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,827
Do you realize the position
you're putting me in?

978
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:14,763
Fletcher is worth three times
what McKernon is.

979
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,599
I'm sorry you're in
this position right now,

980
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,051
but for once, I'm not
the one who put you in it.

981
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:20,970
Jack Soloff is.

982
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:37,569
Dinner is served.

983
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:42,241
I guess that means you got Opie
his bridal gift after all.

984
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,826
I did.

985
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:46,045
And I shouldn't have been
so standoffish with you

986
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,746
in the file room.

987
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:49,498
Well, maybe I shouldn't
have had that be

988
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,300
our first interaction.

989
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:54,553
No, that's not on you.
That's on me.

990
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:58,674
I never welcomed you
to the firm, and I should have.

991
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,760
You know, when I was
a young mother,

992
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:04,430
first week of school, every day
I dropped my little girl off.

993
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:07,599
When I left, she cried.

994
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:11,687
Friday came, I left,
she didn't cry.

995
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:14,156
So I did.

996
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,275
What are you saying?

997
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:18,077
You didn't welcome me
to the firm

998
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:21,613
because you weren't ready to see
your little girl move on.

999

Are you saying Harvey
is my little girl?

ready to move on.
