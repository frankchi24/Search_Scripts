1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:03,854
Professor Gerard, I came
to ask for a favor.

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:04,939
The answer's no.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,474
Which is why
I brought this.

4
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:07,775
You know.

5
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:09,026
And you talk a big game,

6
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:11,062
but you're just as human
as everyone else,

7
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:12,313
you smug son of a bitch.

8
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,448
Louis.

9
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,200
- What are you doing here?
- Leaving.

10
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,819
That way, I don't have to look
at either one of you two liars.

11
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:23,124
Oh, my God.
He knows.

12
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,626
He doesn't just know.

13
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:26,961
He's a name partner.

14
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,719
She came to me
and lied to my face.

15
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:30,664
She did it to protect me.

16
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:32,466
I'm gonna keep
hammering on her

17
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:33,834
until you break.

18
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,920
With a new name
comes a new beginning.

19
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:37,972
Here's to our newest
name partner,

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,090
Louis Litt.

21
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:41,642
Louis has something on you.

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,846
Daniel Hardman embezzled
money from the firm,

23
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:47,231
and I covered it up.

24
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:49,400
Why couldn't you trust me
with this before?

25
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:51,185
Because I didn't know
how you'd react.

26
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:54,488
Jessica, your secret
is safe with me.

27
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:11,255
♪ ♪

28
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:19,263
I thought we were done
with rooftop conversations.

29
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:20,965
Some things
require privacy.

30
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,089
I haven't heard you say that
since the midnight coup

31
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:24,468
of Schmidt, Gordon,
and Van Dyke.

32
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:25,469
You done?

33
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:26,554
It wasn't a joke.

34
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:27,605
Well, neither is this.

35
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:29,640
I told Jeff Malone
I helped cover up

36
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:32,193
Daniel Hardman's
embezzlement.

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,195
Why the hell would you
open that time capsule?

38
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:35,613
Because he knew
the explanation

39
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,731
we gave the partners about
Louis was bullshit,

40
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:38,983
and I had to tell him
something.

41
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,068
You could've told him
it was none of his business.

42
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:42,736
Harvey, I didn't
bring you here

43
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,155
to get relationship advice.

44
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,623
I brought you here
to tell you what I did

45
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:46,707
in case it ever came up.

46
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,708
No, you didn't.

47
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,659
You brought me here
because now

48
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,114
you have to get Louis
to back you,

49
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:51,579
and you knew
you'd be mad at me

50
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:53,423
when I told you what
you didn't want to hear.

51
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:54,945
You're right.
I don't want to hear it.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,167
How do you think
it's gonna go

53
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:57,334
when I tell Louis
he holds

54
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,637
the fate of my relationship
in his hands?

55
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,888
How do you think
it's gonna go

56
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:03,057
the first time Malone
brings up Louis' blackmail?

57
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,225
I don't care.

58
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:05,309
Well, I'll tell you
how it's gonna go.

59
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,811
Louis is gonna look back

60
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,513
with his beady little eyes
and say, "Embezzlement?

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,515
That's not how I got
my name on the wall."

62
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,684
And the shit's gonna
hit the fan anyway.

63
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:14,852
You know what?

64
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:16,103
You can be a real
son of a bitch.

65
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:18,072
Yeah, but instead
of being pissed at me,

66
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,273
why don't you take
a look in the mirror?

67
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:21,158
Because we held out
an olive branch,

68
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:22,693
and after Louis hears this,

69
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,195
he's gonna take that branch

70
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,863
and beat the shit
out of us with it.

71
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,208
Louis.

72
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,210
Professor Gerard?
What are you doing here?

73
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:40,544
I've got a small
legal matter

74
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,762
to attend to.

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,714
Well, is it anything
I can help you with?

76
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,409
Actually, I'm here
to speak with Harvey.

77
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,800
Ah, ah, I understand.

78
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,219
You're looking
for a name partner.

79
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:49,436
Well, you can't quite
see it from here,

80
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:50,554
but if you walk back
about ten feet,

81
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,805
take a gander to your left,

82
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,190
you'll see I've gotten
a little recognition--

83
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,059
I appreciate that,
but as I said,

84
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:57,278
I'm here to speak
with Harvey.

85
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:03,067
So are we gonna talk about
that little welcome speech

86
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,401
that Jessica
made for Louis?

87
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:05,703
We don't have
to talk about it

88
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:07,705
because Louis isn't
going to accept it.

89
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:08,906
Why not?

90
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,350
Because it'll be
a cold day in hell

91
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,409
when he can accept being
Maverick to my Iceman.

92
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:14,745
Don't--don't you mean
Iceman to your Maverick?

93
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:16,247
No, I don't.

94
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:18,883
You actually want to be
Iceman over Maverick?

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,501
- Who got the trophy?
- Who's the better pilot?

96
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:21,802
- The one who got the trophy.
- Wrong.

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,921
Because in the end,
Maverick saved Iceman,

98
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,422
and if he hadn't, trophy boy
would be sitting

99
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,725
on the bottom
of the Indian Ocean right now.

100
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,593
- Where he'd still be the man.
- According to you.

101
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:32,096
According to me is the only
"according to" that matters.

102
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,097
Here we go.

103
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,766
Maybe, but according to me,

104
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,435
Viper was the real hero
of that film.

105
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,937
What?

106
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,572
You think I'm too old
to know<i> Top Gun?</i>

107
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,107
What I think is,
you have no business

108
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,325
being in my office.

109
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:46,322
Are we gonna do this
in front of your associate?

110
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,195
We don't have to do anything
in front of anybody.

111
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,197
You just have to go.

112
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,785
Harvey...

113
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,120
I need a lawyer.

114
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:57,454
Louis' office
is down the hall.

115
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,456
I don't want Louis.

116
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:00,874
- I want you.
- That's funny.

117
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,543
The last time you saw me,
you told me I wasn't fit

118
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,545
to practice law
in your ivory tower.

119
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:05,796
What I told you was,

120
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:08,132
is that you'll sacrifice
ethics for wins,

121
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,768
and right now
I'm not in my ivory tower,

122
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:11,852
and I need a win.

123
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,970
I knew it.

124
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,021
You're just like
everybody else.

125
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,379
The ends don't
justify the means

126
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,807
until it's your ass
on the line.

127
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,859
Do you think I like
asking you for help?

128
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:21,562
I think this Liberty Rail thing
must have you by the balls.

129
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:22,646
So you know.

130
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:23,731
I know after their
train derailed,

131
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:24,945
you were appointed
to assess

132
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:26,817
the victims'
compensation formula,

133
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:28,035
and I know after you did,

134
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,620
some of those victims
hired a lawyer

135
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:31,288
and opened
an investigation.

136
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:32,706
Then you also know
they found nothing.

137
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,742
Then the question is,
why are you here?

138
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:37,628
The TSA found $25,000
in my luggage

139
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,581
the day I announced I was
changing the formula.

140
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:41,999
So now you're
being accused

141
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,217
of accepting
a bribe.

142
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,752
Which I did not do.

143
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,837
Well, good luck proving
that, Professor,

144
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,839
because it won't be
with my help.

145
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:53,510
I was wrong about you,
Mr. Specter.

146
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,262
I never thought that you
wouldn't represent somebody

147
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,397
just because you
didn't like them.

148
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:57,681
Well, you're wrong again.

149
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,850
I don't like you,
but I'm not representing you

150
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:01,485
because you did
something shady,

151
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:03,153
and I'm not screwing over
crash victims

152
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,321
for the likes of you.

153
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:05,489
You know I didn't do this.

154
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,574
What I know is
you showed yourself in.

155
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,410
You can show yourself out.

00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,119
Hey, I didn't want
to say anything

168
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,904
in front of Gerard,
but has it occurred to you

169
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,156
that you're an idiot
if you don't take this case?

170
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,908
Last year, you were
shitting yourself

171
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,042
he'd find out about you,

172
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,800
and now you think
we should work with him?

173
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,379
No, I wasn't worried
he'd find out.

174
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:04,081
I was worried about Louis.

175
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:05,966
Gerard didn't bat
an eye at me back then,

176
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:07,417
and he didn't just now.

177
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:08,585
But we get him
out of this

178
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,220
and he ever does
find out about me,

179
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,421
he's gonna owe us.

180
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,091
Mike, that man is never
gonna compromise his ethics

181
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,665
just because we got him
out of a jam.

182
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:16,997
Never gonna compromise
his ethics?

183
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:18,312
You just said
he took a bribe.

184
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,109
So what does that
have to do with anything?

185
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,919
It has everything
to do with everything

186
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,352
because you don't
think he did it.

187
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:28,605
- So what?
- So what?

188
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,940
That means you're not
turning him down

189
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:31,275
because you think
he's shady.

190
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:32,526
You're...

191
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,911
You're turning him down
because you have

192
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,029
a Henry Gerard-sized chip
on your shoulder.

193
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:37,698
I do not have a chip
on my shoulder.

194
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,166
You sure sound
like you do,

195
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:40,367
which makes you
worse than an idiot.

196
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,502
It makes you a jackass.

197
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,003
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

198
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:44,705
You know that he divided
that money fairly,

199
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:45,706
which means that
you're just--

200
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,174
I don't care
what it means,

201
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:48,458
and I don't need
a lecture from you.

202
00:06:48,593 --> 00:06:49,593
Apparently you do,

203
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,677
because you're about
to screw over

204
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,045
a bunch of innocent people

205
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,848
just to stick it to some guy
who hurt your feelings.

206
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,433
That's not something
I ever thought

207

I'd be saying to you.

208
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,806
Well, look who it is,

209
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,858
the woman who put me
in my place.

210

What now?

211
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,060
You want me to sign
a piece of paper

212
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:08,695
admitting that I was the man
on the grassy knoll?

213
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,647
I meant what I said
at the ceremony, Louis.

214
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,302
You mean the ceremony
that you only had

215
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:13,534
in order to trick me?

216
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:15,485
I had it because
you demanded it,

217
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,487
but I'm not here
to talk about that.

218
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:18,982
I'm here to talk
about Jeff Malone.

219
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
What about him?

220
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:21,325

that he and I are--

221
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,076
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey?</i>
I'm aware.

222
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,495
I'm gonna let that go

223
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,748
because you may
also not be aware

224
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,132
that I had to lie to him.

225
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,472
He doesn't know
about Mike, does he?

226
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,007
No.

227
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:38,642
But he does know
you committed a crime

228
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
and that you resigned

229
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,345
and now your name
is up on the wall.

230
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:42,429
What'd you tell him?

231
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:45,098
I told him you found out
that I covered up

232
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:46,767
Daniel Hardman's
embezzlement

233
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,186
and that you used it
to strong-arm me.

234
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,688
And now you want me to protect
another one of your secrets.

235
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,991
It's the same secret,
Louis,

236
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,859
and you have just as much
invested in it as I do.

237
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:57,224
No, I don't,
because I don't care

238
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,246
if your relationship
with Jeff survives or not.

239

What do you want, Louis?

I want something for
continuing to cover your ass.

You got something.
You got your name on the wall.

but Gerard's
staying with me.

317
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:00,210
Oh, please,
don't pretend

318
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:01,658
like you actually care
about him.

319
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:03,013
He can't even stand you.

320
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,182
Louis, I just offered
to consider giving you

321
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,266
one of my clients,

322
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,101
so I suggest
you let Gerard go.

323
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,459
No, I'm not letting
anything go,

324
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,138
because it doesn't make
any sense.

325
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:12,606
Not only can't he stand you.

326
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,608
He doesn't respect you
because he's got things--

327
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:16,109
What did you
just say to me?

328
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:18,061
I said he doesn't
respect you.

329
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,146
Well, you know what?

330
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:21,148
He definitely
doesn't respect you,

331
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:23,567
because when he told me
he needed a lawyer,

332
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,535
I tried to send him
your way,

333
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,204
and his exact words were,

334
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:29,739
"I don't want Louis.
I want you."

335
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:33,743
Fine.

336
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:35,245
Then I'll just take
another one of your clients.

337
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:37,547
- You're not taking a thing.
- You just said that I could--

338
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,552
Look, I don't give a shit
what I just said, okay?

339
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,051
My clients are my clients.

340
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,169
And you don't get
out of my office

341
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:43,420
in the next three seconds,

342
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,088
something's gonna happen
between you and me,

343
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:47,257
and I guarantee
it won't end with you

344
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,843
keeping all of your teeth.

345
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:56,600
No.

346
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,401
Just turn around and walk
right back out that door.

347
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,603
- Harvey.
- Did you hear what I said?

348
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,987
I did, but apparently,
you didn't hear

349
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:02,989
what Jessica said
about wiping the slate clean.

350
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:04,608
And apparently, you didn't
hear what I said,

351
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:06,827
because I just told Louis
he could have one of my clients.

352
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,528
And three seconds later,
you told him he couldn't.

353
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:09,946
Yeah, because I realized
that I'm paying

354
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,198
for Jessica's mistake.

355
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:13,283
No, Harvey, you were willing
to pay for her mistake

356
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,585
right up until Louis said
Gerard doesn't respect you.

357
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,030
Oh, that has nothing
to do with it.

358
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:18,588
You can lie to yourself
all you want,

359
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:19,873
but I'm not gonna
let you bullshit me.

360
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,124
What the hell
are you talking about?

361
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,043
Henry Gerard is the one
person you respect

362
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,295
who never respected you,
and Louis touched that nerve.

363
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:27,764
And I told you that
has nothing to do with it.

364
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:28,882
You really think that?

365
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,046
I don't think it.
I know it.

366
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,091
Then you know what,
Harvey?

367
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,385
You're no different
than Louis,

368
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,390
because you have a chance
to help us all move on,

369
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,242
and you are blowing it off
out of pettiness,

370
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:37,858
which is exactly
what Louis would do.

371
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:38,859
What do you want
from me, Donna?

372
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,227
I want you
to be a grown-up

373
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,979
and do what you said you'd do
in the first place.

374
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:50,781
You got something?

375
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,647
Yeah, we've been
overlooking the obvious.

376
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,228
Yeah, I'm not in the mood
for 20 questions.

377
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,229
Give it to me.

378
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:56,647
Unless you're traveling
internationally

379
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,432
and don't report it,
carrying cash on board a plane

380
00:12:58,517 --> 00:12:59,517
isn't a crime.

381
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,818
Great,
except for the fact

382
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:02,436
that Gerard's not being
charged with smuggling.

383
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,521
He's being sued.

384
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:04,522
Right, but my point is,

385
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,173
how did Garrett Brady
even find that out?

386
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:08,192
Well, he found out
because Gerard

387
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:09,493
was detained by the TSA.

388
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:11,112
Who talked to him
for five minutes

389
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:12,446
and then sent him
on his way.

390
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:13,864
Those searches
aren't a matter

391
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:14,999
of public record.

392
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,500
- Exactly.
- Holy shit.

393
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:17,618
Brady bribed the TSA.

394
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:18,703
Which isn't only illegal.

395
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:20,871
It makes that report
totally inadmissible.

396
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:22,289
You figured this out
on your own?

397
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:24,175
Well, I would've done it faster,
but I had to order some sushi.

398
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,377
"Would've done it faster."

399
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:27,712
That's what you said
your first week here,

400
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,430
except it was pizza
instead of sushi.

401
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:30,548
Yeah, I'm growing.

402
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:32,883
You mean Rachel
taught you how to eat.

403
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,769
Like I said,
I'm growing.

404
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:40,224
Hey, Donna, I'm a little
busy at the moment.

405
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:42,059
Too busy to take on this?

406
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:43,194
What's that?

407
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,729
Just the first client
that Jessica gave Harvey

408
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:46,230
when he made name partner.

409
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:47,898
Harvey said he wouldn't
let me have any of his clients.

410
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,366
No.
He said he would.

411
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,011
But then instead
of taking him up on it,

412
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:52,319
you went ahead
and shit on his feelings.

413
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:53,738
Please.
Harvey doesn't have feelings.

414
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:55,372
That's not true,
and you know it.

415
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:56,741
And you of all people
should know that a person

416
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,209
can overreact
when they're hurt.

417
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,376
If you're referring to me,

418
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:00,578
I do not overreact when--

419
00:14:00,662 --> 00:14:02,246
Okay, whatever you say,
Fatty-Baldy.

420
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:05,549
Okay, get the hell
out of my office and--

421
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,219
Fine, you have a small,
legitimate point.

422
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:09,253
I really hurt his feelings?

423
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,671
Yeah, you really did.

424
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,316
But then he realized
he was overreacting

425
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,674
and that this was
a chance for us all

426
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,392
to get back
to where we were.

427
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,927
You swear that is
the first client

428
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:19,096
that Jessica gave him
after me made name partner?

429
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:21,065
I swear.

430
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,067
Leave me the file.

431
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,415
You two go ahead.
I haven't decided yet.

432
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,834
Actually, we're not here
for the falafel.

433
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,535
We're here to introduce
ourselves.

434
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,670
Mike Ross.

435
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,537
Harvey Specter.

436
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:45,005
We represent
Henry Gerard.

437
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:46,373
Ah.

438
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,292
Well, in that case,
let me buy you two lunch,

439
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,594
because I'm about to come
into an unexpected windfall.

440
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,959
Well, I guess
that's your thing--

441
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,297
paying people off.

442
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:55,549
I hope the TSA got more
than some shitty falafel.

443
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:56,934
What the hell
are you talking about?

444
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:58,435
I'm talking about this.

445
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:03,474
Oh. Bribery?

446
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:04,809
Ironic, isn't it?

447
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:07,561
You suing Professor Gerard
for accepting a bribe

448
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:09,697
when you're the one
paying off federal employees.

449
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:11,148
Allegedly paying,
Counselor.

450
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,283
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

451
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,651
You don't want
to slander me.

452
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,536
- So you admit it.
- I don't admit a thing.

453
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:17,321
Your client sold out victims
of a train derailment.

454
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:18,539
He's going to pay.

455
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:20,457
You may not be willing
to admit anything here,

456
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,076
but you'll have to
in front of the judge.

457
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Because I've drafted
subpoenas

458
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:25,830
for every TSA employee
on duty that night.

459
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:27,915
Drop the case,
Mr. Brady.

460
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,083
Are you threatening me?

461
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,085
No, we're informing you.

462
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,670
Well, let me inform you.

463
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:34,138
In case you forgot,
the TSA falls

464
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,896
under the Department
of Homeland Security,

465
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:37,474
which makes this
a national security issue.

466
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:38,592
This has nothing to do

467
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:40,511
with national security,
and you know it.

468
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:41,979
All I know is
the government found

469
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,264
a large sum of cash
on a passenger.

470
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:44,348
Now, how they came
to know that,

471
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:45,683
how they proceeded
to investigate that,

472
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:46,934
or what they did
with that information

473
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:48,228
is the government's business.

474
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,320
And that's what
you're going with?

475
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:50,437
That's not what
I'm going with.

476
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:52,356
That's what they're
going to go with.

477
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,359
So you can call up as many
TSA agents as you like,

478
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:56,777
but they're not gonna be
saying a thing.

479
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:59,697
And you can buy
your own damn falafel.

480
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,923
I need
Cutie Pie Cosmetics.

481
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,291
You want to try
that again?

482
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,592
I have a meeting
with Joan Walsh tonight,

483
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,877
and I need her files.

484
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:13,961
Joan is Harvey's client.

485
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:15,596
- Not anymore.
- Since when?

486
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:17,181
Since it doesn't matter,

487
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,632
because I'm name partner,

488
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:21,101
which means when I say
I need something,

489
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,186
your response
should either be,

490
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:24,271
"How high?"
or "Can I have another?"

491
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,024
Fine.

492
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,359
There are a few things
that you should know--

493
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:29,894
You see,
what I know is

494
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,228
your boss seems to think

495
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:32,980
all it takes
to impress Joan Walsh

496
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,566
is getting Donna to make
a fancy dinner reservation,

497
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,035
but I'm going to impress her
with so much legal domination

498
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:39,313
that by the end of the night,

499
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:40,404
all she's gonna be able
to say is,

500
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,206
"Harvey Specter who?"

501
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,574
- Okay, that's a mistake--
- A mistake?

502
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:44,742
Oh, I get it.

503
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:45,993
You're trying to impress me

504
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:47,411
with your legal domination

505
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,496
to prove that you're not
just a paralegal

506
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:50,631
but an associate.

507
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:51,799
No, Louis. I'm--

508
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,384
See, I don't care
what you call yourself.

509
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,419
So unless you did
such a shitty job,

510
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:56,887
the files are unreadable,

511
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,806
hand 'em over to me
right now.

512
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:23,414
That's more like it.

513
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,014
What's this?

514
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:41,265
I know you have
to work tonight,

515
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:42,633
but you also need to eat.

516
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,134
I wouldn't call this
just eating.

517
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,053
Well, you deserve better
than paper plates.

518
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:47,888
I don't mind paper plates.

519
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,807
Oh, I know you don't.

520
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,358
I just said
you deserve better.

521
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:53,143
Is that<i> ropa vieja?</i>

522
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,361
Hmm.

523
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,280
I made it myself.

524
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:58,065
Which means you got it
at the Cuban place

525
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:00,617
that I love
on 40th and Lex.

526
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:01,735
By myself.

527
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,154
What did I do
to deserve this?

528
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:06,824
I don't know.

529
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:09,043
I'm just...

530
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,328
feeling closer.

531
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:12,663
Because I confided
in you.

532
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,331
Because the walls
are coming down,

533
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,333
and I can feel it.

534
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,972
What did I do
to deserve you?

535
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,557
Mm, well, we can
talk about that

536
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:28,312
over this delicious meal
that I made all by myself.

537
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:38,522
♪ ♪

538
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:39,656
To us.

539
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:46,363
And then I said,
"Helen,

540
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:47,998
"that's no Pomeranian.

541
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,666
"That's a Pomimo.

542
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:51,668
You've been had."

543
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:54,872
Oh-ho-ho,
that is hilarious.

544
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:56,540
Really, dogs,
they are--

545
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,008
they are so fascinating.

546
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,376
Do you have many dogs,
Louis?

547
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:00,544
Hell, no.

548
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:05,682
Building regulations--
it's a clusterf-f-f...

549
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,301
I've been fighting them
for years.

550
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:08,886
- Oh, that's horrible.
- Yes.

551
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:11,055
As is what's going on
with your stock.

552
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:12,139
Oh, Louis,
we're having dinner.

553
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:13,440
- Put that away.
- No, no, no.

554
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:14,808
But I just thought you'd
be interested to know

555
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,026
that we could skyrocket
the share price--

556
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,694
Right now
what I'm interested in

557
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:18,896
is having another Manhattan

558
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,500
and hearing what's
on the dessert list.

559
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:21,865
Oh, you don't need a list.
Get the crème brûlée.

560
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,900
Now, this stock issue,
I have--

561
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,401
Fax the papers to my office,

562
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:25,926
and I'll review them
when I get home.

563
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:26,954
When you get home?

564
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,906
What the f-f...

565
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:30,874
What the hell did we come
to dinner for, then?

566
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,992
For this.

567
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,127
What this?

568
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:34,795
This.

569
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:37,915
Okay.

570
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,217
I don't know how Harvey handled
these quarterly reviews, but I--

571
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:41,552
Oh, Harvey...

572
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,003
was magnificent.

573
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:46,279
Truth be told,
I was a little disappointed

574
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:47,867
when I heard that
you'd be handling this

575
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:48,892
instead of him,

576
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:50,594
but I haven't seen
your cha-cha yet,

577
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,895
so the jury's still out.

578
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:54,181
- That was a lawyer joke.
- Yep. Got it.

579
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:55,432
Yep.

580
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,768
Listen, Joan,

581
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,603
I think you're
gonna be really glad

582
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:01,021
that it was me here
tonight,

583
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,073
because I already sent
a letter to your board.

584
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,491
- You did what?
- And I--

585
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,326
I notified them of this.

586
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:07,444
That's what--

587
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,279
what I'm trying
to tell you.

588
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,285
Why the hell
would you do something

589
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,870
so patently stupid?

590
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,338
Stupid?

591
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:20,707
Hey, I didn't become
name partner being stupid.

592
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:21,792
Didn't you?

593
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:22,793
Two members of my board

594
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:24,595
are about to reach
their term limits.

595
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,679
At least one is being circled
by Glamour Cosmetics.

596
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,550
You have just notified
that person of a product

597
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,518
that I've had in R & D
for years,

598
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:33,971
and now they can trade
information

599
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:37,224
for a seat on the board
of my biggest competitor.

600
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:38,392
Joan, I didn't know--

601
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,527
Tell me, Mr. Litt,

602
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:43,397
did you actually graduate
from law school,

603
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:46,150
or did you just buy your way
onto the letterhead?

604
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:07,794
Yeah, you better put
that bag down,

605
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:09,096
because we're staying
all night.

606
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:13,026
Didn't go well with Joan,
did it?

607
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,698
No, it didn't, because
you sandbagged me.

608
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:15,949
I didn't sandbag you.

609
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,284
Well, then what do you call
not telling me

610
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:18,752
that Glamour was circling
her board members?

611
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,037
I tried to tell you,

612
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,588
but you couldn't hear me
through all of your rage.

613
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:22,756
What I'm not hearing

614
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:24,625
is the sound of you
putting your bag down,

615
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,627
because the board members
are meeting tomorrow afternoon,

616
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,812
and I only have until then
to fix this.

617
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,097
And you want me
to help you?

618
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:31,632
You're the associate
on this case, aren't you?

619
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:33,646
- So now I'm an associate?
- Hey, you know what?

620
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:34,718
Now is not the time
to get into it.

621
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:36,303
No, now is exactly the time
to get into it,

622
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:39,389
because you have taken
every opportunity possible

623
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,274
to make me feel like
I am nothing,

624
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:43,310
and now, even though
you want something,

625
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:45,034
you're still treating me
like I'm nothing.

626
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:46,697
I'm treating you like
every other associate.

627
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:47,731
That is bullshit,
and you know what?

628
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:48,865
Even if it were true,

629
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,484
you didn't used to
treat me that way.

630
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:55,322
I didn't used to know you
lied to me on a daily basis.

631
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:58,625
Louis, it would serve
you right

632
00:21:58,743 --> 00:22:01,962
if I take my bag
and leave you here

633
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,964
and go home to the man
that I love.

634
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:05,082
So you're not gonna help.

635
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:06,717
No, I'm gonna help you,

636
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:08,669
but not because
you deserve it.

637
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:11,004
I'll do it because I am
an associate,

638
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:14,591
and I am a professional,
which means I am capable

639
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:17,594
of putting the personal aside
in order to do my job.

640
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,567
And one of those, please.

641
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:25,485
Just what I was
in the mood for.

642
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:26,683
Ah, you're getting a bagel.

643
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:27,904
That means you kicked ass.

644
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:29,823
Which I did.

645
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:31,024
You called up the TSA,

646
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,826
busted up their
national security defense?

647
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:34,578
No, I used their defense.

648
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:36,079
Gerard's gonna testify
under seal

649
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:38,115
because it's a matter
of national security.

650
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,332
And the judge
bought that?

651
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,450
What's not to buy?

652
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:41,918
The TSA made
the argument for us.

653
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:42,919
And what did Brady say?

654
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:45,122
That's the best part
about it.

655
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,957
He doesn't even know it.

656
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:49,126
It's a matter
of national security.

657
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,427
We testify under seal,

658
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:53,180
the judge realizes that Gerard
is a degenerate gambler...

659
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,297
But a fair mediator.

660
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:56,099
The case gets dismissed,
and Garrett Brady

661
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:58,135
and Harvard Law
never know it happened.

662
00:22:58,269 --> 00:22:59,789
You thought of all
of that on your own?

663
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:01,354
You think you're the only
one who can come up

664
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:03,106
with an intelligent solution?

665
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:04,307
You are 1 for 400

666
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:05,892
in the time
we've worked together.

667
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:08,228
Okay, smart guy, since
I did your job for you,

668
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:09,896
you're gonna do
my job for me.

669
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:11,148
You want me to prep Gerard

670
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:12,282
because you don't
want to sit in a room

671
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,734
and listen to him talk
for two hours.

672
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,402
I didn't want to
15 years ago,

673
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:16,703
and I don't want to now.

674
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:18,905
We only get
one shot at this,

675
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,074
and his testimony
better be rock solid.

676
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:22,159
Thanks.

677
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:25,378
Oh, yeah, sure,
help yourself!

678
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:26,713
Dick.

679
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:35,172
I see you haven't slept.

680
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:36,807
I have a lot of work
that needs attending to.

681
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:38,892
I bet you do, considering
the phone call

682
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,370
I got from Joan Walsh
this morning.

683
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:42,095
She called you?

684
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,070
She wanted to know what
the other name partners

685
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:46,433
were going to do about the one
that screwed the pooch.

686
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:47,768
Oh, come on,
that is not fair.

687
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:48,935
I didn't have all
the information--

688
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,487
You had enough information

689
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:52,155
to make a deal
to get her from Harvey,

690
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:53,990
and part of that deal was
you backing me with Jeff.

691
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,242
Oh, so that's why
you're here.

692
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,493
You don't trust
I'm still gonna do it?

693
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:57,944
Because you haven't
done it yet,

694
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,919
and you have a history
of making poor decisions

695
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:01,364
when things aren't
going your way.

696
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:02,916
The only poor decision
I've made is agreeing

697
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:04,167
to cover for you
in the first place.

698
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:05,502
You didn't think that
was such a bad idea

699
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,037
when you were using it
to get what you wanted.

700
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:08,705
And now you're threatening
to take that thing away.

701
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:10,457
Louis, you want
to keep Joan,

702
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:11,591
that's on you,

703
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,927
but I held up my end
of the bargain.

704
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,545
You better hold up yours.

705
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:23,637
I just want to go over it
one more time, Professor.

706
00:24:23,771 --> 00:24:25,138
How much money
was in that pot?

707
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:27,858
I'm tried
of going over it.

708
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:29,559
Why do we have
to keep replaying

709
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:31,027
every moment of this game?

710
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:32,979
Because your entire case
depends on it.

711
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:36,233
My case depends on the fact
that I won that money gambling,

712
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,068
not whether I won it
with a flush.

713
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:40,120
Your case depends on
the judge believing you,

714
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:42,205
and if he finds any holes
in your testimony, then we--

715
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,741
I gave you the names of
everyone I knew at that game.

716
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:47,116
But none of those men were
there when you won that money.

717
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,796
I can't help it if I didn't
get the name of the guy I beat.

718
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:52,799
Which is why your story
needs to be rock solid.

719
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:58,088
Okay.

720
00:24:58,222 --> 00:24:59,756
Go ahead.

721
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:01,508
So I ask you again,
Professor,

722
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:03,260
how much money
was in the final pot?

723
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:05,178
Roughly $12,000.

724
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:06,313
And you won that hand.

725
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,931
As I said before,
I won,

726
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:09,015
and then I cashed out.

727
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,180
And what did you
have again?

728
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,184
A queen-high flush.

729
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:12,569
And who did you beat?

730
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:14,104
I told you,
I didn't get his name.

731
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,438
Okay, so what
did he have?

732
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:18,358
Two pair,
queens over sixes.

733
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:22,913
Wait a second.

734
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:25,282
You said before that
the man next to you

735
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,533
folded with two queens up,

736
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:27,857
and now this guy
has two queens,

737
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,919
and you had
a queen-high flush?

738
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:31,338
I said that the man
next to me

739
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:32,455
folded with two kings.

740
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,456
No, you didn't.

741
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,591
You heard me wrong.

742
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,426
No, I didn't.

743
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,961
Is this part
of prepping me,

744
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:39,462
or are you accusing me
of something?

745
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:40,797
I'm trying to get
your story to line up.

746
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:43,216
- My story does line up.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

747
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:44,935
Look, young man, if you're
gonna sit over there

748
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:46,019
and call me a liar--

749
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:47,187
I'm not calling you a liar,

750
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:49,025
but if you say tomorrow
what you said today,

751
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
we're gonna be
in a lot of trouble,

752
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,348
because where I come from,

753
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:52,943
there are only
four queens in a deck.

754
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:54,861
I said two kings,

755
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:57,480
and I'm gonna say that
again tomorrow.

756
00:25:57,565 --> 00:26:00,367
So you do your job,

757
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:02,035
and I'm gonna do mine.

758
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:09,826
He's lying.

759
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:11,044
What are you talking about?

760
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:12,412
Gerard's story about
winning all that money

761
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:13,630
playing poker is bullshit.

762
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:15,498
All right, slow down.
What the hell happened?

763
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:17,334
I did the math,
and the hands don't add up.

764
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:18,738
What do you mean
you did the math?

765
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,670
I mean first he said that he
drew a queen on fourth street,

766
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,055
and then when I pressed
him about it, he--

767
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:23,223
Wait a second.

768
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:24,925
This conclusion is based
on him recalling hands

769
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,343
under cross-examination?

770
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:27,427
Harvey, I got kicked out

771
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:28,911
of Atlantic City
for counting cards.

772
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:30,397
- I know this shit.
- It doesn't mean he's lying.

773
00:26:30,514 --> 00:26:31,982
I got a little experience
with that too,

774
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,483
and I'm telling you,
he was.

775
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,735
- Or maybe he's tired.
- Or maybe I'm right.

776
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:37,737
Or maybe you don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

777
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:40,440
- Why are you defending him?
- Because you asked me to.

778
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,414
Look, Harvey,

779
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:49,115
I'm not saying that
he took a bribe.

780
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,953
I'm just saying that he didn't
get that money playing poker.

781
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:56,256
Well, unless he admitted that,
he's testifying tomorrow.

782
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,378
Since when do you stick
your head in the sand?

783
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:03,513
- Did he admit it?
- No, he didn't.

784
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:05,711
But he screwed up the details,
and he shouldn't have,

785
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,601
because people who are telling
the truth get it right.

786
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,887
And you know it.

787
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:26,641
What's that?

788
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:28,009
Jacks full of fours.

789
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:29,811
I can see that,
but why--

790
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:31,563
Why is it staring you
in the face?

791
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,265
It's what I threw down
the last time I won a huge hand.

792
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,570
It was six weeks ago,
and I can remember every hand

793
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,355
that every player
at that table had.

794
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,919
Now, if you won money
the other night,

795
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,024
you'd remember it too.

796
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,275
I do remember,

797
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:45,944
and as I explained
to your associate--

798
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,496
Yeah, stop bullshitting me.

799
00:27:48,614 --> 00:27:50,882
Where the hell did that
money really come from?

800
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,083
'Cause if you don't
tell me the truth,

801
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:53,641
I'm canceling
that hearing right now.

802
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:58,590
It came...

803
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,458
from a student of mine.

804
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:01,759
For what?

805
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:04,295
In exchange
for changing his grade.

806
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,798
Jesus Christ.
For $25,000?

807
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:08,633
He was going to fail
my class,

808
00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:10,468
and that would've stopped him
from getting an offer from--

809
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:12,137
You goddamn hypocrite.

810
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:14,639
You preach about ethics,
and you do this?

811
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:16,691
This is about ethics.

812
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:18,643
And you don't have
any idea why I did it.

813
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:20,645
I don't care
why you did it.

814
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,397
I care about what
you're making me do,

815
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:24,032
because I am not
suborning perjury.

816
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,068
Well, you tell me that you've
never done anything worse.

817
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:31,039
I knew it.

818
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:33,741
You would do it
for someone else...

819
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:35,126
but not for me.

820
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:37,245
You know what, Professor?

821
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:39,380
There's a small part of me
that actually thought

822
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,833
that you came to me because
you thought I'm the best,

823
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,085
but you just think I'll do
whatever it takes to win.

824
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,421
Isn't that what
makes you the best?

825
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:49,493
Get someone else
to do your dirty work,

826
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,392
because I'm not
suborning perjury.

827
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:08,193
What are you doing?

828
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:10,612
Getting my blood flowing.

829
00:29:10,746 --> 00:29:12,030
I've been sitting here
all night,

830
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:14,999
and restless leg syndrome
kills 14 people every hour.

831
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:16,277
I don't think
that's accurate.

832
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:18,036
I don't care what you think.
What do you have?

833
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,754
I found a way to fix
things with Joan.

834
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:26,941
Okay, you're arguing
anything in R & D

835
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:28,082
is the intellectual property

836
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,380
of the person
who suggested the product?

837
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:31,599
Until such time that
the results become public.

838
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:33,384
Which they did the second
I sent the board that letter.

839
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:34,469
Except board members
are subject

840
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:35,603
to the nondisclosure
agreement.

841
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:36,888
Well, the board members
haven't signed

842
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:37,889
a nondisclosure agreement.

843
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:40,024
Yet.

844
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:41,476
What's to stop them
from refusing?

845
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Nothing,
but if they do,

846
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:43,778
then the noncompete
kicks in.

847
00:29:43,896 --> 00:29:45,730
Preventing them from revealing
the contents of my letter

848
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:47,065
under threat of prosecution.

849
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:48,866
Specifically
corporate espionage.

850
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:50,902
Oh, my God.
You got this idea from--

851
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,320
- Our bylaws.
- My bylaws.

852
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:55,156
Rachel, holy shit,
this is...

853
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:56,658
acceptable.

854
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:00,912
I think the word you're
looking for is "awesome."

855
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,298
Well, the word I'm saying
is, "Get out,

856
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:04,632
because I have a meeting
to prepare for."

857
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,884
You know what, Louis?
I have been working all night.

858
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:09,220
And this gets your ass
out of a major sling,

859
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,922
so instead of dismissing me,

860
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:12,390
you should be asking me
to come with you.

861
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:13,808
Excuse me,
Miss Professional.

862
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:15,426
You wanted me to treat you
like every other associate.

863
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:17,314
- Now I am.
- By acting as if I did nothing?

864
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,430
No, by acknowledging
you did acceptable work.

865
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:20,648
Letting you come with me
is something

866
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:22,684
that I would only do for you
if we were friends,

867
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:23,818
which we are not.

868
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:38,082
You canceled the hearing.

869
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,834
You were right.

870
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:42,954
He was lying.

871
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,340
I'm sorry.

872
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:46,674
You know, I knew
he was a hypocrite

873
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,259
after I found out
about the gambling.

874
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:51,179
I never thought
he'd sell out Harvard.

875
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:54,716
What are you
talking about?

876
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,050
He did take the bribe,

877
00:30:56,135 --> 00:30:58,135
but it had nothing to do
with the accident victims.

878
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:00,355
He did it to change
someone's grade.

879
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:03,524
Why would he do that?

880
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,692
What difference
does it make?

881
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,861
Either way, he was gonna
let me suborn perjury.

882
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:09,113
It makes a difference because
we still have to win this case.

883
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:11,115
Oh, I don't give a shit
about winning this case.

884
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,820
I've never heard you say
anything like that before.

885
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:19,073
You--you care
about winning every case,

886
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:20,198
every game,
every argument.

887
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:21,242
Did you hear me?

888
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:22,910
He was gonna let me
suborn perjury.

889
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:24,629
And so would
every client you have

890
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:25,963
if they thought
they'd get away with it.

891
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:27,165
He's not every client.

892
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,750
No, he's the one you hated
in the first place.

893
00:31:28,884 --> 00:31:30,585
- I didn't hate him.
- Harvey, what is going on here?

894
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:34,505
I thought he was
better than us.

895
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,641
I sat in that class
and listened to him talk

896
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:39,811
about what kind
of lawyers we should be,

897
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:42,347
and I always let him down
because I knew

898
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:45,099
that wasn't the kind
of lawyer that wins.

899
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:46,851
And I wanted to win.

900
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:48,853
So I'd argue with him,

901
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,072
and he'd look down on me.

902
00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:56,944
And now instead of you
letting him down,

903
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:58,279
he let you down.

904
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:01,332
He turned out to be
no better than any of us.

905
00:32:08,207 --> 00:32:11,759
So then let's make him
better than us.

906
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:23,388
Miss Walsh.

907
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:25,273
You are not on my schedule
today.

908
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:27,892
Ah, ah, Miss Walsh,
please take a look at this.

909
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:29,060
What is it?

910
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,278
It's a chance
to make things right.

911
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:31,779
Ha.

912
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,817
You cannot call
board members employees

913
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,202
based on them having access
to an expense account.

914
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:39,987
Not just an expense account.

915
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:42,323
They have corporate cards
and standing offices,

916
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:44,375
which, as defined
by section 14.2

917
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,177
of the Internal Revenue Code,

918
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:47,712
makes them employees.

919
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,497
Well, Mr. Litt,

920
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:52,550
seems I won't be demanding
a new point person after all.

921
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:54,802
I'm glad to hear that.

922
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Are you?

923
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,004
Of course I am.

924
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,673
You're my first client
as name partner.

925
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,007
You're very important
to me.

926
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:03,237
Well, I suppose
we'll find out the truth

927
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,762
when someone else
makes name partner.

928
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:06,264
What are you talking about?

929
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,815
I'm not an idiot.

930
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,901
I know that no one in your firm
wants to deal with me.

931
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:10,985
That's not true.

932
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:12,103
In fact,
I fought for you.

933
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:13,821
You may have thought
you were fighting for me,

934
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:15,940
but I know that Jessica
dumped me on Harvey,

935
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:18,693
and it seems that the second
you made name partner,

936
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:20,244
Harvey did the same thing
to you.

937
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:25,450
Oh, you didn't know that,
did you?

938
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:27,869
Then maybe we were
meant for each other,

939
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:30,288
since we're both
left out of the club.

940
00:33:39,014 --> 00:33:40,181
You betrayed me.

941
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:42,099
You make this big speech
about repairing our friendship,

942
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:43,134
and all it was
was more words.

943
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,135
What are you
talking about?

944
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:46,020
You convinced me
to take Joan,

945
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:47,772
while conveniently
leaving out the fact

946
00:33:47,856 --> 00:33:50,641
you're doing Harvey a favor.

947
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:51,976
That's not why
I did it, Louis.

948
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,228
Well, just tell me right now,
can he stand her?

949
00:33:54,313 --> 00:33:55,813
No, but he was
gonna keep her

950
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:56,981
because you--

951
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:58,149
Hurt his precious feelings.
I know.

952
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:59,150
I felt so awful
about that.

953
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:00,514
You know what, Louis?
You should.

954
00:34:00,536 --> 00:34:02,069
And while you're at it,
you should feel pretty awful

955
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:03,514
about being a dick to me
right now.

956
00:34:03,622 --> 00:34:04,622
You lied to me again.

957
00:34:04,623 --> 00:34:07,158
No, Louis.
I fought for you...again.

958
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,292
No.

959
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:09,494
You made Joan
sound important.

960
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:11,301
"The first client
that Jessica gave Harvey

961
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:12,497
when he made name partner."

962
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:13,998
She is important, Louis,
but you can't see that

963
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:15,216
because you didn't
want a client.

964
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:17,001
You just wanted to take
something away from Harvey.

965
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:18,002
What I want is respect.

966
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:19,220
Then get out of your own way

967
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:21,839
and get on the goddamn team.

968
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:25,142
You mean the team that kept
Mike's secret from me?

969
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,310
No, Louis!

970
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:28,229
I mean the team that
protected its own,

971
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:30,898
because that's
what teams do.

972
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:33,901
And, you know, I shouldn't
even be telling you this

973
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:35,099
because she
wasn't going to,

974
00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:36,404
but if you need
a little bit more evidence

975
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:37,989
of what we do
for each other,

976
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:38,990
then take a look at Rachel,

977
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:40,408
because she got
Katrina a job.

978
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:41,576
- What?
- That's right.

979
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,077
Your former associate,

980
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:45,363
and you've been treating
Rachel like shit.

981
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:46,914
So, if you're done
yelling at me,

982
00:34:47,032 --> 00:34:49,083
then I suggest you go fix
one of the thousand things

983
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:50,501
that you have
screwed up lately,

984
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:54,622
because the rest of us,
we are done fighting for you.

985
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:09,542
Mr. Ross.

986
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,750
Ah, you must be Ian.

987
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,244
And, please,
don't call me Mr. Ross.

988
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:13,546
- Mike is fine.
- Ah, sure.

989
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,348
Hey, thanks
for your call, Mike.

990
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:17,050
Pearson Specter
is a great firm.

991
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,601
Ah, well, you're
a great candidate.

992
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,386
I'm a little curious why
you're still interviewing.

993
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:22,271
I heard you had
a solid offer at Skadden.

994
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:25,058
I do, but Skadden Arps
is no Pearson Specter.

995
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:26,442
Are you sure it's not

996
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,561
because you're worried
they'll find out that you failed

997
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:30,363
Professor Gerard's
legal ethics class?

998
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,482
- What?
- Oh, shit.

999
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:33,566
You don't know.

1000
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,034
He hasn't changed
your grade,

1001
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,121
but he still has
your $25,000.

1002
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,406
Who the hell are you?

1003
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:41,824
I'm exactly
who I said I was.

1004
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:42,909
The only thing I left out

1005
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,794
is that Professor Gerard
is my client.

1006
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:46,629
Well, he can't be
in trouble for this.

1007
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:47,747
I'd know.

1008
00:35:47,748 --> 00:35:48,748
He's not.

1009
00:35:48,832 --> 00:35:50,133
He's being accused
of accepting a bribe

1010
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,751
while conducting
a federal mediation

1011
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:53,169
because of this.

1012
00:35:53,303 --> 00:35:54,387
That's not my problem.

1013
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:55,638
It's your problem now,

1014
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:58,257
which is why you're
gonna sign this.

1015
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:02,011
What is that?

1016
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:03,062
It's a sworn affidavit

1017
00:36:03,147 --> 00:36:05,531
stating the money that
you paid Gerard is a loan.

1018
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,318
Well, what happens
to my grade?

1019
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,320
It stays the same
because Henry Gerard

1020
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:13,523
doesn't take money
to change grades.

1021
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:14,941
That's bullshit.
We had a deal.

1022
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:17,360
Yeah, well, consider this your
first lesson in the real world.

1023
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:19,028
Deals change.

1024
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:21,781
I don't care
what world it is.

1025
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:23,416
I'm not signing anything.

1026
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
That's too bad,

1027
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:26,619
because the truth
will come out.

1028
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:28,921
And this way,
you're failing a class

1029
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:30,339
instead of getting thrown
out of school

1030
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:32,058
for bribing a professor.

1031
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,543
It's up to you, Ian.

1032
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:34,677
You want an F,

1033
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:36,929
or do you want to not have
a legal career at all?

1034
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:47,306
So I sign this, and the
bribery allegations are gone?

1035
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:50,309
And no one ever
knows a thing.

1036
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:53,729
But I still have to pay
Ian back the money.

1037
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:55,581
That's the way
loans work.

1038
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,517
You say that like
I am a monster.

1039
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:59,452
I say it like it's true.

1040
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,074
You know...

1041
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:07,994
you never let me tell you
what the money was for.

1042
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:10,429
You didn't listen to me
when I told you I don't care.

1043
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,731
Who's the monster now?

1044
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:13,599
I don't care
because you always said

1045
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,586
the circumstances
don't matter.

1046
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,480
Well, do you care
that after Mike grilled me,

1047
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:19,755
I was so impressed with him

1048
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,507
that I wonder why
I'd forgotten him.

1049
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:24,844
So I looked through
my old records,

1050
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:26,679
just to see how he did,

1051
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:29,098
but I couldn't find
any record of him

1052
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:31,317
ever being in my class.

1053

gonna find any record

1054

of you accepting a bribe
from a student.

1056

I'm saying you got
a two-for-one,

1057
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:42,662

That's why you came to see me
back then, isn't it?

1060
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,035
You didn't want anyone
to find out about him.

1061
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,503

00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,503
You know what?
Something did happen.

1107
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:38,704
I dealt with some shit,

1108
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,373
and I'm trying
to thank you for it

1109
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:43,709
because it turned out
to be a good thing.

1110
00:40:43,844 --> 00:40:46,178
I think the word you're
looking for is "closure."

1111
00:40:46,263 --> 00:40:47,263
That's your word.

1112
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:48,214
The word I'm looking for is,

1113
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:49,382
"You're welcome, Harvey.

1114
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:51,133
That's nice of you to say."

1115
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:53,552
Thanks, Harvey.

1116
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,054
Good.

1117
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:56,222
Now listen to me.

1118
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:57,476
For a minute there,
I thought

1119
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:59,225
you were gonna tell me
that he knows.

1120
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:00,726
What?

1121
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,144
Maybe I'm crazy,

1122
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:05,314
but when I was prepping him,
for a second, he looked at me,

1123
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:07,316
and I thought,

1124
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,702
"He's suspicious."

1125
00:41:09,786 --> 00:41:11,036
And then you called,

1126
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,406
and after everything
that's happened already, I--

1127
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:20,079
It's fine, Mike.
He doesn't know.

1128
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:28,087
