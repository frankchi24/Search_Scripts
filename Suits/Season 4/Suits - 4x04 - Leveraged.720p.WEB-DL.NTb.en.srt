1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,035
- Previously on suits...

2
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,570
- Walter, I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

3
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:08,107
But I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,075
- Well, you told me that
mike ross wasn't a threat,

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,477
And then he handcuffed us
with a t.R.O.

6
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,612
I want proof that
he's giving up his bid,

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,147
And if I don't get it
by the morning,

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,682
I'm gonna call
my private investigators,

9
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:17,683
And I'm gonna finish
what I started.

10
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,385
- What did harvey tell you?

11
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:20,719
- Looks like
he told me the truth.

12
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,456
- I want you to stop
the personal attacks on mike.

13
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,191
- You told me this
wasn't gonna be a problem.

14
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,595
- You don't have to stop this
because you're some changed man.

15
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,663
You have to stop this
because you owe me.

16
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:32,664
- Mr. Ross.

17
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,665
Eric woodall.

18
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,234
I'm the u.S. Attorney for--

19
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,602
- The southern district
of new york.

20
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:37,736
I know who you are.

21
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,471
- Since when does the s.E.C.
Go around

22
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,107
Intimidating law firms
by going after their clients?

23
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,275
- They don't,
but they will

24
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,743
When eric woodall starts there
next week.

25
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,744
It started.

26
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,647
Seven clients, seven subpoenas,

27
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,349
All coming tomorrow.

28
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,769
- Uh, excuse me,
you don't have an appointment.

29
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,071
- I don't need an appointment.

30
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,705
Sit down, shut up,
and listen.

31
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,608
Harvey might forgive you because
you returned those recordings,

32
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,609
But I don't.

33
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,078
- Donna.
- Not done.

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,213
What harvey did with gillis,
it was harsh,

35
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,183
But using what I told you
in a private conversation--

36
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,285
That crosses a line
that even harvey never would.

37
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,087
- Donna.
- Still not done.

38
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:31,123
When you left our firm,
you left me too,

39
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,525
But I honestly thought
that we'd always be friends.

40
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,528
Now I'm not so sure.

41
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,464
- Amy, did you send donna
the package?

42
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,099
- Guilt gift.
Didn't open it.

43
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,367
- It was a balenciaga
classic town bag.

44
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,670
- Anthracite
with an outside pocket.

45
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:45,737
- His idea or yours?

46
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,206
Don't answer that.

47
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,476
It was yours.

48
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,445
- You and harvey want to
knock each other out,

49
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,447
You go right ahead.

50
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,583
But don't ever
betray me again.

51
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,286
Nice shoes.

52
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,658
- She's even better
than I imagined.

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,141
- Looking for this?

54
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,443
- Harvey specter.

55
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,812
What brings you to montclair
at 7:00 in the morning?

56
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,747
- Oh, you know
what brings me here.

57
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,583
I woke up to find these
on my welcome mat.

58
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,253
- Well, as much as I'd love
to have been responsible

59
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,356
For subpoenaing seven
of your firm's top clients,

60
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,591
I didn't even know about this
till just now.

61
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,693
- You didn't even have the balls
to come at me directly.

62
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,462
- Get off my property.

63
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,663
- What's the matter, eric?

64
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,366
You're afraid
I'll get you fired again?

65
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,334
- I get it.

66
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,937
You want to hear me say
I'm using my new position

67
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,839
To destroy your business,

68
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,475
'cause you're the piece
of garbage that got me fired.

69
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,910
Isn't that what you
want to hear me say?

70
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,546
- Oh, I know
you'll never say that,

71
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,347
But I do want you to admit
that you sent

72
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,383
An agent brian harris
after my firm.

73
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,318
- Sorry.
I don't even have jurisdiction

74
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,686
Over that department.

75
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,422
That department's run by a man
name sean cahill.

76
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:14,293
Sean cahill just happened
to target my firm?

77
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,361
- Well, he is a killer attorney

78
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,231
With a nose for sleazy lawyers,

79
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,499
And I should know.

80
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,434
We came up together
at the justice department.

81
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,603
You know, that little
governmental agency

82
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:25,938
That protects their own?

83
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,973
- Well, eric, your big brother
couldn't protect you

84
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,977
And I don't see how this is
gonna be any different,

85
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,314
And by the way,
that's yesterday's paper.

86
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,350
- You wanted to see me?

87
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,351
- Sure did.

88
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,520
Have a seat.

89
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,522
I was going over
our trade sheets.

90
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,257
Couldn't help but notice

91
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,492
You bought another 100,000
shares of gillis industries.

92
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,627
- It's gonna be fine.

93
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,395
- Do I look like an asshole
to you?

94
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,763
Where the hell
did you get the money?

95
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,333
- You know where
I got the money.

96
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,634
I bought those shares on margin.

97
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,702
- And leveraged my company.

98
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:57,769
- The bylaws said I can do it.

99
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,438
- I don't care
what the bylaws say,

100
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,006
You did this without asking.

101
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,274
- Look, I know you're pissed.

102
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,342
- Oh, I'm not pissed.

103
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,776
I've been waiting for you

104
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,511
To have the balls
to do something like this

105
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,512
Since you got here.

106
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,981
You raised my risk,

107
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,916
But you also raised my reward,
and on top of it,

108
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,652
You did it like
an investment banker,

109
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,454
Without permission.

110
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,260
- Well, thank you, jon.

111
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,629
- Go get 'em.

112
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,366
One more thing.
- Yeah?

113
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,935
- You have a week
to de-leverage my company.

114
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,271
If you don't,
you're out of a job.

115
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,278
You went to eric woodall's house
this morning?

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,712
- I understand
you're bent out of shape

117
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,347
Because I stepped on
your territory--

118
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,049
- You think I give a sh--
about my territory?

119
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,617
- What the hell are you doing
in here?

120
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,685
- Listen, I really don't care

121
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,353
If you work this thing
or I do,

122
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,455
But whoever it is has to
not be an idiot.

123
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,057
- And how, exactly,
am I an idiot?

124
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,660
- You poked the bear.
- Eric woodall isn't the bear.

125
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,595
- No. I am.

126
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,564
And whatever you were
about to say, don't say it.

127
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,867
Harvey, this is his case.

128
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,402
It's why we brought him in,

129
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,603
And I don't want you involved.

130
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:05,604
- Me?

131
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,738
I'm the one who found out

132
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,906
It's not woodall
coming after us, it's--

133
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,675
- Sean cahill.

134
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:13,512
- These are my clients,
and when they call in a panic,

135
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,514
I need to be the voice
on the other end of the line.

136
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,749
- Then be the voice
on the other end of the line,

137
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,551
But you're not
handling the s.E.C.

138
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,420
- I'm the reason
they're coming after us.

139
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,555
- Which is why you wanted to
hire jeff in the first place.

140
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,390
- That was before
all this became real.

141
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,591
Now that it's happening,

142
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,759
He doesn't want to
sit on the sidelines.

143
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,463
- Well, then find yourself
a comfortable spot on the bench,

144
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,732
Because like it or not,
jeff's in charge.

145
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,604

156
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,106
- Exactly, except for the part

157
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,941
Where if I don't find
a new investor in a week,

158
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,075
I'm out of a job.

159
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,810
- I'm surprised
he gave you a week.

160
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,946
- Amy, it's not funny.
- I know it isn't.

161
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,648
I was just trying to make
the best of the situation.

162
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,650
- Well, if you want to make
the best of the situation,

163
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,419
Get me a meeting
with tony gianopolous,

164
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,756
Because if I can't get
in there...

165
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:31,957
I'm in trouble.

166
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,092
- We're in trouble.

167
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,861
- You really mean that?

168
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,664
- You think I'm staying here
if you leave?

169
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,932
- Thank you, amy.

170
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,100
- I'm just kidding.

171
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,568
Epstein's been trying
to poach me

172
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,070
Since the day I got here.
Mmm. Tch.

173
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,072
Yeah, you think those flowers
bought themselves?

174
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,940
Mm-mm.

175
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,110
- You--wow.

176
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,985
- Can I talk to you a second?

177
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,953
- If you want an update
on the takeover,

178
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,688
You should talk to harvey.

179
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,957
- That's not why I'm here.

180
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,692
- Look, logan,
I-I know that you--

181
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,162
- I have five companies here

182
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,797
That I'm looking at
for my next deal,

183
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,865
And I need someone
to evaluate them

184
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,735
From a legal standpoint.

185
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,171
- Your next deal.
- Yeah, my next deal.

186
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,740
Harvey told me
not to hurt my future

187
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,074
By going below the belt
with mike,

188
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,609
So instead of not
hurting my future,

189
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,478
I thought I'd start
planning for it.

190
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,147
- So then maybe harvey is who
you should be planning it with.

191
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,916
- Well, harvey's
got stuff to do,

192
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,084
And he's not the one who
convinced me to back off mike.

193
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,187
- Are you saying that I owe you?

194
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,488
- No, I'm not saying that,

195
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,058
- So we're just gonna go
back and forth, trading favors?

196
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,526
- Rachel, this isn't a favor.

197
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,094
I have a board meeting
on Friday.

198
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,596
I need to be prepared.

199
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,932
So are you my lawyer or not?

200
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,068
- I will get right on it.

201
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,070
- Thank you.

202
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,976
- Louis, I need your help.
We're gonna need to--

203
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,177
- Don't speak.

204
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,216
You may speak.

205
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:08,520
- Just thanking
the lord god almighty.

206
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,155
We taking down jessica?
We firing malone?

207
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,223
I am tingling.

208
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:15,660
- Mike ross just bought another
2% of gillis industries.

209
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,662
- He must be leveraged up
to his scrawny little neck.

210
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,798
- Exactly, and he's gonna be
scrambling for funding.

211
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,833
- You want me
to get your t.R.O. Removed.

212
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,836
- Because you pissed off
judge ramos

213
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,137
And now she
can't stand you.

214
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,707
- Oh, because I keep
a list of your enemies.

215
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,941
You want to see it?
- Just get it done.

216
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,042
- Oh, I'm gonna get it done.

217
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,777
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

218
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,212
- Louis, we're splitting
mike's focus.

219
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,114
That doesn't mean
he won't be prepared.

220
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,549
- Oh, he can prepare
all he wants,

221
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,751
But the student is about to meet
the master,

222
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,786
Because ralph macchio
doesn't stand a chance

223
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,255
Against mr. Miyagi.

224
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,191
<i>- You know the karate kid?</i>

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,300
- That's not cool, harvey.

226
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,740
- Oh, let me see
if I can guess why you're here.

227
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,575
You came to tell me
the way I handled harvey

228
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,044
This morning was sexy.

229
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,013
- Oh, you mean when I told him
to leave you alone?

230
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,950
- And the way that I allowed you
to do that was very sexy.

231
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,752
- Uh-huh.

232
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,121
- And this is...

233
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,889
The griffen cosmetics
subpoena.

234
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,990
- I looked them all over.

235
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,125
This is the weakest one.

236
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,093
- The weakest one?
- Exactly.

237
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,163
Once this one goes down,
the others fall like dominos.

238
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,198
- First of all, if I were gonna
take that strategy,

239
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,767
I would go for
the hardest one.

240
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,569
Second of all,
why don't you walk yourself

241
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,170
Back to your office
and let me do my job?

242
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,573
- Excuse me?

243
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:38,076
- You told harvey you
brought me in to handle this.

244
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,013
- Your job isn't to worry about
what I told harvey.

245
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,849
Your job is to worry about
what I'm telling you.

246
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,585
- And what I'm telling you

247
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,987
Is that I'm not walking
into an s.E.C. Negotiation

248
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:49,955
With a babysitter.

249
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,590
- Negotiation?

250
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:55,060
- I know that, and I'm gonna
win it with one shot.

251
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,661
- Then I suggest you
warm up to this.

252
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,598
You're not walking into
the s.E.C. With a babysitter.

253
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,367
You're walking in there
with a bazooka.

254
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,838
- Hey, mike,
you need to see something.

255
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,707
- No, I don't have time.

256
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,241
I'm working on
the gianopolous proposal.

257
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,644
- Yeah, that proposal isn't
gonna matter if they win this.

258
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,885
- Goddamn it.

259
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,687
Harvey's trying to roll back
the t.R.O.?

260
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,688
- No, it's not harvey.

261
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,689
Check the docket.

262
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,859
It's some woman named lois litt.

263
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,931
Yeah.

264
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:33,932
I know how to handle her.

265
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,367
Um, here.

266
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,002
This is 90% done.
Check it over.

267
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,004
Make sure there's not
one comma out of place.

268
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,139
- Mike, come on,
you know I can do more than--

269
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,841
- I don't have time, amy.
Just do it.

270
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,309
- Okay.

271
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,648
- How long did you work
in this sh-- hole?

272
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,183
- Sorry I'm late.
Been up to my neck in work.

273
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,252
Just filed seven huge subpoenas.

274
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,787
- Yeah, we know what you filed.
- Oh.

275
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,188
I see you brought the missus.

276
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,092
- Jessica, whatever you're
about to say, don't say it.

277
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,128
- How about I say it with this?

278
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,362
- Ooh, a subpoena?

279
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,433
- And you'll be answering it
in court tomorrow.

280
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,901
- Oh, well then I better see

281
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,937
What flavor bullsh--
you're serving up.

282
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,408
Ah, ah, now,
this is a good one.

283
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,945
"malicious prosecution
of pearson specter clients,"

284
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,247
And how exactly
are we doing that?

285
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,248
- I'll tell you how.

286
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,749
You come at our clients.

287
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,017
Our clients leave us.

288
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,252
You drop their cases.

289
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,853
- Well, I certainly
wouldn't tell them

290
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,422
That's how to avoid
s.E.C. Scrutiny,

291
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,892
But it's not my fault
if dropping pearson specter

292
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:34,893
Starts catching on.

293
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:35,927
- Enough bullsh--.

294
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,696
You're targeting my clients

295
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,798
On behalf of eric woodall,
and you know it.

296
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,733
- That is a lovely theory,
but if you had any proof,

297
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,201
You wouldn't be standing here
right now.

298
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,136
- I have proof, sean.

299
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,006
Seven cases in one day
against our clients,

300
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,407
Which we both know
has never happened

301
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,009
In the history of the s.E.C.

302
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,377
- It has now.

303
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,280
We've filed nine cases
against clients of weil gotshal,

304
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,414
Eight against skaaden,

305
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,084
And six against cravath.

306
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,019
Welcome to the new s.E.C.

307
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,754
We target law firms.

308
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,756
And as long as we're not
only targeting yours,

309
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,358
The only way to shut this down
is to shut us down.

310
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,096
What's really
going on here, sean,

311
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,230
And I'm gonna prove it.

312
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,165
- Well, good luck,
but how do you think

313
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,468
Judge hopkins is gonna respond
to your allegations

314
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,136
When I tell him
they're coming from a man

315
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:22,073
Who is about to be fired?

316
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,109
Oh, you--
you didn't tell her.

317
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,479
Ooh, that's awkward.

318
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,047
I'll see you in court.

319
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,418
- Jessica!
- I don't want to hear it.

320
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,220
- Well, you need to hear it.
- What?

321
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,755
That you lied to me?

322
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,256
- You know, I didn't
actually lie to you.

323
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,258
- Oh, no, no, no.
You tell me that you didn't lie

324
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,160
Because we never directly
asked you the question,

325
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,294
And I will knock
your head off.

326
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,295
- All right, fine.

327
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,764
I lied.

328
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,265
I lied
because it doesn't matter.

329
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,400
I want to fight for you,
and I'm the best man to do it.

330
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,269
- Well, the new part
of the equation

331
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,171
Is that you just made me
look like a fool.

332
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,506
- Jess.
- Don't pull that jess sh--

333
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,307
With me--I want to know what
it says in your file.

334
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,476
- I don't know what it says.
- How the hell do you not know?

335
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,844
- 'cause whatever it is
is bullsh--.

336
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,880
Because the reason
they were gonna fire me

337
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,248
Is that I refused
to go after you.

338
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,950
- Then why didn't you
tell me that

339
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,786
When you came at us
demanding a job?

340
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,554
- Because good lawyers negotiate

341
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,991
From a position of strength,
not weakness.

342
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,460
- Well, the position
you just put us in

343
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,328
Is pretty goddamn weak.

344
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,808
- Louis, hey.
- Don't louis me.

345
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,411
Of a "how's your father?"
- what does that mean?

346
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,880
- It means that I'm not here
to exchange pleasantries.

347
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,382
I'm here to get
that t.R.O. Lifted.

348
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,516
- Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

349
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,351
I'm also sorry
to hear about sheila.

350
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,554
- Bullsh-- you're sorry
to hear about she--

351
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,855
What are you
talking about?

352
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,089
- Come on,
you have to have heard.

353
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,524
- Heard what?

354
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,393
- She's engaged.

355
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,495
It's all over harvard's
facebook page.

356
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,838
- Oh, my god,
how could she do this?

357
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,307
She said she could never be
attracted to a handsome man.

358
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,209
- And that picture doesn't
even do him justice,

359
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,176
But this one, however...

360
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,911
- A thong?
- Yeah.

361
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,047
That...
- What the--

362
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,583
- Yeah, it's a whole, like,
beach thing, I guess.

363
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:14,018
Long weekend.

364
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,920
- You're a son of a bitch, mike.

365
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,088
You're not even sorry at all.

366
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,423
You're using this
to get into my head.

367
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,991
- Louis, come on,
I can't believe you.

368
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,526
You think I would use
sheila's engagement

369
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,861
Just to get you
off your game?

370
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,962
- Never gonna work.

371
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,163
- That I would
stick it in your face

372
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,631
That she's all up
in this guy's business

373
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,099
In a way that you've
never seen before?

374
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,102
- That right now
she's probably scrapbooking

375
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,470
The first day
of their relationship,

376
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,105
Which apparently happened
just weeks

377
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,908
After you broke her heart?

378
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,243
- You're the devil.

379
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:42,046
Sidwell investment group
versus sanders international.

380
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,314
- Looks like that's us.

381
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,315
I'll see you in there.

382
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,920
- Louis, I can't believe it.

383
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:51,122
I give you one
goddamn job to do,

384
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,457
And you--
what are you doing up there?

385
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:58,329
- Oh, explain why you stood in
front of the judge like a moron?

386
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,464
What possible explanation--

387
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,300
- Sheila got engaged.

388
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,068
- What?

389
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,069
When?

390
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,304
- This morning.

391
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,573
- Louis, I'm sorry.

392
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,409
- I was so sure
that she would just come around

393
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,044
About having children,
you know?

394
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,380
That's why I've been
turning down

395
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,081
All those j-date requests.

396
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,383
- We'll get mike another way.

397
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,251
- Oh, you're goddamn right
we're gonna get him.

398
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,419
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch

399
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,453
If it's the last thing I do.

400
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,389
- What are you talking about?

401
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,558
- He used the sheila news
to get into my head, harvey.

402
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,330
- Used the news
or gave you the news?

403
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,065
- Oh, please,
what difference does it make?

404
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,199
- What difference does it make?

405
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,668
It makes all the difference.

406
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,369
Like on the one hand,
I feel for you,

407
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,405
And on the other, you're
the world's biggest idiot.

408
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,607
I've been staring at it
for three hours.

409
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,608
It's real.

410
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,243
- I don't believe it.

411
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,011
- Yeah, that adonis
on that yacht,

412
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,179
Sheila's fiance.

413
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,448
- That adonis
is a photoshopped picture

414
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,284
Of lorenzo lamas from 1998!

415
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,585
- Who the hell
is lorenzo lamas?

416
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,120
- Well, I can tell you
who he isn't.

417
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,156
He isn't sheila's fiance!

418
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,063
- Oh, thank god.

419
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,198
- Are you even listening?

420
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,467
It was bad enough
that nigel rattled you

421
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,102
With your unread cat letters.

422
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,337
Now you're letting mike
do this?

423
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,372
- Harvey, please.
- Shut the hell up!

424
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,007
Look, I tried to warn you,

425
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,609
And you stood there with your
stupid leg up in the air,

426
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,446
Telling me that the student
was no match for the master

427
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:25,650
And all it took
was one doctored picture

428
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,118
For you to sh-- the bed!

429
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,588
- I didn't mean to--
- shut the hell up!

430
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,756
God.

431
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,198
- Well, fancy meeting you here.

432
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,001
- Rachel, get out of here.

433
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,771
- I was just coming to
make some copy--

434
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,306
Louis, what's wrong?

435
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,274
- I don't want to talk about it;
nothing is wrong.

436
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,076
- Well, obviously
something's wrong.

437
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,578
- You know what,
if you're so curious,

438
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,382
I'm sure the two of you will
have a big laugh about it later.

439
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,217
- Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about,

440
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,451
But seeing you like this,

441
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,253
There's no way
that I would laugh at you.

442
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,556
- Mike convinced me
that sheila was engaged

443
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,291
To throw me off my game.

444
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,327
- I'm so sorry, louis.

445
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,129
- Yeah, well, he sure wasn't.

446
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,797
Stuck a knife in me,
twisted it

447
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,699
With the thought of her
and another man.

448
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,236
It felt like
a drill in my skull all day,

449
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,404
And then to top it all off,

450
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:24,442
It cost me the respect
of my best friend.

451
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,345
- Maybe--

452
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,680
- Oh, don't you even try
to defend him.

453
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,282
- No, I wasn't going to.

454
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,817
I was going to say,

455
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,486
Maybe this is what you needed

456
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,489
To decide to reconnect
with sheila.

457
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,058
- And what about harvey?

458
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,160
How do I repair that?

459
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,463
- I'm really sorry
for what happened, louis.

460
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,464
I am.

461
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,679
- Hey.
- Hey.

462
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:05,083
- Are you asking because
you're concerned about me

463
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:09,120
Or because you want to know
if I left you any food?

464
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:12,090
- Whoa.

465
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,491
Tough day?
- I'm sorry.

466
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,493
I've just been working
16-hour days,

467
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,729
And I'm really--
- stressed.

468
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,098
Yeah, I know the feeling.

469
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,470
'cause I heard that you had
a pretty big win today.

470
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,471
- You talked to harvey.

471
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,573
- I talked to louis.

472
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,874
Mike, I know you want to win,

473
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,777
But do you have any idea
what your lie did to him?

474
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,845
- It wasn't a lie.

475
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,379
It was a strategy.

476
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,549
- It was both, and it ended up
with him near tears.

477
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,853
- It just seems like all
that matters to you is winning

478
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,222
And that you don't care about
what it does to your friends.

479
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,157
- You know what?

480
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,825
I'm sorry that I hurt louis,

481
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,293
But he was going to
that courtroom

482
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,129
So they could put their
tender offer to a vote.

483
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,763
- I know.

484
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,366
- You also know because we've
had this discussion before

485
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,235
That if he got his way,

486
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,837
They would rip that company
to shreds.

487
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,573
So instead of coming down on me
for what I did to louis,

488
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,675
Why don't you start worrying
about all the lives

489
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,378
That logan sanders is
gonna destroy if that happens?

490
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,925
You told me you didn't care
who was in charge.

491
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,361
You just wanted whoever it was
to not be an idiot.

492
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,296
- Are you saying
that I was an idiot?

493
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,631
- I'm saying we both were.

494
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,633
I shouldn't have gone
to woodall,

495
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,569
And you shouldn't have
lied to us.

496
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,638
- You don't seem pissed.

497
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,507
- I've had enough happen
already today.

498
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,776
Besides,
lying to me was wrong,

499
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,212
But lying to the woman
you're in a relationship with

500
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,813
Is a whole other level.

501
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,183
- When do you think
she's gonna get past it?

502
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,251
- From personal experience,
that could take a while.

503
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,619
That's not my problem.

504
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,921
That's yours.

505
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,722
- Then what are you doing here,
harvey?

506
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,593
- I'm here to tell you
what you're gonna do about it.

507
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,562
- No.

508
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,696
No way.

509
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,464
I'm not taking the stand.

510
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,768
Because woodall telling you
to go after our clients

511
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,636
Is how you got this job
in the first place

512
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,238
And happens to make our case.

513
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,639
- He didn't outright tell me
to do it,

514
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,640
And you know it.

515
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,741
- You had to find out somehow.

516
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,443
- I found out
from brian harris.

517
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,912
He told me he had
this funny feeling

518
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,480
That the day after
woodall arrived,

519
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,382
That I was gonna
start issuing subpoenas

520
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,785
To pearson specter clients.

521
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:24,355
When I asked him why,
he said, "you know why."

522
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,723
- Then you're gonna
get up on the stand

523
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,992
And tell them that.
- I can't. I have no proof.

524
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,394
It was vague, and it's
a third party conversation.

525
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,496
- Which makes it hearsay,
and I don't give a sh--.

526
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,899
- Well, I do, 'cause it opens
me up to slander at best

527
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,534
And perjury charges at worst.

528
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,236
- Well, jeff,
you used that story

529
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,503
To get your ass in here.

530
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,440
Now use it to get the job done.

531
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,715
Amy!

532
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,517
I thought I asked you

533
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,519
To leave the gianopolous
proposal on my desk.

534
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,555
- And I did,
20 minutes ago.

535
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:58,856
- What?
Okay.

536
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,858
Did you proof it?
- No.

537
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,393
I thought you'd have
a better chance

538
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,794
If the document
was riddled with typos.

539
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,396
- This is important.
- I know it is,

540
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,797
Which is why I read it
backwards and forwards.

541
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,266
- Okay, did you add the part

542
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,403
- I did, but your figures
on the non-voting stock

543
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,672
Didn't add up,
so I proposed a staggered board

544
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,274
To make up for the imbalance.

545
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,642
- Staggered board?

546
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,976
- Yeah, don't act so surprised.

547
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,611
- I'm sorry,
I just thought that you--

548
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,413
- You just thought
that I didn't know anything

549
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,748
About what goes on here?

550
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,982
Listen up, t. Boone pickens,

551
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,385
I actually know a lot
about this business.

552
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,787
- And I know more than enough
to know

553
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,622
That that looks like
every other proposal

554
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,692
- Well, that gives me
a sh-- load of confidence

555
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,395
- I'm not trying to
destroy your confidence.

556
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,663
That's the one thing you have
going for you.

557
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:39,864
- Then what are you
trying to do?

558
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,065
- Mike, you're not here

559
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,767
Because you crunched
sidwell some numbers.

560
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,902
You're here because
you solved a problem for him.

561
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,407
- All right.

562
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,877
- And bring you everything
I can find on tony gianopolous.

563
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,379
On it.

564
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,380
- Amy.

565
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,016
Why aren't you--

566
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,051
- Why am I an assistant

567
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,852
And not an investment banker?

568
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,788
I'm getting my phd
in psychology.

569
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,724
Money bores me.

570
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,793
- I don't know why you needed
to talk to me in chambers,

571
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,960
Mr. Malone.

572
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,362
I was clear on my ruling.

573
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,030
- Well, with all due respect,
your honor,

574
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,999
Your ruling didn't cover
the fact that the s.E.C.

575
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,934
Has a vendetta
against pearson specter.

576
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,469
- That's a serious accusation.

577
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,372
He would have said it
out there, not in here.

578
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:24,475
Because I don't want to slander
an entire department

579
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:25,643
Based on the actions
of two men.

580
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,479
He doesn't want to be
charged with perjury

581
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,880
Because he's lying,
and this is a joke.

582
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,484
To do the exact same thing
that he's doing right now.

583
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,819
- What the hell
are you talking about?

584
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,354
- Before I left the s.E.C.,

585
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,489
I was told to target
pearson specter clients.

586
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,990
- And who exactly told you?
- Brian harris.

587
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,392
- Then go after him,

588
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:42,793
'cause all you've got on me
is hearsay,

589
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,628
And might I point this is
the accusation of a man

590
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,664
Who is about to be fired,
which I'd say should be taken

591
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,965
With a cubic meter of salt.

592
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,934
- Well, that cubic meter of salt

593
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,569
Might actually
get a little bit smaller

594
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,404
If sean here were to, say,
open up his files

595
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:57,541
- Our work product is covered
under federal regulation,

596
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,611
- I also know you're hiding
behind your office

597
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,114
- All right, all right,
that's enough.

598
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,648
Mr. Malone,
I don't appreciate you

599
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,683
Using my chambers to testify,

600
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:06,984
And he may not have proof,

601
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:10,087
But if one client
leaves his firm

602
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,956
And their charges
miraculously disappear,

603
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,591
You're looking at more
than sanctions.

604
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,960
You're looking at jail time.

605
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,400
- Thank you.

606
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,801
- Rachel?

607
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,804
You already have a suggestion
for my new deal?

608
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,139
- I do.
- Good.

609
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,141
Then which of those five
companies should I go after?

610
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,675
- None of them.

611
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,144
- So you brought me nothing?

612
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,546
- No, I brought you
five better options.

613
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,181
- What's wrong with the op--
- just take a look.

614
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,556
- These companies
have no disposable assets.

615
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,825
- No, they don't.
They have underperforming assets

616
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,827
That can be turned around
and built into something.

617
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,495
- Did you even look into
the companies I gave you?

618
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,097
- Yes, I did, but I--
- but what?

619
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,534
Her boyfriend's kool-aid.
- Maybe if more people did,

620
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,202
There just might be--
- god damn it, rachel,

621
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,171
I'm not in business
to save the world.

622
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:01,806
I asked for
a professional opinion.

623
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,774
- And I gave you
a professional opinion.

624
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,676
You just don't like it.
- No, I don't.

625
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,578
And now we're gonna have to work
all day tomorrow

626
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,213
To do what I asked you to do
in the first place.

627
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,681
- You mean
spend all day together.

628
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,982
- If that's what it takes.
- Mm-hmm.

629
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,684
Did you call this board meeting

630
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,219
Just so we could
spend more time together?

631
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,954
- Did you bring me deals
you knew I'd reject

632
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,088
Just to avoid it?

633
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,560
Look, like I said,

634
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,094
I have a meeting on Friday,

635
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,563
And I need to be
prepared for it,

636
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,097
So maybe you should
go back to your office,

637
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:30,634
And just give me a call
when you have something.

638
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,772
- Okay.

639
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,645
- You're kidding me.

640
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,113
So this is all mine?

641
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,049
- Yup.

642
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,917
In 20 days, the public access
will be gone,

643
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,221
And you will have yourself
1/4 mile of private beach.

644
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,989
- What about
the southampton city council?

645
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,524
- What about them?

646
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:56,126
- They're a bunch of
public-access loving assholes.

647
00:24:56,128 --> 00:25:01,131
- Like I said,
what about them?

648
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,167
- How'd you do this, mike?

649
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,969
- Well, the question isn't
how I did it,

650
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,570
It's why I did it.

651
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:08,973
- Oh.
You want something from me.

652
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,975
- Just your consideration.

653
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,544
- Well, you've earned it.
Go ahead.

654
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,153
Not interested.

655
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,957
- You didn't even look at it.

656
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,926
- Oh, I don't have to.

657
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,229
- You just said that I earned
your consideration.

658
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,298
- Mm-hmm,
and you just got it.

659
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,802
- Gillis industries
is ripe for a turnaround,

660
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:41,238
And I already own 7%.
- Congratulations.

661
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,541
Now go beg someone else
for money,

662
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:44,875
Because you're not
getting mine.

663
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,577
- I don't understand.

664
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,678
- You don't have to.

665
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,213
Now get the hell
out of my office.

666
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,282
- Mr. Gianopolous.
- I said get the hell out.

667
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,725
- Hey, mike.
How's it going?

668
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,993
Fancy meeting you here.

669
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,866
- It was you.

670
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,968
- What was me?

671
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,005
I'm just here to thank you
for the advice you once gave me.

672
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,807
You know,
back when we were friends.

673
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:19,977
- Louis.
- No, no, no.

674
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:23,347
You once told me that
my actions had consequences.

675
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,782
Remember?

676
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,817
Your actions yesterday
have consequences too.

677
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,019
- What did you say
to gianopolous?

678
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,220
- Not much.

679
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,122
Just that you were
the person responsible

680
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,123
For his number two
leaving him.

681
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,124
- I was responsible?

682
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,259
He agreed to it.

683
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,760
- But what he didn't know
was is that

684
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,829
It was his own lawyer
who came up with the idea.

685
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,932
- And what does that--
- have to do with it?

686
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,734
He may have agreed to it,

687
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,235
But it was a betrayal by you.

688
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:49,773
You obviously do not know
about investment banking.

689
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,843
The only thing more satisfying
to these guys than money

690
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:56,046
Is sticking it to someone
who stuck it to them.

691
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,359
I'm sorry for hurting you
with sheila.

692
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:11,128
- Don't you ever mention
her name to me again.

693
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,264
- Okay,
but it was a move,

694
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,265
Like you just did.

695
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,735
So can we move on?

696
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,804
- Move on?

697
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,942
You used the woman I love
to extend your goddamn t.R.O.

698
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:29,213
You knew how I felt about her,
and you did it anyway.

699
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,249
I will never, ever forget it
until the day I die.

700
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,385
Good luck beating harvey
without money.

701
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,194
- James dolan died
and left me the knicks?

702
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,397
- Louis stopped mike
from getting gianopolous.

703
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,865
He blocked his funding.

704
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:48,866
- Good.

705
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,140
- You went to louis
with a problem,

706
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,207
He fixed it,

707
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,876
And all you're gonna say
is "good"?

708
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,344
- Donna, I'm glad
he fixed the problem,

709
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,246
But it was a problem
he created.

710
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,815
When it comes to people
he cares about,

711
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,383
Louis has a blind spot.

712
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,186
- Yeah, for people and cats
and who knows what else?

713
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,988
- I'll tell you what else.

714
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,923
He cares about you.

715
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,293
- What do you want from me,
donna?

716
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,029
- I want you to tell him
he did a good job.

717
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,265
- I'll tell him
when we come out on top.

718
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,433
- Okay, harvey.

719
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,401
You do what you're gonna do,

720
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,703
But just remember,

721
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,404
When louis asked sheila
to marry him,

722
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,807
You were the one he picked
to be his best man,

723
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,376
And you said yes.

724
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,322
- I'm sorry,
but we're not hiring today.

725
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,724
- I think you'd be
looking for a job

726
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,125
Given the beat-down
you took in chambers.

727
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,928
Jeff disgruntled employee here
told you,

728
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,298
- Well, what I told her
is that you lost.

729
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,365
- Then why are you here?

730
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,967
- We're here to make you
an offer.

731
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,302
- You drop all seven cases,

732
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,237
We drop the malicious
prosecution claim.

733
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:04,441
- Judge hopkins is going to be
waiting for you to take action.

734
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,276
Too much time goes by,

735
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,878
He's gonna think
you're full of sh--.

736
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,146
- But if you fold right now,

737
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:12,249
For the exact claim
that we're willing to drop.

738
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,884
- Which is why
we'll tell the judge

739
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:15,753
That in exchange for those
cases being dropped,

740
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,821
We'll give the s.E.C.
Unprecedented access

741
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,123
To our clients' books.

742
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,292
- Which, of course,
you won't be doing.

743
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,362
- So what exactly
am I getting out of this?

744
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,530
- You get to save face.

745
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:27,498
- I do like my face.

746
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,999
However, I also like my ass,

747
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,034
Which will be on the line
if I take this deal.

748
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:34,404
- Then you have 24 hours to
decide which one you like more.

749
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,880
- Mr. Forstman, mike ross.

750
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,848
- No.

751
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,383
- Sir, I think that
if you hear me out--

752
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,419
- How the hell
did you find me here?

753
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,188
<i>- The article in forbes said</i>

754
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,556
You can't go more
than three hours

755
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,558
Without rosa's cafe cubanos.

756
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,161
<i>- That article in forbes
was six years ago.</i>

757
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,096
- It also said you never change.

758
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:02,432
Every bud fox wannabe dumped
in a local landfill?

759
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:07,337
You'll miss the opportunity
to get back at harvey specter.

760
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,542
- And what does
a little sh-- like you

761
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,243
Know about harvey specter?

762
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,279
- I know that he bought that
'63 aston martin

763
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,281
Out from under you,
and you've hated him ever since.

764
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:19,082
You know he keeps it
in a garage?

765
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,184
Doesn't even drive it.

766
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,185
- What do you want?

767
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,490
- Gillis industries.

768
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,325
- Gillis industries...

769
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,994
Is a black hole
of distressed debt.

770
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,029
I want nothing to do with it.

771
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,030
- No, it isn't.

772
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,232
It's a '63 aston martin.

773
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,436
- Who do you work for?

774
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,104
- Who says I work for anyone?

775
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,272
- Because a young kid like you

776
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,275
With enough clout
to go after gillis...

777
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,577
I'd know you.

778
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,545
- I work for jonathan sidwell.

779
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:52,316
- Okay. You've got
my 230 mil.

780
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,286
- I only need 80.

781
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,555
- You don't know what you need.

782
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,626
- What happens to the company
is my call.

783
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,261
- Done.

784
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,935
Oh, one more thing,
when you get those papers.

785
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,973
I have a feeling there'll be
a provision buried in there

786
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,442
That says that
once the deal closes,

787
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,477
You cut sidwell out.

788
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,179
- I'm sorry, what?

789
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:25,349
And I want need him
sucking a chunk out of a deal

790
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,484
That can't happen without me.

791
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,032
- Well?

792
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,433
- He went for it.

793
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,534
- That is great.

794
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,570
- No, it's not all great.

795
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:50,073
He'll only give me the money
if I agree to cut out sidwell.

796
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,141
- What?

797
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,577
What does cut him out
even mean?

798
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,045
- It means make sure sidwell

799
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,947
Doesn't get a penny
from this deal.

800
00:31:56,949 --> 00:32:00,417
- Mike, the second he finds
that out, you're gone.

801
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,653
- He's not gonna find out
until the deal closes,

802
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,222
And if I don't find the money,
I'm out of a job anyway.

803
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:08,392
- Oh, I get it.

804
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,560
At least this way, you get to
leave on the winning side.

805
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,664
- We leave on the winning side.
- Who says I'm gonna do that?

806
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,634
- What happened to, "you think
I'm staying if you leave"?

807
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,702
- Yeah, that was before I knew

808
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,070
You were gonna screw over
sidwell.

809
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:21,705
- Amy, I--
- no, he may be

810
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,440
A dick sometimes,
but he's the reason you're here.

811
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,343
- You think I want this?

812
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,678
I have to make a choice between

813
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,313
The promise I made
to walter gillis

814
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:32,316
- Mike, walter gillis
doesn't give a sh--

815
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,417
About that promise anymore.

816
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,718
- Yeah, but I do,

817
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,687
And so do all the people
that work for him.

818
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,725
- So you're gonna do it.

819
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,462
- I don't know.

820
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,598
But I do know that I keep
having to do sh--y things

821
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,300
Just to win this thing,

822
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,302
But I'm gonna go make up
for one of them right now.

823
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,411
- I'm sorry I didn't do
what you asked me to do.

824
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,246
I should have evaluated
your ideas.

825
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,115
- You should have,

826
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:09,119
That you don't always do
what people expect of you.

827
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:11,321
- You mean what people
tell me to do.

828
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,323
- I chose the nicer version.

829
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,058
- Well, I, um...

830
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,094
I finished what I should
have done in the first place.

831
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,062
- And?
- And let's go through them.

832
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,133
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

833
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,401
I figured if I tried
to go upstairs,

834
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,669
You'd have me killed.

835
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,304
- Oh, is that a joke,
'cause I'm not laughing.

836
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:28,739
- Louis, I didn't say it
right the first time.

837
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,008
I want to say it again.
I'm sorry.

838
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,711
- You think "I'm sorry"
makes up for what you did?

839
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,180
- No, but I'm hoping
that we can move past it

840
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,082
And be friends again.

841
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,751
- Well, the only problem
with that is,

842
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,619
Is that you and I both know
that you're only here

843
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,187
Because I took away
your sugar daddy,

844
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:48,325
- Louis, if you don't want to
accept my apology, that's fine,

845
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,093
But I'm not here
from a position of weakness.

846
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,461
I'm here from
a position of strength.

847
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,796
- Bullsh--.
Where'd you get money?

848
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,197
You don't have any friends
out there.

849
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,466
- No, but harvey has enemies.

850
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,268
- What's that supposed to mean?

851
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,603
- You told me
these guys hold grudges.

852
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,172
I just found a guy
with one against harvey.

853
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,240
- You son of a bitch.

854
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:04,574
You didn't come here
to apologize.

855
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,076
You came here
to rub it in my face.

856
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,711
Oh, and I bet you just
can't wait to tell harvey

857
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,379
That I'm the one
who gave you the idea.

858
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,747
- Louis, I wasn't even
gonna tell you

859
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:11,748
How I got the idea at all.

860
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,083
I'm still not gonna tell harvey.

861
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,317
- Because you want me
to owe you?

862
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,685
- Because I'm not
as much of an asshole

863
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,454
As you think I am.

864
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:20,057
- What about a buyout?
- Never gonna happen.

865
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,658
He's got a golden parachute.

866
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,593
- Well, then I've got two people
on the board.

867
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,062
I can force a vote.

868
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,830
- You do that,
it triggers a stock split.

869
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,331
His shares double
in voting power.

870
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,333
Yours don't.
- I mean, that's all five.

871
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:33,203
None of them work.
- No, they don't.

872
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,771
- So when you told me
you should have

873
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,206
Evaluated my ideas first,

874
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,707
You weren't saying
that they were good.

875
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,110
- I was saying
I wasn't doing my job.

876
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,412
- Which was to let me
figure out for myself

877
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,780
That my ideas weren't good.

878
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,583
- I chose the nicer version.

879
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:51,455
Logan, there are plenty
of other companies out there.

880
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:52,756
- None that we're gonna find
in time

881
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,124
For my board meeting tomorrow.

882
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,125
- So push it.
- I can't.

883
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:58,328
I didn't call it.

884
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,097
- And I thought--
- yeah, I know.

885
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,632
That I only even arranged it
to spend time with you?

886
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:06,436
- No, and now they're gonna
ask me tomorrow

887
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,704
How gillis is going,

888
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,706
And I'm gonna have to tell them
we might lose,

889
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,475
And then they're gonna ask me
what else I have,

890
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,111
And I'm gonna have to
tell them nothing.

891
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,412
- Or maybe you won't.

892
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,581
- I told you,
I'm not in that business.

893
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,183
- Then convince the board
that you should be.

894
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,184
- Okay.

895
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,185
Go back to your office.

896
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,186
Get your files.

897
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:27,824
I don't always do
what people expect me to do.

898
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,237
- Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

899
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,738
- Of course.

900
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,442
- I heard about what you did
with gianopolous.

901
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:46,877
Good job.

902
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,647
- I appreciate that, harvey.

903
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,449
I do.

904
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,417
Um...

905
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,186
But it doesn't matter.

906
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,156
You know,
he went somewhere else.

907
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,491
- I know.

908
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,493
He went to forstman.

909
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,329
I just wanted to tell you
you did a good job anyway.

910
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,166
- See, that's the thing.

911
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,904
I didn't.

912
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,573
- What are you talking about?

913
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,778
- Mike got the idea from me.

914
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,483
- What?

915
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:27,751
How?

916
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,554
- When I cut him off
from gianopolous,

917
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:31,855
I stuck it in his face,

918
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:36,660
And I told him that
people hold grudges, and I--

919
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,528
He must have known
your history with forstman,

920
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,297
And that's why he went to him,
so...

921
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,703
I'm sorry.

922
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,505
- God damn it, louis.

923
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:51,541
I don't want to keep
being mad at you,

924
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,777
But you keep doing
the same sh--.

925
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,679
- But, see, this wasn't me
being duped.

926
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:59,616
- No, it was you
letting your emotions

927
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:02,519
Lead you into
doing something stupid.

928
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,721
Again.

929
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,857
You just had to
stick it in his face.

930
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,261
You know what?

931
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,330
I'm done.

932
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,566
- It's not fair,
you know.

933
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:25,242
I'm emotional.
You're cold.

934
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:28,445
You're loved,

935
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,913
And I'm hated.

936
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,784
- Louis, if I was so cold,

937
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:38,255
I wouldn't have come here
in the first place.

938
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,436
- Pouring us a drink.

939
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,605
- Cahill took the deal.

940
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,774
- All seven cases
are officially dead.

941
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:04,547
Jessica, I'm sorry that I didn't
come clean with you before.

942
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,683
- Me too.

943
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,386
- Lying to you
was a business decision,

944
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,588
And it was wrong,

945
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,924
That I would never lie to you,
man to woman.

946
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,328
- I appreciate that.

947
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,932
- We have a problem.

948
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,901
I just got off the phone
with richard coleman.

949
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,836
Last week,
sean cahill asked him

950
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,738
If I'd ever crossed any lines
in his presence.

951
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,973
- Son of a bitch.

952
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,641
He doesn't want our clients
to leave us.

953
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,810
- He wants them
to cough up dirt on me.

954
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,979
- At least none of them did,
or we'd be in trouble right now.

955
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,448
- How do you want to handle it?
- Let's talk about it tomorrow.

956
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,650
Right now, I've got
something else to do.

957
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,385
- Sh--.

958
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,721
They wouldn't turn on harvey.

959
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,923
Cahill wanted us
to drop those cases anyway,

960
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,525
And I just did him a big favor.

961
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,427
- You couldn't have known that.

962
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:52,662
- It was my job to know that.

963
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,436
- Hey, mike?

964
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,838
- Yeah.
- Harvey specter's here to--

965
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,341
- Harvey, what can I do for you?

966
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,778
- I wanted to thank you
for the recordings.

967
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,648
- Is that why you came
all the way down here?

968
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,917
- I came to tell you I think
you're making a big mistake

969
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,119
Getting into bed with forstman.
- I knew it.

970
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:19,823
- You could have thanked me
for those recordings days ago,

971
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,791
But instead you picked
the exact day

972
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,093
That I find a new investor
to show up

973
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:24,961
With your thank-you
and your friendly advice.

974
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,563
- This isn't some move.

975
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,398
- You only make moves.
- Mike.

976
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,466
- Hey, tell me right now

977
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,767
That you wouldn't do
the same thing

978
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:31,768
If you were in my position.

979
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,537
- I was.

980
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,538
And I did.

981
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,040
What?

982
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,075
You think our grudge
is about some car?

983
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,944
- What the hell
are you talking about?

984
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:43,580
- When I was younger,
I made a shady deal with him,

985
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,515
And I paid for it.
- Who says that I'm making--

986
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:46,683
- If you haven't, you will,

987
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,785
Because forstman
doesn't throw money around

988
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,453
Without getting something
in return.

989
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:51,921
- He's gonna get money
in return.

990
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,490
- Money is third on his list.

991
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,158
The first two
are getting back at people

992
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,493
And getting control of people.

993
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:59,763
Before you had louis
cut me off from gianopolous,

994
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:02,065
Because now I have
no other choice!

995
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,174
- You always have a choice.

996
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,519
- Here's to turning around
piedmont avionics.

997
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,889
What?

998
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:28,425
- Nothing.

999
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,793
What time is it?

1000
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:33,530
- Too late for you
to change your mind.

1001
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:36,599
Logan, the board
is going to be wowed.

1002
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,535
- Well, I wish I had
your confidence.

1003
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:41,938
- You are not short
in the confidence department.

1004
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,140
- Oh, you don't have to
pay me compliments.

1005
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,776
- I meant it as an insult.

1006
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,945
- You know, if this law thing
doesn't work out--

1007
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,080
- Then I could have a career
in venture capital?

1008
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:54,083
- No, I was gonna say
you could be my assistant.

1009
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,186
- Hilarious.

1010
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,822
- Seriously, rachel, I--

1011
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,924
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1012
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:03,760
- Yes, you could have.

1013
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,228
It just wouldn't have been
as good.

1014
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,931
- Humility.

1015
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,766
Another thing I love about you.

1016
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,619
- Logan, I should go.

1017
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:30,820
- Rachel, I--

1018
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,622
- Um...

1019
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,893
Good luck tomorrow.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
