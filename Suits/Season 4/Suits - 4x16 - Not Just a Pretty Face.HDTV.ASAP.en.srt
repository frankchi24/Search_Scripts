- Jessica, you were right.

Effective immediately,
I'm tendering my resignation.

4
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:10,665
Forstman
doesn't throw money around

5
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,383
without getting something
in return.

6
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,419
He's gonna get money
in return.

7
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:15,420
Money is third on his list.

8
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:17,222
The first two are
getting back at people

9
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:18,806
and getting control of people.

10
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:19,807

Yep.

After Woodall lost his job,

Forstman got him installed
at the SEC.

Where's the proof?

that in a few years,

Then why?

109
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,469
Because I'm gonna be
an actress,

110
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,913
and I want somebody
who understands

111
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:29,223
that there's more to life
than just the DA's office.

And that I can give my all
to them

00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:32,727

So you're stepping out

Yes, but
the important thing is,

I-I know what you meant.

126
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,509
What you really meant is that
you weren't expecting

127
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:06,878

He can't find the money

140

where the money went.

And why can't we tell
Cahill that?

00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:51,775
Louis, I got your note,

163
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,577
and I know that Norma's
still out,

164
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,112
but I really
don't have time to--

165
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:57,497
Norma's dead.

166
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:58,615
What?

167
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,630
She died this morning
taking care of her sister.

168
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,754
Oh, Louis,
I'm so sorry.

169
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:04,921
You don't need to fake it,
Donna.

170
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,039
I'm not faking it.

171
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
She was a sweet woman.

172
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,959
She was a frickin' battle-ax
is what she was.

173
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:11,178
There wasn't a day that went by
that I didn't want to rip out

174
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:13,295
one of her varicose veins
and strangle her with it.

175
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:14,708
Okay, I don't think
you're in touch

176
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:16,366
with how you're really feeling
right now.

177
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,301
How I'm feeling
is that she left me high and dry

178
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:19,469
just like she always did.

179
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:21,271
You expect her
to keep working?

180
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:22,856
Look at this.

181
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,608
It's her entire estate
laid out on paper.

182
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:25,942
She couldn't manage
my calendar,

183
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:28,227
but this crap fest she plans
within an inch of her life.

184
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,146
And you want me to make sure

185
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,364
these things
are bequeathed properly?

186
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:32,816
You can stuff them in
a giant piñata for all I care.

187
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,034
I have to go find
the perfect urn

188
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,619
to throw her ashes
off the top of the building.

189
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:36,737
She requested that?

190
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,378
No, she wanted them
to be in here with me,

191
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:39,656
but like hell
I'm gonna do that.

192
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,742
Okay, Louis, I will
take care of this for you,

193
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,910
but you're not throwing
her ashes anywhere without me.

194
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:45,212
Okay, fine.

195
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,713
Do you want me to smooth things
over with Harvey for you?

196
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:48,582
No.

197
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,385
Harvey will be just fine
on his own.

198
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,174
I know who you are,
and I'm not interested.

199
00:07:57,341 --> 00:07:59,426
Just 'cause I got
a bad reputation?

200
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,844
Because I'm not accepting
a drink

201
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:02,479
for putting your rival
behind bars.

202
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:03,980
You got the wrong idea, pal.

203
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:06,683
I didn't buy you that
for putting my enemy away.

204
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,986
I bought you that
for<i> how</i> you put my enemy away.

205
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,521
Okay, you got me.

206
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,324
What are you talking about?

207
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,409
You.

208
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,861
You've got something special.

209
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:19,555
And I want people
with something special

210
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,914
working for me.

211
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:21,998
Why exactly would I want
to work for you?

212
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:23,533
I can think of
a million reasons,

213
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,702
'cause that's the signing bonus
I'm gonna give you,

214
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:26,870
and that's a hell of
a lot more money

215
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,255
than you're ever gonna make
as a lawyer.

216
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:29,372
And what if I told you

217
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:30,733
I don't practice law
to make money?

218
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,877
Then I'd ask you,
what do you practice it for?

219
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,929
To bend people to my will.

220
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,382
Then bend people to your will
for me

221
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:41,802
and make a lot of money
on top of it.

222
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,471
Well, here's the thing,
Mr. Forstman.

223
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:45,915
Not that
it's any of your business,

224
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:49,059
but I'll be making 1/2 million
a year in no time.

225
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:50,811
1/2 million a year is dick.

226
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,863
My gardener makes that.

227
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,314
Then go offer your gardener
a job,

228
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,066
because I'm not interested.

229
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,703
Just so you know, if you change
your mind and come back to me,

230
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,239
it's not gonna be
the same conversation.

231
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:05,625
Thanks for the drink.
Good luck, Mr. Forstman.

232
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,581
Okay.

233
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,666
What are you doing?

234
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,084
What do you think I'm doing?

235
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:16,336
If Forstman gave the money
to someone Woodall's close to,

236
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,638
we need to start
by compiling a family tree.

237
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:21,391
I meant why aren't you
at school today?

238
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:25,011
Because I'm gonna prove
to Harvey that I exist.

239
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,263
Okay.

240
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,981
Now that you mention it,
what was that last night?

241
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,349
Ever since you came back,

242
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:31,685
it's like you and Harvey
speak this secret language,

243
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:32,686
and I'm not a part of it.

244
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,237
Rachel, come on.
We have history.

245
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,595
I'm not talking about history.
I'm talking about respect.

246
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:37,858
Okay, you don't know
what you're talking about

247
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,192
if you think
Harvey doesn't respect you.

248
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,327
Are you gonna tell me
that last night

249
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:41,578
he didn't give you a look
that said,

250
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,163
"You don't need to tell her
the full story

251
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,601
because she doesn't need
to know"?

252
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:46,025
Rachel, he didn't give me
that look

253
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,200
because he doesn't respect you.

254
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:51,004
He gave me that look
because he's ashamed.

255
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,455
What are you talking about?

256
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:56,793
Let's just say that
I'm not the only one

257
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,128
that Charles Forstman duped.

258
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:00,597
- Harvey got taken by Forstman?
- Yes.

259
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:01,965
And he only told me
because he had to

260
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,099
when we were in the middle
of that takeover battle.

261
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:07,637
That's why Harvey's so slow
to care about anybody.

262
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:10,557
Forstman used somebody
he cared about.

263
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:12,776
Holy shit.
I never even thought about that.

264
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,977
Who do you think it was?

265
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:17,147
I don't know,
but I have a pretty good guess.

266
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,649
Well, what do you think?

267
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,785
I think this place is a dump,
and I'm busy,

268
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:24,120
so why don't you tell me
why we're here?

269
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,485
I want to open
a restaurant here.

270
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,324
Marcus, there's already
a restaurant here.

271
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:28,909
And it isn't working.

272
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,578
Which is why they're gonna
lose their lease.

273
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:33,046
Take a look.

274
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,215
I've got a chef.

275
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,666
I've got a liquor license.

276
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,168
I've got renovation plans.

277
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:40,971
I have everything I need.

278
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:43,173
Except the money.

279
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:44,591
I need $150,000.

280
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,259
- Are you crazy?
- Come on, Harvey.

281
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,561
This is my dream.

282
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:48,895
I know I can make this work.

283
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:50,013
And I'm not saying you can't,

284
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,014
but I don't have
that kind of money.

285
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:53,183
What are you talking about?

286
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,569
You're the big-time lawyer who
just got his name in the paper.

287
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:58,355
My name in the paper
doesn't pay me extra money.

288
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:00,323
I make $50,000 a year.

289
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:02,242
And you said you were gonna be
a corporate lawyer.

290
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,400
Yeah, and when I am,
I can help you, but right now--

291
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,746
I don't give a shit
about right now.

292
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,531
I give a shit about when
you were supposed to be

293
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,866
my big brother, but instead,
what did you do?

294
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,034
I know what I did.

295
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:12,702
Then you know
I can never get a loan

296
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,120
for as long as I live.

297
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,422
Marcus, when are you gonna
take responsibility

298
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:16,673
for your own shit?

299
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:18,677
What the hell does it look like
I'm trying to do?

300
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:27,550
I came to you first because
I know you'd want me to,

301
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:30,353
but if you don't come through,

302
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:31,855
I'm gonna go to Mom.

303
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,139
You don't mean Mom.

304
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:34,557
You mean him.

305
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,476
And you're not taking
a nickel from that man.

306
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,111
Taking his money
isn't gonna make

307
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:39,729
what he did to Dad any worse.

308
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,564
That's bullshit,
and you know it,

309
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,700
and I'm not gonna
let you do it.

310
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:45,402
Hey, Harvey.

311
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,487
How the hell
are you gonna stop me?

312
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:55,795
Am I crazy,

313
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,414
or is that the same dress
you were wearing

314
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:59,082
the last time I saw you?

315
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:00,216
You must be crazy,

316
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,885
because I don't wear
the same dress ever.

317
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:04,587
Then you must spend a fortune
on wardrobe.

318
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:08,091
But I have to say,
it's worth it.

319
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:10,927
I suddenly get the feeling
this isn't just a drop-by.

320
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,762
I want to move up
our timeline.

321
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,564
Harvey, we have a deal.

322
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,929
I put myself on the line
for you,

323
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:18,435
and our deal
is not going to change.

324
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:20,103
I could just pay you
the money back and move on.

325
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,188
And if you could do that,
you wouldn't be here

326
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:23,406
asking to come back.

327
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,692
How much money
did Marcus lose this time?

328
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,976
He didn't lose anything.
He wants to start a restaurant.

329
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,163
He doesn't want
to start shit.

330
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,448
He owes somebody something.

331
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,616
You don't know that.
He's turned his life around.

332
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,702
What I know is,
he has a problem,

333
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:38,838
and he's looking
to get money from you.

334
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,591
And you're not gonna get it
from me.

335
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:44,961
Then I'll get it
somewhere else.

336
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,763
And what's that
supposed to mean?

337
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:50,383
I got a job offer
from Charles Forstman.

338
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,602
Look at me.

339
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,304
I don't care
what he's offering you.

340
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:55,305
Don't take it.

341
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:56,940
Because he's got
a bad reputation?

342
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:57,974
You think I don't know that?

343
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,225
I think there are
a lot of things

344
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
you think you know
that you don't.

345
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,028
What I know is,
you're either gonna help me

346
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,480
or Charles Forstman is.

347
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:05,615
It's up to you.

348
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,234
Harvey, I can't make you
listen to me,

349
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,904
but what I'm not going to do
is let you come here

350
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,598
and leverage me
with some bullshit offer

351
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:15,458
from a shady banker,
so do what you're gonna do.

352
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,711
But don't say
I didn't warn you.

353
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:33,721
You can buy all the Wonder Bread
you want, Eric,

354
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,272
but you can't take it with you
to prison.

355
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,690
What are you doing here?

356
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:39,109
I'm here to remind you
that once they find the money,

357
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,978
it's all gonna come
tumbling down.

358
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:42,582
Well, they're not gonna
find the money,

359
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,732
'cause there is no money.

360
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,285
Not in your accounts,
but I know what Cahill doesn't.

361
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:50,237
Forstman gave it to somebody
you care about,

362
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:51,789
and if I tell him that,
it'll be too late.

363
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:53,240
I know what
you're trying to do.

364
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,876
You're trying to bait me
into moving the body.

365
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,128
We both know you're not
dumb enough to do that.

366
00:13:58,246 --> 00:13:59,663
I'm here to get you
to cut a deal

367
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:00,914
and turn Forstman in.

368
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,500
You don't have the authority
to cut a deal.

369
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:06,587
No, but I can get Cahill to

370
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,306
after you hire me
to represent you.

371
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:12,643
You mean hire the fox
to watch the henhouse?

372
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,761
Not a chance.

373
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:16,313
Eric, they're closing in,

374
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,932
and when they do,
you're gonna want to call me.

375
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,585
So why don't you
take my card?

376
00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:34,498
This is ridiculous.

377
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,016
Woodall's got 30 people
it could be,

378
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:36,950
or it could be none of them.

379
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,119
I know that,
but this is our job.

380
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:43,173
No, our job is to help Harvey
get Forstman.

381
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,211
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking--

382
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:46,276
I am, and you are too.

383
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,361
Rachel, we are never
gonna get Harvey

384
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,485
to go after Forstman
for what they did 12 years ago.

385
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:50,781
Why, because of his brother?

386
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:53,434
Yes, because of his brother,
or because he's ashamed.

387
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,202
Either way, he knows
it's a possibility.

388
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:57,171
He doesn't need me
to tell him about it.

389
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,757
No, he just doesn't need<i> me</i>
to tell him about it.

390
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,792
- Rachel--
- This is not about that.

391
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:04,178
Look, I can't tell him

392
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,213
because I'm not supposed
to know, but you can.

393
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:08,215
And I just told you,
he doesn't want to hear it.

394
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,990
And when has that ever
stopped you before?

395
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:11,268
- This is different.
- Why?

396
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:14,388
Because he's ashamed.

397
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,940
Then he's not
thinking right,

398
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,977
and he needs your help
more than ever.

399
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,897
Then we're both telling him.

400
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:25,282
Mike, I don't need
the credit.

401
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,735
No, this isn't about credit.
This is about us.

402
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:30,487
He can't tell me something
and expect me not to tell you.

403
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,076
You wanted to see me?

404
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:37,544
Yes.
Where have you been all day?

405
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:39,747
Why? Is there something
you want to talk about?

406
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:40,831
Yeah, where you've been.

407
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:42,416
Sean Cahill was at my door
last night--

408
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,834
Harvey, Norma passed away.

409
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:45,386
I've been helping Louis.

410
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:47,504
Norma died?

411
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:49,223
That's terrible.

412
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,620
I thought
you couldn't stand her.

413
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:54,144
I couldn't, but I assume
Louis loved her, so...

414
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,562
- Do what you need to do.
- Oh.

415
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:57,948
Because she was his secretary,
he must have loved her.

416
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:02,503
- That's not what I meant.
- But it is what you said.

417
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,238
Okay, Donna.
What's wrong?

418
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,689
How about we start
with the fact

419
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,041
that I have been wondering
for the last ten hours

420
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,461
if you're going to acknowledge
what happened last night.

421
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,179
But you're you,
so of course you're not.

422
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:13,367
I'm not gonna acknowledge it

423
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:14,798
because nothing happened
last night.

424
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:16,967
Why?
And don't tell me I know why.

425
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:19,171
Because it would have been
a mistake, and you know it.

426
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,388
What I know is
something happened,

427
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:23,891
and you ran away, but not before
you told me you loved me.

428
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,811
I did that because I wanted
to make you feel better.

429
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,446
What did you
just say to me?

430
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:31,148
That's not what I meant.
I didn't say that--

431
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:32,592
Because you pity me?
Yeah, you did.

432
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,701
No, I said it
because I love you,

433
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:35,702
and I wanted you to know it.

434
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,070
Love me how?

435
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,907
- Why does that have to--
- Love me how?

436
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,244
That's what I thought.

437
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:46,029
You either can't answer
or you won't,

438
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:47,898
which is bullshit,
because obviously,

439
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,249
you don't just look at me
this way.

440
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,301
You're capable of looking at me
that way,

441
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,202
but you don't want to let
those worlds collide

442
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:54,774
because you're afraid
to risk anything.

443
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:55,906
Because we have everything.

444
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,724
No, Harvey.
<i>You</i> have everything.

445
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,409
So you're saying
you want everything?

446
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,311
I don't know, Harvey,

447
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:05,132
but what I do know is
I don't want your pity.

00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:24,668
I do.

451
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,794
Hold on a second.
Let me turn this off.

A monthly ritual
to remind myself.

454
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,116
Of what?

455
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,451
Of what a pussy
Gordon Gekko is.

456
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:45,439
Now, you want to tell me
what changed your mind?

457
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:46,890
I decided
I wanted the money.

458
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,308
And you turned me down,

459
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:52,679
so now you're gonna tell me
why you want the money.

460
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:55,399
My brother needs $150,000
for a restaurant.

Hmm.
Now we're getting somewhere.

462
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:00,621
Let's have it.

463
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,239
Okay, you want it?

00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,409
Here it is.

It's not just a restaurant.
It's a second chance.

Marcus has

00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,153
Mm-hmm.

469
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:18,322
And you think
this is his way out?

470
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:19,323
I know it is.

471
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:22,209
Hmm.

472
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:23,994
We're not a good fit,

473
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,796
'cause restaurants fail,

474
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,465
and when this one does,
you'll leave.

475
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,003
So you might as well leave
right now.

476
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:34,267
Then how about
we bet on it?

477
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,689
You're gonna gamble
on something

478
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,841
to get your brother
out of a gambling problem?

479
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,844
- I didn't say I had a problem.
- I think maybe you do.

480
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:43,847
When you always win,
it's not a problem.

481
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:49,603
I think
I might like you, pal.

482
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:58,695
Louis.

483
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,113
I got your message.
What's going on?

484
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:01,748
What's going on is,
they're trying to screw me,

485
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:02,749
and I need you to be bad cop.

486
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:03,867
What?

487
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,268
Have you made a decision, sir?

488
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,455
No, I haven't made a decision,
you shyster dealer of death.

489
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,674
Okay, I think maybe
we're gonna need another minute.

490
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:11,959
No, we don't.

491
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,413
I don't need another minute
to see

492
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:14,962
that this looks like a pot
from Home Depot,

493
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:16,446
this looks like a lamp
from Motel 6,

494
00:19:16,464 --> 00:19:18,849
and this looks like
a goddamn howitzer shell.

495
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,717
You are lucky that I don't take
this mockery

496
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:23,186
of a final resting place
and shove it up your ass.

497
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:25,105
- Louis, that's enough.
- No, it's not enough.

498
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:27,107
I've been handling this bullshit
for two days

499
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:29,476
for a woman who's supposed to be
handling things for me.

500
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:30,727
Louis, this isn't
about the urn.

501
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:32,692
Oh, please don't give me
that touchy-feely shit.

502
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,897
And why the hell
are you not being bad cop?

503
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:35,312
Because that's not
what's needed.

504
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,900
Oh, bullshit
it's not what's needed.

505
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,402
- Louis.
- You don't care about me.

506
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:39,953
You never cared about me.

507
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:42,406
All you care about
is yourself...

508
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,375
and your stupid sister
and your Hummel figurines

509
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,077
and your<i> Murder, She Wrote</i>
reruns.

510
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:48,745
Louis, I'm not Norma.

511
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:53,083
She's gone...

512
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:54,251
and it's gonna be okay.

513
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:56,253
She was a battle-ax!

514
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,430
But she was my battle-ax.

515
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:09,149
I know. I know.

516
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,151
Oh, she didn't just leave me
high and dry.

517
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:12,769
She left me for good.

518
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:14,571
I'm so sorry.

519
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,773
It's okay.

520
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,861
Both of you?

521
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,079
We both work for you.

522
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:23,523
Which is why we're both here
to say

523
00:20:23,614 --> 00:20:26,783
maybe it's time
we explore other options.

524
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:27,868
You got to be kidding me.

525
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:28,785
You spent two days on this,

526
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,440
and you're ready
to throw in the towel?

527
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:31,788
We've spent two
of our five days on it,

528
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,006
and we still don't have
a name,

529
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:35,125
so we think
it's time to consider--

530
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,259
What?

531
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:38,128
Going after Forstman

532
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:39,856
for whatever he did to you
12 years ago.

533
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:43,216
- You told her?
- Yes, I did.

534
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:45,218
Because like I said,
we both work for you.

535
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:46,636
Which means
we both want to help.

536
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,801
You think I haven't wondered
how to go after Forstman

537
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,126
100 times
in the last dozen years?

538
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:51,141
Then why don't you?

539
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,715
Because I'm not the only one
at risk.

540
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,362
You mean your brother.

541
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,613
Yes, I do.

542
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:58,065
And I'm not gonna bring him
into this,

543
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:59,566
because he didn't do
anything wrong.

544
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,151
Harvey, I'm not saying--

545
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,236
Did you hear me?

546
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:04,905
He doesn't just have a gun
to my head, okay?

547
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:06,109
He's got one
to my brother's.

548
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:07,324
And how many times
have you told me

549
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:08,909
that when someone has
a gun to your head,

550
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:09,910
you figure
a different way out?

551
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,728
This is Charles Forstman.

552
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:13,547
- There is no other way out.
- Harvey, there's--

553
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:15,832
I gave you a job to do.
Now do your goddamn job.

554
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,106
Well, that was a bust.

555
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:29,486
- We had to try.
- Did we?

556
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:30,604
I told you he'd be pissed off,
and he was.

557
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,156
Yeah, and you also told me
he needed to hear things

558
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:33,157
that he didn't want to hear.

559
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:34,575
Okay, well,
now all he heard is,

560
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,577
not only can't he trust me,
he can't trust you either.

561
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,162
That's not what he heard,
and you know it.

562
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,159
What he heard was that
you're the closest person

563
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,198
in the world to me,

564
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,583
I am never gonna
keep things from you,

565
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,284
and I'm not the only one
in his corner.

566
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,370
I'm the closest person
in the world to you.

567
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:47,421
Of course you are.
How can you even--

568
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:48,539
I'm not questioning it.

569
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:51,291
I'm the closest person
in the world to you,

570
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:54,461
and I wouldn't be
on your family tree.

571
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,462
You're talking
about Woodall.

572
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,797
Yes, I'm talking
about Woodall.

573
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,599
Woodall's married.
We checked his wife. Nothing.

574
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,134
That's the thing.
We're not married.

575
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:01,635
Okay, I really don't think this
is the time to bring that up.

576
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,020
I'm being serious.

577
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:04,555
We've exhausted every person
that's related to him.

578
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,274
Maybe it's time
we found someone who isn't.

579
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,029
- That's genius.
- Thank you.

580
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:15,566
Now I really don't understand
why Harvey doesn't respect you.

581
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
It's too soon.

582
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,536
It's too soon
for that joke.

583
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:21,038
Too soon.

584
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:27,077
I can have any one?

585
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,629
Take your pick.

586
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:30,497
It doesn't matter,
'cause you're gonna lose.

587
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:31,665
That's funny.

588
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,467
I look at it like
I'm gonna win twice.

589
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:36,670
I get to drive a badass car,
and I get to kick your ass.

590
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,555
Cocky. I like that.

591
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,433
A guy like you,
I'm surprised you could stand

592
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:42,593
working for Cameron Dennis
in the first place.

593
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,447
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't like cocky.

594
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,730
Take, for instance,
what's-his-name--DuPont?

595
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,365
What's he up for?
Tax evasion?

596
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:49,916
- Insider trading.
- Yeah, whatever.

597
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,786
The point is, after
what you did the other day,

598
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,188
why aren't you leading that?

599
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,506
Because this is Cameron's case.

600
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,192
If I were him,
it'd be yours.

601
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,928
Harvey,
you are his star player,

602
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:03,197
and he's not even putting you
in the game.

603
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,199
And on top of that,
he didn't have the balls

604
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,751
to announce whether
he's going after DuPont or not.

605
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,326
Don't you worry
about Cameron Dennis.

606
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:13,690
DuPont's gonna get
what's coming to him.

607
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:15,526
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

608
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:18,028
What are you talking about?

609
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:19,196
Well, you're loyal to the guy
you work for.

610
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,231
I like that.

611
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,886
So you were just
talking shit about him

612
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,901
to see if I'd jump on board?

613
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,737
And you didn't...

614
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:29,656
which is why
we don't have to race anymore.

615
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,741
You're saying I got the job?

616
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:33,894
I'm saying welcome
to the team.

617
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:35,779
Well, that's all
well and good, Charles,

618
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,564
but we're still racing.

619
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,782
We sure as hell are.

620
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,984
We just have to find
something else to bet on.

621
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:44,278
Hey, Sean.
Good to see you.

622
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,539
Don't give me that shit.

623
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,574
Did you confront Eric Woodall
yesterday morning

624
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,575
at his supermarket?

625
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,227
I ran into him
by accident.

626
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:51,578
I like the produce there.

627
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,180
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

628
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,016
Did you approach the subject
of an SEC investigation

629
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,735
with the express purpose
of intimidating him?

630
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,804
I approached him
with the express purpose

631
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:02,055
of hiring me
as his lawyer.

632
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,340
Why the hell
would you do that?

633
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,621
You're supposed to be
helping me.

634
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,310
And if he's willing to
admit what he did,

635
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:07,427
that is helping you.

636
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:08,628
And instead,
he's claiming that

637
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,430
I sent you there
to intimidate him.

638
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:12,205
Then I guess
that's the way it's breaking.

639
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:13,567
What the hell
are you talking about?

640
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,131
He's either gonna buy
what I'm selling

641
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:16,436
or cover his tracks.

642
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,439
And if he covers his tracks,
you need to be there.

643
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:20,991
Are you asking me
to follow him?

644
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:22,776
No, I'm telling you
to follow him.

645
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,661
I can't do that.
I don't have authorization.

646
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,330
Didn't stop you
following me.

647
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,248
Enough.

648
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,201
He's filing charges
of harassment against me.

649
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,786
We do this,
nothing sticks.

650
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,122
Then we might not get him,
because I have nothing.

651
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,170
Well, let me give you
a little extra motivation.

652
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,792
Remember,
Woodall knows all about

653
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,961
Louis Litt's
little Forstman transgression.

654
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:43,347
So if he gets exonerated,

655
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:46,550
who do you think's gonna be
the first person he goes after?

656
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:48,719
So, instead of going to Jersey
for your produce,

657
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,387
go get me something
I can use.

658
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,402
You're having a drink
by yourself?

659
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,654
What's going on?

660
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,122
What's going on is,

661
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,328
I just finished having them
scrape Jeff's name off his door.

662
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:16,382
So why don't you tell me
why you're here, Harvey?

663
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:18,215
Cahill's having trouble
getting evidence

664
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,493
against Forstman and Woodall.

665
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,801
I'm aware of that.

666
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:23,086
Then you should also be aware
that if Woodall keeps his job,

667
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:24,471
he's likely to go after Louis.

668
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,890
I could've done that math,
and so could you, so...

669
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:30,928
I might be able to
help them get Forstman...

670
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,397
on something else.

671
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:34,932
Does this have
something to do

672
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,351
with when he offered you
that job 12 years ago?

673
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,820
Yes.

674
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,313
I told you
that man was trouble.

675
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,826
And I told you
I wouldn't abandon Marcus

676
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,195
and you were wrong
about him.

677
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:49,913
So this has something to do
with Marcus.

678
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,583
Yes, it does.

679
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:56,586
Well, if you are asking me
to choose

680
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:59,172
between your brother and Louis,
you know who I'm choosing.

681
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,841
I'm not asking you
to do that.

682
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:01,925
Then what are you asking?

683
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,712
I want your help
to get my mind right.

684
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,716
Here's the thing, Harvey.

685
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,552
Jeff's gone,

686
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,555
and he's gone
because of the choices I made.

687
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:20,894
So I'm not sure if I can
help you get your mind right,

688
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,213
'cause right now...

689
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:25,415
mine's not right.

690
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:34,074
Hang on a sec.

691
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,208
Hey.

692
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:37,494
Hey.

693
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:39,997
You didn't come down here
just to give me my start date.

694
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:41,298
I came down here to tell you

695
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,776
I think
you have something special,

696
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,835
and I'd love nothing more
than to have you on my desk,

697
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:48,255
but I'm leaving
the DA's office.

698
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,419
Does this have something to do
with that Forstman guy

699
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:51,785
buying you a drink
the other night?

700
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,427
I thought you didn't know
who he was.

701
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,671
Well, I looked him up

702
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,230
because I thought
I was gonna be working for you.

703
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,483
And I'm telling you,
he's shady.

704
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,920
Because he's got
a bad reputation?

705
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:04,154
I don't care
what his reputation is.

706
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:07,491
You don't know this about me
yet, but I know people...

707
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:09,242
usually better
than they know themselves.

708
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,329
And the same way
I know you are a good person,

709
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,581
I can tell you that man
is rotten to the core.

710
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,099
You're just trying
to get me to stay

711
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:16,950
so you can work at my desk.

712
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,870
Listen to me.

713
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,873
I don't care whether
I work on your desk or not.

714
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,008
You're making a mistake
if you take a job with that man.

715
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:26,446
Then I guess
I'm making a mistake,

716
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,378
because I already did.

717
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,181
It was nice
knowing you, Donna.

718
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,524
So you're keeping her here
after all.

719
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:45,562
Yeah, I couldn't throw her
off the roof

720
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:46,646
after you got me to cry.

721
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,198
I'm glad.

722
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:49,566
Donna, I can't thank you enough
for what you did.

723
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,652
Oh, you're welcome,
Louis.

724
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,456
The truth is, I needed this
more than you know.

725
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,158
Well, I get it.

726
00:27:58,242 --> 00:27:59,242
You needed a distraction

727
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,628
after everything
you just went through.

728
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:04,214
Uh, yeah.
Something like that.

729
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:06,666
Truth is,

730
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,002
I could use a distraction
myself.

731
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,971
Well, there is one thing
that you still need to do.

732
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:15,142
You need to start thinking
about a new secretary.

733
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:18,645
Donna, I know
I've asked you this before,

734
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,897
but we're so much closer now
than we were then, and--

735
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:22,649
Louis, I work for Harvey.

736
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,184
You know
I can't be your secretary.

737
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:28,488
But we have this bond...

738
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,240
you and I.

739
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:32,909
Shakespeare,
the gun club.

740
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:35,187
We've always spoken the same
language, and you know it.

741
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:36,530
Louis, I can't.

742
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,165
I get it.

743
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,752
We're better as friends.

744
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,589
Hey.

745
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:48,625
How about I set up
a little farewell for Norma

746
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,878
as my last official act
as your interim secretary?

747
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:56,383
Thank you, Donna.

748
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,415
Are you sure
we've got the right address?

749
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,917
I'm positive.

750
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,091
I'll be right back.

751
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:14,719
Can I help you?

752
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,285
Uh, yes, is there
a Mary Ann McGrath here?

753
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:18,452
Who can I say is asking?

754
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,820
We're with
Pearson Specter Litt.

755
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:22,039
We'd like to speak with her
in regards to an ongoing case.

756
00:29:22,157 --> 00:29:23,574
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

757
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:25,659
You just said she was here.
I don't understand--

758
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:27,661
Mary Ann has
advanced Alzheimer's.

759
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,246
But she's 55.

760
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:32,249
It's early onset, and hers is
particularly aggressive.

761
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:33,384
I'm sorry.

762
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:34,418
Can I ask how long
she's been a patient?

763
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:35,986
We're not supposed to
disclose any--

764
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:39,006
Please.
It's really important.

765
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,940
She was moved her
about a year and a half ago.

766
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:42,009
And before that?

767
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,844
I don't really know,

768
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:46,430
but I don't think
she was getting the best care.

769
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:49,266
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

770
00:29:56,274 --> 00:30:00,027
My mother's 55.

771
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:02,446
You know, and if she's only here
because Forstman pays for it--

772
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
I know.

773
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:04,832
Harvey wants us to find

774
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,250
the person
Woodall's close to.

775
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:07,334
That's all we can do.

776
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:08,502
Well, "all we can do"

777
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,540
is gonna send her back
to some horrible facility.

778
00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:12,268
- We don't exactly know that.
- Yes, we do.

779
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,959
Rachel, it's terrible.

780
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:17,344
I don't like it
any more than you do,

781
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:19,596
but it's not up to us.

782
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,433
I know.

783
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:25,969
It just sucks.

784
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:28,889
You goddamn liar.

785
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:30,891
Oh, don't be mad.

786
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:33,143
Yeah, Conchita tells everybody
I'm not home.

787
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:34,728
You know what
I'm talking about.

788
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:36,864
DuPont Investments
dropped through the floor today,

789
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:38,148
and you sold short

790
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:40,901
based on something
that I told you in confidence.

791
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:42,953
I don't recall you telling me
anything at all.

792
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:44,071
You son of a bitch.

793
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:45,823
You made over $100 million
on that trade.

794
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:47,374
Yeah, I did.

795
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,159
Welcome
to the real world, pal.

796
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,795
My real world doesn't involve
befriending young attorneys

797
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:53,380
to get inside information.

798
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:55,833
Maybe you're not the right man
for me after all.

799
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,718
You think I still want
to work for you after this?

800
00:30:57,836 --> 00:30:59,420
You wanted competition
and money.

801
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:02,339
You got the competition.

802
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:03,507
Here's your money.

803
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,642
You can shove that $1 million
up your ass,

804
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:07,845
because I'm not only
not taking your job,

805
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:09,063
I'm gonna prosecute you.

806
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,300
Then you might as well
add your name to the indictment

807
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,350
since you've already
shared in the profits.

808
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:14,852
What are you talking about?

809
00:31:14,936 --> 00:31:16,353
Take a look at this check.

810
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:18,238
It's not $1 million.

811
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:21,024
It's 850,000.

812
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,861
Bet you can guess where
the other $150,000 went.

813
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:24,995
What did you do?

814
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:27,664
You know what I did.

815
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:29,533
Marcus had nothing to do
with this.

816
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,702
He wouldn't have had you said
yes right away.

817
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:32,786
But you didn't.

818
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:34,621
We're giving you
the money back.

819
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:36,540
You're gonna break
his little heart.

820
00:31:36,674 --> 00:31:38,509
He thinks that money
came from you.

821
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:41,879
And you snatch cash out
of an addicted gambler's hands,

822
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:43,464
take away his dream,

823
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:45,299
only one way
that story ends.

824
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:48,268
So you can either
pout about it...

825
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:51,388
or you can embrace it and
prove to everyone I was right

826
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:54,608
when I said I saw
something special in you.

827
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:57,561
Someday the shoe's gonna be
on the other foot, Charles.

828
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:00,314
Words spoken by every loser
I've ever met.

829
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:02,533
See you around, pal.

830
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:13,043
It's Woodall's first wife.

831
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:14,962
Her name's Mary Ann.
They grew up together.

832
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,080
They got married
when they were 21

833
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:18,688
and had it annulled
six months later.

834
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,634
And what's the money for?

835
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,586
- She has Alzheimer's.
- Don't tell me.

836
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,080
He moved her
to a high-end facility

837
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:25,422
and pays
for round-the-clock care.

838
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,057
And the problem is,
we called the company

839
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:28,342
that handles
the billing, and--

840
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,676
And everything's in cash
up front,

841
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,345
probably paid five years
in advance.

842
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:34,481
And Mary Ann couldn't tell you
because she doesn't speak.

843
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,652
Which mean we don't have
any proof.

844
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,770
Where are you going?

845
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:42,689
I'm gonna go get us
some proof.

846
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:43,824
You did this?

847
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:44,942
Mike and I both did.

848
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,410
Then why isn't he here?

849
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:47,694
You know why.

850
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:50,414
Because it was more you
than him.

851
00:32:50,532 --> 00:32:51,612
You did a good job, Rachel.

852
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:59,089
Shopping, renting videos.

853
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:01,625
You must be going stir-crazy.

854
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,427
That's all right.

855
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:06,213
My suspension
is about to expire.

856
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:07,777
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

857
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:09,132
We found Mary Ann.

858
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,218
I'm told she's doing well
at the new facility--

859
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:13,220
you know,
the one Forstman's paying for.

860
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:19,726
You son of a bitch.

861
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,728
I'm not here to exploit
your tragedy, Eric.

862
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,113
I'm here to tell you
it's over.

863
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:24,231
Well, if this were over,

864
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:26,533
you'd be with Sean Cahill
right now,

865
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,619
which means you're still looking
for me to cut a deal.

866
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:30,487
I'm looking for you
to turn on Forstman.

867
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,573
You accost me
for the second time

868
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:35,209
in three days
and throw Mary Ann's name around

869
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:37,160
like a bargaining chip,

870
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:39,129
and you think
I'm gonna help you?

871
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:40,247
Drop dead.

872
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:45,552
Eric, please.

873
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,754
The reason I knew to look
for someone that you cared about

874
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,139
was that Forstman did
the same thing to me.

875
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:52,142
He finds your weakness
and presses down

876
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:54,394
until you don't have
the will to stand up to him.

877
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:57,481
With you, it was an ex-wife
with Alzheimer's.

878
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,317
With me...

879
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:03,353
it was a little brother
addicted to gambling.

880
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,439
I don't care.

881
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:06,907
You don't have proof,

882
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:08,945
and you're not gonna get it
in the next 24 hours.

883
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:10,027
You're right. I don't.

884
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:11,862
But here's the thing.

885
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,865
Cahill may have a deadline,
but I don't,

886
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,533
and I don't care
how long it takes,

887
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:18,168
because I'm gonna find
that proof

888
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:19,703
if you don't turn
on Forstman.

889
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,065
A lot of you don't know this,

890
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:39,596
but the truth is,
I hated Norma.

891
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:42,432
I hated her clogs,

892
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,434
her mustache,

893
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,187
her stupid
seasonal sweaters.

894
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:50,190
But the thing
I hated most about her

895
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:52,109
was her favorite story

896
00:34:52,243 --> 00:34:56,113
about how Abe Vigoda asked her
to marry him in 1975.

897
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,497
I mean, we get it.

898
00:34:57,615 --> 00:34:58,999
You were hot.

899
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:00,200
You turned him down,

900
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:02,169
and it was the biggest regret
of your life.

901
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:04,588
And like everything
you ever said,

902
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:06,757
I couldn't stand it
at the time.

903
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:10,210
But now that you're gone,

904
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:13,713
I understand what you meant.

905
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:17,801
Don't let the moment pass.

906
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,770
Don't let the people you love
walk by you

907
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,439
without letting them know
how you feel about them,

908
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:25,809
because life slips by,
and then it's over.

909
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:28,145
And I'm not gonna let
another minute pass me by

910
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:31,481
without letting you know
how much you mean to me.

911
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,954
I love you, Norma.

912
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:45,462
Thank you, Louis.

913
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,330
That was
a lovely ceremony.

914
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:05,315
That was beautiful, Louis.

915
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:06,833
I couldn't have done it
without you.

916
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:09,019
- Oh, that's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

917
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:13,023
I couldn't even see how I felt
without you showing me.

918
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:14,107
And the truth is, Donna,

919
00:36:14,242 --> 00:36:18,195
you know me better
than I know myself.

920
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:23,166
Like I said,
Harvey has no idea

921
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:24,835
how lucky he is
to have you.

922
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:35,846

Looking for the money

925
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:16,253
I supposedly gave
Eric Woodall?

926
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:20,090
You want to save me the trouble
and just admit what you did?

927
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:21,925
Now, where would be the fun
in that?

928
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:24,644
Fine.
Keep playing your games,

929
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:26,042
but this time,
you're gonna lose.

930
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:28,315
Why, because you think
you convinced Woodall

931
00:37:28,432 --> 00:37:31,101
to give me up?

932
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,986
Yeah, he came to see me.

933
00:37:33,104 --> 00:37:34,738
Said you tried to get him
to turn me in.

934
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:37,774
What I said was,
you're an arrogant bastard

935
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:40,827
who's spent his life
manipulating people.

936
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:44,614
And you're the loser who
only cares about competition.

937
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,117
Not my fault
you can't beat me.

938
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:48,618
I can this time.

939
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:52,505
Oh, I don't think so, pal,
because...

940
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:55,342
he turns on me,
I turn on you.

941
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:57,510
If you're talking about
12 years ago, let me remind you.

942
00:37:57,628 --> 00:37:58,712
We were both part
of that deal.

943
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:00,347
Yes, we were.

944
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:03,300
All three of us were--
you, me, and your brother.

945
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:04,714
You leave my brother
out of this.

946
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,852
Not a chance.

947
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,138
And you don't leave
this Woodall thing alone,

948
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:10,140
by the time I'm done,

949
00:38:10,274 --> 00:38:12,275
all anybody will know
about 12 years ago

950
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,526
is you gave me a tip

951
00:38:13,644 --> 00:38:15,946
and made sure your little
brother profited from it.

952
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,948
I didn't give you shit.

953
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:20,367
You tricked me into giving you
inside information

954
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:21,785
and then blackmailed me

955
00:38:21,902 --> 00:38:24,371
by giving Marcus money
he didn't even know was dirty.

956
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:26,656
That may be the truth,

957
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:30,160
but they're never gonna
hear it from me.

958
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:33,830
I'm afraid
they just did.

959
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:34,965
Hi, Charles.

960
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:36,833
Sean Cahill.
Nice to meet you.

961
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:38,551
Who the hell are you?

962
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:41,221
I'm the guy from the SEC
that isn't in your pocket.

963
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,639
I asked Sean
to follow Woodall.

964
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:44,975
Couldn't.
No authorization.

965
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,760
But I had no problem
getting authorization

966
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:47,927
to follow you.

967
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:51,314
Which is how I knew
when to turn this on.

968
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:53,566
You're wearing
a goddamn wire?

969
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,986
For someone whose favorite movie
is<i> Wall Street,</i>

970
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,654
that's got to be
pretty embarrassing.

971
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:59,022
Son of a bitch.

972
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:01,741
You may have gotten the better
of me 12 years ago, Charles,

973
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,910
but this time, you didn't.

974
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:07,247
So remember what it feels like,
because I know I will.

975
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:10,500
Harvey, this isn't over.

976
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:13,169
Words spoken by every loser
I've ever met.

977
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:15,005
See you around, pal.

978
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:22,128
Two for two.

979
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:29,185
He didn't touch my balls.

980
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:35,525
Black, two sugars,
splash of vanilla.

981
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,363
How do you know
that's how I take my coffee?

982
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:39,112
The same way I know
you're not taking that job.

983
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,648
You know I'm not taking that job
because I came into work today.

984
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:42,732
No, Mr. Specter.

985
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,103
I knew you weren't taking
that job

986
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:46,786
the second you walked away
from me the other night.

987
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:49,205
I told you I know people better
than they know themselves.

988
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,458
Well, what did you do
with Tina?

989
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:53,126
Oh, I had Big Bertha
reassign her.

990
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,795
- To who?
- Do you really care?

991
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,130
- Not a bit.
- Good.

992
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,299
Here's the deal.

993
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,835
I will take a bullet for you.

994
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,670
And I don't mean that
literally.

995
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:05,422
But what you do for me is,

996
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:07,006
when I need something,
you give it to me.

997
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:09,426
It's not just
a one-way street.

998
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,761
Will you also do some actual
secretarial work?

999
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:14,848
Take a look at what I did with
your calendar there, hotshot.

1000
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,066
Holy shit.

1001
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:17,743
When'd you get that done?

1002
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:20,603
I told you I'm not like
every other secretary.

1003
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:23,273
I'm Donna.

1004
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:24,908
Then let's get to work.

1005
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:28,912
But for the record, I don't take
vanilla with my coffee.

1006
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:31,197
You will
after you taste that.

1007
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,416
Oh, my God,
this is awesome.

1008
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,502
When will they learn?

1009
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,134
Perfect timing.

1010
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:52,635
And what are we celebrating?

1011
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,772
Our win.

1012
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,525
"Our win."

1013
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:00,727
- I like the sound of that.
- Me too.

1014
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,228
Where were you?

1015
00:41:02,313 --> 00:41:03,863
I'll get into that
in a minute.

1016
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,532
I want to talk to you
for a second.

1017
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:06,900
What is it?

1018
00:41:06,984 --> 00:41:10,153
Rachel, you know I told you
I loved you

1019
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:11,371
from the second I met you.

1020
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:13,790
Well, you loved
my pencil skirt.

1021
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:14,874
I loved your face.

1022
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,914
♪ ♪

1023
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:25,084
You're the most amazing woman
I have ever met,

1024
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:29,255
and you're not
just beautiful,

1025
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,927
but you're sweet
and caring and kind

1026
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:36,346
and brilliant
and tenacious.

1027
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,315
Mike, are--

1028
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:42,685
are you doing
what I think you're doing?

1029
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:48,191
I called your father today.

1030
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:50,443
And then I went to get
Grammy's ring cleaned.

1031
00:41:50,528 --> 00:41:51,694
Oh, my--

1032
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:52,912
I don't want to go 40 years

1033
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,532
wondering why I didn't do this
one day sooner.

1034
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:05,041
Rachel Elizabeth Zane...

1035
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,510
I love you...

1036
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:10,713
and I always will.

1037
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:13,349
You're my whole life.

1038
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:16,636
Will you marry me?

1039
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,888
Yes.

1040
00:42:19,023 --> 00:42:20,690
- Yes?
- Yes.

1041
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,063
Oh, my God.

1042
00:42:27,198 --> 00:42:29,065
All right, here...

1043
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:33,403
Oh.

1044
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:35,405
Oh, my God.

1045
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:41,461
It's beautiful.

1046
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,547
She wore it every day
for almost 60 years.

1047
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:47,050
So will I.

1048
00:43:01,815 --> 00:43:02,935
What's up, dickhead?

1049
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
What's up, loser?

1050
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:05,818
Hey, Harvey.
Good to hear from you.

1051
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:07,737
What's going on?
Everything okay?

1052
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:09,105
Yeah, everything's okay.

1053
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,607
I just haven't talked to you
in a while

1054
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:12,025
and wanted to see
how you were doing.

1055
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,443
I'm great.
Katie's good.

1056
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,662
The kids are good.
Everything's good.

1057
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:17,080
Great.

1058
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:19,449
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

1059
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,284
You sure
there's nothing going on?

1060
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,702
Nothing.

1061
00:43:22,836 --> 00:43:25,121
Like I said, I just haven't
talked to you in a while,

1062
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:26,839
and I miss you.

1063
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:29,125
I miss you too, Harvey, but
unless you got something else,

1064
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:30,209
I've got to go.

1065
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:31,544
The kids are in the bath.

1066
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,962
Nothing else.

1067
00:43:33,097 --> 00:43:35,431
Love you, Harvey.

1068
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:37,050
I love you too.

1069
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:45,608
- Hey.
- Hey.

1070
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,777
Listen, I was thinking about
what you said,

1071
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:49,812
about me pitying you.

1072
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:50,947
And I don't.

1073
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:53,199
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

1074
00:43:53,317 --> 00:43:55,401
I think you're one of
the most amazing women

1075
00:43:55,486 --> 00:43:57,820
I've ever met,
and just because I don't--

1076
00:43:57,955 --> 00:43:59,989
- I'm leaving you, Harvey.
- What?

1077
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:04,744
This isn't working
for me anymore.

1078
00:44:04,828 --> 00:44:07,130
Donna, I know
how you're feeling,

1079
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:09,165
but you just went
through something huge,

1080
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,336
with being on trial,
and, uh...

1081
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,506
you need to give it time.

1082
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,007
You can't just quit.

1083
00:44:18,175 --> 00:44:20,510
I'm not quitting.

1084
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:21,844
I'm going to work for Louis.

1085
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,065
Donna.

1086
00:44:29,987 --> 00:44:32,238
Donna, please.

1087
00:44:32,356 --> 00:44:34,691
I love you, Harvey.
