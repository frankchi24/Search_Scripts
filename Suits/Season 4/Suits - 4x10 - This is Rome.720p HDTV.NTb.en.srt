1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,603
Will you marry me?

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,072
- Yes, I'll marry you.

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,475
- When we have kids,
world, watch out.

4
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:10,609
- Louis, I don't want kids.

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,445
- Sheila, I'm gonna be a father.

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,415
- You heard louis.
He already gave him the job.

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,484
- I want to know
why the hell you came back.

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,285
- What matters is
that I'm staying,

9
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,087
Because this is where I belong.

10
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,589
- This makes it look
like forstman's payment

11
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,391
Never went
to any offshore accounts,

12
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,525
And that you never took
a piece of it.

13
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,127
- That's forgery.

14
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,696
- Which is a less of a crime
than what you did.

15
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,032
- I had no choice!
- Bullsh--, you had no choice!

16
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,733
You could have said "no" at any
goddamn point along the way.

17
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,668
- One thing is for sure.

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,039
When all this is over, I'm
gonna fire the sh-- out of you.

19
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:44,676
- I wouldn't be back here
if it wasn't for louis.

20
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,079
- I'll take care of it.

21
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,214
- "Dear harvey and jessica,

22
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,816
"I put all of you in jeopardy
for my own personal gain.

23
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:54,486
"effective immediately,
I, louis litt,

24
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,523
"am resigning
from pearson specter.

25
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,591
Please take care of my home."

26
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,285
- One, two.
- Give me a second, gimme a sec.

27
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,521
Maybe we can get you
some trunks, go a few rounds.

28
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,091
- I think I've already
gone a few rounds.

29
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:35,294
I need your help.

30
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,262
- Anything.
What can I do for you?

31
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,832
- Clients.
I need clients.

32
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,500
- Louis, the by-laws say that--

33
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,835
- Come on, harvey. You think
I don't know what they say?

34
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,269
I wrote the by-laws.

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,572
- Yeah, and who'd you
write 'em for, huh?

36
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:50,109
Jessica, and she's not gonna
make an exception for you.

37
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,276
- Well, maybe she'll make one
for you?

38
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,614
I tried to get interviews
at six different firms

39
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,783
And every one of them
said the same thing:

40
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,351
It's a bloodbath out there.

41
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,286
Which means if I can't
bring business with me,

42
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,256
Because I'm never gonna
find a job in this city.

43
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,324
- Louis...
- Harvey.

44
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,493
I'm not askin' for the moon.

45
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,528
Just three companies that
I brought to the firm myself

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,365
When they were nothing.

47
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,469
- Let me talk to jessica.

48
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,539
- Thank you.

49
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,254
- Harvey, you don't look busy.

50
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,489
Would you like to attend
the international securities

51
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,558
Law symposium?
- That depends.

52
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,360
Is it in vegas, miami, or rio?

53
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,896
- Poughkeepsie.
- Send paul porter.

54
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,266
- What can I do for you?

55
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,567
- I just saw louis.

56
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,637
- No. He's not getting
any clients.

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,205
- He just wants three.

58
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,773
Letting them go won't break us.

59
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,276
- No, it won't,
but it will open the floodgates

60
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:00,612
That ever thought of leaving
and taking their clients.

61
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:04,283
And he's worked his fingers
to the bone for both of us,

62
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,884
And he's asking for a crumb.

63
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,686
- And I give him that crumb,
and next thing you know,

64
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,588
All the cookies
in the cabinet are gone.

65
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,492
- I do know that instead
of talking about giving

66
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,294
Louis' clients away,

67
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,529
You should be working
on keeping your own.

68
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,699
- Jessica, I'll find a way
to keep versalife,

69
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,668
But that has nothing
to do with louis.

70
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,936
We owe the man something.

71
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,505
- And I'm giving him something.

72
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,675
My phone rings and he gets
a glowing recommendation

73
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:33,245
Instead of me saying that he
left after committing a felony.

74
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,913
- No one's gonna call
if he can't get in the door.

75
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,685
- That's on him, not on me.

76
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,298
- Are you sure we
should be doing this?

77
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,335
In bankruptcy
picking through his stuff?

78
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:59,371
- It just doesn't feel okay
going through his things.

79
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,939
- Rachel, you haven't heard from
him. I haven't heard from him.

80
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,908
If we don't pack up his stuff,
who will?

81
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,376
- I guess you guys
had the same idea I did.

82
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,911
Yeah.

83
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,413
- He didn't take that either?
- No.

84
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,648
I just cleaned it.

85
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,916
It was smudged

86
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,252
And I didn't want to give it
back to him dirty.

87
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,554
- He must have been
in such a hurry.

88
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:19,424
- He was in a hurry 'cause
he was ashamed.

89
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,495
- I want to just
get this over with.

90
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,471
- Jessica, what--
- am I doing here?

91
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,907
I'm here to tell you
that I know you know the truth

92
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,376
About louis' resignation.

93
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,710
- I don't know--

94
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,648
- Yes, you do, and I'm guessing
you didn't like it.

95
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,649
- You're right.

96
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,819
Because I don't think
that he deserves to be fired.

97
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,989
- That's funny, because I think
you both deserve to be fired.

98
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,859
- What do you--
- you knew what he did,

99
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,560
And you said nothing.

100
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,297
- So that's why you're here.

101
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,464
To fire me.

102
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,669
- No. I'm here to give you
a second chance.

103
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,852
- Those don't look
like my case files.

104
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,422
- They're not,
but I didn't come empty-handed.

105
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,390
I got you somethin'.
- A job?

106
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,060
- General counsel
at procter & gamble.

107
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,962
- Procter & gamble?
What is that, a joke?

108
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,832
They're in cincinnati, which is
like, american for "siberia."

109
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,835
<i>"number 31 on the fortune 500,"</i>

110
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,904
And it's a chance
to make a fresh start.

111
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,372
- Whose idea was this chance?

112
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,907
Her majesty?

113
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,542
Oh, yeah,
I bet she loved that.

114
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:47,612
- Louis, it was my idea,
and you should take it.

115
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,548
- Well, would you take it?

116
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,582
No way on earth.

117
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,650
You know why?

118
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,685
Because this is rome,

119
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,821
You're a gladiator,
and so am I.

120
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,756
- Then be a gladiator.

121
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,058
Take this job and fight
your way back here.

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,461
- I don't have
to go to cincinnati

123
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,429
To fight my way back here.

124
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,466
I can goddamn fight jessica.

- I'm here to pick
the three clients that are mine.

135
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,640
- Those clients, like everyone
this firm represents,

136
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,876
Belong to me, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

137
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,078
- Oh yes there is,
'cause pursuant to the by-laws,

138
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,513
You're required
to inform clients

139
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,981
Of any attorney's departure.

140
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:59,184
If you fail to do so prior
to me giving you formal notice,

141
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,052
They're up for grabs.

142
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,487
- Well, you wrote the by-laws.

143
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,989
I'll take your word
that's what they say.

144
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,525
- Oh, I see. You don't think
I can take 'em from you, huh?

145
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,194
Well, I'm the one who brought
them in and answered their call

146
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:12,197
When all you did
was take your cut.

147
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,765
- Is that all I did?

148
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,567
- Yes, and that's
why I'm gonna win them,

149
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,035
Because I deserve them.

150
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,738
- And that's what it always
is with you, louis, isn't it?

151
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,739
What you deserve.

152
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,007
- You're goddamn right it is,

153
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,842
And you have some nerve
tellin' me no

154
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,010
After all I've done for you.

155
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:28,713
- What you've done
is break the law,

156
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,616
And I'm still willing to give
you a good recommendation.

157
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,953
- I don't need your
bullsh-- recommendation.

158
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,888
I need clients, and if
you're not gonna give 'em to me,

159
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,924
You better strap in,
because I'm gonna take 'em.

160
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,931
- Louis.

161
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,532
You haven't returned
any of my phone calls.

162
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,835
- I don't like contact
during transitional periods.

163
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,603
- But you didn't even
say goodbye.

164
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,771
- What is there to say, katrina?

165
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,773
- Well...

166
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,608
When you're ready,

167
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,976
I would love to take you out
for dinner.

168
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,011
- We can't do that.
You're on the other side now.

169
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,847
- What are you talking about?
- I gave jessica notice.

170
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:02,814
I'm going after three clients.

171
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,815
- Louis--
- no-no-no.

172
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,051
And I do not want to put you
in the position

173
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,052
To fraternize with the enemy.

174
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,155
- You're not the enemy, louis.

175
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,125
Jessica had me contact all
of your old clients in person.

176
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,528
- She what?

177
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,530
- You can't approach them.
It's over.

178
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,132
- I have to get going.

179
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,968
- Louis!

180
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,536
I am so sorry.

181
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,805
I didn't want to do it.
- Don't be.

182
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:30,108
If it had to be somebody,
I'm glad it was you.

183
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,043
- I'm in the middle of a merger.

184
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,144
What's so important
that I had to come down

185
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,513
To your sh--ty office?

186
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,814
- This used to be
your sh--ty office.

187
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,782
And after that,
it belonged to six other people,

188
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,150
Five of whom are now gone.

189
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,954
- That things can change
in the blink of an eye.

190
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,923
- Louis.
- Yes, louis.

191
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,992
Took all of ten seconds
to scrape his name off the wall.

192
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,828
How long do you think it's gonna
take jessica to scrape off mine?

193
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,832
- Harvey, jessica
sees me as a huge problem.

194
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,534
The solution is just
to get rid of me.

195
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,701
I don't want that to happen, so

196
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,803
I need to solve
an even bigger problem.

197
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,072
- And you want me
to give you a bigger problem.

198
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,240
- I just got back.
I need you to give me

199
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,142
The biggest problem you've got.
- Fine.

200
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:08,980
Sterling pharmaceuticals
is merging with pfizer.

201
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,016
Come on, smart guy.
You want to solve the problem?

202
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,217
You better be able
to identify it.

203
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,185
- There is no problem.
They merge.

204
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,655
They only make up 26%
of the market.

205
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,190
That's--that's not
over the limit for 10b-6.

206
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,726
- But?

207
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,194
- Sh--.

208
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,829
Versalife puts us
over the limit.

209
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:28,567
- Unless we figure out a way
around 10b-6.

210
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,802
Like I told jessica I would.

211
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,672
Harvey, no one has ever
been able to do that.

212
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,773
- Listen to me.
You want to make a splash?

213
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:38,810
Part the red sea.

214
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,917
Oh, no.
- "oh, no," what?

215
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,988
I don't feel like having.
- You know what, harvey?

216
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,157
I just came in here to see
if you needed anything.

217
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,760
- I don't.
- Okay, fine.

218
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,229
Listen, I know that
this whole thing with louis

219
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,731
Is upsetting you.

220
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,865
- No. What's upsetting me,
is you saying

221
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:05,937
- I'm worried about him.
He's in a really bad place.

222
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,372
- You think I don't know that?
That's why I tried to help him.

223
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,907
I got him a job
on a silver platter

224
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,642
And he threw it in my face.

225
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,676
- And he shouldn't
have done that.

226
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:12,978
- Yeah. Then why are you here?

227
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,383
- Because I still think
we can help.

228
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:22,087
You did a good thing
by getting him that job.

229
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,389
It was the right instinct,
but it was the wrong city.

230
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,291
- Yeah, I can't get him anything
in new york.

231
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,792
- I'm not talking
about new york.

232
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,829
- Then what the hell
are you talking about?

233
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,938
- Nice grouping.

234
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,007
- How'd you know I'd be here?

235
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,708
- Because you go mudding
when you're happy,

236
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,243
And you come here when you're
looking to blow off steam.

237
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,412
- Well, I am blowing off steam,
donna,

238
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,315
And I'm not finished, so
unless you can handle a pistol,

239
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,019
Do me a favor please
and just leave me alone.

240
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:06,665
- Connecticut junior
pistol championship finalist.

241
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,732
Three years in a row.

242
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,302
- Ask me that again
and I will use this on you.

243
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,737
- Is there anything
that you can't do?

244
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,305
- No, there isn't.

245
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:18,309
Including talking harvey
into getting you another job.

246
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,778
- So where is it this time?

247
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,713
Cincinnati? Minneapolis?

248
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,214
Anchorage, alaska?

249
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,416
- Boston.

250
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,685
- Sheila.

251
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:27,986
- Yes, sheila.

252
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,456
- I got him to give you his word
he will do it,

253
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,193
He's not gonna make the call
unless you say you're on board.

254
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,327
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

255
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,897
- Donna, sheila values strength.

256
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,465
She's gonna
see this as me coming to her

257
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,267
At a time of weakness.

258
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,402
- Louis, you go to boston
with the sole purpose

259
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:49,941
Of being with her, she's gonna
see that as a sign of love.

260
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,211
- Tell him to make the call.

261
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,913
- Okay, kyle, I think
the question you have to ask is,

262
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:58,016
"where do I see myself
in ten years,"

263
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:04,022
And unfortunately, the answer
is, "not as a harvard graduate."

264
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,758
Idiot.

265
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,761
Louis, what are you doing here?

266
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,164
- I'm here to take you back.

267
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,734
- I-I don't understand,
the way we lef--

268
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,770
- I don't care how we left it.

269
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:22,140
Not a day has gone by that
I haven't thought of you,

270
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,810
And I can't hold
it back anymore.

271
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,912
Sheila, I love you,

272
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:32,083
And I want us to be together.

273
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,020
- Louis, this is wonderful,
but it's--it's--

274
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,156
It's just a lot to take in.

275
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,992
To believe that
you're really ready to commit.

276
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,460
- Well, how's this for ready?

277
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,429
I'm taking a job in boston.
- What?

278
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,797
- I quit pearson specter.

279
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,767
- Oh, my g--

280
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,202
I can't believe it.

281
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,303
You did all that for me?

282
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,438
- Yes.

283
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,807
- Well, I--

284
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:00,078
- Well, what?
- I got a job in boston for you.

285
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,346
- Louis, did you
make that decision

286
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,515
Before or after you
quit your old job?

287
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,150
- What difference does it make?

288
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,018
- It makes a huge difference.

289
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,521
You don't call for six months,
and then...

290
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:13,491
And suddenly I'm supposed
to fill the hole in your life?

291
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,026
- No-no-no-no-no,
it's not like that.

292
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,961
- Okay, then what is it?
- I mean, do you know

293
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,464
How hard it was
for me to not call you?

294
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,066
I was tryin' to move on.
- Then why didn't you move on?

295
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,402
- Because I realized
that I don't need new york.

296
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,839
I need you.

297
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,141
- Louis, geography was
the least of our problems.

298
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,045
And--and I want you to know
that I've come around on that.

299
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,247
- You don't "come around"
on children.

300
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,550
I don't want them, and I'm not
going to change my mind.

301
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,885
- You don't have to,
because I've changed mine.

302
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,587
- Okay, and I believe
that you believe that, it's--

303
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,088
- Well, then if you b--

304
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,824
I'm just sensing
that you don't know where I'm--

305
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:46,891
- Louis, when I asked
if you'd quit first,

306
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,893
I was asking because if--

307
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,428
If I believed that you
were really ready

308
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,031
To give up children,
I would run

309
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,134
Into your arms
and never let go,

310
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,303
But if you're doing this
because you're down and out--

311
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,306
Do you understand that
I was going to change

312
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,876
My entire work schedule
weeks ago for you?

313
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,913
Before all this.
- You were going to.

314
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,182
But you didn't.
- Sheila, please.

315
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,452
- It was good
to see you, louis.

316
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:18,590
Please go.

317
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,407
- You see me getting
my ass kicked by ftc rule 10b-6.

318
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,909
- And?

319
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,078
- Harvey needs and update
and I don't have sh--.

320
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,112
- And if you were harvey
and he was jessica,

321
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,881
You'd say you're all over it.

322
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,215
- I can make that happen.

323
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,985
- Donna, send a bottle
of johnnie walker blue

324
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,419
To jonathan palmer,
and get him tickets

325
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,888
To the next sox game,

326
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,623
And then find out
when his wife's birthday is,

327
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,925
His kid's birthday,
his dog's birthday.

328
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,894
- How am I supposed to--
- I don't care how you do it.

329
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,061
Figure it the hell out.

330
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,062
- Harvey, this is
a thank you to him.

331
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,332
- It's not a thank you,
it's an apology for you

332
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,101
Talking me into getting him
to give louis a job.

333
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,235
- What did he--

334
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,536
- He didn't show up
to the interview,

335
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,571
And what's happening
with our versalife problem?

336
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,072
- I'm all over it.

337
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,574
- Yeah, "all over it" means
you don't have dick.

338
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,044
Next time I see you,
have something.

339
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,081
- Jonathan palmer's in boston.

340
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,984
Harvey got louis a job there
because of sheila, didn't he?

341
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,586
- Yes.
- Donna, if he didn't show up

342
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,454
For the interview, it means
it didn't work with sheila.

343
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,024
- Sh--.

344
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,360
He's gonna be devastated.

345
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,162
- You bring him his box
of stuff yet?

346
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,531
- No, but I'm going
to right now.

347
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,400
- Let me do it.
- Listen to me.

348
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,001
Harvey's pissed at you
because you don't have anything

349
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,069
And louis needs me.

350
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,337
- Donna, I am here
because that man

351
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,241
He gave up going
after sheila for me.

352
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,310
For all I know, that's why it
didn't work out for him up there

353
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,245
And it's...

354
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:51,015
The least I can do,
is comfort him when he's down.

355
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,020
- Go.

356
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,726
- Come in, come in.

357
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,227
What are you doin' here?

358
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:06,297
- Stuff has been sitting
on your desk for days.

359
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,366
I wanted you to have it.

360
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:12,036
- Okay. I'll need it
for my new office.

361
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,171
- You got a job?

362
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:17,442
- Not yet, but I will.
- Oh.

363
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,545
Order of the coif.

364
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,548
Yeah, look who
graduated magna cum laude.

365
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,317
- Summa, actually,
for all the good it'll do me.

366
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,287
- I know there's got to be
a story behind this key. Yeah?

367
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,022
From one of your
first cases or...

368
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,190
- Mike, do me a favor, please.

369
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,492
Just stop it, will you?
- Stop what?

370
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,526
- Stop asking questions that
you already know the answers to

371
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,728
Just to stay here longer.

372
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,729
- Louis, I'm not--
- you're not what?

373
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:41,466
You're just making small talk
while you look around the room

374
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,701
To see if there are any
sharp objects in the vicinity.

375
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,336
- That is not why I came here.

376
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,606
- Well, it wasn't to deliver
a box of my sh--.

377
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,342
- Look, when I was drowning,
you threw me a lifeline, okay?

378
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,044
- Okay, well,
that's nice of you to say,

379
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,279
And I appreciate you
bringing over my things,

380
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,315
But they're not exactly
a lifeline.

381
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,083
- I heard about boston.

382
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,119
- What'd you hear?

383
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,721
- That harvey got you a job
and you didn't even show up.

384
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,623
- Well, why would I
when the love of my life

385
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,358
Rips out my heart
and then stomps on it?

386
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,593
- Louis, I'm just trying
to help.

387
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,529
- Well, you can't!

388
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,032
I don't have sheila.

389
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,502
I don't have a job.

390
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:21,806
And right now I'd just
prefer to be alone.

391
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,788
- No.

392
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,490
Well, I don't care
what he says.

393
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,161
15% of bullsh--
is still bullsh--.

394
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,228
Dick.

395
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,832
- I can see you're busy, sir, so
I'll just jump right to it and--

396
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:52,070
If this is your asking me
for rachel's hand in marriage,

397
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,740
You know, you're goin'
about it the wrong way.

398
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,209
- Sir, I think if I were gonna
do that, I'd have the foresight

399
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,511
To ask your wife
how to approach you first.

400
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,080
- Good answer.

401
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,516
I'm actually here
about louis litt.

402
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:06,651
- Yeah, I heard he resigned.

403
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,653
- He did, and he's looking
for a job.

404
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,855
- A fellow like that
should have his pick.

405
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,157
- Well, the partnership
agreement prohibits him

406
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,559
From taking clients.

407
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,427
- Ooh, sh--.
- Yeah.

408
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,763
- Ah, jessica doesn't
play around, does she?

409
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,834
- Look, I know it's bad
out there, but--

410
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,135
- Bad? It's the apocalypse.

411
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,369
And I'm not runnin'
a soup kitchen.

412
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,206
If a partner
can't bring me clients...

413
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:32,610
- These are louis' billables
for the last 15 years.

414
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,813
- Mm.

415
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,316
This guy ever sleep?
- And he doesn't just bill.

416
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,251
He trains the associates,
he publishes.

417
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,320
He will give his life to you.

418
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,189
- And you want me to do this
because you're with my daughter?

419
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,791
- I want you to do this
because I've never asked you

420
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,659
For a thing, and
the first time I am,

421
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,761
It's a favor for someone else.

422
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,697
That's the kind of man
that your daughter is with.

423
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,765
- So it's because you're
with my daughter?

424
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,667
- You're gonna see it
how you're gonna see it,

425
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,503
But the real question is:

426
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:03,608
What are you gonna
do about louis litt?

427
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,645
- I'll meet with him.

428
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,880
But there's no guarantee.

429
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:12,683
- Well, that's all I can ask.

430
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,620
- You tell my daughter to give
her old man a call sometime.

431
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,422
- Yes, sir.

432
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,228
Hey.
- You look happy.

433
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,632
- I am happy, because today
I did a good thing.

434
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,600
- You're going to let me paint
the bedroom robin's egg blue?

435
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,269
- I said I did a good thing.

436
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,371
I didn't say
I did a ridiculous thing.

437
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,508
- I got louis a job interview
in new york.

438
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,310
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,412
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

440
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,548
- Oh, I love you.

441
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,651
- Well, you should fix
one for yourself too,

442
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,920
Because I couldn't have
done it without you.

443
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,755
- What do you mean?

444
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,924
- I mean the interview's
with your dad.

445
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,358
- What?

446
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,497
- I went to your dad for louis.

447
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:02,767
What?

448
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,769
- It's really sweet.

449
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,438
- But...

450
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,773
- Let's just say
there's a reason

451
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,642
That I didn't go to my dad
to pay for law school.

452
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,643
- I thought you said it was
because you wanted

453
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:16,814
- It is, but other people
don't have a problem

454
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:22,453
Because they don't have to wait
for the other shoe to drop.

455
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,288
- What are you talking about?

456
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,825
- So you mean after this, he's
gonna want something from me?

457
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:32,997
- I don't know, but he's gonna
want something from someone.

458
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,768
- If it gets louis a fresh
start, I really don't care.

459
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,746
Really?
- Yeah.

460
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,847
- You got to be kiddin' me.
- No.

461
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,249
- You went there too?

462
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,316
- Every Tuesday
for the last five years.

463
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,585
- Oh. Wednesday.

464
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,355
Chicken parm day.

465
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,389
- More like christmas to me.

466
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,657
- Oh, I believe it.
- Oh, louis.

467
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:04,328
But it's time that we got
down to the crux of the matter.

468
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,563
- You want to know
why I resigned.

469
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,031
- Well, I did call jessica,

470
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,267
And she gave you
a glowing recommendation,

471
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,668
And we both know
that's bullsh--.

472
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,270
- You want to know the truth.

473
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,771
- Did I say anything
about the truth?

474
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,274
I'm just makin' sure you know
I know that it's bullsh--.

475
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,609
But my truth is,
I don't care why you left.

476
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,578
All I care about
is what you're gonna take.

477
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,779
- What?

478
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,382
- You take one client,
I could give a sh--

479
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,884
How big it is, and I'll make you
a senior partner on the spot.

480
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,286
- Wait a second.

481
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,054
Mike ross said

482
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,523
That I was not required
to bring business.

483
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,991
- This isn't about business.

484
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,793
This is about balls.

485
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,994
I don't need another grinder,

486
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,829
I need a lawyer
who can kick a door in,

487
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,798
And the door in question
is pearson specter's.

488
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,833
- You want to see if I can break
my partnership agreement?

489
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:48,306
Because if you can't do that,
then what the hell good are you?

490
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,042
You're no different
than jessica.

491
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,712
I'll take that
as a compliment.

492
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,815
Sylvia will validate you
on the way out.

493
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,652
Robert, this is new york.
I take a cab.

494
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,722
- See, that's my way
of saying "get the hell out."

495
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,031
- Well, how long
is a little while?

496
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,533
- Do you have any--

497
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,667
- Louis!

498
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,536
- Excuse me.

499
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,104
Katrina, what are
you doing here?

500
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,806
- You know what I'm doing here.
This isn't your client anymore.

501
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,974
You're prohibited
from contacting them.

502
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,577
- I-I'm not here to see--
- neubacher capital?

503
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,045
Yes, you are.

504
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,747
Just like you're going
to go see carver tech

505
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,949
And blackthorne simons.

506
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,751
- How do you know that?

507
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,486
- Because they called me.
- What are they saying?

508
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,787
- Doesn't matter
what they're saying.

509
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,456
It's plain as day
you're trying to poach them.

510
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,957
- Does jessica know?
- Not yet.

511
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,425
But if you keep doing this,
she's gonna find out.

512
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,593
- Yeah, well, let her sue me,

513
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,794
'cause I don't have
any other choice.

514
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,430
- Robert zane offered me
senior partner

515
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,865
If I can break
the partnership agreement.

516
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,634
That is a major law firm
in new york.

517
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,902
I'm not gonna get
a better chance than that.

518
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,572
- Look, tell jessica
if you have to.

519
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,874
I don't want to get you
in trouble, okay?

520
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:00,745
But I just lost my job.

521
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,847
And I just lost the woman
I love for the second time,

522
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,682
All in one week.

523
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:08,018
Now I have this chance
to turn my life around...

524
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,156
With this one client.

525
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:15,693
I'm gonna take it.

526
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:18,863
- Louis.

527
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,835
You want one client,
I'll give you one client.

528
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,004
- What? Wait, no--

529
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,839
- When you agreed to take me on,

530
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,175
I swore that
I would be loyal to you,

531
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,978
And if I'm not loyal now,
then I never was.

532
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,680
- Katrina, if you do this
and jessica figures it out,

533
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,449
She will fire you,

534
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,084
And I cannot live with that.

535
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,986
- That won't matter
if you get the job

536
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:45,756
And you take me with you.

537
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,860
- Give me the goddamn name.

538
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,930
- What?

539
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,131
- I'm gonna tell you something,

540
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,567
And I don't want
you to overreact.

541
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,869
- From the look on your face,
I'm not makin' any promises.

542
00:23:58,871 --> 00:23:59,970
- I just got an email
from louis.

543
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,806
He's going after versalife.

544
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,574
- Get me ray.
- What are you gonna do?

545
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,075
- Get me ray!

546
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,644
- Harvey, it was just
a notification email.

547
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,813
You don't even know where he is!
- Yes, I do.

548
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:12,716
- That notification is required
by the bylaws.

549
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,218
He's doing it
at the last second.

550
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,921
I guarantee you he's walking
in versalife's door right now.

551
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,829
- Hell do you think
you're doing?

552
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:27,031
- Not doing, did.
I just signed versalife.

553
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,066
- You have no right.
- Please, I have every right.

554
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,569
Because when I quit, jessica
only notified my clients,

555
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:32,770
Not yours,
because she didn't think

556
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,238
I had enough balls
to go after you head-on.

557
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,942
Because I didn't think
you would stoop this low.

558
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:40,578
- Oh, too bad. You exposed
your flank, now you're too late.

559
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
- Yeah, and you can see
the fear in my eyes.

560
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,081
Excuse me.

561
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,584
- I told you, you're too late.

562
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,018
- To tell them
an unemployed clown

563
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,920
Just sold them
a pile of bullsh--?

564
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:53,557
- You mean the bullsh-- that you
have to drop them as a client?

565
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,692
The pfizer merger.

566
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,827
Ftc rule 10b-6.

567
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,063
They were not pleased
that you kept them in the dark.

568
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,165
- You are a son of a bitch.
- Who's the clown now?

569
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,700
You're a son of a bitch.

570
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:03,968
I'm only taking one client

571
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,604
The least you could do
is be a gentleman about it.

572
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,706
- A gentleman?
I got you two jobs!

573
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,542
- Two jobs in siberia!

574
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,744
Out of pity.

575
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,713
- I got you those jobs
out of compassion,

576
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,114
Just like when
I fought for jessica

577
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,983
To not fire you
in the first place.

578
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,784
But when I take versalife back,

579
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,854
It's gonna be without
any feeling for you at all.

580
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,830
- What happened?

581
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,065
- I lost them,
but I'm gonna get 'em back.

582
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:38,035
- What I want to know is
how the hell did louis find out

583
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,136
That we had to drop them?

584
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,170
- I don't know.

585
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,305
People know sh--.

586
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:42,573
- People don't know sh--.

587
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:45,543
People get told sh--.

588
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,810
- Jessica, I know I wanted
to throw him a bone,

589
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:49,113
But I did not tell him.

590
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,848
- I wasn't talkin' about you.

591
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,249
I was talking about mike ross.

592
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,185
- Tell me you didn't have him
working on versalife.

593
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,054
- That doesn't mean--
- I knew it.

594
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,889
He was working on versalife.

595
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,258
He owes louis
for bringing him back here.

596
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,093
That is motive and opportunity.

597
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,796
- You just want him gone
by any means necessary.

598
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,066
- Oh, I think I have been
more than clear about that.

599
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,100
- Yeah, well,
try another theory,

600
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,602
Because mike
would never do this.

601
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,170
- Oh, there are a lot of things

602
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:16,640
You never thought
mike ross would do.

603
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,176
Sell out an old man's company.

604
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,178
Get in bed with a billionaire.

605
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,949
Cut his boss out of a deal.

606
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:28,586
- Jessica--
- people change, harvey.

607
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,923
Louis is taking versalife
to robert zane.

608
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,926
Mike ross' future father-in-law.

609
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,996
Why don't you think about that?

610
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:53,110
- Mike, I need to know
what you have on versalife.

611
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,753
- It was me.
- What was you?

612
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:03,921
- Louis going after them
is my fault.

613
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,623
- What did you--
- I went to robert zane

614
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,358
And I asked him
to give louis a job.

615
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,859
- That's it?

616
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,661
You didn't tell him
about versalife?

617
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,963
- Of course not, wh--
you think I would do that?

618
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,866
You went to one
of our biggest competitors

619
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,635
And put 'em together
with a desperate louis.

620
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,837
<i>- I did it because louis
was desperate, all right?</i>

621
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,138
I went to see him the other day
to bring him his stuff,

622
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,209
You're telling me when you
were supposed to be helping us

623
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:29,013
You were busy giving them
to louis on a silver platter?

624
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,348
- I was, but I also figured out
how to get them back.

625
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,050
- Why didn't you tell me then?
- 'cause I was trying to think

626
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:35,886
- What the hell's
wrong with this option?

627
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:39,223
- It involves going
to walter gillis.

628
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,867
- Well, look
who decided to drop by.

629
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,435
The man who lost me my company

630
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,871
And his partner
who tore it to shreds.

631
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,873
- Walter, I understand
how you must feel.

632
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,141
- So, why are you here?

633
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,976
- Because we have a proposition
for you.

634
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:01,111
- Does it involve an apology?

635
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:04,314
- It is an apology.

636
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,822
- You want me to buy versalife?

637
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,725
- We want you to buy
a division of versalife.

638
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:18,328
- They've been working on
anti-addiction meds for years.

639
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,731
- Look at the results.
This one works.

640
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,067
- But it's a money-loser
and it's gonna take years.

641
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,702
They don't have
the capital, the patience,

642
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,270
Or the will.
- But you do.

643
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,872
- And let me guess, you two are
here out of the goodness

644
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,008
Of your hearts.
- You want the truth?

645
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,944
He'd be here whether this was
for his own good or not.

646
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,847
For me, I'm here
because it gets me out of a jam.

647
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,315
- So you can stick it to us
if you want to,

648
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:41,218
But if you do that...

649
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,153
You're gonna miss the chance
to save a lot of other people

650
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,354
Just like phillip.

651
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,990
- Don't ever talk to me
about phillip again.

652
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:51,895
This is how all this started,
with you using my son.

653
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,798
- No, I'm the one
who used your son.

654
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,301
I used him to get control
of your company,

655
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,436
But everything mike did
from the second he met you

656
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,004
Was to save your company,

657
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,474
Because when it comes
to caring about people,

658
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:04,775
He's twice the man that I am,

659
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,777
And by the way,
he never gave up on you,

660
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,278
And he never sold you out.

661
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,480
- Bullsh--.

662
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:10,514
- You're right, it is.

663
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:13,851
- Mike, no.

664
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,486
- The truth is,
is that I gave you my word.

665
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:18,155
I told you I would never sell
you out and then I got into bed

666
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,823
With someone
that I never should have trusted

667
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,992
And I lost you your company.
- Yes, you did.

668
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,360
- And that company
was your family.

669
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,463
It gave you purpose,
but you still have money,

670
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,165
And this is a purpose.

671
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:31,468
Walter, if you don't want
to do this, I get it.

672
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,537
But I need you to understand
that the only reason

673
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:37,274
I even thought to come to you
in the first place

674
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,942
Is that I'm gonna regret
what I did to you

675
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:43,046
For the rest of my life.

676
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,894
I hope you're not
furious with me.

677
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:59,296
- I'm not mad.

678
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,864
- You're not?

679
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,432
- No.

680
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,268
- Well, good.

681
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,804
I wanted to...
Thank you

682
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,906
For setting up that meeting
with robert zane.

683
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,440
I just hope you understand
that if I had a choice,

684
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,942
I never would have gone
after versalife,

685
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,310
But I had no choice.

686
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,546
- Louis, we took them back.

687
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,915
- What?

688
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,550
But you had to drop them.

689
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,952
- Not anymore.

690
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:24,855
We convinced them to sell
their trial drug division.

691
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:27,891
- Of course. You drop a drain
on their earnings,

692
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,226
Stock price
goes right through the roof.

693
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,195
- And their market share
falls below the threshold.

694
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,396
- But who the hell
would buy it?

695
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,566
- Walter gillis.

696
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,975
- Of course, walter gillis.

697
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,577
- Louis, listen--
- mike.

698
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,579
You won.

699
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,614
You're a brilliant lawyer.

700
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,449
- You are a brilliant lawyer.

701
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,551
- Yeah, I'm a brilliant lawyer
who's never gonna work again.

702
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,953
- Hey, stop.

703
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:58,922
That is not true.

704
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,591
Look--look--look
at everything that you have.

705
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,126
A harvard law diploma,
summa cum laude,

706
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,930
Those are the credentials
of a supreme court justice.

707
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,466
- Nah, that and 2 bucks will
get me a seat on the subway,

708
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,436
But thank you
for having the decency

709
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,137
To tell me in person.

710
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,305
- Louis, come on.

711
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,373
Let me--let me--

712
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,574
Let me stick around for a while.

713
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:23,914
You--you can tell me the story
about that key.

714
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,283
- Mike, I know
what you're tryin' to do.

715
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,585
Now's not the time.

716
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,655
Please go.

717
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:55,579
- Come in.

718
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,381
You're not louis litt.

719
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:00,117
- No, I'm not. But if you're
expecting him to show up,

720
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,486
It's gonna be a long wait.
- You here to take his spot?

721
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,322
I'll give you senior partner
right now.

722
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,425
- I'm here to tell you
you're not getting versalife.

723
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,427
- I'm sorry,
I don't know who that is.

724
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,629
- It's the company
you tried to poach from me.

725
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,065
- You seem upset.
- I'm not upset.

726
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,700
I just wanted to remind you
you once told me

727
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,503
I was a piece of sh-- for using
your daughter against you,

728
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,972
But now you turn around
and use louis against me?

729
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,174
- No, that's not the same.
- It is to me.

730
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:27,244
I may fight with him,
but he's still my family.

731
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,213
- Then why did he leave?
- That's between me and louis.

732
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:34,151
- I wanted versalife, but it's
not worth gloating over.

733
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,619
So why are you really here,
harvey?

734
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,587
- I'm here to ask you
to take louis anyway.

735
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,222
- And why would I do that?

736
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,657
- 'cause you're a smart man.

737
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,361
If you do it, I'll owe you one.

738
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,463
- I don't need you owin' me one.

739
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,066
- Why don't you take the night
to think about it?

740
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:54,004
You can never have
too many favors in the bank.

741
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,746
- You wanted to see me?

742
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,415
- I heard about versalife.

743
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,285
Good work.

744
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,619
It wasn't you.

745
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,221
- No, it wasn't.

746
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,724
- You know I thought it was you.

747
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,158
- Harvey didn't tell me,

748
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,394
But I didn't just
fall off the turnip truck.

749
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:20,430
- No, you didn't.

750
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,099
- What?

751
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:26,103
- Every damn time I think
there's no upside to having you,

752
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,371
You do some sh--
to make me think

753
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,207
It's actually nice
to have you around.

754
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:36,313
- We're good after you
bill a few more hours tonight.

755
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,748
- Well, that's gonna
have to wait until later,

756
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,118
Because I am definitely
going out to celebrate.

757
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,686
- You've earned it.

758
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:46,790
- Jessica.

759
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:51,661
She did what harvey
would have done for you.

760
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,575
- Jessica.
- Katrina.

761
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,810
- Is this about the--

762
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:09,346
- I can either fire you...

763
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:11,448
Or you can resign.

764
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,651
The choice is yours.

765
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:15,752
- You know?

766
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:18,155
- I know.

767
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:21,124
- Then why are you being
so nice about it?

768
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,460
- Because letting you go
is enough.

769
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:26,329
- And you also don't want
to antagonize me,

770
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,632
Since I'll be working
for robert zane.

771
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,635
- You haven't heard?

772
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:35,272
We got versalife back.

773
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,340
Louis won't be going to zane,

774
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:42,546
And neither will you.

775
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,649
I wish you luck.

776
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:47,184
- You'll have my letter
of resignation on your desk

777
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,218
In the morning.

778
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:29,626
- Well, if I were, I'd say you'd
gone three times in an hour.

779
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,362
- Yes,
and this is our third drink.

780
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,498
- You know they have medicine
for that, right?

781
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,499
- You saying I'm old?

782
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,733
- Yes, but I'm also saying

783
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,268
I know you haven't been goin'
to the bathroom.

784
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,803
- All right, you want the truth?

785
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:40,904
I've been calling donna.

786
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,806
- Oh my god, that is so great.

787
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,175
You guys finally
decided to take the plunge.

788
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,511
- I wanted to know
if robert zane called me back.

789
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:50,447
- I asked him to hire louis
anyway.

790
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,249
- You're kidding.
- I'm not.

791
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,783
I even told him
if he did I'd owe him one.

792
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,586
- Hmm.
- What?

793
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:57,854
- Oh, I'm just tryin'
to figure out at what point

794
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,690
In the last week
you decided to become a pussy.

795
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:04,261
- Oh, so doing something nice
for someone makes you a pussy?

796
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,762
- I didn't say that exactly.
- Yes, you did.

797
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,532
You've done for people.
- Okay, you know what, harvey?

798
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:12,769
I am nice, and if that makes me
a pussy, then so be it.

799
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,238
- Then it's settled:
You're a nice pussy.

800
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,908
Miss, can I get a cosmo
here for my friend?

801
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,509
- Go ahead, order another drink.

802
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,279
Be in the bathroom
in another five minutes.

803
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,780
- You going back
to the prostate again?

804
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,249
- What, like you've never
repeated jokes before?

805
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,585
- I have no idea what--
- what I'm talking about?

806
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:29,853
Let's see uh, "you see,

807
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,588
That's funny,
because blah-blah-blah,"

808
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,823
Or "by blah-blah-blah,
I mean blah-blah-blah."

809
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,792
- Okay, I get it.
- Oh, I'm just getting started.

810
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,761
I could do this all night.
- Hey, you know what?

811
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:38,962
Now I have to go
to the bathroom.

812
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,598
- Go for it.
Take your time, no rush.

813
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,669
If it hurts, call someone.

814
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,249
- Louis, what
are you doing here?

815
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,685
- I'm waiting for harvey.

816
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:05,288
- Harvey's not here.

817
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,656
- Then you'll have to do.

818
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,425
- Look, louis,

819
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,694
I know you've been
through a lot,

820
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:11,928
But harvey's gonna--

821
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,564
- I don't give a sh--
what harvey's gonna do.

822
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:18,635
- Okay, you're scaring me.

823
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,944
- You know what an oscar
looks like?

824
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,847
- What?
- Academy award. Bald guy.

825
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,516
I mean, of course
we all know what it looks like,

826
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,452
But especially you,
you're an actress.

827
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:39,556
I mean, of course you don't need
to be told what it is.

828
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,025
- What are you talking about?
- The highest academic honor

829
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:46,396
In harvard law is
the order of the coif.

830
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,932
You don't get a trophy.

831
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,334
You get three things.

832
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,671
You get a parchment
to hang on your wall,

833
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:57,741
A medal to wear at graduation,

834
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:00,443
And this.

835
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,981
Now, this key
doesn't say "order of the coif."

836
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,549
It doesn't say anything.

837
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:07,917
It's just a symbol.

838
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,386
- What does that have
to do with harvey?

839
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:10,954
- It doesn't.
It has to do with mike.

840
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,523
- You know what, louis?
It's been a long day, can--

841
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:17,794
- It's about to get longer.

842
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:21,398
See, mike asked me about this.

843
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,968
And I thought he was--

844
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,372
I thought he was trying to get
my mind off of my problems,

845
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,408
But then he did it again.

846
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,943
And it got me to thinking:

847
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:38,615
Mike graduated magna cum laude.

848
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:42,819
He's in order of the coif.

849
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,488
But he didn't recognize this.

850
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,757
- So he forgot a stupid key.

851
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,627
- Mike ross doesn't forget
anything.

852
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,796
See, the reason
he didn't recognize this

853
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:58,335
Was because he never got one,
because...

854
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,638
He didn't go to harvard.

855
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,773
- Louis, we've been
down this road before.

856
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,075
Mike is the harvard database.

857
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:06,943
- But he's not in the yearbook,

858
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:10,947
His address during his law
school years was in new york.

859
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,784
He even paid rent the first
of the month in person.

860
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:18,021
- Well, I'm sure there's an--
- sit down!

861
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,658
Last year, you told me not to
tell sheila about mike's file.

862
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,828
You acted like you cared
about me.

863
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,098
You didn't give a sh-- about me.

864
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,033
You cared about you!

865
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,034
And harvey!
- No.

866
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,402
- And mike!
- No.

867
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,937
- And jessica!
- Louis, that's not true!

868
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:36,473
- Well, let's call sheila
right now.

869
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:38,541
I know all of the numbers
by heart.

870
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,810
I mean, she may not
be interested in me anymore,

871
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,480
But she will definitely be
interested in a fraud claiming

872
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:46,549
That he went to harvard.

873
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:57,060
- I'm sorry.

874
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:02,532
- You're sorry?

875
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:06,603
You've been lying to me
since the day mike ross arrived.

876
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:12,108
I knew harvey and jessica
never really accepted me,

877
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,544
But I thought
you were different.

878
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,546
I thought you were my friend.

879
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:21,518
- I am your friend, louis.
- No, you're not.

880
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,823
And don't you ever
say that to me again.

881
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,492
- Where are you going?

882
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:33,663
- To see your friend jessica.

883
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,605
Louis knows.

884
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,513
- Louis.

885
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:51,981
- I know you're a stickler
for the rules,

886
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,517
So I figured I'd just
come by to return my I.D.

887
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,487
- I want to see you
perp walked through the bullpen

888
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:01,157
With your pretty little jacket
draped over your handcuffs.

889
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,928
But until then, yeah,
I'll take an explanation.

890
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,932
- When I found out the truth
about mike ross,

891
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,201
It had already been done.

892
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:13,903
- By harvey?

893
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:17,474
Right after he
made senior partner over me?

894
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,676
That's when he hired the fraud?

895
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,077
That's the correct timeline,
right?

896
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,745
- Yes.

897
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,080
- So instead of turning him in,

898
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,216
You cover it up.
- Louis--

899
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,718
- And the one time
that I do something...

900
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,689
You don't cover it up at all.

901
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,224
You throw me to the wolves.

902
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:36,493
- I saved you from the wolves.

903
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:39,128
- Then I ask you
for the smallest gesture,

904
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,564
Just to allow my career
to continue with dignity,

905
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:46,503
And you couldn't muster
the tiniest shred of compassion.

906
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,039
- What do you want me to say?

907
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:54,577
- I want you to tell me
you're a liar!

908
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:58,648
And a hypocrite!

909
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,289
I want you to say you're sorry.

910
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,732
- I am a liar.

911
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:19,802
And I am a hypocrite.

912
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,108
But I will not say I'm sorry,

913
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:29,312
Because I did what I did
to protect this firm.

914
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:31,948
- Well, looks like the captain's
about to go down with her ship.

915
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,117
- Bullsh--.

916
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,718
You want something.

917
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,253
- Oh, I told you.
I want to see you in--

918
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,155
- In handcuffs?

919
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:43,226
If that were true, the police
would be here instead of you.

920
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:48,197
No, you wanted to see me squirm

921
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,268
Before asking me
for what you really want.

922
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,107
I'm not gonna
give you the satisfaction,

923
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:02,178
So you might as well
spit it out.

924
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,647
- You asked me what I wanted
once before, and I told you,

925
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:09,252
And then you told me
that I couldn't have it.

926
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:13,723
But now I can.

927
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,626
Pearson...

928
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:21,064
