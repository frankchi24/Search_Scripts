1
00:00:01,218 --> 00:00:02,918
Mike Ross never went
to law school.

2
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:04,853
I knew it,
and I hired him anyway.

3
00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:06,188
I still can't stay, Harvey.

4
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,323
I know.

5
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:09,458
I just want to stop lying
to the people I love.

6
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:11,160
This makes it look like
Forstman's payment

7
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:12,361
never went to
any offshore accounts.

8
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:13,662
That's forgery.

9
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:15,498
Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

10
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:16,532
I had no choice.

11
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,898
Bullshit, you had no choice.

12
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:19,834
You could've said no at
any goddamn point along the way.

13
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:22,403
One thing is for sure:
When all this is over,

14
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,305
I'm gonna fire the shit
out of you.

15
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,340
I went to Robert Zane,

16
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,674
and I asked him
to give Louis a job.

17
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,010
You want to see if I can break
my partnership agreement.

18
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:31,513
If you can't do that,
what the hell good are you?

19
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,848
Louis won't be going to Zane,
and neither will you.

20
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:36,083
I'm here to ask you
to take Louis anyway.

21
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:37,385
And why would I do that?

22
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:38,453
If you do, I'll owe you one.

23
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:39,887
Mike Ross doesn't forget
anything.

24
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,789
See, the reason
he didn't recognize this

25
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:43,724
is because he didn't go
to Harvard.

26
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,428
You've been lying to me
since the day Mike Ross arrived.

27
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:48,630
I am your friend, Louis.

28
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:49,697
No, you're not.

29
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,231
And don't you ever say that
to me again.

30
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,699
You might as well
spit it out.

31
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,235
You asked me what I wanted
once before, and I told you,

32
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,070
and then you told me
that I couldn't have it.

33
00:00:57,104 --> 00:01:00,574
Pearson...

34
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:05,078
Specter...

35
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:06,880
Litt.

36
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:19,926
♪

37
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:48,854
Want to tell me
what was so important

38
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:49,888
I had to get back here?

39
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,824
He knows.

40
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:55,427
I know what you're thinking.

41
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:59,031
Why didn't Donna tell you?

42
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:03,168
I'll tell you why.

43
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:05,637
Because as my first official act
as name as name partner,

44
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,671
I told her not to.

45
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:09,141
What?

46
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,143
You heard me.

47
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:12,611
You can look at her
as long as you want.

48
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:13,978
She can't help you.

49
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:16,147
Because my name's going up there
first thing tomorrow.

50
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,181
No, it isn't.

51
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:18,283
Yes, it is.

52
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:19,484
But it won't be tomorrow.

53
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:20,798
I'm not waiting
just so you can--

54
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,053
Louis, I have to sell this

55
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,388
to the senior partners.

56
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:26,090
I can't just slap your name
up there one morning.

57
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,592
You did it for him.

58
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:28,826
I didn't resign the week before.

59
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,395
- I don't care.
- Louis.

60
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:31,463
That's enough.

61
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:33,197
This is going to take time,

62
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,832
and while it does, you're going
to keep this to yourself.

63
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,200
Bullshit.

64
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:38,102
You're just trying to buy time
so you can get out of this.

65
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,437
I'm not trying to buy anything.

66
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:43,275
We have an agreement,
and this is for your own good.

67
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,643
Well, for your own good,

68
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:46,877
you better remember what I'll do
if this takes too long.

69
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:53,636
Please tell me
you had no other choice.

70
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:54,885
You know damn well I didn't.

71
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,086
No, I don't.

72
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,954
That's because
you didn't see him.

73
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,123
All he's ever thought about
since the day he was born

74
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,592
was getting this

75
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:03,960
So if I have to choose
between giving it to him

76
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:04,995
and going to jail--

77
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:06,069
He really threatened that?

78
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:07,698
He didn't just threaten it.

79
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:09,566
He was going to do it.

80
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,067
And what are we going to do?

81
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,370
We're going to take it.

82
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,773
We give him this,
it is never gonna end.

83
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:19,510
Harvey, before you say
another word to me,

84
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:21,578
I want you to think
about the fact

85
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:25,014
that I just ate
a big bowl of shit

86
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:26,982
because you brought that kid
into my house.

87
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:29,985
And I had to take it,

88
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,688
so you're going to take it.

89
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,129
Harvey.

90
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,130
You don't need to say it.

91
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,800
Yeah, I do.

92
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,035
Louis came looking for you,
and I didn't know what to do.

93
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,004
He was gonna call Sheila
and tell her everything.

94
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,540
I'd never seen him
like that before.

95
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:51,541
Donna, this is not on you.

96
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:53,476
Yes, it is.

97
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,844
He pressed me,
and I broke.

98
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:57,946
It doesn't matter,
because he already knew.

99
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,214
How can you know that?

100
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,783
Because I know Louis,
and I know you.

101
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:03,585
And he couldn't have broken you

102
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,186
unless he knew
the truth already.

103
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:06,855
So this is not your fault,

104
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,609
and I never want to hear you
say that again.

105
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,692
I should've at least warned you
before you got here.

106
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,807
All that would have done
was antagonize him even more

107
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,231
because he would've known
you did it.

108
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:18,600
You did everything
you could've done.

109
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,934
Okay.

110
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:24,573
We have to tell Mike.

111
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,707
No, we don't.
Not now.

112
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:26,707
Harvey.

113
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,609
Look, I'll tell him
in the morning.

114
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,977
We just had a huge win,

115
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,012
and I am not in the mood
to ruin his night.

116
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:39,587
Louis.

117
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,124
What are you doing here?

118
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,729
They didn't tell you.

119
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:50,063
Tell me what?

120
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:53,967
Jessica made me name partner.

121
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,002
But, uh--

122
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,637
But? But?

123
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,037
But what?

124
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:00,707
I resigned in shame?

125
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:04,076
Well, that's all changed,
and it's all because of you.

126
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,378
Remember this?

127
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:06,679
No, you don't,

128
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:10,617
because you can't remember
something you never knew.

129
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:12,251
Cool to the end.

130
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:15,254
Well, it doesn't matter,
because Donna told me.

131
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:16,656
And Harvey.

132
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,824
And Jessica.

133
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,126
When I told them
that I knew you were a fraud,

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,629
did they run from you
like you were the plague.

135
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:23,663
What do you want?

136
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:25,064
I already got
what I wanted from you.

137
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:26,666
- Name partner.
- You must want something else.

138
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,980
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

139
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,669
See, that's what
I love about you, Mike.

140
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,871
Almost always a step ahead.

141
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:33,640
What I want from you

142
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:36,876
is to know that you're dead
at my law firm.

143
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:38,077
You can't fire me.

144
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,813
Why would I fire you
when I can break you?

145
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:45,151
You see, I'm going to bury you
under a mountain of shit so big

146
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:47,453
you're going to be begging me
to take it off.

147
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,287
And all you have to do
is say two simple words--

148
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:51,356
the same two words
that you <i>let</i> me say

149
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,459
to Harvey and Jessica.

150
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:55,861
"I resign."

151
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:05,604
Louis.

152
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,539
- What are you doing here?
- Leaving.

153
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:10,542
That way I don't have to look at
either one of you two liars.

154
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:17,415
Oh, my God, he knows.

155
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,018
He doesn't just know.

156
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:21,954
He's a name partner.

- You know.
- Yeah, I know.

169
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,060
And a little heads up
would've been nice.

170
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,328
I wanted to give you the night.

171
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:08,797
Well, the night
kind of got blown up

172
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:10,398
when Louis showed up
at my apartment

173
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,367
and said
he was gonna break me.

174
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:13,834
What do you want from me,
Mike?

175
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,037
I want to know how you let him
become name partner.

176
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,705
Would you rather we let him go
to the police?

177
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,008
I don't believe that Louis
would actually go to the police.

178
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,242
He would because Jessica said
he would.

179
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:22,276
So if you're here to say

180
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,711
that we can figure
some way out of it,

181
00:07:23,745 --> 00:07:25,146
that's not going to happen.

182
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,182
He knows, and it's done.

183
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:29,983
Did you hear what I said?

184
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,252
Louis came to my apartment
filled with rage,

185
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,520
and he told me
he was making it

186
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,755
his personal mission
to break me.

187
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,790
Then you make it your mission
not to let him.

188
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,493
Harvey, he's name partner.

189
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,161
Did I ever tell you
the story about the gym?

190
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,063
I'm not really in the mood
for a story right now.

191
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,665
Then you're going to hear it
anyway.

192
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,437
When I was a kid,
my father put me in boxing camp.

193
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,739
Middle of summer, 90 degrees.

194
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,874
Every day after sparring
in that,

195
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,644
they'd make you do 100 laps
and 50 pull-ups.

196
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,446
They'd push you
until you either threw up

197
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,948
or passed out or both.

198
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,184
Anyone could leave at any point.

199
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,298
All you had to do was quit.

200
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,719
And let me guess,
you didn't quit.

201
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,088
I quit every goddamn day.

202
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,257
I just never
said it out loud.

203
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,791
Because no way
was I gonna give them

204
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,961
the satisfaction
of breaking me.

205
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,631
So I guess it's time for me
to drop down and give Louis 20.

206
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,167
I think it's gonna be
a little more than 20, buddy.

207
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,180
I see you noticed

208
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,049
I scraped your little
associate title away.

209
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,484
<i>You</i> scraped it away?

210
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,351
Yeah, just like
I'm gonna scrape you away,

211
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:42,953
starting with these.

212
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:44,221
Oh, Louis, go ahead.

213
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:46,223
Give me all of the shittiest
cases that you can find,

214
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:47,924
but I'm telling you,

215
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,992
it's not gonna break me.

216
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:51,027
You overestimate yourself.

217
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,163
Did you think when I said
I was going to bury you in shit,

218
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,198
I meant legal work?

219
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,466
No, no, no.

220
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,700
You're not a lawyer,

221
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,135
which means
you must be a paralegal,

222
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:02,839
and that's exactly the kind
of work you're gonna be doing.

223
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,808
Louis, you can't do this.

224
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,343
Everyone out there
thinks of me as a lawyer.

225
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,777
And two days ago,
they thought of me

226
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,059
as someone who used to
work here.

227
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,447
Look at us now.

228
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,282
Oh, and if you're thinking
of crying to Harvey.

229
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:14,484
that would be
a major mistake,

230
00:09:14,518 --> 00:09:17,020
because this is
between you and me.

231
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,596
What are you doing here?

232
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,498
I'm here because
I know you're angry

233
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:30,633
and you're feeling betrayed,
but I am not gonna let you

234
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,502
throw our friendship away.

235
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:33,603
I can't throw away something

236
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:35,138
that never existed
in the first place.

237
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,612
- Louis--
- Donna, we're not friends.

238
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,108
We were never friends, because
it was all based on a lie.

239
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,709
So you think my giving you this

240
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,612
and every other nice thing
that I ever did for you

241
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,580
was just to keep you from
finding out about Mike?

242
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,582
No, I don't.

243
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:47,916
But I do think
if you had the chance

244
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,519
to take back
all those nice things you did

245
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,954
in exchange for me never finding
out about your little secret,

246
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,088
you'd do it in a heartbeat.

247
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:54,556
You want a chance
to tell me the truth?

248
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,092
Go ahead.
Tell me the truth right now.

249
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,961
And that answers my question.

250
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:00,029
You know what, Louis?

251
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,296
It was a
bullshit question

252
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,598
designed to do nothing
but make me feel like shit.

253
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,200
Mission accomplished.

254
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,869
And now I'm gonna tell you
what I told Mike.

255
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:08,837
- You're dead to me.
- Okay.

256
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:10,839
You want to hate me?
Hate me.

257
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,708
You want to hate Mike?
Hate Mike.

258
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,843
But everybody at this firm
can't be dead to you,

259
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:17,212
because sooner or later,
you're going to need someone.

260
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:18,313
Thank you, Donna,

261
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,515
but that someone
isn't going to be you.

262
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,056
Donna said
you wanted to see me.

263
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,158
No,
I didn't want to see you,

264
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:31,759
I needed to see you.

265
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:33,194
I know you're under
a lot of stress,

266
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,597
but that was a one-time thing.

267
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:37,199
I don't need you to do that
to me.

268
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,366
Louis has
already done it.

269
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,534
What are you talking about?

270
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:40,634
Look at this.

271
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,370
He's buried me
in paralegal work.

272
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:45,445
Okay, that's bullshit.
He can't treat you like that.

273
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:47,508
Rachel, I don't care
how he treats me, all right?

274
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,510
I can take it
until he gets over this.

275
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:50,977
But look at these deadlines.

276
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,680
There's no way I can get
all of this work done

277
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:53,714
on time without your help.

278
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,268
I will do whatever you need,
but, Mike,

279
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:57,618
he is not going to get over it
until you make him get over it.

280
00:10:57,652 --> 00:10:59,953
- Rachel, please--
- Mike.

281
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:03,624
The day after what happened
in here happened,

282
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:04,758
I shut you out.

283
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,127
But then, a week later,
you came to my door,

284
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:09,830
and you said you weren't gonna
let me go without a fight.

285
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:11,198
That is not the same.

286
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:13,166
I wanted you
to fall in love with me.

287
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,669
I was already in love with you,
and you knew it.

288
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,304
Yeah, well,
Louis is a lot of things,

289
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,441
but he's not in love with me.

290
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:24,444
He used to be.

291
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:26,379
You just have to
make him remember that.

292
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,118
Okay, the first thing
we need to do

293
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:32,619
is finish all of this work.

294
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:33,819
Okay.

295
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:36,422
Unless, of course,
that offer still stands.

296
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:37,857
I don't recall making an offer.

297
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,659
You did say
whatever I need.

298
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,026
That's not what I meant.

299
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:43,829
And then you said never
take no for an answer, so...

300
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:49,201
Lock the doors.

301
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:50,903
- Are you serious--
- Take yes for an answer.

302
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:52,405
I'm locking the door.

303
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,575
Louis, you sounded urgent
on the phone.

304
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:57,609
What's going on?

305
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,411
I'll tell you what's going on.

306
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:00,946
I'm back at
Pearson Specter.

307
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,148
What?

308
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:03,182
I don't understand.

309
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:05,684
Let me explain it to you.

310
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,219
I just became name partner.

311
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:11,023
Louis, this is amazing.

312
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,825
I'm so happy for you.

313
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:13,959
Okay, well, you can keep
being happy for me,

314
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,227
but you better start
being happy for you,

315
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:16,427
because I'm bringing you back.

316
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:19,197
What?
I--oh.

317
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:21,532
Katrina Amanda Bennett,

318
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,769
will you be my associate?

319
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:27,839
Louis Marlowe Litt,

320
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,740
I will be your associate.

321
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,142
Again.

322
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,844
You've just made me
the happiest attorney on earth.

323
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,913
When do we consummate our new
preexisting relationship?

324
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:37,115
As soon as my new position
is official.

325
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,417
- Wait, why isn't it official?
- I can't tell you that.

326
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,519
Louis, I think I've more than
proven you can trust me.

327
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,553
Oh, are you kidding me?

328
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,754
You're the only one
I can trust.

329
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:44,822
It's not that.
It's just--

330
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:46,376
Okay, Louis,
you don't need to tell me.

331
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,795
But if you won't tell me,
and they won't tell the world,

332
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:51,962
something's wrong.

333
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:53,397
Katrina, I know what I'm doing.

334
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:55,098
And Jessica knows
what she's doing,

335
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,934
which is playing you for a fool.

336
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,157
Harvey, I was just gonna
call you.

337
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:08,325
I'll save you the trouble.

338
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,193
We're bringing Louis Litt
back to the firm.

339
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:11,328
That doesn't matter.

340
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:12,642
Because that call was
to tell you

341
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,597
I'm hiring him,
and you owe me.

342
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:16,132
Bullshit.

343
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,434
You calling me a liar?

344
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:18,628
I'm not calling you anything,

345
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,837
but you are calling
Sylvia out there a liar.

346
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:23,073
Oh, no, no,
Sylvia wouldn't tell you shit.

347
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,107
Wrong.

348
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:25,342
One compliment
about her hair,

349
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:28,911
and she told me you gave Louis
the bad news an hour ago.

350
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,613
See you around, Robert.

351
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:33,116
Harvey, one more thing.

352
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,185
You do still owe me
that favor.

353
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:36,418
What kind of math
are you doing?

354
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,220
The kind of math
that says Jessica Pearson

355
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:41,056
hiring Louis Litt back
adds up to shady.

356
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:43,131
If that's all you've got,
you can collect your favor

357
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,694
when the clock strikes
kiss my ass,

358
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:46,996
because partners leave firms
and come back all the time.

359
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,932
Maybe, but they don't come back
with their name on the wall.

360
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,002
Ah, I'm guessing he wasn't
supposed to tell me that.

361
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:57,239
But he did, and Louis Litt
is not name partner material,

362
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,575
which means he must have
something on you.

363
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,677
So unless you want me
going around town

364
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:03,612
flapping my big mouth
that something isn't right

365
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:07,649
in your kitchen, you're gonna
make good on that favor.

366
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:09,518
Sylvia didn't slip up at all,
did she?

367
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:10,552
No, she didn't.

368
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,587
You have your girl Friday;
I have mine.

369
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:14,489
But you can still tell her
how nice her hair looks

370
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:15,624
on the way out.

371
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:17,291
I'll be in touch.

372
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:23,464
Oh, you're tapping out already?

373
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,499
I thought you'd have
a lot more backbone than that.

374
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:28,202
I'm not tapping out.

375
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:29,470
I finished all of the work--

376
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,138
Which I expected to be done
an hour ago.

377
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:33,908
Come on, Louis, you didn't
expect it to be done at all.

378
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,510
Just like
you didn't expect this.

379
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:37,845
What the hell is that?

380
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,513
It's a gift certificate.

381
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:40,948
What, are you trying
to bribe me now?

382
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:45,318
It's not a bribe,
it's a reminder.

383
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:49,122
Look, the gift certificate is
from Peter's Steak House,

384
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:51,158
the place that you and I saved
together.

385
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,292
And after we saved it,

386
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,294
you told me that
we had something in common.

387
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,295
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

388
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,329
Yes, you do,

389
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,564
because what we had
in common

390
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:00,633
was a love of the law.

391
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:01,988
You told me that
when you asked me

392
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:06,039
to be your associate, Louis,
and I am still the same person.

393
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,274
And if I found out a woman
I had something in common with

394
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,276
was actually a man,
I wouldn't keep seeing her.

395
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,812
Okay, what I did is not at all
the same thing.

396
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,847
No, it's worse.

397
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,282
You say you love the law
so much,

398
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,151
but every single case
you've ever touched is tainted.

399
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,320
So you get exposed,
Peter's gets bulldozed.

400
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,489
It wouldn't even be there
to get bulldozed

401
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,991
if you and I hadn't
worked together.

402
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,858
All right, genius.
You want to work together?

403
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,294
You love the law so much?

404
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,797
You're gonna memorize
every case that I've ever done.

405
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,831
Louis.

406
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,865
No, get to work,

407
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,701
and use that magnificent
memory of yours

408
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,735
for something more than

409
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,436
bullshitting
your way through life.

410
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,113
We have a problem.

411
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,982
Unless it's urgent,
I don't have the time.

412
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,882
Louis is telling people.

413
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,217
What people?

414
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,518
For starters, Robert Zane.

415
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,721
Why the hell is Louis even
talking to Robert Zane?

416
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,023
I asked him to hire Louis
after we took back VersaLife.

417
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,591
And you didn't think to tell me
that after last night?

418
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,859
I was handling it.

419
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,661
From what I can tell,
you handled it like shit.

420
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:04,762
So this is my fault?

421
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,076
Well, it sure as hell
isn't mine.

422
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,297
You know what, Jessica,
I'm not the one

423
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:08,532
who wanted to fire Louis,

424
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,434
and I'm not the one who wanted
to deny him clients.

425
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:12,770
I did that because of
his performance as an attorney.

426
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:16,006
You antagonized him for years
for your own pleasure.

427
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,340
Tell yourself
whatever you want.

428
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,042
You handed out
your share of abuse.

429
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,744
Tell yourself
whatever you want.

430
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,079
You're the one who hired a fraud
and gave Louis leverage.

431
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,714
And I told you
Louis would get worse,

432
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:25,909
and you said
I had to take it.

433
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,483
Well, I don't care whose fault
it is,

434
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,552
he is getting worse,
and I'm not gonna take it.

435
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,688
Oh, yes, you are.

436
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,023
You're going to take it,

437
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:34,891
and you're gonna do it
with a smile on your face

438
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,393
until I say otherwise.

439
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,462
And what the hell
are you gonna do?

440
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:42,831
I'm going to clean up this mess
once and for all.

441
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,702
What do you mean,
you don't have

442
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:48,170
diamond-encrusted
business cards?

443
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,805
Fine, what about
the embossed ivory?

444
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,107
Okay, great, well, how much
would 10,000 of those run me?

445
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:54,143
Money's no object.

446
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,977
What, are you crazy?
I'm not paying that much.

447
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,412
Unless it comes
with a reach-around.

448
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,347
Which, by the way,
I'm still not paying that much.

449
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:00,749
Elite Printing, my ass.

450
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,753
I give you
one simple instruction--

451
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:08,556
to keep your mouth shut--
and you couldn't even do that.

452
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,959
Um, okay, did you make
an appointment with Norma?

453
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,260
- What?
- To see me.

454
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:16,263
Did you check
with my secretary, Norma?

455
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:18,099
Cut the shit, Louis.
I'm not in the mood.

456
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,367
Well, get in the mood,
because I hold all the cards.

457
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:22,436
And those cards are getting you
your name on the wall,

458
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,705
but you need
to keep this to yourself.

459
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:24,772
Why?

460
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,240
So you can figure out a way
to screw me?

461
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:27,641
I gave you my word.

462
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:31,544
Well, no disrespect, Jessica,
but your word means shit.

463
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,479
So if you want me
to stop telling people,

464
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:37,017
you better start
telling people yourself.

465
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:38,618
I told you, in good time.

466
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:42,055
And I just told you
I don't give a shit.

467
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,791
So I suggest you call a meeting
with the senior partners.

468
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:46,126
Those meetings are
on Thursdays.

469
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,460
Well, consider today Thursday.

470
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:50,563
I told you, I have yet
to figure out how to sell it.

471
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:52,766
You want to sell it?
I'll tell you how to sell it.

472
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,601
You and Harvey do it together,

473
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:57,604
you do it like you mean it.
and you do it now.

474
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:59,305
Got it? Good.

475
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,812
I'm sure
you've all heard rumors

476
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,481
about why we called
this meeting,

477
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:12,484
but that's because it's hard
to keep good news quiet.

478
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:14,386
We'll be making this official
later this week

479
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,056
but we're here to announce
our newest name partner,

480
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:22,393
Louis Litt.

481
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:28,332
Thank you, Jessica.

482
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:31,102
Harvey.

483
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:34,505
Some of you may be wondering
how this happened.

484
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:36,207
There's a simple explanation,

485
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,610
and all it requires is for me
to admit something.

486
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:43,013
I made a mistake.

487
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:46,817
I never should have accepted
Louis's resignation,

488
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:48,952
because not only is he
a billing machine

489
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:50,486
and a damn good attorney,

490
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:53,056
he has personally gotten me
out of more than one jam,

491
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,591
and there's no one
I'd rather have my name next to

492
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:58,829
than my friend Louis Litt.

493
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:01,798
Thank you, Harvey.

494
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,868
Even though it's "not official,"
I already feel like

495
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:07,436
my name's been up there
as long as yours.

496
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:11,273
And I definitely feel like

497
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:16,278
it's gonna be up there
for a long, long time.

498
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:22,885
A lot of good that did.

499
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,186
Leave it to Louis to take
his big moment like a dick.

500
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:26,221
Harvey, calm down.

501
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:27,222
Calm down?

502
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:28,823
I just did exactly
what he wanted,

503
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,818
and he acted like a dick,
and he's not gonna stop.

504
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:33,494
He's not gonna stop because
you didn't do what he wanted.

505
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,763
Jessica, I just got up there
and kissed his ass

506
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:37,165
in front of
the entire partnership

507
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,366
and pretended to like it.

508
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,500
Exactly.

509
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:40,534
Pretended.

510
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:43,203
Oh, you want me
to actually like it?

511
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:45,038
I want you to make him
feel accepted.

512
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:46,240
Jessica.

513
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:48,242
Harvey, what Louis wants
is to be accepted.

514
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:49,436
And like it or not,
the person

515
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,111
he wants that from
the most is you.

516
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:53,046
So you're gonna go to him,
you're gonna make nice,

517
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,783
and that's how we're gonna
put all of this to bed.

518
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,618
You want to tell me
what the hell that was?

519
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,787
If you'll excuse me,

520
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,922
I'm gonna let Jessica handle
this conversation.

521
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,524
I have to go kill myself.

522
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,962
Jeff, I can't do this
right now.

523
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:10,163
Should I make an appointment?

524
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:12,332
Because the partners may have
bought that fairy tale

525
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,068
about Louis's triumphant return,
but they don't know what I know.

526
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:16,103
What exactly is that?

527
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:18,138
That Louis committed a crime,

528
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:20,407
and then he resigned
five seconds

529
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,175
before you were
about to fire him.

530
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,479
And now he's not only back,
he's name partner.

531
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:29,582
I reconsidered,
which, as managing partner,

532
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:30,750
I am entitled to do.

533
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:33,920
And as someone with a brain,
I'm entitled

534
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:38,190
to come to the conclusion
that Louis has something on you.

535
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,861
Jeff, you said you didn't
want me to lie to you anymore,

536
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:43,296
and I'm trying
like hell not to.

537
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,964
And that's the same thing
as lying to me.

538
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:45,998
No, it's not.

539
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,034
Oh, you are one hell of
a lawyer.

540
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:51,704
So are you,
which is why you're here.

541
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:53,540
So I'll come clean.

542
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:56,275
I can't tell you the truth
about this,

543
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,745
and that's as honest as
I can be with you right now.

544
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,414
Can you handle that?

545
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:05,517
I can handle it for now.

546
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:07,252
But I won't handle it
forever.

547
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:17,863
Louis, what are you doing here?

548
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:20,131
I noticed you haven't
congratulated me yet,

549
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,033
so I wanted to give you
a chance to make up for it.

550
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,102
Right, congratulations.
We're all so happy for you.

551
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,136
Is that what you wanted?

552
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,838
Seemed a little disingenuous.

553
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:29,006
Then let me be clear.

554
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,307
I don't mean a word of it.

555
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:32,343
You really want to talk that way
to a new name partner?

556
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:33,744
I'm talking to you that way

557
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,013
because you threatened to throw
the man that I love in jail

558
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,482
to become
that name partner.

559
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:38,616
So, you know what, Louis,

560
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,150
I'm sorry
that I didn't bake you a cake.

561
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:41,185
That's too bad.

562
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:42,419
You didn't do anything for me,

563
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:45,189
but I got something for you.

564
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:46,290
Doc review.

565
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:48,225
Filings to be done
in triplicate.

566
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:51,462
Paralegal work,
since you like doing it so much.

567
00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:54,931
You know I don't like doing it
at all.

568
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:56,733
You helped your boyfriend
with his work.

569
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:58,035
You didn't think
I'd figure that out?

570
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,404
You know what?
I don't care.

571
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:01,705
You have no authority over me.

572
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm Harvey's associate.

573
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:05,275
Yeah, but I run the associates.

574
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,711
Therefore, I run you.

575
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,413
I know what you're doing.

576
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,215
But do you know
what you're doing?

577
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:12,569
Not only do you live
with a fraud,

578
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,917
you're just like him--

579
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:15,591
pretending to be a lawyer
when you're not.

580
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,987
I'm not pretending
to be anything.

581
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:17,988
I am in law school.

582
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:19,422
Are you really gonna make it
through?

583
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:20,923
You could barely handle
the LSATs.

584
00:22:20,957 --> 00:22:22,325
You couldn't get into Harvard.

585
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,593
As a matter of fact,
your boyfriend may be a fraud,

586
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:26,529
but he's a better lawyer
than you'll ever be.

587
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:29,265
You have no idea what kind of
lawyer I'm gonna be.

588
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:30,900
Don't I?

589
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,602
You learned from
the best liars around, Rachel:

590
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:37,273
Harvey, Mike,

591
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:39,642
your father.

592
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:44,414
Yeah, I know exactly the kind of
lawyer you're gonna be.

593
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,917
But until that day,
this kind of work

594
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,651
is all you're good for.

595
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,399
So you like marinated meat?

596
00:22:58,428 --> 00:22:59,494
Oh, yum.

597
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,163
Okay, wait,
but which one do you make?

598
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:02,630
Kansas City or Memphis style?

599
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,499
Oh, hell, when it comes to ribs,

600
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,501
I make 'em
every which way I can.

601
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:10,338
I am now officially starving.

602
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,207
- Harvey.
- Please have a seat.

603
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,443
Don't let my law firm get in
the way of your coffee klatch.

604
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,143
Oh, now, now,
don't blame Donna here.

605
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:18,079
I told her you and I had
some unfinished business.

606
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:19,480
Already?

607
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:22,183
What, did you pick something
out of your generic favor file?

608
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,885
I've never done anything generic
in my life.

609
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:27,654
This favor is tailor-made
for you.

610
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,923
It's very specific
and very personal.

611
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,059
We're in a little dispute
with another firm.

612
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:33,827
I need you to get them
to back off of it.

613
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:35,129
Why can't you do it yourself?

614
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,964
'Cause I don't know the lawyer
on the other side.

615
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,032
You do.
Good luck.

616
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,623
What the hell
is he talking about?

617
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,904
- It's Scottie.
- Aw, shit.

618
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:45,038
I know.

619
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:46,673
Scottie doesn't do favors
like this,

620
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,108
and I don't have any leverage
on her.

621
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:50,010
Yeah, you do.

622
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:51,812
You're just not gonna
like using it.

623
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:57,584
Hey, there you are.

624
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,739
Look, I just finished memorizing
all of Louis's cases,

625
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:02,455
and I had an idea
I wanted to run by--

626
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,057
Rachel, what happened?

627
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:07,494
Nothing happened.

628
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,394
What did Louis do?

629
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:10,997
It's nothing.

630
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,665
He found out that I helped you,

631
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:14,399
and now he's giving me
paralegal work,

632
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:16,002
and I was a little upset,
but now I'm okay.

633
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:17,302
You weren't just
a little upset.

634
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:18,604
You were crying,

635
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,405
and a little paralegal work
wouldn't do that.

636
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
It is not important.

637
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:22,407
And you know what?
I had it coming.

638
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:23,509
You had it coming?

639
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:24,744
What are you--
Rachel, what did he do?

640
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:26,278
Mike, I was the one that
told you to make up with him.

641
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:27,747
- Rachel.
- I helped you with the work.

642
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:28,848
- What did he do?
- And you know what?

643
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:29,849
I lied to him
as much as you did.

644
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:32,083
What did he do?

645
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:37,556
It's not what he did,
it's what he said.

646
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,590
What did he say?

647
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,325
Mike, I'm a big girl,

648
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,793
and I can take care of Louis.

649
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:42,927
This isn't about you,

650
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:44,996
this is about me and him,

651
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:46,765
and I'm gonna make him
remember that.

652
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:52,771
You piece of shit.

653
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:54,173
You said this was
between me and you.

654
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:55,307
It is between me and you.

655
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:56,861
No, it stopped being
between me and you

656
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,008
the second you went to Rachel.

657
00:24:58,043 --> 00:24:59,043
You put her between us

658
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,311
the second you went to her
to help you.

659
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:01,445
God, are you insane?

660
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,315
Rachel has never been
anything but kind to you.

661
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:05,783
I can't even count
the amount of times

662
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:06,917
that she defended you.

663
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,719
And now, she tries to help me
just a little bit,

664
00:25:08,753 --> 00:25:10,421
and you rip her to pieces.

665
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,923
No, that's not the help
I'm talking about, fraud.

666
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:14,958
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

667
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:17,695
You went to her to help you
lie to me about who you are,

668
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:20,431
and like the good little lackey
that she is,

669
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,600
she came to me
and lied to my face.

670
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:24,601
She did it to protect me,
Louis.

671
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:25,635
Well, good for you,

672
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:26,736
but when I found out about it,

673
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,538
I felt like shit
for the 180th time.

674
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:30,207
So I just went to her
and did the same thing.

675
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:35,978
You know, Louis,
I've just been memorizing

676
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:39,148
all of your old arguments.

677
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:42,118
I was actually gonna try
and come in here

678
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:44,588
and use one of them
to change your mind about me.

679
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:46,456
- It won't work.
- Oh, I know.

680
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,926
Because while I am the same
person that I was before,

681
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,060
you're not.

682
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:54,697
You're right.

683
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:57,266
I'm not the same person.

684
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,601
I used to be
a man of my word,

685
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:00,635
but you people taught me
that doesn't mean a thing.

686
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:02,371
So when I told you

687
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:05,441
it was between me and you,
I lied.

688
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,809
I found your weak spot,

689
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:10,178
and you know what
I'm gonna do?

690
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:12,414
I'm gonna keep hammering on her

691
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,650
until you break.

692
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,392
Jessica.

693
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:33,328
Please, if it can wait,
I've had a long day,

694
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:34,529
and I need to go home.

695
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:35,563
Too bad.

696
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:36,797
You're staying here

697
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:41,336
and drafting Louis Litt's
new partnership agreement.

698
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,071
So now you're piling on too now?

699
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,772
I'm not piling on.

700
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:47,642
I am giving you this
because it's non-billable work

701
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:51,846
and the only reason
it exists is because of you.

702
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,649
This again?

703
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:55,683
Excuse me?

704
00:26:55,684 --> 00:26:57,352
You heard me.

705
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:59,054
I've seen this movie before.

706
00:26:59,088 --> 00:27:01,155
And the reason
it keeps rerunning

707
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:03,190
is because every time
I think I'm done with you,

708
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:06,927
you and your dirty little secret
rear your ugly heads.

709
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:07,961
You know what, Jessica?

710
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:09,363
I have had it up to here

711
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:11,731
with you saying that this is
my dirty little secret.

712
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:14,101
You could have fired me when
you found out, and you didn't.

713
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,902
No, you decided to keep me
around

714
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:17,237
because you were more concerned

715
00:27:17,272 --> 00:27:19,673
with beating Daniel Hardman
and keeping your power.

716
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,041
And then you kept me around

717
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:22,642
because you didn't want to
lose Harvey.

718
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:25,011
And then you wanted to use
my secret to beat Harvey,

719
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:27,114
and then again
and again and again.

720
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:29,083
So please, Jessica,
why don't you tell me,

721
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:32,319
when the hell does this become
your dirty little secret?

722
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,103
This seat taken?

723
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,240
Hi.

724
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,809
Hey.

725
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,344
Since your message
was so cryptic,

726
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:00,413
I'm assuming
this is about business.

727
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:02,915
I need a favor.

728
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,883
Hey, Scottie.

729
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:06,018
How are you?

730
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,853
How have you been
since you left?

731
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,855
I heard that
you took some time off.

732
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,090
Where did you land?

733
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,659
I need you to settle your case
against Robert Zane.

734
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,860
And why would I do that?

735
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,162
Because I owe him one.

736
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:19,932
Harvey, I'm just getting
back on my feet at a new firm.

737
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,900
This case is winnable.

738
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:25,138
The firm knows that it is
because I told them it is.

739
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,506
I settle,
I look like shit.

740
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,274
I know that,
but you came to me once

741
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:30,143
to take it easy on you
with Folsom Foods--

742
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:32,411
Because you said if I was ever
in trouble personally--

743
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,779
I am in trouble personally.

744
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,948
What the hell is personal
about Robert Zane?

745
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,283
You don't do this for me,

746
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:41,386
Zane's going to put it together
about Mike Ross.

747
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:51,496
Scottie.

748
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,398
You selfish son of a bitch.

749
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,832
You said you told me that

750
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,135
because you didn't want to keep
lying to the people you love.

751
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,170
I didn't want to.

752
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,737
And now you come to me
trading on the fact

753
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:00,972
that I know to get you
out of a jam

754
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,740
for doing something
stupid and selfish

755
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:03,841
that drove a wedge between us

756
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,156
before we ever even
had a chance.

757
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,410
I told you the truth.

758
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,645
After it was too late.

759
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Scottie.

760
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:11,348
I loved you.

761
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:16,054
I loved you,

762
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,857
and you let some stupid secret
that I would never tell anyone

763
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:24,662
come between us because
you couldn't trust me with it.

764
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:25,697
You're right, Scottie.

765
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:29,233
I don't have a leg to stand on.

766
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,470
But if you don't do this for me,
I am in trouble.

767
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:44,614
I'm going to recommend
we settle with Robert Zane.

768
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:45,648
Thank you.

769
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:46,817
But to be clear,

770
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,952
you get to ask me this once.

771
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:50,854
And I never want to hear
the name Mike Ross again.

772
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:51,888
Scottie--

773
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:53,190
Once.

774
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,943
You wanted it to be official.

775
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:14,977
There it is, Louis.

776
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:18,013
It's official.

777
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:20,916
So that's it?

778
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,085
People are just gonna walk in
here tomorrow morning

779
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,588
like it's any other day
and see it or maybe not see it?

780
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,623
What were you expecting?

781
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,358
A ceremony and a brass band?

782
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:29,626
We don't do that.

783
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,295
Well, I'm name partner,
and I say we do now.

784
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:33,763
Excuse me?

785
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:35,631
You heard me.

786
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:38,968
I want pomp and circumstance
in the form of an unveiling.

787
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:40,836
I'm going home, Louis.

788
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:42,304
I'm not spending
the rest of the night

789
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:43,873
emailing invitations
to an unveiling.

790
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:45,040
You're going home?

791
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,842
Well, then I'll send them out
myself.

792
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:48,644
Because tomorrow...

793
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:49,779
This is happening.

794
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:50,913
4:00 p.m. sharp.

795
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:52,148
I have a meeting at 4:00.

796
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:55,951
Then reschedule it.

797
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:58,254
You don't want me
to reschedule.

798
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:01,522
What you want is
to know you've earned that.

799
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:04,625
I have earned it,

800
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,327
but I want you to know it.

801
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,595
Okay, here it is.

802
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:09,597
You got your name up there
by finding leverage

803
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:11,666
and using it to strong-arm me
into doing something

804
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,034
that I never would have done.

805
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:14,068
See, I knew you--

806
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:15,270
Let me finish.

807
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:18,372
It was a stone-cold move,

808
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:21,409
and it's exactly what Harvey
would have done.

809
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:23,678
Now, if that doesn't tell you
that you've earned it,

810
00:31:23,712 --> 00:31:25,379
then I don't know what will.

811
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,118
You still want me to reschedule
my meeting?

812
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:32,152
Yes, I do.

813
00:31:32,153 --> 00:31:34,755
Fine. I'll be there.

814
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,824
You and Harvey.

815
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:39,059
Of course, Louis.

816
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:42,062
We're your partners.

817
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:46,900
Jesus, you look like shit.

818
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:48,135
What's going on?

819
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:50,671
Between drafting Louis's
partnership agreement

820
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:54,140
for Jessica and Louis's
never-ending onslaught,

821
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:55,775
I didn't get any sleep.

822
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,250
Well, splash some water
on your face,

823
00:31:57,277 --> 00:31:58,878
'cause we have to go to
his debutante ball

824
00:31:58,912 --> 00:31:59,946
and look like we give a shit.

825
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,113
No. I'm not going.

826
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:02,468
What do you mean
you're not going?

827
00:32:02,483 --> 00:32:04,050
Now is not the time
to poke the bear.

828
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:05,084
It's too late.

829
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:06,353
The bear is an asshole,

830
00:32:06,387 --> 00:32:08,120
and he's not just taking it out
on me anymore.

831
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:09,589
- He's taking it out on Rachel.
- What?

832
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,491
Yeah, he made it clear
that he found the weak spot

833
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:13,259
that's going to get to me,
and he's gonna keep

834
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:15,595
pressing it and pressing it
until I can't take it anymore.

835
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:17,364
Mike, you are not ringing
that bell.

836
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:19,198
You're damn right
I'm not ringing that bell.

837
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:21,735
But if I have to go raise
a glass to that son of a bitch,

838
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:24,269
I'm gonna end up
smashing it over his head.

839
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:28,340
Come with me.

840
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,375
What are you going to do?

841
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:32,344
Enough is enough.

842
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:33,379
Harvey.

843
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,847
You're just in time.

844
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:36,415
Jessica's on her way down
with the partnership agreement.

845
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:37,649
You here to be my witness?

846
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:40,118
He's here to keep me
from ripping your face off.

847
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:41,712
Oh, I see.
Now that big brother's here--

848
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,021
Okay, that's enough.

849
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:44,556
Louis, you got everything
you wanted,

850
00:32:44,591 --> 00:32:46,091
and you are done
taking it out on him,

851
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,826
because no matter what you do,
I'm not letting him quit.

852
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:50,395
- Then I'll just fire him.
- You can't.

853
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,197
I can, and I will,

854
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,999
because Jessica would rather
he be fired

855
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:55,267
than you all go to jail.

856
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:56,634
No one's going to jail.

857
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:58,469
See?
She knows what's what.

858
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,738
I sign the agreement,
he's done,

859
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,573
and then I bring Katrina back
as my associate.

860
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:04,142
And that's not going
to happen.

861
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,410
What are you talking about?

862
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,604
Louis, I'm afraid you've made

863
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,446
your last dictate to me
as name partner.

864
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,515
I'm not gonna let you
take this away from me.

865
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:12,150
I'm not taking anything away
from you.

866
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,851
You are still name partner.

867
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:16,153
Right after you sign this.

868
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:19,290
I added a little something extra
after you finished drafting it.

869
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,792
This says I'm co-conspirator
to hiring a fraud.

870
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:22,826
You are.

871
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:24,094
You became one

872
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,563
the second you used him
to get your name on the door.

873
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:27,631
I know I'm not a real lawyer,

874
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:29,533
but that sounds like
he is to me.

875
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,035
I am a real lawyer.

876
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,437
He is.

877
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,471
I'm not signing it.

878
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:35,639
Louis, here's the thing.

879
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:37,841
I told you not to tell anybody
about this,

880
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,210
and then you went and
you shouted it to Robert Zane,

881
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:41,845
and then you made me
tell the partners.

882
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:44,180
And the capper is,
there are about a hundred people

883
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,482
waiting to greet you

884
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,651
after the unveiling
you arranged,

885
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:50,720
which won't happen
if you don't sign that.

886
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,025
I could still go to the police.

887
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,995
Yeah, you could,
but you won't.

888
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,464
'Cause you used
that little secret

889
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,632
to get where you are right now.

890
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:06,269
It was the only bullet
in your chamber,

891
00:34:06,303 --> 00:34:08,237
and I am taking your gun away.

892
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:09,272
You set me up.

893
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:10,373
You set yourself up,

894
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:12,342
just like you did
with Charles Forstman.

895
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:13,876
And what I learned from him was,

896
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,444
once you get something
that you want,

897
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:18,246
you will do whatever it takes
to keep it.

898
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:22,084
So why don't you go ahead
and sign

899
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:25,588
so we can get out
to your goddamn party.

900
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,097
You know, it's funny.

901
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:47,433
We've never had a ceremony
when we've changed names before,

902
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:51,436
but Louis Litt had the audacity
to convene us all here today.

903
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:54,806
And as it turns out,
his first decision

904
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,242
as name partner is brilliant,

905
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:59,777
because a ceremony like this
gives us a chance

906
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:03,815
to reevaluate where we've been
and where we're going.

907
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:05,817
Perhaps you had a disagreement
with a colleague,

908
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:09,654
or there's some other issue
that's been on your mind.

909
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:13,325
The point is, with a new name
comes a new beginning.

910
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,960
For me, I'm hoping
we can see this as a chance

911
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:18,762
to wipe the slate clean.

912
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:21,765
With that said,

913
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:25,269
here's to our newest
name partner, Louis Litt.

914
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:32,776
Nice speech.

915
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,478
Let's hope it takes.

916
00:35:34,513 --> 00:35:35,833
It's got a better chance
of taking

917
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:37,681
now that you made him sign
the agreement.

918
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:39,682
That it does.

919
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:40,883
Speaking of which,

920
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:42,852
when exactly did you know
you were gonna do that?

921
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:46,956
Oh, um, about 15 seconds
after Donna told me he knew.

922
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,092
And you didn't feel the need
to bring me in on that plan?

923
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:50,293
I felt the exact opposite.

924
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:51,407
What are you talking about?

925
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:53,596
Harvey, Louis wanted
to see you suffer.

926
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,498
If I had told you,
you would have had to fake it,

927
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:56,933
and you're a shitty actor.

928
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,101
Excuse me, but I can act.

929
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:02,137
No, everybody thinks
they can act, Harvey.

930
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:04,740
The fact of the matter is, well,
you're just a pretty face.

931
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:06,542
Oh, you think I'm pretty?

932
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:08,343
Pretty stupid.

933
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:21,490
I can't believe
it's actually up there.

934
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:25,561
This firm is changing names
more than Prince.

935
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:28,397
Who?

936
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:30,832
You're kidding, right?

937
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:32,201
<i>Purple Rain.</i>

938
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:33,302
<i>Raspberry Beret.</i>

939
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:34,836
I'm kidding.

940
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:38,607
I almost had to reevaluate
our entire relationship.

941
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:42,176
Mm-hmm, after you were gonna go
and beat Louis up for me?

942
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,545
I doubt that.

943
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,083
Mike, thank you.

944
00:36:49,118 --> 00:36:50,418
It just seemed right.

945
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:52,120
After all, you stood up
to Louis for me.

946
00:36:52,154 --> 00:36:57,225
Mm-hmm, and I almost
got pummeled for it.

947
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,160
That took guts.

948
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:03,263
And that's why I love you.

949
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:05,599
I love you too.

950
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:10,004
I wanted to tell you
that you were right.

951
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:12,606
I started this whole thing
by hiring Mike.

952
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:13,874
It's my fault.

953
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:16,443
Thank you.

954
00:37:16,477 --> 00:37:18,679
But I've been on board
long enough,

955
00:37:18,713 --> 00:37:20,914
and it's time
I accepted the fact

956
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,350
that it's my secret too.

957
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:25,218
So where do we go from here?

958
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:27,419
We fight like
hell to protect it.

959
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:39,165
No cake?

960
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,301
What are you doing here,
Jessica?

961
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:45,104
I know you're tired of waiting
for an explanation,

962
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,006
so I'm here to give you one.

963
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:50,442
You've given me explanations
before.

964
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,312
I want the truth.

965
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:55,581
Are you ready for the truth?

966
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:58,050
Because it's not pretty.

967
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:00,186
There's only one way
to find out.

968
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,624
It seems like forever ago,

969
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:08,694
but it wasn't that long ago
at all.

970
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,468
Daniel Hardman embezzled money
from the firm,

971
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,004
and I covered it up.

972
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:22,139
Now, make no mistake,

973
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,375
I found about it,
I confronted him,

974
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,545
and I eventually made him
pay it all back.

975
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,315
But I did cover it up.

976
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:35,320
From the partners,
from the police, from everyone.

977
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:39,890
I even adjusted our books
to hide the crime.

978
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,792
And being a bloodhound
about these things,

979
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:44,595
Louis found out

980
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:49,867
and used it
as leverage to come back.

981
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:51,635
As name partner.

982
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:53,270
As name partner.

983
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:58,209
Why couldn't you trust me
with that before?

984
00:38:58,243 --> 00:39:02,947
Because I didn't know
how you'd react,

985
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:08,185
and I didn't want to risk losing
everything I had.

986
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,466
Jessica,

987
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,401
your secret is safe with me.

988
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:35,411
You're late.

989
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:36,712
But I come bearing gifts.

990
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:39,014
Huh.
That doesn't look like cannoli.

991
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:40,449
It's better than cannoli, Dad.

992
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:42,251
It's the résumé
of your new associate.

993
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:43,852
If this is Harvey's way of
trying to make up

994
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:45,407
for the fact
that I didn't hire Louis--

995
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:48,157
This isn't from Harvey.
It's from me.

996
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:49,725
And you're going to do this
for me,

997
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,994
and I am not going to owe you
a thing.

998
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:53,829
This is what they're
teaching you at Columbia?

999
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:56,331
Because that's not how
favors work.

1000
00:39:56,365 --> 00:39:57,599
I know how favors work.

1001
00:39:57,633 --> 00:39:59,801
You do this, and then you want
something from me someday.

1002
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:02,504
But by then
you're going to understand

1003
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:05,774
that right now
I'm the one doing you a favor,

1004
00:40:05,808 --> 00:40:10,445
because Katrina Bennett
is an amazing lawyer.

1005
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:11,846
I was wrong about you.

1006
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,350
You're not like your mother.

1007
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:18,720
You're like your father.

1008
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:20,789
Come on.

1009
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:22,324
- Oh, that's good.
- That was a good one.

1010
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:23,491
That was a good one.

1011
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:25,459
Sounds just like me,
baby girl.

1012
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:27,594
I had you fooled, huh?

1013
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:29,062
You did.

1014
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,231
Now let me show you
how a lawyer cooks.

1015
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,773
What do you want?

1016
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:41,675
I just thought
you'd want this.

1017
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,243
The associates saved it
for you.

1018
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:44,478
No, they didn't.

1019
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:45,912
You saved it for me
because you want to pretend

1020
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:47,180
to be my friend again.

1021
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:48,849
Louis, didn't you hear
Jessica's speech?

1022
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:50,443
This is our chance
wipe the slate clean.

1023
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:51,885
I did hear her speech,

1024
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:55,355
and I know that she sent you
here to say that to me.

1025
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:56,389
No one sent me here.

1026
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:58,024
I'm here
because I want to be here.

1027
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,261
You see, that's sweet.

1028
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:04,464
But how can I ever believe
a word you say?

1029
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:08,168
I want to know
if you ever thought once

1030
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:11,271
to tell me the truth about Mike.

1031
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,006
No, I didn't.

1032
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,374
Of course you didn't.

1033
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:16,209
- Because we're not friends.
- You're wrong.

1034
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:17,610
We are friends,

1035
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:20,347
but my professional loyalty
to Harvey comes above that,

1036
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:22,215
which is why
I never told anyone--

1037
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,285
Jessica, Rachel, anyone.

1038
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,020
So put yourself in my position

1039
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:30,655
and ask yourself,
what you would have done?

1040
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:35,327
I want you to tell me
something else.

1041
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:38,830
Yes. Anything.

1042
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,165
You ever sleep with Harvey?

1043
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,201
Wait. What?

1044
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:44,836
It's not
a professional question.

1045
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,939
It's a personal question.

1046
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:49,308
Can you put our so-called
friendship high enough

1047
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,510
to answer that one honestly?

1048
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:52,611
Louis--

1049
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,380
Because it's the only thing
I can think of

1050
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:57,749
to know if I can even begin
to trust you again.

1051
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:03,354
Once.

1052
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:05,323
That's my way of wiping
the slate clean.

1053
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,392
You can accept it or not.
