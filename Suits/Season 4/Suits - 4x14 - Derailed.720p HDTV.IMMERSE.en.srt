1
00:00:06,742 --> 00:00:08,742
So I sign this, and all the
bribery allegations are gone?

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,976
And no one ever knows
a thing.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,679
You never let me tell you
what the money was for.

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,881
You didn't listen to me
when I told you I don't care.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,716
Well, do you care
that after Mike grilled me,

6
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,485
I was so impressed with him that
I wonder why I'd forgotten him?

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,123
But I couldn't find any record
of him ever being in my class.

8
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,226
Just like they're not gonna
find any record of you

9
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,094
Accepting a bribe
from a student.

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,863
Jessica, your secret
is safe with me.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,933
I told him you found out

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,703
That I covered up
Daniel hardman's embezzlement.

13
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,938
And now you want me to protect
another one of your secrets.

14
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,174
It's the same secret, Louis,

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,142
And you have just as much
invested in it as I do.

16
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,378
You want me to kiss the ring,
Louis, after what you did?

17
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,779
You're damn right I do,

18
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,715
Because I don't care
how it got up there.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,219
My name is on that wall
whether you like it or not.

20
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,407
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,609
What do you think of this tie?

22
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,344
I think...

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,581
I want to tie you up with it.

24
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,883
Really?
And what brought that on?

25
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,120
I don't know.
I'm feeling powerful.

26
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,589
Okay, well,

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,792
Then let's make

28
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,928
That happen.

29
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,397
Wait.

30
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,598
Is this to do things to me

31
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,199
Or just to get control
of the remote?

32
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,834
Why can't it be both?

33
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,537
Rachel, if you think I'm gonna
let you watch<i> game of thrones</i>

34
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,105
While sexually dominating me,

35
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:50,142
Then you are absolutely right.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,781
Seriously, what's got you
feeling so good?

37
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,215
Oh, it just feels like
such a weight off

38
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,483
Now that Louis doesn't...

39
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,152
- Despise me?
- Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,254
Ah, you know what else
would feel like a weight off?

41
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,758
- Oh...
- no. No, no, no.

42
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,593
Nobody ever calls
the landline except my parents.

43
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,262
- What if something's wrong?
- It's fine.

44
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,296
Mike.

45
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,665
Okay, okay, okay.

46
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,067
Hello.

47
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,069
Yeah, this is him.

48
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,274
Yeah, of course
I can come meet you.

49
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,544
Can I ask what this is...
hello?

50
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,611
Who was it?

51
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,080
Professor Gerard.

52
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,648
He wants me to go meet him.

53
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,882
Did he say what it was about?

54
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,517
No, he hung up.

55
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,119
When does he want you
to meet him?

56
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,287
Right now.

57
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:41,960
- Professor Gerard.
- Thanks for coming.

58
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,895
I wouldn't have bothered you
if it wasn't important.

59
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,931
It's not a problem.
What can I help you with?

60
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,699
It's not me.

61
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:51,069
A former employee at
liberty rail reached out to me.

62
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,671
He claims he was fired
because he knows

63
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,506
The real reason for the crash.

64
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,409
And what was the real reason?

65
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,777
He wouldn't tell me.

66
00:02:58,812 --> 00:02:59,978
Well, what did he tell you?

67
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,214
Enough for me to know
it would be unethical

68
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,617
If somebody didn't
look into this.

69
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,820
But you can't, so you want me
to get Harvey to.

70
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,089
Well, you convinced him
to look into my case

71
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,324
When he didn't want to,
didn't you?

72
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,693
This is different.
We don't take cases like this.

73
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,729
Maybe,

74
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:20,699
But I believe a man
who can convince Harvey

75
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,567
To hire someone
who never went to law school

76
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,437
Could convince him
to make an exception for this.

77
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,108
What?

78
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,977
He didn't tell you I know.

79
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,747
No, he didn't.

80
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,083
Well, I do.

81
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:43,889
But what I'm asking you to do
and me knowing

82
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,057
Have nothing
to do with each other.

83
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,262
I appreciate that.

84
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,365
Does that mean that you're
gonna tell him to take the case?

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,966
I have a better idea.

86
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,040
Got a second?

87
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,309
Of course.
What do you need?

88
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,145
I'd like you to sign off
on my vacation request.

89
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,216
Paris.

90
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,818
I've never heard you
talk about Paris.

91
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:16,254
No, but I have heard you
talk about it,

92
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,256
Which is why I'm taking you.

93
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,827
Are you asking me
to go to Paris with you?

94
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,094
I believe I just did.

95
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,162
Jeff, do you have any idea

96
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,597
How much is on my plate
right now?

97
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,765
Actually, I do, all of which

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,100
Harvey has agreed to cover.

99
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,002
You went to Harvey with this.

100
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,437
Well, I would have
come to you first,

101
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,340
But then it really
wouldn't be a surprise.

102
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,311
I'll think about it.

103
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,413
Take all the time you need.

104
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,781
But in the meantime,

105
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,750
I'll be thinking about
who else around here I can take.

106
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,319
Really?

107
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,488
Well, you're awfully
sure of yourself.

108
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,090
You think I haven't seen
the way Norma looks at me?

109
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,992
Calls me the black stallion.

110
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,133
Norma.

111
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,371
Taking a case.

112
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,772
What kind of case?

113
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,074
What does it matter?

114
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,976
Because you wouldn't be
announcing it like that

115
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,444
If there wasn't something wrong.

116
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,447
It's a case that came
from Professor Gerard.

117
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,548
What?

118
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,816
A man who used to work
at liberty rail

119
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,851
Says the real cause
of the crash was covered up.

120
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,152
Then refer him to a firm

121
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,921
That takes whistle-blower cases,
because we don't.

122
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,022
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

123
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,557
Then don't,
but there's a reason

124
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,893
Lawyers who take whistle-blower
cases don't work here,

125
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,394
And it's because corporations

126
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,162
Don't appreciate
shakedown artists.

127
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,531
And what if
this isn't a shakedown?

128
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,698
And how do you know it isn't?

129
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,333
What I know is that
innocent people died...

130
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,869
Mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters...

131
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,238
And if somebody's covering up
why that happened

132
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,806
And I can stop it,
then I'm going to.

133
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,208
And I said you're not.

134
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,110
Well, but you also said
that Professor Gerard

135
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,945
Didn't know my secret.

136
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,582
Harvey, I know,
I know he'll never tell anyone,

137
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,784
But someday, someone's
gonna find out who will,

138
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,785
And I'll be done.

139
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,853
Mike, he's not...

140
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,588
Harvey, I got
into this whole thing

141
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,891
So that I could try
to help people,

142
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,626
And I don't know
how much time I have left,

143
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:05,830
So please,

144
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,867
Let me try
and help these people.

145
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,205
Then you better make damn sure

146
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,242
This whistle-blower
isn't full of shit.

Bonjour, madame.

157
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:00,410
Oh, I'm so glad you started
with that French bullshit,

158
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:02,078
Because that's what
I want to talk to you about.

159
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,379
I know.

160
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,715
Never thought I'd have
someone ask my permission

161
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,016
To take you to Paris.

162
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,985
You know damn well
that's not what Jeff did.

163
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,989
Jessica, what exactly
do you want to talk about?

164
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:15,291
I want to know
why you cleared my schedule.

165
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,893
Because Jeff asked me to,

166
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,761
And I can't remember the last
time you took a vacation.

167
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:20,496
When's the last time
you took a vacation?

168
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,465
I'm not the one
in a serious relationship.

169
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,900
Oh, so you're playing matchmaker
for me now?

170
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,134
Oh, I'm not playing anything,

171
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,703
And you were the one
who said you had to choose

172
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,739
Between hiring him
and continuing to see him.

173
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:31,074
And then I changed my mind.

174
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,975
And I don't want you
to make the same mistake I did.

175
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:36,512
What are you talking about?

176
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,114
I should have taken
some time with scottie.

177
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,882
Jeff and I are not
you and scottie.

178
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,350
Jessica, take a vacation.

179
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,785
Don't take a vacation.

180
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:44,187
The man came in here,

181
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:46,522
Asking me for help because
he wants to go away with you,

182
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:49,625
And I said yes because I'm not
gonna be the reason he can't.

183
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:03,339
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

184
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,313
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

185
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:17,520
- Louis, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

186
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:20,389
Okay.
What are you doing?

187
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,658
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

188
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:25,027
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

189
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:26,529
You hear...

190
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,097
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

191
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,201
Hello?
Pearson specter...

192
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,736
You hear that?

193
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,471
Where's the litt?

194
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:37,306
Every call is like a slap
in the face.

195
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,542
Louis, it's standard practice
for a law firm

196
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:40,810
To shorten their name
on the phone.

197
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,779
So blatant disrespect
is standard practice now?

198
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,313
It's not disrespect.
It's just...

199
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,382
You're telling me
that your father doesn't

200
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:47,450
Have them answer the phone,

201
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,185
"rand, kaldore, Zane"?

202
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,553
Actually, no, he doesn't,

203
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:54,056
And I think you'd agree
that people respect my father.

204
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:55,324
Unless you want to go back
to telling me

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,559
That he's a shady lawyer.

206
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:58,461
Come on, Rachel,
that was when I was mad at you.

207
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,632
Which is actually why I wanted
to come and talk to you.

208
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:06,836
I want to thank you
for forgiving Mike.

209
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:10,373
It... it means a lot to me.

210
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,074
Now, can you stop
obsessing over the phone

211
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,544
Long enough to hear that?

212
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:15,778
I'm sorry, Rachel,

213
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,180
But I can't,

214
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:19,081
And now I have to go rip
that receptionist a new ass...

215
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:22,118
Louis, if one of your first acts
as name partner

216
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:24,921
Is to rip the receptionist
to shreds,

217
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:27,190
You'll regret that
for the rest of your life.

218
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,058
Just let it go.

219
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:30,359
Let it go.

220
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:33,629
Things will run their course.

221
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:35,631
You know what, Rachel?
You're right.

222
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:39,669
And by the way, I'm glad
that we're friends again.

223
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,881
Pearson specter...

224
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:58,387
Harvey, what are you doing
at 3:30 this afternoon?

225
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,755
Why?

226
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,024
I have some news, and I don't
want you to overreact.

227
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,025
What is it?

228
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,462
Jeffrey bender
wants to meet with you.

229
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:08,030
He heard we're taking
a whistle-blower case,

230
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,033
And he wants us to drop it.

231
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,303
Relax, I'll take care
of Jeffrey bender.

232
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,438
Wait a second,
you're not gonna try

233
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,240
To cut Mike's legs
out from under him

234
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,608
- Before he even gets started?
- What's the point?

235
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:21,110
He'd just bother me
until I agreed not to anyway.

236
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,748
I can't believe it.

237
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:28,184
You have no idea what to say.

238
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,419
What's the date today?
I want to write this down.

239
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,221
You know what?

240
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,823
It's the seventh
of kiss my ass,

241
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,959
And tomorrow is the eighth of
set your own goddamn meetings.

242
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,294
Is that the Mayan calendar?

243
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:40,363
Nope,
that's the Donna calendar.

244
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:43,165
I got you.
For the record, I got you.

245
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:48,537
All right, take me
through it one more time.

246
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:50,640
It's simple.

247
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:53,943
There are axles on all the cars
in all the trains,

248
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,946
And those axles have sensors to
make sure they don't overheat.

249
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,414
So you're saying
that the train crashed

250
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,749
Because the heat sensors
failed.

251
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,184
I'm saying
that all the heat sensors

252
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,720
On the entire fleet were faulty,

253
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:06,122
And they knew about it.

254
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:07,723
Then why didn't you
come forward with this before?

255
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,092
You mean before they fired me
for coming forward with it?

256
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,627
Which brings me
to my next question.

257
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:14,130
You've had four different jobs
in the last six years.

258
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:15,131
What are you getting at?

259
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,333
I want to know why.

260
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:18,534
I move around.

261
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:19,902
It's not uncommon
in my business.

262
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,405
Move around or keep failing?

263
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,707
I got fired
for blowing the whistle,

264
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:26,175
Not for messing up on the job.

265
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,144
That's not what your last
performance review says.

266
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,979
I don't give a shit
what it says.

267
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,081
They used that as an excuse
to fire me,

268
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:34,650
And my reviews
before I came forward

269
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:36,352
Passed with flying colors.

270
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:37,453
I'm a solid worker.

271
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,821
How the hell do you think
I got this?

272
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,623
I know your reviews
are stellar.

273
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,625
What I need to know is
if there's anything out there

274
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,794
That we don't have, because
they are gonna come at us

275
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,163
Any way they can,
and when they do,

276
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:48,698
It's not gonna
be about heat sensors.

277
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,232
It's gonna be about you.

278
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:53,202
Yeah, I don't care if
I'm the worst guy in the world.

279
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:55,671
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

280
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:57,840
That knows
those sensors are faulty.

281
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:01,844
What are you talking about?

282
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,612
what do you mean,
there's a report?

283
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:06,782
Done after the crash
that showed a defective part

284
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:09,218
Was the real cause,
not engineer error.

285
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:10,386
Says the whistle-blower.

286
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:13,289
Says these.

287
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:14,890
That's a memo
ordering the report

288
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:17,693
And another email
acknowledging its existence.

289
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:19,028
We got 'em.

290
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,696
- We do.
- Set a meeting.

291
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,765
Let them do the talking,
then drop the hammer,

292
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,100
And stick a settlement
down their throat

293
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:25,101
Before they know what hit them.

294
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:26,702
I appreciate the advice,
Harvey,

295
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,704
But this time I'm going in
with the hammer in my hand,

296
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,406
And I am coming out swinging.

297
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:32,274
Okay, big talker,
how much you asking for?

298
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,043
40 million.

299
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:35,378
Are you kidding me?

300
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,813
They'll pay ten times that
without even trying.

301
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:39,181
Not when I tell them
they're gonna have to admit

302
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,483
What they did.

303
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,284
- Are you nuts?
- No, I am not.

304
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,719
We are not sealing
this settlement,

305
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:46,155
And before you say another word,
this is my case.

306
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,390
I don't care whose case it is.

307
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,158
They're never going to admit
what they did.

308
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:50,826
Pick a higher number
and let them seal it.

309
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:53,095
Harvey, you told me to prove
this wasn't a shakedown.

310
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,431
Now you want me to take money
to cover things up?

311
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,199
You know what that is?
A shakedown!

312
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,902
A shakedown is when
your case has no merit.

313
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:01,203
This is the way things work.

314
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,705
Not to mention,
if we quietly settle,

315
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,874
We don't have to worry
about scaring away our clients.

316
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,575
That's why
it's the way things work.

317
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,677
Harvey, people died
in this crash!

318
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:11,313
And they're not coming back, no
matter what liberty rail admits.

319
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:13,282
You are such a cold,
heartless son of a bitch.

320
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:15,084
And this isn't
about your parents,

321
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,053
So back them
into whatever corner you want,

322
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,988
But when they refuse
to admit what they did,

323
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:21,757
You are not going to trial.

324
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,463
Stay out of my case.

325
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,601
Something smells delicious.

326
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:44,872
I'm making us dinner, but it
won't be ready for a while.

327
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,574
Good, that means we have time

328
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,110
To go over
my proposed itinerary.

329
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,345
I don't recall saying yes.

330
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,581
I thought that we would start

331
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,317
With a private tour
of the rodin.

332
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:57,751
Oh, the rodin.

333
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:01,388
God, I must have visited that
sculpture garden a dozen times.

334
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,190
Then I'm so glad that I arranged
for us to have a picnic

335
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,625
While we're there,

336
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,693
And during that picnic,

337
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:09,130
We can reminisce
about the week before,

338
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,999
Where we danced the night away
in the Latin quarter.

339
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:13,434
We did?

340
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:16,237
Mm, or we'll talk
about how we'll end the trip

341
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,739
In the loire valley,

342
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,910
Where we will sip wine
along the seine.

343
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,483
Jeff, this trip is perfect.
How did you know?

344
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,753
I know you've always
loved Paris, so I started there.

345
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,923
And then I called your sister.

346
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,324
You did that for me?

347
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,226
I did.

348
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:42,596
So what do you say?

349
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,734
I say,

350
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:50,638
If you knew what I was cooking,

351
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,506
You'd already know my answer.

352
00:14:57,547 --> 00:15:00,714
- Looks French.
- Mm-hmm.

353
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,550
So you let me go through
all that even though

354
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,618
You knew you were gonna
say yes the entire time?

355
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,086
Mm-hmm.

356
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,455
Aren't you glad I did?

357
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,624
Yes, Jessica.

358
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:13,761
Yes, I am.

359
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:27,741
Donna, what are you doing here?

360
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:30,511
I'm here
because I can't take it anymore.

361
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:31,845
What?

362
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,015
This place has no life,
and I can't take it anymore.

363
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:36,584
And that's gonna add life?

364
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:37,918
If I gave you
something too needy,

365
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,020
It would intimidate you,
and you would let it die.

366
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,856
You expect me to believe
that's why you're really here?

367
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,258
Of course not.

368
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:45,392
I'm here to stop you from doing

369
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,061
What you're gonna do
in an hour:

370
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,329
Crash Mike's meeting.

371
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,464
Donna, I can't have him
risking our other business.

372
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,166
It was one client,
and you covered it.

373
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,534
And if he drags this to trial,

374
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:54,635
It will be every client.

375
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,136
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

376
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,172
Then trust him
to accept that on his own.

377
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,473
Donna...

378
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,575
Harvey, when are you gonna
let him be his own man?

379
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,744
His own man?
He's out of control.

380
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,813
He's identifying these people
with his parents.

381
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,214
And you're out of control
because you can't

382
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,549
Separate yourself from him.

383
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:09,984
Okay, you need
to stay out of it.

384
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,186
And I will, but you said
you made a mistake

385
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,189
Not trusting Mike
with gillie industries.

386
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,225
I'm telling you,
don't make that mistake again.

387
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,741
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

388
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:41,081
Uh...

389
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,497
rand, kaldore, Zane.

390
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,532
son of a bitch!

391
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,270
Hello, liar.

392
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,372
- Excuse me?
- Rand, kaldore, Zane.

393
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:06,807
You know what that is?

394
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:09,443
That's how they answer the phone
at rand, kaldore, Zane.

395
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:11,211
- Louis, I'm sorry.
- Oh, save your sorrys.

396
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,546
Do you know the receptionist
at the front desk?

397
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:14,214
Yes, her name is elise.

398
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,350
Good, you can use her name
when you fire her.

399
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,385
I don't have the authority
to fire people,

400
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,054
But I did just talk to her.

401
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,155
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

402
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,156
To set her straight.
That's good.

403
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,223
No, not good.

404
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,591
She came to see me.

405
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,428
She said that
you've been harassing her.

406
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,896
What happened?

407
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:32,032
She said that you called and
hung up on her over 50 times.

408
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,167
What?
How did she even know it was me?

409
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,668
Because you called
from your office.

410
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,503
Well, it wasn't harassment
because it wasn't sexual.

411
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,073
Well, she also said that
you were leering at her

412
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,140
When you stepped
off the elevator.

413
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,342
I wasn't leering!

414
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:42,776
I was mad about
how she answered the phone.

415
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,977
Louis, it doesn't matter
why you did it.

416
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:45,512
She felt violated.

417
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,715
Well, you know what,
you tell her it's not like that,

418
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,218
And then you violate her ass
out the door.

419
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:55,122
Louis, is this really the kind
of name partner you want to be?

420
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,724
No, I want to be
the kind of name partner

421
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,692
That has his name
said on the goddamn phone.

422
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,527
Okay, well,
in order to fire her

423
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:01,995
Without getting sued
for harassment,

424
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,497
You'd have to fire
the entire support staff,

425
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:07,768
And you and I both know that
that's never going to happen.

426
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:10,137
We are not firing
all of our support staff.

427
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,005
Well, it's easy for you to say,
being that your name is first.

428
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,006
What are you talking...

429
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,842
Jessica, I am talking
about respect.

430
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:18,545
R-e-s-p-e-c-t,
find out what it means to me.

431
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:19,847
But I guess
I'll just find my own way

432
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,116
To be treated how I deserve.

433
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:24,084
I know I'm gonna regret
asking this.

434
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,721
Louis, tell me specifically
what it is you're talking about.

435
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,026
They are answering the phones,
"Pearson specter,"

436
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,762
Not "Pearson specter litt."

437
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:35,996
Louis...

438
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,798
You don't believe me?
Check it yourself.

439
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,166
I'm not harassing
our support staff.

440
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,501
It's not harassment,
God damn it!

441
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,869
Louis!

442
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:44,238
Jessica, it's like they've
been specifically instructed

443
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,639
To leave my name off.

444
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:46,807
Now you're just being paranoid.

445
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,409
I am not paranoid.
They're in lockstep.

446
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:50,511
I'm telling you,
someone paid them off.

447
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,646
Louis, that's insane,

448
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,782
But if you want them
to say your name,

449
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,784
I will get them
to say your name.

450
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:06,360
Jessica, what can I do for you?

451
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,796
You can explain to me
why you paid our reception staff

452
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:11,298
Not to say Louis' name
when they answer the phone.

453
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,333
- Who says I did that?
- They do.

454
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,102
God damn it.

455
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,670
I paid them good money
to keep Louis

456
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:17,905
From finding out
for at least a month.

457
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,173
He hasn't found out.

458
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,175
It wasn't him who got them
to crack, it was me.

459
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,043
Even still,
I'm asking for a refund.

460
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,679
Jeff, I'm serious about this.

461
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,217
I know you're pissed about
how he got his name on the door,

462
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,719
But I need you
to bury the hatchet.

463
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,688
- Well, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

464
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,790
Because every single time
I see his rat face,

465
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:38,192
I think about him
blackmailing you,

466
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,426
And it makes me want
to walk over to him

467
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:40,794
And rip his arms off his body,

468
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,198
And that little phone prank
was just my way

469
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,367
Of keeping myself
from doing something like that.

470
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:48,836
I understand,

471
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:51,038
And I do appreciate it,

472
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,507
But I'm not asking you
to do it for him.

473
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,542
I'm asking you to do it for me.

474
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,153
Mr. Ross.

475
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:07,721
All I can say about your filing
is that I think

476
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:09,923
You might have a career
writing fiction.

477
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,992
And if you don't hand over
that report we're requesting,

478
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,694
You're gonna
have a career behind bars.

479
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,128
You're not here
for that report.

480
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,464
You're here to strong arm
my client into a big, fat check.

481
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,866
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

482
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,735
But a big, fat check
isn't gonna get you out of this.

483
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,237
- Is that a fact?
- Sure as hell is,

484
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:24,605
Because we both know
that report

485
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,007
Says you're responsible
for this accident,

486
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,142
And we're not settling anything
without you admitting it.

487
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:32,179
And we're not admitting
something we didn't do.

488
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:34,915
What the hell is this?

489
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,216
Well, you wanted the report.

490
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:37,851
Here it is.

491
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,720
Your client wasn't lying
about its existence.

492
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,655
He was just lying
about everything else.

493
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,657
We ran repeated tests
on our heat sensors,

494
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,425
And they passed every one.

495
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:48,462
This is bullshit.

496
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,563
The only thing that's bullshit

497
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,131
Is Joe Henderson.

498
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,733
He doesn't care
about the accident.

499
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,434
All he's trying to do
is shake us down,

500
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,137
Exactly like he did
at his last four jobs.

501
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:01,909
What the hell is that?

502
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,444
His last four lawsuits.

503
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,946
Did you think we wouldn't
find out about them

504
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,548
Just because the records
were sealed?

505
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,650
Mr. Ross,
your client's been playing

506
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,752
The whistle-blower lottery
for years.

507
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,220
He's never won before.

508
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:15,122
He's not going to win today.

509
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,983
Ch,
you tried to blow the whistle

510
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:31,020
At every job you've ever had,
and now they know it!

511
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,490
Keep your voice down.

512
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,158
You...
no, I'll keep my voice down

513
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,526
When you stop bullshitting me.

514
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,862
Those claims were
supposed to be sealed.

515
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,597
I don't care what they were
supposed to be.

516
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,533
They found them, and you were
supposed to tell me about them.

517
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,468
And what would you
have done if I did?

518
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,803
I would've said what they said,

519
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,671
That you don't give a shit
about what they did!

520
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,073
You're just looking
to get rich.

521
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,875
You think I would've
risked my job

522
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,344
And everything that I have
for nothing?

523
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,378
Excuse me?

524
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,380
I said, I don't see you

525
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:59,082
Working out of the goodness
of your heart

526
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,151
In your $1,000 suit.

527
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,354
You have no idea
who I am or why I do things.

528
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,423
And I told you, you don't have
to be concerned about my history

529
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,426
Because what
I'm telling you is true.

530
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,228
Not according to this.

531
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,631
That's the report that you said
gave us all the leverage

532
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,633
And they say
proves them innocent.

533
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,401
That report is bullshit,

534
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:21,070
Because I'm telling you,
those sensors didn't work,

535
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,672
And that was the cause
of that accident.

536
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:23,973
Well, I might have
a leg to stand on

537
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,109
If you had
any credibility at all.

538
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,977
How the hell am I supposed
to get a jury to believe you

539
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,013
When I'm not even sure I do?

540
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,190
What are you doing here?

541
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,958
I'm here to tell you
to call the front desk.

542
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,927
Oh, let me guess.

543
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,762
Jessica told you
they won't say my name

544
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,130
And you thought
it was hilarious.

545
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,331
You're right, I did.

546
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,399
Why don't you get the hell
out of my office

547
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,501
And go laugh somewhere else?

548
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,002
Oh, you want to hit me now?

549
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,004
Yeah, well, why don't you go
ask Mike Ross about my headlock?

550
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,207
'Cause it's a goddamn vice.

551
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,513
Pearson specter litt,

552
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,548
How may I direct your call?

553
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,588
It was you.

554
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,989
Yes, it was me,

555
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,592
But I fixed it, so...

556
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,527
You can stop worrying
if everybody at the firm

557
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,630
Respects you, because they do.

558
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,636
Everyone except you.

559
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,911
No, Louis, including me.

560
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,480
Listen, I may not like how
you got your name on the wall,

561
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:40,049
But that doesn't mean
it shouldn't be up there.

562
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,288
Congratulations, Louis.

563
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,124
Thanks, Jeff.

564
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,960
Hey, maybe we can even
get drinks this week.

565
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,531
- Name partner buys.
- Deal.

566
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,166
Done.

567
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,507
You can leave the coffee,
but I'm not getting up.

568
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,876
Mike, you've been working
for seven hours straight.

569
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:08,378
You need a break.

570
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,013
I've been working for seven
hours because if I tell Harvey

571
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,481
What's going on
before I have a fix,

572
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,749
He is gonna pull the plug.

573
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,484
Well, then maybe the plug
needs to be pulled.

574
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,219
Rachel, just because
Joe Henderson is

575
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,320
A bullshit plaintiff
doesn't mean

576
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,521
They didn't cover things up.

577
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:21,291
It doesn't mean that they did.

578
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,825
Okay, fine.

579
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:23,960
Why would he ask
for that report

580
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,663
If he knew
it would hurt our case?

581
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,031
- I don't know.
- I don't know either,

582
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,666
Which is why I need more time.

583
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,768
Well, then you need to convince
Harvey to let you keep going,

584
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,369
Because if you don't
and he finds out...

585
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,837
He is not gonna find out.

586
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,774
Mike, he's not gonna
find out from me,

587
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,043
But if I've learned one thing
in the last six months

588
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:44,180
Of working here, it's that if
he finds out from somebody else,

589
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,683
You're gonna regret it.

590
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,057
You come here to tell me
you're taking that vacation?

591
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,925
I came by to ask
when Mike Ross started taking

592
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,926
Whistle-blower cases.

593
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:57,927
Jessica...

594
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,262
I want you
to put the brakes on him

595
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,463
Before this gets
out of control.

596
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,432
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

597
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,133
- Harvey.
- Jessica, it's one case.

598
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,669
He asked me to trust him,
and I'm gonna do it,

599
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,905
And if you're ever gonna
be able to enjoy a vacation,

600
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,075
You're gonna have to trust me.

601
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,411
All right.
Good night.

602
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,780
Bon voyage.

603
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,882
You do know
that doesn't mean "good night."

604
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,117
Of course I do.

605
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,119
Do you know how to say
"good night" in French?

606
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,722
What, do you think
I'm some kind of neanderthal?

607
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:29,092
You don't know one word
of French, do you?

608
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,259
<i>MÃ©nage Ã  trois.</i>

609
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,128
You're an idiot.

610
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,665
<i>MÃ©nage Ã  quatre.</i>

611
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,500
<i>MÃ©nage Ã  cinq.</i>

612
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,170
Can I come in?

613
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,378
What's going on?

614
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,379
We have a problem.

615
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,447
I'm listening.

616
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,384
Liberty rail's report
directly contradicts our claim.

617
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,818
That's a big damn problem.

618
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,387
I believe my client, Harvey.

619
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,588
Based on what, your gut?

620
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,390
No, I found the guy
who wrote the report.

621
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,792
He's on indefinite leave
in Australia,

622
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,394
Where we can't subpoena him.

623
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,295
So it's our word
against theirs.

624
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,997
Which is why I'm here.

625
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,603
Joe Henderson made four other
claims in the last six years.

626
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,871
- You're shitting me.
- Harvey...

627
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,073
That's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

628
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,374
I knew it.

629
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,109
I knew you would bail on me
the second this thing

630
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,210
Hit the smallest bump.

631
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,412
Bail on you?

632
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,414
I backed you because you told me
you had a case.

633
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,116
I do have a case.
I told you they got to this guy.

634
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,184
And you got no proof of that.

635
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,252
And if this were your case,

636
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,220
You would be begging me
for help to get it.

637
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,755
It's not my case.
It's yours.

638
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,323
And now you're asking a jury

639
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,726
To believe these guys
fabricated a report

640
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,895
Based on the word
of a career whistle-blower.

641
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,663
No, I'm asking you
to believe it.

642
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,165
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

643
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
This guy is
a goddamn shakedown artist,

644
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,101
And I'm pulling the plug.

645
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,369
I don't care what he is.

646
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,472
I'm not
a goddamn shakedown artist!

647
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,873
Mike...

648
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:55,878
Harvey, you told me that
those people weren't my parents,

649
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,047
But they are
somebody's parents.

650
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:02,552
Please.

651
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,088
You got 24 hours.

652
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,784
You know it's against the law
to litter, don't you?

653
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,219
What do you want, Donna?

654
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,420
I know you went to see Harvey.

655
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:29,888
You know that
he wants me to fail.

656
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:31,223
That's not true.

657
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:33,225
I don't have anything,
and he only gave me a day.

658
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,326
And if he wanted you to fail,

659
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,162
He wouldn't have given you
another second.

660
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,631
You know he thinks
this is about my parents, right?

661
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:44,770
Is it?

662
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:51,343
Maybe it is,

663
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,679
But what these people did
is a million times worse

664
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,948
Because they knew
it could happen.

665
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:57,449
Wait a second...
they knew this could happen,

666
00:27:57,484 --> 00:27:58,784
And they didn't fix it before?

667
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,852
Yeah, Donna, and then they...
they rolled the dice.

668
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,954
Well, what about now?

669
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:03,088
Are those trains
still messed up?

670
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:04,523
Because that would
make them monsters.

671
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,391
They are monsters, but that
would also make them idiots,

672
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:07,492
And they're not idiots.

673
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:08,660
Well, what are you
talking about?

674
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:10,195
Well, they must have
fixed the sensors by now;

675
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,030
Otherwise if it happened again,
they'd all go to jail.

676
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,632
Well, if they fixed the sensors,
then there has to be

677
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:14,833
- A paper trail.
- Of course there is.

678
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:16,368
Then all you have to do
is get it.

679
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,403
What do you think I've been
trying to figure out all night?

680
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:20,205
What's to figure out?
Subpoena it.

681
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,442
Yeah, there's only one problem.
Harvey only gave me 24 hours.

682
00:28:23,477 --> 00:28:24,576
But now that
you've come up with this,

683
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:26,144
Maybe Harvey
will change his mind.

684
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,413
Donna, I have a theory that
I can't prove and an opposition

685
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:30,115
That's shown they're willing
to alter evidence.

686
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,851
He's not gonna change his mind,
and you know it.

687
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:34,453
There's got to be another way.

688
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:37,622
Donna, look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

689
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:40,492
But unless you have this other
way in your pocket, please,

690
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:43,362
Just leave me alone
and let me try

691
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:46,031
And think this thing through.

692
00:29:04,752 --> 00:29:06,718
no! I don't care what he says.

693
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:08,220
It's an active
goddamn investigation,

694
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:09,221
And I'm not gonna
stand around...

695
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:10,255
You can't talk on that here.

696
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,556
Hang on a second, Charlie.

697
00:29:11,592 --> 00:29:13,658
I'm sorry, we got off
on the wrong foot.

698
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:15,360
Is your name Danielle?

699
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:17,095
That's what it says
on the plate, isn't it?

700
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,097
Well, Danielle, I'm here
to pick up the documents

701
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,266
I ordered an hour ago,
and if you don't give them to me

702
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,467
In the next 15 seconds,

703
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:23,969
Today's gonna be your last day.

704
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:25,037
You didn't talk to me.

705
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:27,739
I said hold on, damn it.

706
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:31,043
Look, I don't have time
to play "who spoke to who."

707
00:29:31,078 --> 00:29:33,311
I am up from do because,
as it is, these documents

708
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,980
Weren't sent
when they were promised.

709
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:36,281
I'm sorry.
What is it you need again?

710
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,483
Oh, Jesus Christ.

711
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,319
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

712
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:43,522
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

713
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:45,724
Well, then by all means,
let's call your supervisor,

714
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,460
And we can tell him
how you'd rather play<i> farmville</i>

715
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,295
Than cooperate with me.

716
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,634
Who did you say
you're with again?

717
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,670
Have you heard of the national
transportation safety board?

718
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:04,276
They'll give you
what you need in the back.

719
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,161
What did you do?

720
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,097
I didn't do anything.
What did you do?

721
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:26,098
Don't give me that.

722
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,866
This makes my entire case,

723
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:30,035
But I can't use it if
I don't know where it came from.

724
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,104
Oh, that looks like
it came from liberty rail.

725
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:34,639
Oh, oh, yeah,
it just happened to walk itself

726
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:36,708
Over from their secure facility.

727
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:38,677
Well, it's possible that
somebody went over there

728
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,645
And released it
from their secure facility.

729
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:43,181
Donna, if I go to Harvey
with this and tell him

730
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,416
What I know happened, he...

731
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,951
You don't know.
You think.

732
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:48,887
Don't lawyer me.
He'll never let me use it.

733
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:51,123
Well, then don't tell him
what you think happened,

734
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:54,292
Because if you do,
he'll make you drop the case.

735
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:57,195
Okay, right now,
I don't care about the case.

736
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,432
I care about you.

737
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:04,035
Mike, I didn't steal anything.

738
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,937
I talked my way in,
and that's what happened.

739
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:07,005
Did you tell them
this was discovery

740
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,006
For a case against them?

741
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,007
No.

742
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,308
Then it's not admissible
in court.

743
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:11,776
Well, then you
have to figure out a way

744
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:15,080
To use it not in court,

745
00:31:15,115 --> 00:31:16,615
But don't ask me
for my help on that.

746
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,650
I have done enough.

747
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:31,396
Hey.

748
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,465
Heard you wanted to see me.

749
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,934
I take it you patched things up
with Louis litt.

750
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:37,102
How do you know?

751
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,404
Oh, he wanted to know
if you were a sports bar guy

752
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,872
Or a wine bar guy.

753
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:42,908
Did you tell him I'm more
of a strip club kind of guy?

754
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,210
You really want to go
to a strip club with Louis litt?

755
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:48,413
I don't really want to go
to a strip club with anyone,

756
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,748
But I do have a meeting
in 10 minutes,

757
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,749
And it's 15 minutes away.

758
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,983
Oh, I just wanted to tell you

759
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,419
That I appreciate you
patching things up with him.

760
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,288
There's no need to thank me.

761
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:59,324
I would do anything
for the woman that I love...

762
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:03,395
Even get a drink
with Louis litt.

763
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:17,008
You here to talk
about anderton software?

764
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:19,444
Because your 24-hour
liberty rail pass is up.

765
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,545
Then I guess it's a good thing

766
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:22,581
That just came
in the mail for me.

767
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:23,582
What is it?

768
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:24,783
Maintenance records showing

769
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,651
They replaced the heat sensors
on all of their trains

770
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,120
Within six weeks
after the derailment.

771
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,423
Now, why would they do that if
they never failed a safety test?

772
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:32,691
They wouldn't.

773
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:34,459
Which means Joe Henderson
was telling the truth.

774
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,760
I can think
of three different ways

775
00:32:35,796 --> 00:32:37,162
They'll explain this away.

776
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:41,233
Not if we can get them on record
before they know we have it.

777
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:43,168
And why don't they know
we have it?

778
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:44,569
The same way I didn't know
they got

779
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:45,837
Joe Henderson's sealed records.

780
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:47,339
Which means you did
something sketchy.

781
00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:49,975
Harvey, do you want to spend
all night asking me exactly

782
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,176
What I did or did not do,

783
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:53,578
Or do you want
to help me right a wrong?

784
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:59,251
Donna?

785
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:01,152
Set a deposition
with liberty rail,

786
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,256
And tell them this time
it won't just be Mike.

787
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,091
I'm on it.

788
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,435
who the hell is that?

789
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,003
That's the ceo of liberty rail.

790
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,139
Yeah, I know who he is.
Who is she?

791
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,807
That's their lawyer.

792
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,609
Why didn't you tell me
she was hot?

793
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:26,044
Because it's not relevant.

794
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,579
- It is to me.
- Why?

795
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:29,314
Because she's hot.

796
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,416
You must be
the infamous Harvey specter.

797
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:33,551
- You must be...
- Evan Smith.

798
00:33:33,587 --> 00:33:35,219
Have to admit,
when I saw your name was Evan,

799
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:37,055
I thought you were a man.

800
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,623
And I have to admit,
when I saw your name was Harvey,

801
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:39,958
I thought you were a man.

802
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:41,960
- I think I'm in love.
- I think you are too.

803
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:43,561
Okay, can we
get this over with?

804
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:45,096
We sure can.

805
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:46,965
I don't even know how you
have any questions at all,

806
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,066
Given our last meeting.

807
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:49,534
We just have a few.

808
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,740
Mr. Mcintyre,
before the derailment,

809
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,776
Liberty rail conducted tests on
the heat sensors on its trains.

810
00:33:58,812 --> 00:33:59,978
Is that correct?

811
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:01,512
- Of course we did.
- And why was that?

812
00:34:01,548 --> 00:34:04,816
We run tests
on all our systems.

813
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,150
It's routine.

814
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:07,518
And the finding of that report

815
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:09,687
Is that there were no problems
with the heat sensors.

816
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:11,122
Are you going to just
ask questions

817
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:12,256
That you already
know the answers to?

818
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:13,758
It's routine.

819
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:15,426
There weren't any problems
with the sensors.

820
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:18,396
And do you routinely
replace the heat sensors?

821
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,764
Yes.

822
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:21,232
We replace them
every five years

823
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,167
As part of our regularly
scheduled maintenance.

824
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,169
And when was the last
regularly scheduled maintenance?

825
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:26,738
That would be two years ago.

826
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,905
And you wouldn't fix something
that wasn't broken, right?

827
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:32,310
Of course not.

828
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:34,479
I'm not in the business
of wasting money, gentlemen.

829
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:36,781
I'm a bit confused.

830
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:38,950
If you're not in the business
of wasting money

831
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:40,718
And there was nothing wrong
with those sensors,

832
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:42,720
Then why did you just
replace all of them?

833
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:44,322
They didn't replace
all of them.

834
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:46,791
I think we'd like your client
to answer that question.

835
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,662
You're in a bit
of a pickle, Richard.

836
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:52,530
You don't know whether to say
you did or you didn't.

837
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:54,365
Of course, you could roll
the dice with your own life

838
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:55,800
Just like you did
with other people's.

839
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,669
The truth is,
it doesn't matter,

840
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,170
Because you already
said on camera

841
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:00,371
You didn't replace
those sensors.

842
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:02,407
And we have these.

843
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:14,018
Where'd you get these?

844
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:15,753
I'll tell you
what I told Joe Henderson.

845
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,122
It doesn't matter
where they came from.

846
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,059
It just matters
that they're here.

847
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:22,593
I need to talk to my client.

848
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:24,062
That's a good idea.

849
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:25,396
You should discuss
how many zeros

850
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:26,798
You're gonna write
on that check.

851
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,932
And one more thing.

852
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,133
You're not only gonna
write a check.

853
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,301
You're gonna
write a public admission

854
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,704
Because people died
in that crash.

855
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,172
That's not how this works.

856
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:40,011
It's how it works today.

857
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:41,779
you're really gonna force
them to make a public admission?

858
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:43,181
Damn right, I am.

859
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:45,483
- Who are you, mahatma Gandhi?
- Somebody has to be.

860
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,452
You were too busy
demanding a bunch of zeros.

861
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:48,953
Well, I was just
looking out for you.

862
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:50,588
Those suits don't pay
for themselves.

863
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:51,689
No, they don't.

864
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:55,126
Mike, great job.
You really stepped it up.

865
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:56,894
Thanks, Harvey.

866
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,931
I think you might be starting
to come into your own too.

867
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,240
really?

868
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,875
Every single game?

869
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,277
No, just the playoffs.

870
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:14,979
- Two sips?
- Two sips.

871
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:17,482
- No more, no less.
- Any beer?

872
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:19,150
Oh, no, not any beer.

873
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:20,752
Miller lite.

874
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:24,288
Miller lite?
What?

875
00:36:24,324 --> 00:36:25,356
But she's a queen.

876
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,458
What can I tell you?
She got it from her dad.

877
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:29,393
Look, if the giants
are in the playoffs

878
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:31,195
And Jessica doesn't take
two sips of Miller lite

879
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,330
After every single first down,

880
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:33,464
She thinks they're gonna lose,

881
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,766
And there's no talking her
out of it.

882
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,568
And those happen a lot, right?
First downs?

883
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:38,770
They sure do.

884
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,339
So what is she like
when she's drunk?

885
00:36:41,374 --> 00:36:43,374
Well, that's a conversation
for another time.

886
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,409
Ooh.

887
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:46,778
I so feel you, bro.

888
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:54,152
You know, I got to say, Louis,

889
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:57,088
I almost feel bad
about pulling that prank on you.

890
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:59,991
Don't feel bad.

891
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:01,726
It was a pretty good prank.

892
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:06,030
Okay.
One more?

893
00:37:06,065 --> 00:37:08,599
Only if you tell me more about
what Jessica's like at home.

894
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:10,034
No, screw that,
I want you to tell me

895
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:13,104
What she was like back
when it was Pearson hardman.

896
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,740
Done.

897
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,841
- Hey.
- Hey.

898
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:17,975
You're heading out
for the night?

899
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,544
- In a few minutes.
- Want to grab a drink?

900
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:20,678
Celebrate?

901
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:22,180
- I can't.
- Why not?

902
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:23,781
Not that it's
any of your concern,

903
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:25,883
But I'm having drinks
with Evan Smith.

904
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,752
What?
You got her number?

905
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,153
No, she called me.

906
00:37:29,189 --> 00:37:30,454
Oh, she asked for your number?

907
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,990
No, she didn't have to.
You gave it to her.

908
00:37:33,026 --> 00:37:34,225
It was on that subpoena.

909
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,060
I know what's gonna
be on your subpoena.

910
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:38,362
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

911
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:40,198
Sure as hell do.

912
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,434
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

913
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,503
I take it you heard
about liberty rail.

914
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:46,704
- I did.
- See?

915
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:50,074
No harm, no foul,
no mass exodus of clients.

916
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:51,909
I'm glad.

917
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:53,277
What's on your mind, Jessica?
You don't seem...

918
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,880
I know you told scottie
about Mike Ross.

919
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,922
How'd you know?

920
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,525
I didn't till just now.

921
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,360
- Jessica...
- I'm not mad.

922
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:12,029
I just want to know
what made you want to tell her.

923
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:13,497
What difference does that make?

924
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:15,766
Because I want to tell Jeff
the truth about Mike Ross too.

925
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:17,435
What changed between now

926
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,537
And when you fed him
that Louis bullshit?

927
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:21,339
Nothing's changed.

928
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:24,675
I just don't want
to lie to him anymore.

929
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:26,844
He told you he loved you,
didn't he?

930
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,982
When the hell did you start
figuring shit like that out?

931
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:34,785
I didn't till just now.

932
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:36,020
Then answer my question.

933
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:37,955
What made you decide
to tell scottie?

934
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:41,092
That's not what
you really want to know.

935
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:44,862
What you want to know
is if I wish I told her sooner.

936
00:38:44,898 --> 00:38:46,697
Do you?

937
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:50,768
Yes, I do.

938
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,347
Hey.

939
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,584
Hey, Rachel,
what can I do for you?

940
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:10,388
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

941
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:13,157
- For what?
- Oh, come on, Donna.

942
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:16,227
Mike told me you saved the day.

943
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,728
Oh, well, you know,

944
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:19,597
After I saved those kids
from that burning building,

945
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:21,432
I had a little extra time, so...

946
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,301
Well, then maybe you should
take the rest of the night off.

947
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:24,535
And why is that?

948
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,372
Because that's what
superheroes do.

949
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,466
Macallan 18.

950
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,635
You got great taste.

951
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,036
Surprised I called?

952
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:01,539
Like I said, you got great
taste, but let me be clear.

953
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:02,740
You want to talk settlement,

954
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,809
I can't do it
without Mike Ross.

955
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:06,944
I'm definitely not here
to talk settlement.

956
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,915
Good, because there are things
I can do without him,

957
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,750
Exceptionally.

958
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:17,321
I want to show you
a little video.

959
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:19,523
What, did you dig up footage

960
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,791
From my high school
championship?

961
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:22,827
Because that'll make this
too easy.

962
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,731
Afraid not.

963
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:30,134
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

964
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:34,171
Which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

965
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,882
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

966
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:46,984
Enjoy your drink, handsome.

967
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,880
Jessica.

968
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:18,649
Jeff, there's something
I need to tell you.

969
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,718
There's something
I need to tell you too.

970
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:24,755
What's going on?

971
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,991
What's going on is
I just had drinks with Louis,

972
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,793
You know, as a favor to you.

973
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:32,430
Turns out he's not so great
at holding his liquor.

974
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:35,299
- What did he do?
- No, he didn't do anything.

975
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:37,635
- You did.
- I don't...

976
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,869
You see, we were
actually bonding

977
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:40,704
When I suddenly remembered
what he had done to you,

978
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,040
And I...
well, I wanted to make sure

979
00:41:43,076 --> 00:41:45,209
That no one
ever did that to you again.

980
00:41:45,244 --> 00:41:46,677
So I asked him how he found out

981
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,479
About Daniel hardman's
embezzlement,

982
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:50,014
And he started with the words,

983
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,349
"it was two years ago."

984
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,717
Jeff, I can explain.

985
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:54,985
You can always explain,

986
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:57,188
But that just means
your whole story

987
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,191
About how Louis got his name
on the door is bullshit.

988
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,826
And I came here
to tell you the truth.

989
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:03,427
More bullshit!

990
00:42:03,463 --> 00:42:04,929
Then let me tell you now.

991
00:42:04,964 --> 00:42:06,263
Don't you get it?
We're past that now.

992
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:07,832
- I don't want to know!
- Jeff...

993
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:09,867
In fact, I never really
wanted to know, I just...

994
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,902
I just wanted you to tell me.

995
00:42:11,938 --> 00:42:13,737
But now, no matter
what you tell me,

996
00:42:13,773 --> 00:42:16,240
I won't ever believe
it's the truth.

997
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:17,575
Jeff, let me in.

998
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,776
It's over, Jessica.

999
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:20,811
It's done.

1000
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:28,552
We're done.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
