1
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,503
- That's not
woodall coming after us.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,604
- It's sean cahill.

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:08,240
- If your hands weren't full
with eric,

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:10,275
They will be full with me.

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,711
- What happened to "you think
I'm staying if you leave?"

6
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:13,712
- Yeah, that was before
I knew

7
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,280
You were gonna screw
over sidwell.

8
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,216
- Forstman doesn't throw
money around

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,250
Without getting something
in return.

10
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,219
- I have no other choice!

11
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,054
- You two are on opposite sides
of a takeover battle,

12
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,323
And your girlfriend
is your associate.

13
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,025
- Are you trying to say
that we're colluding?

14
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,059
- You went right there,
didn't you?

15
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,133
- So we're just gonna go back
and forth trading favors?

16
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,601
- Are you my lawyer or not?

17
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:38,337
Seriously, rachel, I couldn't
have done it without you.

18
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:40,339
- Logan, I should go.

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,477
- Damn right.
You get one, huntley.

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,546
Eisenheim, you
silly son of a bitch.

21
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,314
You think I'd leave you
out of the fun?

22
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,350
Riceman, after you killed
the singer depo.

23
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,619
Out of my way, johnson.

24
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,187
Coffee's for closers.
You don't get a mug.

25
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,056
- Am I to assume I'm getting
my own personal lit-up mug?

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,057
- Absolutely not.

27
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,292
Those are mere mugs.

28
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,796
This, my lady, is a chalice.

29
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,097
- Okay.

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,532
It looks like
all the other ones.

31
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:07,566
- No, donna.

32
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,536
What makes this a chalice
is not the mug.

33
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,838
It's what's inside.

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,673
- Wait a second. Is that--

35
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,175
- Mm-hmm, an exact replica
of the one

36
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,344
Dame judi dench wore
as ophelia.

37
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,647
- Louis, this must
have cost a fortune.

38
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,681
- Donna, please.

39
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,416
You helped me overcome
my stage fright.

40
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,386
You can't put
a price on that.

41
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,589
- I don't know what to say.

42
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,660
- That's all you have to say.

43
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:35,828
I got one for harvey too.

44
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,296
- You know, louis,
I don't think that--

45
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,164
- I know he is still upset
with me

46
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,632
For leading mike to forstman,

47
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,534
But I just thought maybe
if he could--

48
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,535
- Give it to me.

49
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,405
I will take care of it.

50
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:49,508
- Thank you, donna.

51
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,112
- Hey, mike,
sidwell wants to see you.

52
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,280
- Sh--.

53
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,448
- What?

54
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,684
- He took forstman's money
last night.

55
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,853
- Do you think he knows
you're gonna cut him

56
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,154
Out of the deal?

57
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:05,157
- There's only one way
to find out.

58
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,883
You wanted to see me?

59
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:35,621
- Damn right I did.

60
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,925
Something you want
to tell me?

61
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:43,328
- Jonathan,
I don't know what to say.

62
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,796
- Well, you better
think of something

63
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,431
'cause I just got off the phone
with some asshole

64
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,400
From the scc who accused you

65
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,837
Of colluding
with harvey specter.

66
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,206
- That's bullsh--.

67
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,941
- Then why the hell were the two
of you sharing a porterhouse

68
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,442
When you were supposed
to be buying stock

69
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,710
From me
two nights ago?

70
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,612
- It's not what you think.
- What I think is

71
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,814
You better start telling me
what's going on around here.

72
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,216
- There's nothing going on.

73
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,551
Look, I know that guy.
He's full of sh--.

74
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,818
- Well, I don't know him
from a hole in the ground,

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,487
But I know that
you're keeping stuff from me.

76
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,688
- Jonathan, I--

77
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,424
Then you blow
a straight-up stock purchase

78
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,426
That any first-year trader
could do in his sleep.

79
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,494
- It wasn't straight-up.

80
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,562
I had to set up
an auction,

81
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,230
Which happened
to get postponed.

82
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,231
- Yeah, 'cause you were
sipping wine

83
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,632
With harvey specter behind
my back.

84
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,967
- It got postponed
because my girlfriend

85
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,468
Was in the hospital.

86
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,305
- What?

87
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,706
- Rachel
passed out at school.

88
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,941
Harvey and I went
to the hospital,

89
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,342
So we pushed the sale.

90
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,978
- Then you should have told me.
- You're right.

91
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,513
I should have.
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,382
But that's what happened.

93
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,251
- That's it?

94
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,653
- That's it.

95
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,290
- Fine.

96
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,827
But if there is anything else
that you're not telling me,

97
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,796
Now is the time.

98
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,270
- There isn't.

99
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,661
- Well?

100
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,396
- Allison is at dinner
with some friends,

101
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,897
But she'll be home soon.

102
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,733
I have to go.

103
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,701
- Come on, we're working.

104
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,038
We're not working.

105
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,375
I am sneaking around,
pretending to work

106
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,277
So that I can spend time
with you.

107
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,879
- Sneaking around?

108
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,848
- That's what I'd call it,
wouldn't you?

109
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,484
- I don't know.

110
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:50,022
I just don't really want
to think of it like that.

111
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,957
- I have to go.

112
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,895
- Well, she's with her friends.

113
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,997
Aren't you allowed to be
with your friends?

114
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,368
- Is that what we are,
we're friends?

115
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:12,477
- I was actually hoping
that we're more than that.

116
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,983
- Mm, we shouldn't be
having this conversation.

117
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,820
- You wouldn't be here

118
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,990
If you didn't want to be
having this conversation.

119
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,460
- Rachel.

120
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:34,466
- We have had chemistry
from the second we met.

121
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:38,937
You know it.

122
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,041
And I know it.

123
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,608
- Rachel.
Hey.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,876
- Hi.

125
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,645
- What are you doing here?

126
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,814
- I am here because I wanted
to talk to you

127
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,716
Before you came in
to see harvey this morning.

128
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,052
- Do you want some coffee?

129
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,954
- No, I won't be here
long enough for that.

130
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,156
- Are you sure?

131
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,458
- Look, logan.

132
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,893
- I know why you're here.

133
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,496
- If you knew why I was here,

134
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,598
Then I wouldn't need
to be here.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,400
- I think you're here to tell me
that what's happening

136
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:45,871
Isn't really happening,
but it is.

137
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,642
I have a boyfriend
that I love,

138
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,178
So I need you to
stop pursuing me.

139
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,047
No more flowers,
no more looks,

140
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,016
No more attempted kisses,

141
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,651
No more anything, okay?

142
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,788
- Look, you said that if
I knew why you were here,

143
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,791
You wouldn't need to be here.

144
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,759
I think you do need
to be here,

145
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,629
And we both know why.

146
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,165
- You're wrong.

147
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:18,203
- I don't think I am.

148
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,172
You once told me
we had chemistry

149
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,674
The second that we met.

150
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,648
- Logan, please.

151
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,685
- Tell me to stop,
and I'll stop.

152
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,235
- I can't.

153
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,903

00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,835
♪ the greenback boogie ♪

163
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,241
- Harvey, I need to--

164
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,909
- What the hell is this?

165
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,811
- It's from louis.
He wanted you to have it.

166
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,881
- What do you mean he wanted me
to have it?

167
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,083
- You haven't talked to him
since mike landed forstman.

168
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,518
It's a gesture.

169
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,719
Now, can I please
get back to what--

170
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,654
- Oh, why didn't you say
it was a gesture?

171
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,724
Mike has access to forstman
and his $4 billion.

172
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,559
Logan's on his way over
to discuss

173
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,061
Our next move, which we can't
make for two more weeks

174
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,631
Because louis thought sheila
was marrying lorenzo lamas,

175
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,266
But I just got a mug
with something stupid

176
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,768
Printed on it,
so now everything's okay.

177
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,203
- Great.

178
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,304
Are you done being a dick?

179
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,906
Because everything's
not okay.

180
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,307
- What did louis do now?
- Nothing.

181
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,676
And logan sanders isn't
on his way here

182
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,713
Because he just got
brought down to the scc.

183
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:12,918
- What the hell do you think
you're doing

184
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,286
Talking to my client
without me present?

185
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,787
- Oh, he hasn't said a word yet.

186
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,056
- And what gives you
the right

187
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,257
To bring him here
in the first place?

188
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,159
- The United States government
gives me the right,

189
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,562
I would like to ask him.

190
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,163
- You got questions for him,
you ask me.

191
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,164
- Okay, here's one.

192
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,699
What makes you think
you can get away

193
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,067
With collusion on my watch?

194
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,769
- I already told you
we're not colluding,

195
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,071
And you harassing my client
won't change that.

196
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,339
- Will me telling him
about your date

197
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,308
The other night
with mike ross change that?

198
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,842
- What?

199
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,179
To allow you to purchase
gillis industry stock

200
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,180
At a cut rate price.

201
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,582
- That's bullsh--.

202
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,785
While neither one
of you ended up bidding?

203
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,787
And logan here mysteriously
bought the stock

204
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,322
Without any competition.

205
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,724
- That's it. We're done.

206
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,759
You didn't bring us in here
to ask him questions.

207
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,362
You brought us in here to ask me
questions in front of him.

208
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,897
- Am I smart enough
to do that?

209
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,966
- You're dumb enough to try,
and we're leaving.

210
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,100
- I have not dismissed you yet.

211
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,903
- Then arrest us on the way out.

212
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,672
- Gentlemen.

213
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,313
- Hey, what's going on?

214
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,115
You look upset.

215
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,316
- No, it's nothing.

216
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,986
I just found out
I have to go to columbia,

217
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,621
So could you just tell harvey
that I won't be able

218
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,755
To make the logan meeting?

219
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,190
- Rachel,
there is no meeting.

220
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,258
Logan got hauled down
to the scc.

221
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,793
- What?

222
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,161
I just saw him this morning.
That doesn't make--

223
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,098
- Well, it must have been--
wait a second.

224
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,333
They picked him up
at his condo.

225
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,937
Why were you at logan's condo?

226
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,673
- Donna, please don't
do your thing on me.

227
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,309
- Rachel, what is going on?

228
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,847
- The other night
I was working with logan,

229
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:53,051
And things got intense,
and he tried to kiss me.

230
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,886
- Okay, so what did you do?

231
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,656
- Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

232
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,025
- Then why were you at
his condo this morning?

233
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,161
- I went to tell him
that I didn't want him

234
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,329
To get the wrong idea.

235
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,797
- Rachel, if you went
to his place,

236
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,666
You were giving him
the wrong idea.

237
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,904
- Something happened,
didn't it?

238
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,107
- I kissed him.

239
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,443
- How long?

240
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,778
- Too long.

241
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,179
God, I feel horrible.

242
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,213
I'm a horrible person.

243
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,882
- No, you're not.

244
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,986
You are a great person
who had a not-so-great moment.

245
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,088
- Donna, please, you can't
say a word to anyone.

246
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,356
- Of course not.

247
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,459
But rachel, you can't say
a word to anyone either.

248
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,734
- Go ahead,
say what you're gonna say.

249
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:43,735
- You know what
I'm gonna say.

250
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:44,903
Is what he said true?

251
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,838
- Logan, I am not
colluding with mike ross.

252
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,906
- Well, if I thought that,

253
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,074
I wouldn't even
be standing here.

254
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,776
I'm talking about you
buying that stock.

255
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,812
- Look, I can't talk about that.
- Why not?

256
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,114
- Because telling you about it
would make it parking,

257
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,148
But that doesn't
matter anymore

258
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,150
Because now that
that guy hauled you in,

259
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,086
We can't do a thing
with those shares anyway.

260
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,788
- Well, what can we do?

261
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,091
- You and mike ross can get
in a room together,

262
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,960
And put this thing to bed
once and for all.

263
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,795
- No, that's a bad idea.

264
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,098
- Logan, if we don't finish
this now,

265
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,299
You're gonna have the scc

266
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,000
Crawling up your ass
day and night.

267
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,302
- Look, you can try
to scare me all you want,

268
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,837
But I did nothing wrong,

269
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,438
And the last guy I'm getting
in a room with

270
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,907
Is mike goddamn ross.

271
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,748
- Don't you ever knock?

272
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,217
- Logan sanders got taken
downtown this morning.

273
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,485
- Sean cahill.

274
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,486
- Son of a bitch is
throwing sh--

275
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,754
At the wall
to see what sticks.

276
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,956
- And what stuck?
- Wexler.

277
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,357
Logan found out
we bought that stock.

278
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,259
- Did you tell him
why we kept it from him?

279
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,094
- He didn't seem to care.
- All right.

280
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,964
This takeover battle now.

281
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,299
- What do you think I've been
doing for the past month?

282
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,401
- Harvey, I don't think you
understand what I'm saying.

283
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,138
This guy's already looking
at us for collusion.

284
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,506
The longer this thing drags on,

285
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,040
The more likely he is
to come after us

286
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,142
For buying that stock.

287
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:00,078
- In other words,
end this thing?

288
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,513
- Not in other words.

289
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:04,082
In those exact words.

290
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,857
- So I guess jonathan didn't
know you sold him out.

291
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,793
- How'd you know that?

292
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,194
- Because if he knew,

293
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,195
He'd have come
by your office

294
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,463
And ripped you to pieces.

295
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,098
Instead, you're out here
enjoying a bagel

296
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,399
Without the courtesy
of coming by

297
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,234
To tell me that he didn't know.
- My bad.

298
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,436
- So now what
are we gonna do?

299
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,905
- Well, we're
gonna kick some ass.

300
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,974
- Wait.
What are you talking about?

301
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,843
- The scc called sidwell,

302
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,012
And I guarantee you
they also called logan sanders,

303
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,347
Which means harvey can't
use those shares,

304
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,816
And I'm in the driver's seat.

305
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,851
- Well, that explains it.
- Explains what?

306
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,320
- Harvey just called.
He wants to have a meeting.

307
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,459
- Jeff.
- Hey.

308
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,094
- Did you hear what
sean cahill did this morning?

309
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,163
- I did. Yeah.

310
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,065
- Then you know he's poking
around the wexler purchase.

311
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,099
- Ah, let him.

312
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,401
- You don't seem
very concerned.

313
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,603
- I'm not concerned
because I did a damn good job

314
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,839
Protecting this firm
from any liability.

315
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,173
- Yeah, well, the question is
did you protect us

316
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,843
From all liability?

317
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:09,214
- Is there something that
you want to ask me, jessica?

318
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,115
- I want you to go
back over your work

319
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,886
With a fine-tooth comb,
and make sure it's airtight.

320
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,388
- Jessica, you're the one
who asked me to buy that stock,

321
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,359
And I made it questionable,
like you asked,

322
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,629
But if sean cahill comes at
us for attempting to park it,

323
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,965
That is on you,
not my work.

324
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,168
- Jeff, just go back over
everything like I said.

325
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,236
- There's nothing
to go back over.

326
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,971
We're as protected as we can be.

327
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,239
- Okay, maybe you
didn't hear me.

328
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,241
Every partner at this firm

329
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,009
Goes over their work
if I say so.

330
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,110
- And you know what, jessica?

331
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,580
I'm not every goddamn partner.

332
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:46,150
So either you trust me
or you don't.

333
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,593
- Hey, look what the cat
dragged in.

334
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,129
Such a serious expression.

335
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,965
- It's because we need to have
a serious conversation.

336
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,200
- Well, let's get to it.

337
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,468
- I want you to come up
with a number

338
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,371
That we can pay you
to end this thing.

339
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,207
- And why would I do that?

340
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,609
- Because sean cahill
hauled logan into the scc.

341
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,978
- Well, all that means is
that you can't vote

342
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
The shares that
you stole from me,

343
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,982
And that is a "you" problem.

344
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,252
- Mike, it takes two people
to make a case for collusion.

345
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,521
So if he's coming at us,
he's coming at you,

346
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,657
Which means
it's a "we" problem.

347
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,592
- Yeah, you can try
and spin it any way you want,

348
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,994
But I'm happy right where I am.

349
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,262
- I guess you agreed
to this meeting

350
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,397
Just to waste my time,
huh?

351
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,498
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

352
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,567
Who said
I don't want to deal?

353
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,169
- Don't play me.

354
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,537
- Here's the new deal.

355
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,440
You don't buy me out.
I buy you out.

356
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,242
- What?
- We tried it logan's way.

357
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,610
Now we're gonna try it mine...
- Mike.

358
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,578
- 'cause the only way I'd get
in a room with that guy

359
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,149
Is if you guarantee that
I leave with gillis industries.

360
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,483
- He's not gonna
agree to that.

361
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:57,121
- That's another "you" problem.

362
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,062
- Rachel, I need to
know what's going on

363
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,597
With logan sanders.
- What?

364
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,734
- You spent an extra 20 hours
with him last week.

365
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,369
It wasn't billed
to the takeover,

366
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,171
And I need to know
what it's about.

367
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,274
- We were looking
at future deals.

368
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,976
- "we"?
- Yes, we.

369
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,313
He asked me if I could help him
put together some ideas--

370
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,582
- Why?
- What are you getting at?

371
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,551
- I don't know if you've been
paying attention around here,

372
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,519
But we need to wrap
this thing up,

373
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,489
So I need to know if whatever
you and logan were up to

374
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,492
Can force him to end this thing
with mike once and for all.

375
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,195
- It can.

376
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,530
- How?

377
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:43,267
- Logan is under pressure
from his board,

378
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,138
And if he doesn't
close this deal soon,

379
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,540
He might lose control
of his company.

380
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,676
- Jessica, I must say
your impromptu lunch

381
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,344
In the middle of the day
is exactly

382
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,779
What the doctor ordered.
- Thank you, louis.

383
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,482
Now, I must admit
that I brought you here

384
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,183
Because I have something
that I didn't want

385
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,152
To discuss at the office.

386
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,553
- If you're firing harvey,
I can't be in on it.

387
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,788
I just bought him
an amazing mug,

388
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,323
And we're in
a really good place right now.

389
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,059
- And I'm happy for you,
but this isn't about harvey.

390
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,260
It's about the firm.

391
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,362
We recently purchased
a large block of stock

392
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,764
Without realizing
that we represent

393
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,565
A client
with the same interests.

394
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,134
- You're worried
about the appearance

395
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,402
Of parking the stock?
- Exactly.

396
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,070
And I just want
to make sure that we are

397
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,140
As protected as possible.

398
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,644
- Sure, I can do it.

399
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,746
- You seem upset.
- No, I'm not upset.

400
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,181
I mean, why would
I be upset, jessica?

401
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,549
You take me to
an amazing restaurant,

402
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,284
Then you give me some
bullsh-- story

403
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,420
About a stock purchase
with a fabricated company,

404
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,388
And when it's clear as day
this is gillis industries.

405
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,457
- Louis.
- The very same stock purchase

406
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,825
That you went to malone
to structure,

407
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,094
Because you don't trust him.

408
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,762
- Oh, question is
can I trust you?

409
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,432
- What?
- This lunch isn't about him.

410
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,733
It's about you.

411
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,569
- You knew I'd figure this out.

412
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,271
- Just like I know
you'll figure out

413
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,540
Whether or not we have exposure.

414
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,275
Now, the question is
can you do it

415
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,776
Without telling jeff malone?

416
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:04,482
- I can, and I will.

417
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,755
- If you're gonna discuss
what happened,

418
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,256
You can just forget it
because I--

419
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,093
- I am not here to talk
about that, and you know it.

420
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,327
- What?

421
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,830
- You told harvey about
my problems with the board.

422
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,765
- I told your attorney
about a situation

423
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,533
You discussed
with your other attorney.

424
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,435
- And now he's using it
to strong-arm me

425
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,536
Into caving to mike.

426
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,604
- No, now he's using it
to give you

427
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,439
The opportunity
to impress your board.

428
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,174
- Did you bring harvey that
information to get rid of me?

429
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,310
- Logan, I didn't bring
harvey that information,

430
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,444
He asked me for it.

431
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,279
And I don't need to get rid
of you

432
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,448
Because what happened
this morning is

433
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,150
Never gonna happen again.

434
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,686
- Okay, rachel,
you got what you wanted.

435
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,287
I'm gonna get in
a room with mike

436
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,223
And come to an agreement.

437
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,693
- What do you mean you're
gonna get in a room with him?

438
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,361
- Well, how else did
you see this happening?

439
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,763
Did you think I was gonna
let harvey take care of it?

440
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:56,367
- Look, please, you can't
tell him what happened.

441
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,838
- Rachel,
I would never do that.

442
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,473
- Thank you.

443
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,275
- Just to be clear,
's not for him.

444
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,244
It's for me...

445
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,445
'cause you say
what happened this morning

446
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,579
Will never happen again,

447
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,582
And I'm still hoping
that it will.

448
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,751
But I don't want it to happen
because you two are fighting.

449
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:18,289
I want it to happen
because you want it to.

450
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,373
- Hey.
- Hey.

451
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,575
- Do you want me to heat
some of this up or you?

452
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,443
- Mike, I need
to talk to you.

453
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,712
- Are you upset about something?

454
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,548
- No.

455
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,484
I heard you might be
making a deal.

456
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,455
- And you're worried because
you're on the losing side?

457
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,792
- No, I'm actually happy
that this thing will be over.

458
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,893
- But?

459
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,428
- I think that you
should have

460
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,363
Jonathan sidwell put this
to bed for you.

461
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,432
- Rachel--

462
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,800
- You and harvey
have so much bad blood.

463
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,402
- Yeah, and this is our
chance to patch it up.

464
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,970
- And what about logan?
- What about him?

465
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,739
I'm not gonna let him get to me.

466
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:09,974
- That's what you said
the last time

467
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,410
- Mike.
- Rachel, stop it.

468
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,678
Look, we're at the finish line.

469
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,413
I'm not gonna pass the baton
to somebody else,

470
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,783
And I'm not gonna blow it
because this time

471
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:23,888
I've got all the leverage.

472
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,592
- Well, if you have
all the leverage, then...

473
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,595
Maybe you should
ask for one more thing.

474
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,669
- I got stuck in traffic.

475
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,573
With that guy if I didn't.

476
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,775
- Good. So we're not gonna
have trouble in there?

477
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,843
- Not from me.

478
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:46,978
- Then let's get
this thing over with

479
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,246
And get back to normal.

480
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,382
- Keep that in mind.

481
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,984
Logan, sorry I'm late.

482
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:57,488
Let's get to it.

483
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,458
- All right,
just so we're clear,

484
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,994
We're agreeing to have
you buy us out.

485
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,362
- Good.

486
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,597
I think you'll find
this more than generous.

487
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,535
- It is.

488
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,272
- You gonna try and spread
this over 1,000 payments?

489
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,007
- All up front.

490
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,278
- Then all that's left
is for you

491
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,379
To pull out your checkbook.

492
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,781
- Well, actually,
there is one more thing.

493
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,449
You said it, harvey.

494
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,852
Let's get things
back to normal.

495
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:28,886
- What are you talking about?

496
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,321
- Once this deal is done,

497
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,590
You go back to being my lawyer,
and he's out.

498
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,724
- What?

499
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,760
- You sign that,
I'm harvey's client,

500
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,728
And you're looking
for new representation.

501
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,464
- That's--this is bullsh--.

502
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,699
- It's not bullsh--.

503
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,501
Apple and dell don't
have the same attorneys,

504
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:44,769
And neither will you and I.

505
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,470
- Mike, you two
aren't those two,

506
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,938
And I can represent you both.

507
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,040
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter

508
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,875
Because it's not
about who you represent.

509
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,476
It's about
who rachel represents.

510
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,477
- All right, enough.

511
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,645
We agreed to a number.

512
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,781
We can work this out
another time.

513
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,049
- No, we're gonna
work it out right now.

514
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,650
- No, we're not.
- Then you don't have a deal.

515
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,052
- God damn it, mike.

516
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,553
This isn't the time to do this.

517
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,654
- This is exactly
the time to do it

518
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,855
Because this is
the last time

519
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,957
I'm ever gonna be
in a room with him.

520
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,626
- Well, finally,
something we can agree on.

521
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:09,860
- Then let's agree
to something else.

522
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,362
We let harvey choose
which one of us

523
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,730
He wants to represent
after today.

524
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:16,667
- Mike, do not put me in that--
- done.

525
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,469
And now that we've agreed
to let harvey decide,

526
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:20,805
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

527
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,341
The way he got me into this
room in the first place

528
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,609
Was he knows that I've got
ten deals lined up after this.

529
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,677
- Logan.

530
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,613
- Decide.

531
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,459
- I'm going with mike.

532
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,993
- What?
- Mike's my guy.

533
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,129
You knew that going in.
- I don't give a shi--,

534
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,864
And I don't think
jessica pearson

535
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,933
Is going to let you
pick him over me.

536
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,634
- Jessica has nothing to do
with this.

537
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,036
You just agreed
to those terms.

538
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,437
- Those were bullsh-- terms.

539
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,572
- So you're going back
on your word?

540
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,706
- What does it look like?

541
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,676
- Looks like there's
no deal on gillis.

542
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,985
- Mike, you didn't have
to blow up the deal like that.

543
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,553
- Your client
blew up the deal.

544
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,622
- Because you blindsided him.
- Fine.

545
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,591
Then once he's had time
to think about it,

546
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,593
You go back and convince him.
- Convince him?

547
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:16,861
You should have come
to me first

548
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,496
Instead of looking to rub it
in his face.

549
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,897
- I wasn't rubbing anything
in anyone's face.

550
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,031
- Oh, bullsh--.
You have leverage,

551
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,566
And you want to make
sure he knew it.

552
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,034
- And when he had leverage,
he made sure I knew it,

553
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,569
And I didn't agree to a deal,

554
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,738
And then break my word
ten seconds later.

555
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
- And I'm giving you my word.

556
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,042
Close this deal,
and as soon as it's wrapped up,

557
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,544
He's out.

558
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,546
- And what about jessica?
Is she gonna agree to it?

559
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:36,881
- Let me deal with jessica.

560
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,449
- Oh, just like
you did on wexler.

561
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:39,450
- That was a different thing,

562
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,018
And you know it.
- Do I?

563
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:46,424
Get him to agree up front,
or we don't have a deal.

564
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,497
- Louis, I don't usually
get summoned to people.

565
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,665
They get summoned to me.

566
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,966
- But you wanted discretion,

567
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,768
And your office is within
an earshot of jeff malone.

568
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,769
- And you don't want him
to hear

569
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,571
What you're about to tell me.

570
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:04,074
- So first off, I went through
this backwards and forwards,

571
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:09,213
And jeff did a better job
than 99% of all attorneys.

572
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:13,484
Fortunately for you,
I'm the one.

573
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:14,852
- You found a mistake.

574
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,888
- I found a blessing
in disguise.

575
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,623
- What are you talking about?

576
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:24,094
- Jessica, we're not vulnerable
to allegations of parking

577
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,830
Because we never bought
those shares.

578
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,498
- We can't sell them back.

579
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,732
- I'm not talking
about selling them back.

580
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,902
This mistake makes
the entire sale invalid.

581
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,704
- And we don't have exposure

582
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,506
Because the sale never happened?

583
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,774
- Just give me the word,

584
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,175
And I'll david blaine
this whole thing away.

585
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,044
- Louis, this is great work,

586
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,046
But I don't want you to
do anything

587
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:45,549
Until you talk to harvey.
- Are you sure?

588
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:46,784
Because I can just--

589
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,786
- Louis, I bought these shares
without telling him.

590
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,988
I'm not getting rid of them
without telling him.

591
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,958
Are we clear?
- As a bell.

592
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,169
Well, someone saved the day.
- Do tell.

593
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,637
- Jeff malone just dropped
a giant deuce

594
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,771
On jessica's desk.

595
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,206
- Please tell me
you're being metaphorical.

596
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,042
- Nope. Made a huge mess
of the wexler purchase.

597
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,178
- And you cleaned it up?
- Even better.

598
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,614
Because of his blunder,
I'm gonna make it

599
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,215
As though his sh---y deal
never even happened.

600
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,817
- What did jessica say?
- Oh, she loved it.

601
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,986
- And what about malone?
- That's the best part.

602
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,721
That asshole doesn't
even know about it.

603
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,223
- What do you need me to do
to make this unwind happen?

604
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,526
- Nothing.

605
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,027
Jessica just wanted me to run it
by harvey first,

606
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,629
But I haven't been
able to reach him.

607
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,197
- Able to reach him?

608
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,699
Louis, what do you think is
gonna happen

609
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,636
If malone gets wind of this
before you talk to harvey?

610
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,205
- Ah, sh--, he's gonna
try to fix it himself.

611
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,773
- And once again,
he'll be taking

612
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:43,908
What's rightfully yours.

613
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,942
- And I'll be left holding
a big bag

614
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,577
Of jeff malone's giant deuce.

615
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,279
- Where are you going?

616
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:52,082
- To do what
needs to be done.

617
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:55,319
- Rachel,
what the hell did you do?

618
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,787
- What are you talking about?

619
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,189
- Mike demanded that harvey
dump logan as a client,

620
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,025
And it blew up
the whole deal,

621
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,793
And based on
what I know and harvey doesn't,

622
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,762
It wasn't mike
behind that demand.

623
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,298
It was you.

624
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,600
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

625
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,735
What good does sorry do?

626
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,037
- Donna, I thought it was
the best thing

627
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,305
For everyone involved.

628
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,307
Logan out of the picture

629
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,641
And not deal with what happened.

630
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,143
- No, I tried to deal
with what happened

631
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:22,079
Without telling anyone,
which is what you told me to do.

632
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,648
- I did not tell you
to let your personal life

633
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,816
Affect harvey's business.

634
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,785
- I was just trying
to get mike and harvey

635
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,053
Back on the same team.

636
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,955
- I want you to understand
that the way

637
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:34,158
To do that isn't to pull strings
behind their backs.

638
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,630
- I do.

639
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,966
Okay, well, there's got
to be some way to fix it.

640
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:44,201
- That's not the point.
It's being fixed.

641
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,703
- What are you talking about?

642
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:48,138
- Harvey's going
over mike's head.

643
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,874
He went to see charles forstman
20 minutes ago.

644
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,654
- Whoever said size doesn't
matter never saw this table.

645
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:07,625
- Is that an insult
or a compliment?

646
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:11,228
- Knowing you, charles,
you'll take it as both.

647
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,798
- How'd you get
in here, harvey?

648
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,333
You crawled in
through the vents?

649
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,702
- I told your secretary I
was george clooney's brother.

650
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,871
She said it was obvious who
got the looks in the family.

651
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,641
- Great.
Do me a favor.

652
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,676
Tell her she's fired
on the way out.

653
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,277
- Can do.

654
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,713
But first, I wanted
to show you these.

655
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,086
- You want to give me
the aston martin?

656
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,788
- "give" is a strong word.

657
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,661
You want me to buy you out.

658
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,429
- You're going to buy me out.

659
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,032
- So why come to me instead
of mike ross?

660
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,834
- Because I put him and logan
sanders in a room together,

661
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,070
And those two assholes let
their personal sh--

662
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:54,672
Get in the way of business.

663
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,906
- So what makes you think

664
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,042
These two assholes
are gonna do any better?

665
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,077
- Because as much
as you hate my guts,

666
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,114
You want this deal
and that car as much as I do.

667
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:07,718
- Harvey, taking
your car is tempting,

668
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,990
But I don't think buying you
out makes sense anymore.

669
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,324
- Why not?

670
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:17,327
- Because you're standing
there asking me to do it.

671
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:22,900
Now, walk your sorry ass
out of my office.

672
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,868
- Okay, charles.

673
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,939
But I'm afraid you're forcing me
to use my leverage on you.

674
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,741
- You don't have
sh-- on me, pal.

675
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,109
- Who do you think bought
that wexler block

676
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,410
Three days ago?

677
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,312
- I don't give a sh-- who
bought it three days ago.

678
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:38,315
- 'cause it just went back
on the market 30 minutes ago,

679
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,417
And you're looking at
the man who owns it now.

680
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,896
- Jonathan, what
are you doing here?

681
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:57,735
- Forstman bought
the wexler shares.

682
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,803
- What?

683
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:03,240
- They went back on the market,
and he snatched them right up.

684
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,809
- Holy sh--.

685
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,778
- We win.

686
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,980
- We do.
- Mm-hmm.

687
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,984
- You did.

688
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,285
- It's not over yet.

689
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,488
I want you to draw up
a tender offer right away.

690
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,825
- Jonathan.
- What?

691
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,894
- I've been thinking
about forstman.

692
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,796
- And?

693
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,097
- You know we wouldn't have
been able

694
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,499
To do this without him,
right?

695
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:29,967
- No sh--.

696
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:33,070
- You want to team up
with him?

697
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:36,106
Well, you don't need
to convince me,

698
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,541
But how the hell are
you gonna convince him?

699
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,878
- By giving him
a discount on this deal.

700
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,079
- How much of a discount?

701
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:48,018
- Thinking somewhere in
the neighborhood of...100%.

702
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,824
- God damn it, louis!

703
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,292
What the hell did you do?

704
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,560
- What are you talking about?

705
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,028
- I just came from a meeting
with charles forstman,

706
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,797
And when I reached for
my bargaining chips,

707
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,231
He told me I didn't own them
anymore

708
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,167
Because you unwound
the wexler sale.

709
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,902
- Well, I was trying to save
the firm from exposure.

710
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,136
- And who the hell told
you to do that?

711
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,137
- Jessica did.

712
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,405
- She told you to god damn wait,

713
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,940
And you know it.
- Check your phone.

714
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:12,176
I tried calling you.
I left three messages.

715
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,877
- I don't care if you left me
a million messages.

716
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,813
You were told to
wait for my approval,

717
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,348
And you didn't listen
because you never god damn do.

718
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,850
- You know what, harvey?
I always listen.

719
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,119
I always play
the good soldier,

720
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,354
And what do I get for it?
Nothing.

721
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:28,125
I may not be a name partner,
but I am a senior partner.

722
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,593
You get it?

723
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,328
I couldn't reach you,

724
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,964
And I made
a goddamn judgment call.

725
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:36,166
- You want to know why you're
not a name partner, louis?

726
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,303
Because every judgment
call you make turns to sh--.

727
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,441
- Well, then what do you want,
harvey?

728
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:47,878
I'll do anything
to make up for it.

729
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,279
- You want to do something,
louis?

730
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,615
Instead of using donna
to give me

731
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:56,553
Some stupid goddamn mug,

732
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,523
Stay the hell
out of my business.

733
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,243
- You mind grabbing me
a couple packs of sugar there?

734
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,245
- I don't work here.
I'm with pearson-specter.

735
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,481
- I don't give
a sh-- who you're with.

736
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,116
If you're not here to give me
something--

737
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,252
- I'm here to give you harvey
specter on a silver platter.

738
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,521
- I already have harvey specter
on a silver platter.

739
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:35,459
- Not like you will
if you let me buy you out.

740
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:39,396
- Listen, asshole,
harvey came by last night,

741
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,464
Tried to make a deal.

742
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,066
I told him to shove it
up his ass,

743
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,902
And don't think
I don't know good cop,

744
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,370
Bad cop when I see it.

745
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,371
- The good cop, bad cop
doesn't work

746
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,306
When one of them hates
the other one.

747
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,375
- And what the hell is this?

748
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,910
Your niece's diary?

749
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:56,313
- It's a time capsule
of my rage.

750
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,653
- "April 22nd, 2009.

751
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,022
"harvey told me to file
a motion to dismiss

752
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,157
The odor emitting
from my armpits."

753
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,393
This is a joke.

754
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,128
- Once again, he
took my biggest fear,

755
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,264
Put it on display for
the entire world to see.

756
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,400
Oh, yeah, I can go on.

757
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,669
- He hates you that bad, huh?
- No.

758
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:19,703
He doesn't give
a sh-- about me at all.

759
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,271
I hate him that bad.

760
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,975
- You know, you don't have
the authority to buy me out.

761
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,276
- I went to harvey's client
behind his back,

762
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,145
And I got him.
- Oh, I see.

763
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,080
I agree to this,
you steal his client.

764
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:33,383
- And he'll have lost to me,
which is far more humiliating

765
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:34,985
Than losing to you.

766
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:38,989
- You'd go to all this trouble
to stick it to harvey?

767
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:41,224
- Read may 9th, 2012.

768
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:44,294
I'd go to the ends
of the goddamn earth.

769
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,341
- What was so important
you couldn't tell me

770
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,443
Over the phone?

771
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,678
- I want to offer you
something.

772
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,380
- My lucky day.

773
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:07,217
Everyone's bearing gifts.

774
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,553
You want me to
buy controlling interest

775
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,621
In the sidwell investment group.

776
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:15,258
- I want you to buy it
at a $80 million discount.

777
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,361
- The exact amount
I was gonna cut him out of.

778
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:20,163
- Was?
Wait.

779
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,265
Did you change your mind?

780
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,600
You're not gonna cut him
out of gillis?

781
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,502
- Guess you haven't heard.
I'm done with gillis.

782
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,073
I sold my interest
to logan sanders.

783
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,677
- What the hell you
talking about?

784
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,279
That wasn't our deal.
- What can I tell you?

785
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,515
When you're the biggest bully
in the yard,

786
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,683
People give you
their lunch money

787
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,052
Without you even asking for it.

788
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,388
- Oh, my god.
You son of a bitch.

789
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,492
You promised me
that I would control

790
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,027
What happened to that company.

791
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,029
- I promised you if we won.

792
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,430
We didn't.

793
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:57,167
- You did.
- Yes, I did.

794
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,236
- Then our other deal
is off the table,

795
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,270
And you're gonna give
jonathan sidwell

796
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,705
His goddamn cut.

797
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:06,410
- How about I give
you something even better.

798
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:10,647
- What the hell is this?
- A job offer.

799
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:16,586
You got to be kidding me.

800
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,291
- What, did you think
I was gonna hang you out to dry?

801
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:24,194
I could use a smart son of bitch
like you working for me.

802
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,430
- You're the last person in
the world I'd want to work for.

803
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,599
- I am the only person in
the world you want to work for.

804
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,235
- Why is that?
- Because you're a nobody.

805
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,638
You're a former lawyer who's
been an investment banker

806
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,541
All of ten minutes, and is about
to blow the biggest deal

807
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:42,245
That ever came his way,
unless you come over to me.

808
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,229
- Go to hell.

809
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,405
- Harvey, we need
to have a little talk.

810
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,540
- I said everything
I needed to say last night.

811
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,810
Now get the hell out.
- I made a deal with forstman.

812
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,879
- What?

813
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,482
You stuck your nose
in my goddamn business

814
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,817
After I told you to never do
that again?

815
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,152
- No, I saved
your goddamn business

816
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:25,889
After you told me
to never do it again.

817
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:33,296
- You got him to sign this?
- Damn right.

818
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,532
- And who authorized it?
- Nobody.

819
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,567
I lied and told forstman
I had logan's approval.

820
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,604
Can we get logan's approval?

821
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:44,774
- You're goddamn right we can.

822
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:50,213
Louis, this has got to be
the most genius thing

823
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,482
You have ever done
in your entire, wonderful,

824
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,684
Miserable life.

825
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:57,921
- So you're not mad at me?

826
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,757
- Mad at you?
I could kiss you.

827
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,926
- And I can let you.

828
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:04,594
- Then go grab
a couple of your mugs.

829
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,862
I'll crack open the scotch,

830
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,731
And let's see
where this thing goes.

831
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,333
- Can do.

832
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,869
- Hey, louis,

833
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:18,575
How the hell did you get him
to go for it?

834
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:21,545
- We found common ground.

835
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,551
- One more thing.

836
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:35,659
Charles forstman got
the lit the hell up.

837
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,575
- Mike, mike,
sidwell wants to see you.

838
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,710
- Don't tell me.

839
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,679
- He knows.

840
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,615
- Sh--.

841
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,426
- You little piece of sh--.

842
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:10,961
- Jonathan, let me explain.

843
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,462
- There's nothing to explain.

844
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,864
You sold me out the second
you connected with forstman.

845
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,802
- No, I thought I could get
out of it, all right?

846
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,570
But then you took
forstman's money, and I--

847
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,905
- Oh, you're gonna put
that on me?

848
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,975
I took his money because
I thought we were partners.

849
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:27,477
I didn't know you were gonna
stab me in the goddamn back.

850
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,612
- Stab you in the back?

851
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,714
If I didn't make
this deal happen,

852
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:31,881
You said you
were gonna fire me.

853
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,416
- I don't give
a sh-- what I said.

854
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,419
I took a chance on you.
You spat in my face.

855
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,454
- Jonathan.

856
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,955
- You stood right there
selling me

857
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:41,391
On forstman to stop me from
finding out you betrayed me.

858
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:44,561
- No, I did that to stop me
from having to betray you.

859
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,296
Jonathan, he still owes us
money, all right?

860
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,631
We can still go after--

861
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:50,500
To ever trust you again.
- Listen to me.

862
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:51,768
I'm--
- no, you listen to me!

863
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,739
There is no goddamn "we."

864
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,675
You're fired.

865
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,613
- Jonathan, we can still talk
to forstman, all right?

866
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,981
- You think I didn't try that?

867
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,350
Who the hell do you think
told me

868
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,985
That you sold me out
in the first place?

869
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,322
Here.

870
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,591
Put this on your mantle.

871
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:19,729
Remember me every time
you god damn look at it.

872
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,546
- There is the man
of the hour.

873
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:41,885
Why didn't you tell me
what you were gonna do?

874
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,486
- Because if it didn't work,
I didn't want you

875
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,754
To take any of the blame.

876
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:48,825
- Well, why didn't
you tell me afterwards?

877
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,696
It's all anyone
can talk about.

878
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:55,932
- Yeah, I don't care.

879
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,367
- Louis.

880
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:58,968
- Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

881
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,570
Through switzerland
and the caymans

882
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,739
Before it comes out on the
other side.

883
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:06,676
- What?
He's trying to avoid taxes.

884
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,480
You're obligated to report it.

885
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:16,019
- I didn't,
and I'm not going to.

886
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,754
- Louis, that's illegal.

887
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,589
- You didn't see the
look on harvey's face

888
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,791
When he found out that I
was the one who saved the day,

889
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:25,028
And I am...

890
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,465
Not gonna be the one
to see the look

891
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,701
On his face
when he finds out that I didn't.

892
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,638
- Louis.

893
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,708
- Leave me alone.

894
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,114
- Hey, did you
hear the good news?

895
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:47,417
- There is no good news.

896
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:51,688
Logan won, which means
he's not going anywhere.

897
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,926
You want to tell mike
what happened, don't you?

898
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,695
- I am going to tell mike
what happened.

899
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,029
- No, you're not.

900
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,564
Harvey said he would drop logan

901
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,066
When this is over,
and he will.

902
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,668
- And there is no way that
he's dropping logan

903
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,171
If mike can't even be a client.

904
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,706
- What are you talking about?

905
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,074
- I just got a text from amy.

906
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:15,712
Donna, mike got fired.

907
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,848
- Now you really can't tell him.

908
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,917
- You said I shouldn't
go behind his back,

909
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,019
But not telling him is
going behind his back.

910
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,053
- Even if you
were gonna tell him,

911
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,889
This is
the absolute worst time.

912
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,023
- If not now, then when?

913
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,025
I mean, just wait
till he recovers,

914
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,493
And then smack
him down again?

915
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,028
- How about not
smacking him down at all?

916
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,499
- That would be great,
but I already did

917
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:41,638
When I betrayed him, and I--
- rachel, if you do this,

918
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,940
I am telling you it will
bore a hole in his brain,

919
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,943
And you will be risking
your whole life with mike.

920
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,145
- I am risking it if I don't.
- Rachel.

921
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:53,616
- Donna, mike kept a secret
from me that almost ripped us

922
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:58,822
Apart before we
even got started,

923
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:02,892
And he found the courage
to trust me with it.

924
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:08,598
So I need to find the courage
to trust him with this.
