Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:04,811
What I want is to work
at Pearson Specter

3
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:05,790
and to keep seeing you.

4
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,392
Those two things are not
both gonna happen.

5
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:08,893
You've been here
for three months.

6
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,945
All you've done is hit singles,
and I need a goddamn home run.

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,096
- Jonathan, listen--
- I don't want to hear it.

8
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:13,531
Start making us
some real money.

9
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,233
A man like Walter Gillis

10
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,235
isn't gonna listen
to a guy like you,

11
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,621
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

12
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,906
Walter, I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,443
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

14
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:27,412
All right,
I'm in.

15
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:28,446
You're talking
hostile takeover.

16
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:29,581
Gillis industries--

17
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:30,948
Logan, we have a conflict.

18
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,283
You're either with me
or against me.

19
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,752
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

20
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:37,922
Get moving on drawing up a
tender offer for Logan Sanders.

21
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,257
Do you remember
when I told you

22
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,727
that I once had an affair
with a married man?

23
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:44,863
It was him.

23
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,863
Season 4 - Episode 2 - Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner...

24
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,068
You're up early.

25
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:52,070
So are you.

26
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:53,905
Well, I have to be.
You don't.

27
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,109
I was already awake.
Thinking.

28
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,494
About last night?
Look, Mike, I--

29
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:02,330
- it's okay.
I'm good.

30
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:05,149
You're good with me working
on the takeover with Logan?

31
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:06,751
Why do you not
seem to believe me?

32
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:08,319
Because you weren't good
last night.

33
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:09,704
Which was before this morning

34
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:13,458
when I realized that
that's work.

35
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:14,992
This isn't.

36
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:21,099
So as long as we don't let
that affect this...

37
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,500
We won't.

38
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:25,520
In that case, let's set
some in-home ground rules.

39
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,388
Obviously, the first--

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,641
Uh, respecting
each other's privacy.

41
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:30,775
Exactly.

42
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,393
The left-hand side of the desk
belongs

43
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:33,844
to the United Nation of Ross.

44
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:37,198
- You're not a nation.
- I have a flag.

45
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,783
Fine.

46
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:41,369
As long as we agree
that any perusal of my phone

47
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:44,355
is considered a breach
of my borders.

48
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:45,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

49
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,858
I thought you liked it
when I breached your borders.

50
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:51,829
Mm, well, those are
different kind of borders.

51
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:53,998
In that case,
a breach is allowed.

52
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:57,368
- Allowed?
- Encouraged.

53
00:01:57,386 --> 00:02:01,038
- Requested.
- Demanded.

54
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:03,725
Let's go make you
late for work.

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,011
Mm.

56
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,813
Jessica, I am telling you.

57
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,648
The S.E.C. is gonna send
Jeff Malone after us,

58
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:13,884
and nobody is better suited
to beat him down than--

59
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:15,052
you guessed it

60
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,572
because we all know that

61
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:21,025
this is better than this,

62
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,861
which will result in this,

63
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:27,665
which will also result
in this

64
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,234
and this

65
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:33,904
and this.

66
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:35,906
And what do I want in return?

67
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:40,178
Oh, you know what I want.

68
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,180
You've always known.

69
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:44,048
And after I win,

70
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:48,085
you'll not only be willing
to give it to me.

71
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:53,308
You're gonna be begging
to give it to me.

72
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,693
Ha!

73
00:02:58,564 --> 00:02:59,697
- Louis.
- B--not now.

74
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:01,733
- Louis, I have to talk to you.
- B--not now.

75
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,100
How many times
have I told you?

76
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,286
Unless you have photoshopped
my head onto a dragon,

77
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,954
do not interrupt me
while I'm perfecting my pitch.

78
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,539
Your pitch doesn't need
to be perfect.

79
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:09,574
It needs to be now.

80
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:10,941
- Why?
- Malone is here.

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,494
- He's here?
- In the lobby.

82
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:14,866
And Jessica just asked
to see you.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,914
Oh, out of my way.

84
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,250
Aren't--aren't you going
to bring your easel?

85
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,253
Oh, I don't need an easel
to kick this sucker's ass.

86
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,425
Jessica.

87
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,928
Jessica, I got your message,
and I just wanted to--

88
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,764
Louis, this is Jeff Malone.

89
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:35,633
Yeah, I know who he is.
He's with the S.E.C.

90
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,403
He was
until this morning.

91
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:39,970
We brought him over
because we have reason

92
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,489
to believe
they'll be coming after us.

93
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:43,074
Wait, what?

94
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,776
Jeff is
our newest senior partner.

95
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,448
He's going to be taking on
the S.E.C.

96
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:51,916
Because you suck.

97
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,485
And I wanted to introduce him
to you first

98
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:56,754
because you're a loser.

99
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:00,925
Who can get him up to speed
on Felton Securities.

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,664
Because you're never
going to be name partner.

101
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:09,050
And you're both experts
in finance.

102
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:11,135
Louis, I'm really looking
forward to working with you

103
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,171
on Felton Securities.

104
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:18,776
Yeah, me too.

105
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:22,113
You suck.
You're a loser.

106
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:25,199
Louis?

107
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,485
Is there something else?

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,688
No.

109
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,123
Nothing.

110
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:48,139
How long you been
working on that?

111
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,223
Two hours.

112
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:50,541
You know it's called
a brief, right?

113
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:52,009
You know
his name's Harvey, right?

114
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:53,978
You make
a compelling argument.

115
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,012
So I got your note.

116
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:59,216
What do you wanna talk about?
Um...

117
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,217
Logan Sanders.

118
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:01,352
What about him?

119
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:05,055
We sort of dated
a few years ago.

120
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,392
Wait, hang on.
Define "sort of."

121
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,612
- Definitely.
- Define "dated."

122
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:13,064
We had an affair
while he was married.

123
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,098
Holy shit.

124
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,386
I know.
And I--

125
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:16,918
Yes, you have
to tell Harvey.

126
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:19,203
Because, Rachel, if there's
two things that Harvey hates,

127
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:22,707
it's things being kept from him
and things being kept from him.

128
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,625
- I know.
- Then what am I doing here?

129
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:26,076
I don't know
how to tell him.

130
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:28,679
Quickly, because Logan's
gonna be here in an hour.

131
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:30,014
What?

132
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:31,916
And, Rach, it's less important
how you tell Harvey

133
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,551
than that you tell Harvey.

134
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:36,387
Go.

135
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,474
Okay.

136
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:42,109

147
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:20,828
I was wondering all day
if you would be--

148
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,080
I can't do this.

149
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,648
What?
Rachel--

150
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,650
It's wrong.

151
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:28,119
Wrong?
You're the one who kissed me.

152
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,921
And I was wrong.

153
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,656
No, you weren't.

154
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,757
My whole life
I've done everything

155
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,831
that I was supposed to do,

156
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,427
and all it did
was make me miserable.

157
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,597
Ever since I met you...

158
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,183
I can't stop thinking about you,
and all I want to do--

159
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:44,469
Logan--
Logan, if we do this,

160
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:47,004
someone's gonna find out
at some point and then what?

161
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:51,142
I don't care.

162
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,358
Okay.

163
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,711
Harvey, I need to tell you--

164
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,829
Rachel?

165
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:16,467
Logan.

166
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,468
Where's Harvey?

167
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,803
I don't know.
I'm early.

168
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,705
He doesn't like it
when people--

169
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:24,709
- What are you doing here?
- I'm Harvey's associate.

170
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,477
You did it.
You went to law school.

171
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,763
Not exactly.
I'm in law school.

172
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,014
Rachel, that's great.

173
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,382
I'm really proud of you.

174
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,184
I'm just gonna come back.

175
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:36,821
You came in here to tell him
about us, didn't you?

176
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,406
How'd you know?

177
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,057
It's all over your face.

178
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,559
- Logan--
- Please don't tell him.

179
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:44,162
I have to tell him.

180
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:47,498
Rachel...

181
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,066
Do you know
what people think

182
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,169
when a son
takes over his father's company?

183
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,670
That his father's proud
of him?

184
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,672
That he didn't earn it.

185
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,874
Which is why I'm not looking
to advertise the fact

186
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,593
that I once had an affair.

187
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:01,429
You're not advertising it.
You're disclosing it to counsel.

188
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:03,881
Okay, look,
you want the truth?

189
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,551
I'm not proud of the way I was
back then.

190
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:10,438
The way I treated Allison,
the way I treated you.

191
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:11,939
But I'm not that person
anymore,

192
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,108
and I don't want people
to think that I am.

193
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,260
And I understand that,
but I work for Harvey,

194
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:19,096
and I can't keep things from him
that he needs to know.

195
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:20,565
- He doesn't need to know this.
- Yes, he does.

196
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,933
Why is that?

197
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:24,986
Because I happen to live
with the man on the other side

198
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,873
of the takeover battle.

199
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,382
Oh, no.
You need some me time already?

200
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,133
It's not me time.

201
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,885
It's "I'm gonna kick
your ass" time.

202
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,222
I think we both know you only
kick ass after eating a hot dog.

203
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,474
I could be drinking a juice
box and still kick your ass.

204
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:48,793
I don't think so,
because I have this.

205
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:51,312
Just read it to me.

206
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:54,482
"Harvey Specter,
you are summoned to"--

207
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:56,984
You gotta be kidding me.
You're subpoenaing me?

208
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,187
Oh, yeah.
I filed a T.R.O.

209
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,571
I'm gonna block
your tender offer.

210
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,806
Bullshit, you are.

211
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,408
Well, we'll see what the judge
has to say.

212
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,992
Oh, right.
You got your hands full.

213
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:06,661
Here, let me get that for you.
There you go.

214
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:08,646
Hearing's at 2:00.
I'll see you then.

215
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:10,198
Oh, Harvey, the suit--

216
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,484
it's a little dated for court,
don't you think?

217
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,154
Did you get everything
settled with hr?

218
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:19,340
Yeah.

219
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:22,326
Corner office.
You really must like me.

220
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,430
Don't get too excited.

221
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,881
You know, the last two partners
that had this office

222
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,299
didn't survive the year.

223
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,000
Then it's a good thing
I'm much better than they were.

224
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:31,769
You don't even know
who they were.

225
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,337
That doesn't matter, Jessica.
I know who I am.

226
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:36,674
Me too--
cocky lawyer in a corner office

227
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,643
who hasn't done a thing
for me yet.

228
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,312
Yet.

229
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,531
By the way, I understand it's
tradition for the name partner

230
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:44,965
to welcome a new partner
with lunch.

231
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:48,519
Jeff, when I told you
that our relationship

232
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,822
is now purely professional,
I was serious.

233
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,541
Jessica, what's not
purely professional about lunch?

234
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,877
Unless you mean the sex
that will be following lunch?

235
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:57,829
Oh, you're not hearing me.

236
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,331
Oh, I'm hearing you.
I'm just ignoring you.

237
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,717
But I promise I won't be
ignoring you at lunch.

238
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,635
Cocky.

239
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:14,312
Harvey. Harvey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

240
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,563
Yeah, sure,
come on in.

241
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:17,482
I was actually hoping
that we could talk in my office.

242
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,733
What's the--
You're early.

243
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:21,519
- Did you...
- Oh, you two haven't met.

244
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,154
Rachel, Logan.
Logan, Rachel.

245
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:24,655
- I guess you didn't.
- Didn't what?

246
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,223
We actually have met before.

247
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:28,242
That's why I was trying
to find you.

248
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,077
- To tell me you met our client?
- No.

249
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:33,230
To tell you that we used to be
in a relationship together.

250
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:37,535
You looking
to get back together?

251
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:38,669
No.

252
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,571
- Then I don't give a shit.
- Good.

253
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,590
Then we can move on to why
you didn't tell me that the guy

254
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,759
on the other side of this fight
used to be your associate.

255
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,711
- I was going to.
- When?

256
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,245
In 20 minutes, when you were
scheduled to be here.

257
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:49,680
Unfortunately,
I have to reschedule.

258
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,049
- Why?
- I have court.

259
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,184
Mike's alleging
I broke privilege.

260
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,186
- Did you?
- Yes, technically,

261
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,021
when I told you to move up
our timeline.

262
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,723
Now, if you'll excuse me.

263
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,592
W-wait a minute.
If you--if you broke privilege,

264
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,931
what are you gonna
tell the judge?

265
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,705
I don't know,
but until I think of something,

266
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,531
I'm going to confuse the shit
out of everyone I can.

267
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,282
That doesn't make any sense.

268
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,735
- It makes total sense.
- No, it doesn't, Your Honor.

269
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,320
All right, hold on.
Let me get this straight.

270
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,572
You work for him?
Worked. I was his associate.

271
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:16,073
Not the best associate,
Your Honor.

272
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,208
Is that relevant?

273
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,626
No, but I'd like it
on the record.

274
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,878
Well, it's on there now
whether we want it there or not.

275
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,247
And all I'm saying is, there's
no attorney-attorney privilege.

276
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:24,382
Finally, a fact.

277
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,383
An irrelevant fact,

278
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,751
because at the time
of the conflict,

279
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:28,586
I was his client.
Not the best client either.

280
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,055
Mr. Specter, shut up.
Now you're his client?

281
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,307
No, I was his client--
okay.

282
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,142
I was an associate
at Pearson Specter,

283
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:36,961
and then I left
to become an investment banker.

284
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:38,179
It's very confusing.

285
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,463
I'd dismiss the whole motion,
Your Honor.

286
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,983
I said, "shut up."

287
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,467
Are you an attorney
or an investment banker?

288
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:44,769
I'm an investment banker.

289
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,136
Then what the hell
are you doing in my chambers?

290
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:47,905
Acting as my own attorney.

291
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,241
And no matter how much he tries
to confuse the issue, he can't.

292
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,693
I told him I was going
after the same company he was,

293
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,695
and he used that knowledge
to move up his tender offer.

294
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:55,830
He waived conflict.

295
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,481
That doesn't apply
to privilege.

296
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,084
Bottom line is, he doesn't
have proof of anything.

297
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,318
I don't, but he does.

298
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:03,988
Unfortunately,
he can't force me to testify.

299
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:04,989
There's no precedent.

300
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,008
Fortunately, there is.

301
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:11,512
So go ahead, ask him
if he did what I'm saying.

302
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,550
Mr. Specter,
do I need to swear you in?

303
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,436
Give him the T.R.O.

304
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,887
You know,
I'll do more than that.

305
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,523
Not only can't your client make
a tender offer for 60 days,

306
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:27,645
they can't purchase any more
stock until then either.

307
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:32,817
I'm telling you,
we need to negotiate with him.

308
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,118
You mean pay him off?

309
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,686
Yes, that's exactly
what I mean.

310
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:39,523
Every day this drags on, it's
millions out of your pocket.

311
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,709
Well, from where I'm sitting,
all I can see is a lawyer

312
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:42,910
trying to distract me
from the fact

313
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,495
that this whole thing
is his fault.

314
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:45,863
If I didn't break privilege,

315
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,864
he might have locked
this whole thing up

316
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:47,865
before you knew
what hit you.

317
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,634
Fine.
We'll negotiate.

318
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,220
No, I'll negotiate.

319
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,172
No, not without me.

320
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,474
Do I need to draw you
a picture?

321
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,476
You, Mike, Rachel.

322
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,811
Harvey, I appreciate
your concern,

323
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,680
but this is my first deal, so
unless you're gonna pay him off

324
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:06,851
with your money,
I'm gonna be at that meeting.

325
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,657
What are you doing?

326
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,825
I'm writing in my diary.

327
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,777
Isn't that
what your dictaphone is for?

328
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:19,363
No, my dictaphone
is for my singular triumphs,

329
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,999
like when Harvey told me
I was the man,

330
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,753
and my diary is
for my most agonizing defeats,

331
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:28,572
such as when Jessica just told
me I'll never make name partner.

332
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,842
- Louis, she didn't say that.
- Well, she might as well have.

333
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,745
She just gave Malone
the corner office.

334
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:35,746
Oh, my God.

335
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,915
Yeah.

336
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,550
And what's more is
I think I agreed

337
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,185
to give him
Felton Securities.

338
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,921
Well, un-agree to it.

339
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,189
I can't.

340
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:47,091
I shook his hand.
The die is cast.

341
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:48,192
God damn it, Louis.

342
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,194
You know how this works.

343
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:51,645
First it's a case.
Then it's a client.

344
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,765
Before you know it, you're
on the 38th floor with Ted.

345
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:57,651
- Who's Ted?
- Exactly.

346
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,938
Holy shit.
What did I just do?

347
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,373
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

348
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,542
You're gonna stop writing
in that pussy diary,

349
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,711
and you're gonna show Jessica
you're the one

350
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:11,549
who should be sitting
in that corner office.

351
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:16,003
Ready the dictaphone.
We're gonna need it.

352
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,986
Hey. How are things
going Logan Sanders.

353
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,255
- You have no idea.
- Do I want to have an idea?

354
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,491
Not unless you want to hear
about how Mike Ross

355
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:28,842
is still
causing us trouble.

356
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:30,878
Nope.

357
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:33,764
You don't care about
Logan Sanders at all, do you?

358
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,549
No.

359
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,802
This isn't
a coincidental encounter, is it?

360
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,688
No, it is not.

361
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:43,057
You are having lunch
with Jeff Malone today.

362
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:44,525
Come on, Jessica.
You banged him.

363
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,859
The least you could do
is take him to lunch.

364
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:47,444
That is not funny.

365
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,679
Wait a second,
you want me to take him to lunch

366
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:50,847
because you banged him.

367
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:53,650
Harvey...

368
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,953
I want you to go ahead
and say "banged"

369
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,855
to my face one more time.

370
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,627
I'm not going to but not
because I'm scared of you.

371
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:07,164
Whatever lets you sleep
at night, white boy.

372
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:12,970
Donna, tell Paul Porter
he's meeting me for lunch.

373
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:15,539
When he gets there, tell them
to seat him with Jeff Malone.

374
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:16,974
Who's he not having
lunch with?

375
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:19,059
- Jessica.
- Oh, done.

376
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:21,095
Aren't you gonna ask me why?

377
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,896
She asked you to go
because she didn't want to.

378
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,015
You're sending Porter
because you don't want to,

379
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,518
but you didn't have the balls
to say no to her face.

380
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,519
Is that it?

381
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,020
The balls are debatable.

382
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,724
Balls are never debatable.

383
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:39,113
- Ah, hey there.
- Hey.

384
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,064
Louis, listen,
I just, um--

385
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,699
I just wanted to say
one more time

386
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,752
how much I'm really looking
forward to working with you.

387
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:46,920
Aww, well, I would just like
to say for the first time

388
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:48,205
that you will not be
working with me,

389
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,374
because I will not be giving you
my jock,

390
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,375
let alone my case.

391
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,177
Yeah.

392
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,744
Okay, I get it.

393
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,014
So you're the guy?

394
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,049
Yeah, I am the guy.

395
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,602
No, not that guy, Louis.
Definitely not that guy.

396
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,437
You're the guy in every office
who wants to piss

397
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:06,723
on the new guy, you know,
to mark your territory.

398
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,942
So why don't I just walk you on
down to my office?

399
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:11,138
I'm gonna let you get your
little piss on in my corner,

400
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:12,146
and then we can move on.

401
00:16:12,197 --> 00:16:13,614
Oh, I've moved on.

402
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,432
I've set the deposition
for Todd Smith tomorrow.

403
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,784
You don't think
I know about that?

404
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,202
I don't give a shit
whether you know it or not.

405
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:20,704
It's my job to determine
whether Todd Smith is guilty.

406
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:22,858
And who do you actually think
is better at determining

407
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:25,659
whether a guy is guilty
of insider trading, Louis?

408
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,461
A career prosecutor
for the S.E.C.

409
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:29,213
or a monkey
in some Italian suit?

410
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:30,881
- A monkey?
- Monkey.

411
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:32,883
Well, you're nothing
but a crowing cock.

412
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,718
And the last cock that walked
into my office

413
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:36,503
learned what
all the other cocks learned--

414
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:39,139
that I eat cock for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

415
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:40,808
Louis, you're gonna let me
in that deposition tomorrow

416
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:42,009
whether you like it or not.

417
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,560
Why, because you're gonna run
to Jessica?

418
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:46,146
No, simply because I'm gonna
tell everyone here in the office

419
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,982
that you said you eat cock for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

420
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:51,735
Yeah, that's right.
It's goddamn delicious.

421
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,271
Mmm! Mmm, mmm.

422
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,662
So what, you think
you can handle Todd Smith

423
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:01,111
better than me?

424
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,081
Well, let's just see.
Let's just see what you got.

425
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,652
Saw you scheduled a meeting
with Mike.

426
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,671
I assume that means you're going
to offer him a deal.

427
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,986
It could mean I'm going to
offer him a trip to Disneyland.

428
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,324
But it doesn't.

429
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,460
Of course not, he'd probably
want to wear mouse ears,

430
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,961
and then nobody wins.

431
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,129
You're welcome.

432
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,848
I didn't thank you.

433
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:23,043
Since you scheduled the meeting
when I'm at law school,

434
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,668
which you did to cut me out.

435
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:26,836
Did you get your name
on the wall since lunch?

436
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,021
No.

437
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:29,306
Then let's get
something straight.

438
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,024
I didn't set that meeting.
Donna did.

439
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,394
And if I didn't want you there,
I'd just tell you to your face.

440
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:37,714
So let me tell you now, you're
not going to that meeting.

441
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:39,700
Because you think
I can't handle it?

442
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,702
Because I'm not throwing
gasoline on a pile of matches

443
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:43,120
just to see what happens.

444
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:45,405
Now, if you're done
wasting my time,

445
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:48,992
you just gave me an idea.

446
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,961
You're welcome.

447
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:57,968
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

448
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,169
You said it yourself.

449
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,037
I never brought you a gift
when you moved in.

450
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:04,241
- Still don't see an orchid.
- Flowers die.

451
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,211
I thought I'd bring
something better.

452
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:08,896
Me...

453
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,565
Across the table from you.

454
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,567
- Where's your client?
- He doesn't need to be here.

455
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,485
This fight started
with you and me.

456
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,154
So let's you and me
settle it right now.

457
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:19,389
You mean you don't want him
here because you don't think

458
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,158
Logan Sanders and I
can be in the same room.

459
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:22,993
I don't think.
I know.

460
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:24,111
Harvey, I'm a grown man.

461
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:25,746
I can sit across the table
from somebody

462
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,080
who had a history with Rachel.

463
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:28,749
Maybe, but you both
have a brain and a dick,

464
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,334
and if you get in that room
together,

465
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:33,403
the brains aren't gonna be
leading that conversation.

466
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,289
Fine, you tell me
that you have the authority

467
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,709
to negotiate a deal,
and I'll negotiate.

468
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,411
But you can't
'cause you don't.

469
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,880
And I'm not gonna agree
to something here today

470
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,082
just to have Logan reject it
tomorrow.

471
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,018
So go home, get some sleep,
and then the three of us

472
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:52,055
will do this again
in the morning.

473
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:59,141
Look, here's the thing Todd

474
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,070
You're not actually our client.

475
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:02,699
Felton Securities is.

476
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,834
And it's my job to find out
if you're telling the truth.

477
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:06,369
Bullshit.
It's my job.

478
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:08,871
- Louis, I'm handling this.
- No, you're not.

479
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,540
If he doesn't stop lying to me,
I'm gonna cut him looser

480
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,059
than Jared's pants
after a Subway diet.

481
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,228
- I'm not lying to you.
- You took a tip.

482
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:17,213
All right, Todd, you took a tip,
used it for your client--

483
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:18,682
Yes, and now you're trying--

484
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:20,850
God damn it, Louis!

485
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:23,085
Listen, if you don't back
the hell off my interrogation,

486
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:25,188
I'm gonna pick
his scrawny ass up

487
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:27,157
and use him to beat
the shit out of you!

488
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,441
Stop it!

489
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:29,442
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

490
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,529
You're trying to rattle me.

491
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,913
- Uh-oh.
- What?

492
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:35,332
Uh, your vein.

493
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:36,666
- Here?
- It's bulging.

494
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,084
Just like mine did,
right before my heart attack.

495
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,869
- Louis, he's not gonna--
- What? Have a heart attack?

496
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,405
That was exactly my thought
ten seconds before I was slumped

497
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:43,673
on the courtroom floor.

498
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,175
Oh, wow,
it's just like Jenkins.

499
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,260
- Jenkins?
- No shit, Jenkins too?

500
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:49,412
He was sitting
right next to me, hand to God.

501
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,348
And, Louis, you should have
seen his wife and kids

502
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:52,716
at the funeral.
Funeral?

503
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,418
- Yeah, you have kids, Todd?
- Yeah, I have two kids.

504
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:57,687
Yeah, well, whether it's
a heart attack or prison time,

505
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:59,556
if you do not stop
lying to us,

506
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,274
they're never going to see
their father again.

507
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,026
Do you understand
what I just said?

508
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,260
You are never going to play
soccer with them--

509
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:06,929
Okay.
Okay, I am lying to you.

510
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:08,598
But please,
you gotta help me.

511
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:09,932
Well, we want to.

512
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,535
But, T-dog, you gotta be
straight up with your homies

513
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,536
if you want us
to have your back.

514
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:17,106
The truth is,
I'm germaphobic.

515
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:19,075
I have to wash my hands
throughout the day.

516
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:21,578
And they get dry--
I mean really dry--

517
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:24,047
so I have to put on
a lot of lotion.

518
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:26,049
And I know
this sounds ridiculous,

519
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,784
but my finger must have slipped
on the keyboard, and I--

520
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:29,586
I hit the wrong stock.

521
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,971
You're saying that you didn't
even mean to buy that stock?

522
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:34,057
Nope, but then
it skyrocketed,

523
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:35,842
and I wasn't gonna tell
everybody that I only bought it

524
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,977
because I suffer
from dry skin.

525
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:39,962
Please, you can't
cut me loose.

526
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,433
I mean, I-I can't go
to prison.

527
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:46,736
Unsanitary.

528
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,659
Not that
it's any of my business,

529
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:53,976
but it was straight before.

530
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:55,144
I know.

531
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,830
Oh, I get it.

532
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:59,866
Look less together.
Get underestimated.

533
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:06,289
You gotta wave
your hand slower.

534
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,659
- Thanks.
- No problem.

535
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:12,629
If you want soap, you just click
your heels together three times.

536
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:15,215
How do you think I'm planning
on getting that dryer to work?

537
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,549
You know, you think you wouldn't
have these problems,

538
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
considering what
you guys charge.

539
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:19,469
Oh, no, I don't work here.

540
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:24,057
- But you, uh--
- I used to.

541
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,309
You're Mike Ross.

542
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:32,615
And you're Logan Sanders.

543
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,517
Paper towel?

544
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:37,987
Don't mind if I do.

545
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:39,522
After you.

546
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,791
- Don't mind if I do.
- I see you two have met.

547
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:43,126
We have.

548
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,628
And don't underestimate him
because of his tie.

549
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:50,216
I have always estimated
that tie correctly.

550
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:51,634
Now, can we talk
about business?

551
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:54,537
Depends on what
you're proposing.

552
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:55,839
That you walk away.

553
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,674
That doesn't sound
like much of a deal.

554
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,175
Well, he forgot to add
the part where you walk away

555
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:01,261
$20 million richer.

556
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,012
Pure profit.
No risk.

557
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:05,214
Win-win.

558
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:08,184
All right.

559
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,906
Sounds good.

560
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,158
Guess I just have
one question.

561
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:17,494
What exactly are you going to do
with this company?

562
00:22:17,528 --> 00:22:20,163
All due respect, I don't see
how that's any of your concern.

563
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:22,165
All due respect, you're the
one coming to me with an offer.

564
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,733
So if I say it's my concern,
it is.

565
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:26,753
Mike, you're asking about
a competitor's business plan.

566
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:28,538
And if he wants
to not be competitors,

567
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:30,673
then he needs to answer
my question.

568
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,074
Okay, I'll tell you.

569
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:35,912
I'm gonna do what anyone would
and sell it for parts.

570
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,431
No deal.

571
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:41,083
Okay, Mike.

572
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:43,219
You win.

573
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:46,255
Let's, uh,
make it 30 million.

574
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:47,557
You could make it
a billion, Logan,

575
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,359
and the answer is still
gonna be the same,

576
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:51,528
'cause I made a promise
to Walter Gillis

577
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:53,696
that I would fight
to keep his company alive.

578
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,282
And I don't think he's gonna
believe that cutting a deal

579
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:59,285
to sell his workers out
is keeping that promise.

580
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,620
I thought you said
he was smart.

581
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:02,455
I am, which I why I know
what's going on here.

582
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,908
What exactly is that?

583
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:07,660
No one ever
tells you no.

584
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:09,946
You're used to getting
what you want.

585
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:12,332
But that's gonna stop
right now.

586
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:15,919
You're right.
I do always get what I want.

587
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,220
I don't see how this time's
gonna be any different.

588
00:23:17,254 --> 00:23:18,721
I'll tell you
how it's gonna be different.

589
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:21,224
This time you're talking about
something that I care about.

590
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:22,725
So if you think I'm gonna
step aside and let you do--

591
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,928
Yeah, I don't care
if you step aside or not.

592
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:27,347
When I see something I want,
I take it,

593
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,815
and then I do whatever the hell
I want with it.

594
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:31,801
And what I wanna do with
this company is strip it down,

595
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:32,852
flip it over--
Okay, that's enough.

596
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:33,970
No, no, no, let him talk.

597
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:35,321
I wanna hear this.
Keep going, Sanders.

598
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:37,356
No, I don't need to
because you know how this ends.

599
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:39,526
Yeah, I do, with me
and Walter Gillis on one side

600
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,444
and you crying to your daddy
on the other.

601
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:42,445
We're done.

602
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,863
You're right.

603
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:46,749
We are.

604
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:49,318
Listen, the next time I say
"Don't come to a meeting,"

605
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:50,920
don't come to a meeting.

606
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:52,121
He came at me
just as hard as--

607
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:53,339
I don't give a shit
what he did.

608
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,341
Now, if you'll excuse me.

609
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:57,760
- Where are you going?
- To get you this company.

610
00:23:57,795 --> 00:23:59,596
- What are you talking about?
- Weren't you listening?

611
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,049
He just gave up
his weak spot.

612
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:06,636
Was that true
about Jenkins?

613
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,521
I don't even know
a Jenkins.

614
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:12,108
But I do know Todd's vein
wasn't bulging.

615
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:14,143
And, Louis, you were actually
pretty good in there.

616
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:16,345
Yeah, I was.
And so were you.

617
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:17,730
So we're in agreement.

618
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:19,032
Yeah, you don't
completely suck.

619
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,150
I just meant that
we should stick by Todd Smith.

620
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:23,903
That story was so ridiculous,
it just might be true.

621
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:26,072
Great, I'll call Felton
and make the recommendation.

622
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:28,825
Well, hold up.
You're gonna do what now?

623
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:30,660
Call my client?
Louis.

624
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:32,829
It may be your client,
but it's still my case.

625
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:33,880
Like hell it is, Jeff.

626
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:37,050
- Okay. Okay, you call.
- Oh, I plan to.

627
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,384
And when I do,
I'll be telling them

628
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:40,169
that Mr. Slippery Fingers
is no longer our problem.

629
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:42,472
Just one second ago,
you said you believed him.

630
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,874
Yeah, I also told you that
his story was so ridiculous

631
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,309
and nobody would believe it.

632
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,428
Well, then it's our job
to make them believe it, Louis,

633
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,879
or this guy could wind up
in prison.

634
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,881
He is not my concern, Jeff.

635
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:54,484
Felton Securities is.

636
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:05,177
Walter Gillis knows
what he's doing.

637
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:06,329
Yeah, so do I.

638
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:07,914
He's letting your pension
go unfunded,

639
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:09,732
so he can hoard $1 billion.

640
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,586
No, that money is earmarked
for expansion into Asia,

641
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:15,088
and I believe
in Walter's vision.

642
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:18,240
You might, but do the workers
you represent?

643
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:20,426
You're acting
as if our fund is empty.

644
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:22,629
I'm acting
as if it's 40% full.

645
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,348
And let me guess,
you're gonna fill up the rest.

646
00:25:25,382 --> 00:25:28,584
Someone else wants to acquire
Gillis' company

647
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:30,419
before we can make an offer.

648
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:32,188
If you vote to block it,

649
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:35,725
we will fully fund your pension
the day we take over.

650
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:40,113
You're talking about me
selling out my friend.

651
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:42,782
I'm talking
about $500 million.

652
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:44,484
And why can you fund it
and they can't?

653
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:46,619
Well, they can with half
that billion, but they won't.

654
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:49,438
Because like I said, he's
hoarding it for that pipe dream.

655
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:52,108
You're gonna take that billion
for yourselves.

656
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:53,576
Half.

657
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,495
The other half goes to you
and your union--

658
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:58,581
the men Walter Gillis
supposedly cares about.

659
00:25:58,615 --> 00:26:02,051
Pete, this is gonna happen
whether it's me or someone else.

660
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:04,170
And someone else may not
give you the chance to do

661
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:07,256
what you were elected to do:

662
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,175
Protect your people.

663
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:16,858
Hey.
Hey.

664
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:22,372
How'd your meeting
with Harvey go today?

665
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:25,125
I thought talking about work
was against the rules.

666
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:27,844
Mm, talking about work is.
Talking about our day isn't.

667
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,213
I mean, if we can't do that,
then we're letting the case

668
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:33,967
come between us, right?

669
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,936
My meeting with Harvey
went fine.

670
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,839
But you didn't take
the deal.

671
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:44,728
Because it wasn't
a good deal.

672
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:48,231
Fine.

673
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:50,483
Okay, what's the matter
with you?

674
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,536
What's the matter is that
I heard what happened.

675
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,373
- From him?
- No, from Donna.

676
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,024
But it could have been
from any of the 50 people

677
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,192
who saw the two of you
going at it.

678
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,827
- Rachel--
- Just tell me this.

679
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:03,163
Did you refuse the deal
because it wasn't good enough

680
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:04,697
or because it came from Logan?

681
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:06,049
You think I didn't take
this deal

682
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,867
because of your history
with this asshole?

683
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:09,502
Well, you did
just call him an asshole.

684
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,537
He's an asshole because he's
willing to decimate a company

685
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:13,807
just to put some money
in his pocket.

686
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,809
Look, I gave my word
to Walter Gillis.

687
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,761
That's what I told Harvey
and what I told Logan

688
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:19,479
and what I didn't think
I'd have to tell you.

689
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:24,651
I'm just saying, all of this
could have been over today.

690
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:25,902
You think I don't want this
to be over?

691
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,487
I do.

692
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,772
But I can't take that deal.

693
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:31,157
And we said we wouldn't let this
come between us.

694
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:34,077
So don't.

695
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,198
- Hi, Donna.
- Hey, Louis.

696
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:39,565
What can I do for you?

697
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:45,371
Oh, well, I just came in
to bring you this and this

698
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:51,244
and all of these.

699
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:53,430
Those are the last seven
Todd Smiths you evaluated.

700
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,597
- Donna--
- Seven.

701
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,182
And you didn't cut
one of them loose.

702
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,384
- You heard me and Malone.
- I did.

703
00:27:58,418 --> 00:27:59,853
And you're cutting this guy
loose just to spite him.

704
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,087
That's ridiculous.

705
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:03,440
Okay, so this has nothing
to do with Malone?

706
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,092
Nothing.

707
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:09,595
Where'd you get that?

708
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:11,698
Come on.
You know where I got it.

709
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,033
Louis...

710
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,271
I know he took your dream.

711
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,210
I mean, she didn't even
consider me.

712
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,129
Just brings him in,
had me train him,

713
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:30,467
and gives him
the corner office.

714
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,469
Hey, did I ever tell you
about the time that I auditioned

715
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,588
for <i>Hamlet</i> in college?

716
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:36,890
Obviously, you played Ophelia.

717
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,125
No, Chrissy Kiff did.

718
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:40,810
I was her understudy,

719
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,146
and I was so jealous.

720
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,682
I found myself wishing that
something would happen to her,

721
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:49,802
that she would get sick
or she would twist an ankle.

722
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,408
And then, the day
before we closed...

723
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,612
Her father died.

724
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:00,747
Donna, that wasn't
your fault.

725
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,533
But I still felt horrible

726
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:06,035
and ashamed

727
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:11,624
'cause my jealousy had brought
out something really ugly in me.

728
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:16,329
And as you can tell,
I still regret that.

729
00:29:16,347 --> 00:29:18,348
You know you've never
told me a story

730
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,184
about yourself
like that before.

731
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,604
I've never told anyone
that story before.

732
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,974
Louis, I know how badly
you wanted this.

733
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:33,363
But this is a man's life.

734
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,864
We won't cut him loose.

735
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:38,184
I'll tell Malone.

736
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,687
I'm proud of you, Louis.

737
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,379
Did you get an offer
to walk away from your takeover?

738
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,580
I did.

739
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:51,965
What was the offer?

740
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,333
$30 million.

741
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:55,802
And you turned it down?
What the hell is wrong with you?

742
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,203
They're gonna rip
the company apart.

743
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:59,088
I don't care if they wanna use
Walter Gillis' head

744
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:00,473
as a paperweight.

745
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,474
You said you wanted
a grand slam.

746
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,759
That offer is a double.

747
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,210
Well, I'd rather have a double
than nothing.

748
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,211
Look, I know
what I am doing here.

749
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:06,479
Do you?

750
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,147
Because they just
flipped the head of the union.

751
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,049
And without his vote,
we don't have shit.

752
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:11,884
- What?
- These guys play to win.

753
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:13,486
They just promised
$1/2-billion donation

754
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,938
to their pension fund.

755
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:18,908
And unless Walter Gillis is
gonna match it, we're done.

756
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:19,993
Yeah.

757
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,612
That's what I thought.

758
00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:24,664
You get that $30 million,

759
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:28,167
or you find yourself
another job.

760
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:34,207
Donna,
did you need something?

761
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:37,627
No, but Louis does.

762
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:40,129
He was planning to pitch you
that he take on Jeff Malone

763
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,015
before you and Harvey
even met him.

764
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,099
He saw Woodall coming
before we did?

765
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,384
And if he won,

766
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:48,054
he was hoping that
that would mean name partner.

767
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:50,306
I empathize with that, Donna.
I do.

768
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:51,424
But I have to make decisions

769
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:53,226
based on what's best
for the firm.

770
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,593
And I'm not here
to change your mind,

771
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:56,396
but maybe if you did
something else for Louis--

772
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,596
Such as?

773
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,432
Giving him
the corner office.

774
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,200
You mean
Jeff Malone's office?

775
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,820
He could move to Louis'.

776
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:06,739
I appreciate
you letting me know about Louis,

777
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,107
but I'm not going
to do that.

778
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,409
Well, why not?
Jeff Malone just got here.

779
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:11,411
Because I said so.
Now if you'll excuse me--

780
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:13,246
You're sleeping with him.

781
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,631
- What?
- Of course.

782
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,417
That glow, the morning meetings,
you had Harvey take your lunch.

783
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:19,785
How could I miss it?
I'm losing my edge.

784
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:24,974
Donna, there is nothing
going on between--

785
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:27,977
you're not losing your edge.

786
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:31,147
But I ended my relationship
with Jeff Malone

787
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,299
the day that I hired him.

788
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:34,734
And I respect that.

789
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,019
But you said
you make decisions

790
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,988
based on what's best
for the firm.

791
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:43,943
Isn't giving Louis his dignity
back good for the firm?

792
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,147
Hey, I got your message.

793
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:49,982
Usually when someone
wants to talk business--

794
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,669
I want to take your offer.

795
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:56,322
Mike, that offer's gone.

796
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,925
And what if I told you
I'd take less?

797
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,293
I'd say I can't
give you less.

798
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:01,761
Come on, you're the guy
who settles.

799
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,881
I'm telling you
I wanna settle.

800
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:06,766
You're telling me
you have to settle.

801
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,184
And I know that
you can get that offer back.

802
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,186
It's not my job
to get it back.

803
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,021
And even if it was, you think
he's gonna give you a nickel

804
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,690
after what you said to him?
What I said to him?

805
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:14,857
What about what he said to me?

806
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,192
I don't care what he said
to you.

807
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,310
I gave you a way out,

808
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:18,844
and you insisted
on going to that meeting.

809
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:21,063
You didn't do that for me.
You did that for your client.

810
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,700
What difference does it make?
It was a win-goddamn-win.

811
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,618
And you shit all over it.

812
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,869
Now I'm saying,
I'll take it.

813
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,354
Yeah, well,
it doesn't work that way.

814
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:29,989
I'm here as a courtesy.

815
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:32,024
You're only here
because you lost.

816
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,127
- Harvey, I'm--
- Enough.

817
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,497
That company's fate is sealed.
It always has been.

818
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:40,333
And the next time you walk away
from the table,

819
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,836
be prepared to walk away
from the table.

820
00:32:57,448 --> 00:32:59,916
Hmm.

821
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,032
Wanna pour me one of those?

822
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:04,838
Help yourself.

823
00:33:04,872 --> 00:33:07,824
So what's going on
with Mike Ross?

824
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:09,126
How do you know I'm thinking
about Mike Ross?

825
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,927
Who else would it be?

826
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:13,380
He got you on the ropes?

827
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,932
No, I got him.

828
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,834
And he's about to go down.
How do you know?

829
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:19,469
'Cause the only way
to stay in the game

830
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:23,473
is to get Walter Gillis
to give up his dream.

831
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:25,275
And you don't think
he has the stomach

832
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,277
to rip off the arm
to save the body.

833
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:29,362
No, he doesn't.

834
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,314
You don't seem to feel good
about that.

835
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,450
No, I don't.

836
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:36,686
Harvey.

837
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:38,705
Do you remember when I gave you
the Collins case?

838
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:39,956
Yeah.

839
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:42,576
It was brutal,
what we had to do.

840
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:44,694
It was my first taste
of that kind of thing.

841
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:46,362
And you loved it.

842
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,631
What's your point?

843
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:50,967
Some people love
the taste of blood.

844
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:54,004
Other people, hmm.

845
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:57,040
Better to find out
who you are sooner than later.

846
00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:58,592
You saying
I'm doing him a favor?

847
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:02,562
I'm saying,
you're being who you are

848
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:07,150
and letting him
be who he is.

849
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:22,398
What are you doing?

850
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,700
I'm just thinking
about how much

851
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:25,502
I'm going to miss
having my own office.

852
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:28,404
Put your pride away, okay?
You can still go back to Harvey.

853
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:29,739
I went back to Harvey.

854
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:34,461
The money's off the table.

855
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:36,746
Then you have to flip
that vote.

856
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:39,049
The only way to do that
is to get Walter Gillis

857
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:43,253
to put $500 million
into that pension fund.

858
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:45,689
And if he does that,
he loses his expansion.

859
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:47,057
Mike, then do it.

860
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:50,426
Amy, when his son died,
this company became his family.

861
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:52,779
If he doesn't expand, then
his company's gonna die too.

862
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:55,065
I ask him to do that,
then I'm no better than Logan.

863
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,900
No, you are better,
because after you do this,

864
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,451
you're still gonna fight
to keep them alive.

865
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:00,070
Gillis is not gonna see it
that way.

866
00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:02,205
He's just gonna see
some slick banker

867
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,040
who sold him a bill of goods
just to end up doing

868
00:35:04,075 --> 00:35:06,910
what everybody else
was at least up front about.

869
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:09,412
Mm.

870
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:11,047
Then why don't you
just pack up your shit

871
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:13,133
and crawl out of here with
your tail between your legs?

872
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,719
Because if you don't have
the stomach to handle this,

873
00:35:15,753 --> 00:35:20,140
then you don't belong here.

874
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,893
Hey, uh,
got your message.

875
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:25,345
Is there something wrong
with Felton Securities?

876
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:26,346
Not at all.

877
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:27,847
Oh, thank God.

878
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:30,466
I just assumed since you wanted
to meet here in Malone's office.

879
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:32,435
Oh, this isn't his office
anymore.

880
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,903
Oh, did he get fired?

881
00:35:33,938 --> 00:35:36,990
No, but he is moving.

882
00:35:37,024 --> 00:35:40,193
Louis, I know it hasn't always
been easy for you

883
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:42,696
to embrace new partners,

884
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:45,648
but you've made
a great effort with Jeff.

885
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,500
All in a day's work.

886
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:51,204
And your day's work has
benefited this firm for years.

887
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:53,123
So we thought it was time
to show you

888
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:56,092
a little
overdue appreciation.

889
00:36:04,468 --> 00:36:07,337
This office?

890
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:13,109
I gave this office to Jeff

891
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:15,862
because I wanted him
to feel valued here.

892
00:36:15,896 --> 00:36:20,617
But the truth is, I--
I should have given it to you.

893
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,291
I don't know what to say.

894
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:30,744
Oh, okay.

895
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:33,413
All right, let it out.

896
00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:34,547
No way.

897
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:36,299
Pete Kreeling would never side
with them.

898
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:37,884
He would, and he has,

899
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:39,369
because they offered
what you couldn't--

900
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:40,920
security for his workers.

901
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:42,052
They're my goddamn workers.

902
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:43,973
Then show them
that you care about them.

903
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:46,209
Fund the pension,
and fund it now.

904
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:47,727
You told me you'd fight
to keep this from happening.

905
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,682
I told you I would fight
to protect your company.

906
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:51,731
And right now, this is
the best way of doing that.

907
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:54,401
You're talking
about using my expansion money.

908
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:55,435
If you don't use it now,

909
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:57,237
there's gonna be
nothing to expand.

910
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:59,522
You son of a bitch,
you manipulated me.

911
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:00,657
No, I told you
a war was coming

912
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:02,192
and that you needed
a war chest.

913
00:37:02,226 --> 00:37:03,860
Well, now is the time
to crack it open.

914
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:07,414
You told me what I wanted
to hear to get me on your side.

915
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:08,748
You're the same as them.
You're wrong.

916
00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:10,700
I looked you in the eye,
and I told you that I wanted

917
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,235
to save your company.

918
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:13,336
They looked me in the eye

919
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:14,671
and told me they wanted
to rip it apart.

920
00:37:14,705 --> 00:37:16,206
You're the same as them!

921
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,258
And you're an naive old man
having a tantrum

922
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:22,078
because he's not getting
his way!

923
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:38,862
That expansion
was my dream.

924
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:41,030
I know.

925
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:51,291
But now it's time to wake up.

926
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:54,711
Fund the pension, Walter.

927
00:37:54,745 --> 00:38:00,500
Pete Kreeling's vote
stays in our favor, and...

928
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:03,219
We live to fight
another day.

929
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:12,812
No.

930
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:15,598
I just wanted to thank you,
you know, for the new office.

931
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:16,632
It's a downgrade.

932
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,401
Not to me.

933
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:20,236
I also wanted to thank you
for lunch.

934
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:22,105
- I didn't show up for lunch.
- I know.

935
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,907
You thought you were
sending me a message.

936
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,241
I was sending you a message.

937
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:27,277
Not the one you wanted,
Jessica.

938
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:28,661
You see,
because what I heard is that

939
00:38:28,696 --> 00:38:31,647
you don't trust yourself
around me.

940
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:34,334
If I didn't,

941
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:36,002
I wouldn't have put you
right next door.

942
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:38,488
Jessica, say what you will,

943
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,256
but we both know
where this is headed--

944
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:43,159
you and me
watching these.

945
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:45,661
You think you know me
that well?

946
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,330
Well, if I don't,

947
00:38:47,348 --> 00:38:51,167
I'm about to.

948
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:53,186
Neighbor.

949
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:02,278
More. More. More.
Ah, ah.

950
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:04,697
Thank you.

951
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,907
Happy corner office.

952
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,793
Open it.

953
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:20,163
- Is this...
- Me.

954
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:23,500
As Ophelia.

955
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:24,751
But I thought you--

956
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:27,637
Yeah, well,

957
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:31,558
sometimes bitter memories

958
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:35,395
become bittersweet

959
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:38,431
when you share them
with a friend.

960
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:16,853
- You here to pick up Rachel?
- No.

961
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:19,755
No, I just came by
to say thanks.

962
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:20,974
For what?

963
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:25,695
For not giving me
a way out.

964
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:26,696
You funded the pension.

965
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,899
100%.

966
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:31,985
You just got rid
of half your war chest.

967
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:36,739
Maybe, but I also did
what you thought I couldn't do.

968
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,243
I got the vote back.

969
00:40:40,277 --> 00:40:44,998
Maybe now you'll realize that
I'm willing to go the distance.

970
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:46,165
All you did was make it
to round two.

971
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:47,467
Oh, so you thought

972
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:50,219
this was gonna be like
one of those early Tyson fights,

973
00:40:50,254 --> 00:40:54,123
the ones that only lasted
45 seconds.

974
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:55,174
Remember what happened
the first time

975
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,226
someone made it
out of round one?

976
00:40:57,261 --> 00:41:00,229
And what ever did happen
to Buster Douglas?

977
00:41:00,264 --> 00:41:02,482
I don't know,
but wherever he is,

978
00:41:02,516 --> 00:41:05,602
they can't take that title away
from him.

979
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:17,146
Hey.

980
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:19,198
Hey.

981
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:21,167
What you working on?

982
00:41:21,201 --> 00:41:23,986
You know what I'm working on.

983
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:25,321
You wanna go home?

984
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,544
Harvey.

985
00:41:31,595 --> 00:41:34,964
Guess that means you're
gonna be working late, huh?

986
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:37,717
Um...

987
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,938
Thanks to the guy
we're up against.

988
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:46,109
He is proving to be much tougher
than everyone expected.

989
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:48,861
- Everyone?
- Not everyone.

990
00:41:53,784 --> 00:41:56,402
He sounds like
a real douche bag.

991
00:42:00,324 --> 00:42:04,410
You know,
he's not that tough.

992
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:06,796
I can work on this tomorrow.

993
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,833
Let's get out of here.

994
00:42:14,672 --> 00:42:18,541
You really gonna
work on that tomorrow?

995
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,376
No, I'm going to work on it
later tonight,

996
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:23,713
but at least I'll be home.

997
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:25,214
Think I can take a look at it
when you're done?

998
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:26,215
I think not.

999
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:27,600
Just a proofread?

1000
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:32,387
Ah, still no.
