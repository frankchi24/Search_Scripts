Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:02,286 --> 00:00:03,982
I have a list here
of the signing bonuses

3
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,060
of the top three associates
who have come into this firm.

4
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,979
An advance plus my salary
will cover my tuition.

5
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:11,314
Those numbers don't add up.

6
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,299
Summer associates
work as lawyers,

7
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,301
and I can do the same.

8
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:18,137
It's an offer letter.
We're investment bankers.

9
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:19,989
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

10
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,524
Harvey, Stephanie Liston
just called me.

11
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,660
She said they just brought Mike
in for questioning.

12
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,696
You're a dirty lawyer,
and now you're on my radar.

13
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:29,616
I'm tired of putting the
people I care about in jeopardy.

14
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,618
I called Jonathan Sidwell
this afternoon.

15
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,486
I took the job.

16
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:35,839
Mike Ross never went
to law school.

17
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:39,793
I knew it,
and I hired him anyway.

18
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:41,678
I still can't stay, Harvey.

19
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:43,463
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:46,032
Give me permission to go.

20
00:00:47,514 --> 00:01:18,032

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,302
Going to work or school?

22
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,971
Both.

23
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:27,006
Think you have time
for some of this?

24
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,211
Maybe if you will loan me
your limo.

25
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:35,064
Hmm.

26
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:37,066
I'm sure
we can work something out.

27
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,402
Mm-hmm.

28
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:14,754
Thought you were
getting dressed.

29
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,890
I did get dressed.

30
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:18,558
Then you got undressed.

31
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:21,694
I got a little hot.

32
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:23,596
Yes.

33
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:26,149
You did.

34
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,996
Come to think of it, it is
getting a little warm in here.

35
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,990
Good. Thank you.

36
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:08,157
Mr. Gillis.

37
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,993
Mike Ross.
Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,578
You should know
I'm only doing this

39
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,279
as a courtesy
to Jonathan Sidwell.

40
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,982
But I'll tell you right now,
the answer is no.

41
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:18,585
- Good.
- Why good?

42
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:19,919
Because a yes
is always so much better

43
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:20,954
when it starts as a no.

44
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:22,705
You're a confident young man,

45
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,658
but I know what my
distribution centers are worth.

46
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,876
You know
what they're worth to you.

47
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:30,663
This is what they're worth
to me.

48
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,501
This is bigger
than I expected.

49
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,670
I've heard that before.

50
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,672
Okay, fun time's over.

51
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,524
I'm not interested in selling
to someone

52
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,859
who I don't know
where they're coming from.

53
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:44,978
Let me tell you
where I'm coming from.

54
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,679
I do my homework.

55
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,232
These centers are a beacon
to every predator out there

56
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,450
that you haven't laid
the groundwork

57
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:51,818
to get out of the DVD business.

58
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:53,509
Sounds to me
like where you're coming from

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,787
is trying to scare me.

60
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,322
No, no,
I'm not trying to scare you.

61
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:59,576
I'm trying to help you.

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,412
They're circling,
and you know it.

63
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:03,630
You don't do this,

64
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,298
you might as well send out
an invitation

65
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,468
asking for a hostile takeover.

66
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:10,336
This number can't be real.

67
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:11,554
- It is.
- Then what the hell

68
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,339
are you gonna do
with my distribution centers?

69
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,542
I'll be happy to tell you that
five seconds after I buy them.

70
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:20,513
Walter, I know you want
your people to be okay,

71
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:22,565
and I give you my word
they will be.

72
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,602
But these centers...
have become a headache.

73
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:28,521
And you need cash for when
those predators come knocking.

74
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:31,407
Let them knock.
I'm not answering the door.

75
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:33,026
No, you're not hearing me.

76
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:35,912
If you don't raise enough money,
they're coming in

77
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:41,067
whether you answer that door
or not.

78
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:44,236
The offer's good
for another hour.

79
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,713
You are not
my hair-gelled partner in crime.

80
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:56,099
I haven't used hair gel
since ninth grade.

81
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:59,602
I was trying to avoid
the frizzy look.

82
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,054
Where is he?

83
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:02,355
Donna said that he had
a morning meeting

84
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:03,389
outside of the office.

85
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,058
And where is Donna?

86
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:06,359
Right here.

87
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:08,444
I prefer to appear
at the exact moment I'm needed.

88
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:09,612
I wish I could say the same
for Harvey.

89
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,430
- Oh, well, Harvey has a very--
- Save it.

90
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:12,932
She may have been born
yesterday,

91
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:15,902
but I know that morning meeting
doesn't mean "morning meeting."

92
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:16,986
Everyone knows that.

93
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,351
It's just not my place
to say it.

94
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,288
Not mine either.

95
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,440
He did it yesterday too.

96
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:22,992
When he resurfaces,

97
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:26,746
tell Specter
Pearson wants to see him.

98
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:30,750
I used mousse
in high school.

99
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:32,969
It was the '90s.
Was it?

100
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:34,337
I heard that.

101
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:53,656
Did you bring me lunch?

102
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,158
Chen Dynasty.

103
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:56,776
How many egg rolls
are in here?

104
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:58,611
- Two.
- You closed Gillis.

105
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,079
No, I killed Gillis.

106
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:03,149
Well, I hope you told them
no mushrooms in the lo mein.

107
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,752
- You never told me that.
- I didn't think I had to.

108
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,153
Aren't you supposed to be
the one taking care of me?

109
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:09,539
Ugh, how am I
supposed to do that

110
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:11,424
when there are mushrooms
in my lo mein?

111
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,259
Why do I
keep you around again?

112
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,687
Deal memo
on Friedman Technologies,

113
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:16,829
engagement letter
signed by Stillman,

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,998
and, oh, two front-row tickets
to Daft Punk

115
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,717
for you and Rachel tonight.

116
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:24,137
But why do I
keep you around?

117
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:26,005
Mike, Sidwell's in there
waiting for you.

118
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:28,474
Be careful, okay?
He's not in a good mood.

119
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,109
It's okay.
You know why?

120
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:32,178
'Cause I killed it
with Gillis.

121
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:33,446
Hey, Amy.
Yeah?

122
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:34,781
Eat the mushrooms.
They're good for you.

123
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:36,566
Screw you.

124
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,402
- Morning.
- Where have you been?

125
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:40,987
Oh, you know,
just getting Walter Gillis

126
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:42,739
to sell us
all of his distribution centers.

127
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:45,708
Oh.

128
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:47,960
- What the hell are you doing?
- What's it look like I'm doing?

129
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,196
I'm sending a message.
We're not a convent.

130
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:51,497
We're in business
to make money.

131
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:53,199
And this deal does that.

132
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,130
You did this deal
to retain those people's jobs.

133
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:57,754
- And to make us 30%.
- We're a hedge fund.

134
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,138
If we don't make 50%,

135
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,367
we might as well buy time-shares
and hope for the best.

136
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:03,042
That's bullshit.
This deal is solid.

137
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,561
No, what's bullshit is you've
been here for three months.

138
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:08,086
All you've done is hit singles,
and I need a goddamn home run.

139
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,649
- Jonathan, listen.
- I don't want to hear it.

140
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,018
I want you to get
your head out of your ass.

141
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,603
Stop trying
to save people's jobs,

142
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:16,689
and start making us
some real money.

143
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,391

I don't think
you would've wanted to see me.

158
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,725
I know what you were doing
three hours ago.

159
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:16,228
Well, then, you should have
come on over.

160
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,780
Maybe you should try having

161
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,815
some morning meetings yourself.

162
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,101
Don't you worry
about my mornings.

163
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:24,620
What you need to worry about
is Logan Sanders.

164
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,155
What?

165
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,541
He drive one of his father's
subsidiaries into bankruptcy?

166
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,293
The opposite.
Boy got his shit together.

167
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,662
Max is retiring,
and Logan's taking over.

168
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,331
Let me guess.
He wants a meeting.

169
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,499
He's got one.

170
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,834
With you, tomorrow morning,
10:00 a.m.

171
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,053
Great.
Push it a week.

172
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,255
Harvey, this kid considers
himself a young lion.

173
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:44,423
He's gonna want
to make his mark,

174
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:46,142
and the easiest way
for him to do that

175
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,960
is to change lawyers.

176
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,595
Maybe, but the last thing
a lion wants

177
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:52,264
is to have his dinner handed
to him on a silver platter.

178
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,967
You're gonna give him
a hunt.

179
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,635
Did you think of that
all on your own?

180
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:57,736
I'm extra sharp.

181
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,522
I haven't worked
a minute all morning.

182
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,490
See, that's funny, 'cause
I was late from all the sex.

183
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,159
Get the hell out
of my office.

184
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,694
♪ Bow chicka bow bow

185
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,504
Look what the cat dragged in.

186
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,507
And you're wearing a vest.
Here it comes.

187
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,043
Here what comes?
Mazel tov.

188
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,012
Congratulations
on your special day.

189
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,763
- That's a good one.
- Harvey, leave him alone.

190
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,182
He looks better than you do.

191
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,350
- Thank you, Donna.
- You're welcome.

192
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,768
Oh, and Mr. Peanut called,

193
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,387
and he said he'd be happy
to lend you his top hat.

194
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,006
- Are you two finished?
- I could go all day.

195
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,357
I think the vest
has had enough.

196
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,059
Yeah.

197
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,861
So you come all the way
down here just to let me know

198
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,980
that you were right
about Walter Gillis?

199
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,592
I came all the way over here
to tell you

200
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,949
I am done playing
in the kiddie pool.

201
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,734
- I'm listening.
- I'm going after a whale.

202
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,703
I think I'm in love.
Let's go to war.

203
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,788
That's the thing.

204
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,290
We're not going to war.

205
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,627
Mike, the second
whoever it is finds out

206
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,212
that you've got 5%
of their company,

207
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,696
we're going to war
whether you like it or not.

208
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,382
They're not gonna find
that out because I don't own 5%.

209
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,035
Do I need to give you
a tutorial on the procedure?

210
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,587
You start by buying shares.

211
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,888
I know what
the procedure is, Harvey.

212
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,256
Well, how many shares
have you bought?

213
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,874
- None.
- This phrase,

214
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,142
"I know what
the procedure is,"

215
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,261
I don't think it means
what you think it means.

216
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,064
Well, as inconceivable
as it might be to you, Harvey,

217
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,732
I'm actually
not going in hostile.

218
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,933
What are you talking about?

219
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,235
I'm talking
about approaching someone

220
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,353
to buy their company
in order to keep it alive,

221
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,155
instead of selling it
for parts.

222
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,863
You're offering someone
hugs and rainbows.

223
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,443
I'm offering someone
the chance to survive

224
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,195
and banking
that they'll take that chance

225
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,280
rather than give up.

226
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,748
You don't have the money,
do you?

227
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,916
No, I don't.

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,951
But even if I did,
I wouldn't use it.

229
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,504
Well,
welcome to what every person

230
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,905
who doesn't have money
has ever said.

231
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,957
Oh, I get it.

232
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,293
You think this is the meeting
where you make fun of my idea.

233
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,461
No, no, no, no, no, no.

234
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,912
This is the meeting
where you realize

235
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:50,799
that my idea is happening
whether you like it or not.

236
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,384
Where's the fun
in that meeting?

237
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,769
Oh, the fun?

238
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,755
It's all right over here
on this side of the table.

239
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,566
Hey, I'll give you a chance
to get acquainted

240
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,942
with the new reality.

241
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,193
I'll be in my office.

242
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,895
Get back to me
by the end of the day.

243
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,096
Wow.

244
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:07,733
Looks like our baby boy's
all growns up.

245
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,119
Hey, tell me, sweetheart,
you guys validate parking?

246
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,120
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

247
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,605
I've got it right here.

248
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:15,174
And how many hours
is that good for?

249
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,492
What's it matter?

250
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,377
We're just gonna charge it
back to you anyway.

251
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,115
You know my secretary is,
like, so much younger

252
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,451
did he say "fitter"?

253
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,289
What did you find out?

254
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,424
- Woodall's resurfacing.
- Me too. When?

255
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:33,926
- Next week.
- Me too. Where?

256
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,794
- S.E.C.
- Me too. Title?

257
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,763
- Supervisor.
- Director.

258
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,014
Me too.
I just threw that in

259
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,816
to make sure
you weren't yes-man-ing me.

260
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,934
Talk to me.

261
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:42,851
I found out
the name of the man

262
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,019
Woodall's sending after us.

263
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,438
Jeff Malone.

264
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,441
Jeff Malone is a beast.

265
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:50,526
Well, the only way

266
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,812
to beat a beast
is with a bigger beast.

267
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,164
I need to get in there
before everyone else

268
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,916
and let Harvey and Jessica know
that I had the foresight

269
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,451
to look for it,
the cunning to find it,

270
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:00,652
and the balls to stop it.

271
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,171
Then you take on Malone.

272
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,989
Next stop: Name partner.

273
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,675
- Pearson Specter Litt.
- Okay, you know what?

274
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,462
Just let's not count
our chickens before they hatch.

275
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:11,680
But just for shits and giggles,
say it one more time.

276
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,215
Leave out Specter.

277
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,352
Donna, I got Paul Porter's
annual restructuring proposal.

278
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,355
Can you file it
under "I don't give a shit"?

279
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,173
What about Mike?
You want me to have Rachel

280
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:22,641
prepare a dog and pony show
for him?

281
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,643
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

282
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:26,862
Harvey, I need to talk
to you right now

283
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,013
about something very important.

284
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:29,481
Harvey, why won't it
be necessary?

285
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,066
'Cause you don't beg
the girl to go out with you.

286
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,234
You wait.

287
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,069
She'll call.
That's not even-

288
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,373
Excuse me. Hold on a second.
Um, what if they don't call?

289
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,824
They always call.

290
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,326
Well, what about people
who aren't you?

291
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,494
- You mean you?
- Yeah, of course I do.

292
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,380
If they don't call,
then they don't call.

293
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,165
But once they smell
your desperation,

294
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,532
they won't respect you,

295
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,368
and you'll never get
what you want anyway.

296
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,303
I'm sorry, did you want
to talk to me about something?

297
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,055
It can wait.

298
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,873
Come to think of it,

299
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,725
tell Rachel
when she's back from school

300
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,679
she can have
the rest of the day off.

301
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,050
Harvey.

302
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,103
You do that, you might as well
send Mike a telegram that says,

303
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,155
"I'm not putting any thought
into your idea."

304
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,907
Yeah, might as well.

305
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,276
Okay, are you sure that's how
you want to play this?

306
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,778
Didn't I just answer that?

307
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,615
You did, but this isn't about
whether or not Mike calls back.

308
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,566
This is about you
not letting Mike call the shots.

309
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,118
I let him call the shots,
all he's gonna do

310
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,870
is shoot himself in the foot.
Maybe.

311
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,672
But if this was anybody
other than Mike,

312
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,257
you wouldn't be acting
like this.

313
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,508
Bullshit. I don't let
Tony Gianopolous push me around.

314
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,909
You think I'm gonna let
Mike Ross?

315
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,128
No, of course you don't let
Tony push you around,

316
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,764
but I've never seen you
mock one of his ideas.

317
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,216
Yeah, because his ideas
aren't ridiculous.

318
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,584
This is
Mike's first big idea.

319
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:42,087
And I just told you,
his first big idea sucks.

320
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,606
And if you use Rachel
to deliver that message,

321
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,651
this is gonna end badly.

322
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,892
Okay, thanks, mom, but I think

323
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,193
I'm gonna keep playing ball
in the house.

324
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,863
Okay, act like a child
who doesn't want to be told

325
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,170
what to do,
but Mike's a client,

326
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,598
and you need to start
treating him like one.

327
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,617
Donna, the next time
I need help figuring out

328
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,437
how to treat a client,
I'll let you know.

329
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,572
Okay, great.

330
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,323
Harvey, what can I do
for you?

331
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,325
There's a Jeff Malone
waiting in the conference room

332
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,493
wanting to see both of us.

333
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,495
Any idea who he is?

334
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:21,431
I've run into him before.
He's a hotshot at the S.E.C.

335
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:24,834
- What do you think he wants?
- Let's go find out.

336
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:29,139
Ms. Pearson.

337
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,524
You must be
Harvey Specter.

338
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,509
I'm Jeff Malone.
I know who you are.

339
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,977
My question is,
why are you here?

340
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:36,813
- You seem hostile.
- You investigate

341
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:39,566
publicly traded companies.
We're not publicly traded.

342
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,201
No, but your clients are.

343
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:43,236
Hence his question
and our hostility.

344
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:45,188
- Our?
- We tend to stick together

345
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,491
when an uninvited guest
interrupts our dinner.

346
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:49,876
Well, I didn't bring any wine,
but when I go,

347
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:51,361
I hope you'll be happy
that I dropped by.

348
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:53,330
Yeah, I doubt that.

349
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:55,799
So why don't you tell us
which client you're here for

350
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,367
and be on your way?

351
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,920
All of them.

352
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:03,373
Since when does the S.E.C.
go around intimidating law firms

353
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,041
by going after their clients?

354
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:06,393
They don't, but they will

355
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,678
when Eric Woodall starts there
next week.

356
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:10,847
He comes at our clients
after what he did,

357
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:14,351
this time, he won't get fired,
he'll end up in jail.

358
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:16,570
Except it won't be Woodall
who's coming.

359
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:17,887
It'll be him.

360
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,056
Exactly.

361
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:22,776
Listen, I'm gonna be getting
a vaguely worded assignment

362
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,027
with a not-so-vague agenda

363
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:25,412
of getting up
your clients' asses

364
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:27,497
with the full power
of the S.E.C.

365
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:28,698
And when they ask why--

366
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,700
and they always ask why--

367
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,119
I'm gonna be expected
to tell them

368
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,753
that it's because
they're clients of your firm.

369
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,071
Why are you telling us this?

370
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,624
Because he doesn't want
to work for Woodall.

371
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,377
He wants to work here.

372
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:43,880
I've always heard
how good you were.

373
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:46,466
It's nice to see it's true.

374
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:48,685
Anyway, here's the thing.

375
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:51,721
I'm really tired
of being a public servant,

376
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,523
and more importantly,
I've always thought

377
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,859
that Eric Woodall
was a, um--

378
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:57,611
oh, shit,
I'll just go ahead and say it.

379
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,695
He's a dick.

380
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:00,930
Finally, something
we can agree on.

381
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:02,932
Seems to me the only thing
left for us to agree on, Harvey,

382
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:04,117
is my starting salary.

383
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:06,436
I'm just kidding.

384
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,655
I'm sure
all your new senior partners

385
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,440
get paid the same.

386
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,658
Before you start picking out
floor patterns

387
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:12,959
for your new office,

388
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,328
I'd like to discuss this
with my partner first.

389
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:18,114
I'd expect nothing less.

390
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,617
Oh, uh, just one more thing.

391
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,552
I haven't been formally given
this assignment yet,

392
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,837
so I have no conflict.

393
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,172
But in one more week I will,

394
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:26,506
which means this offer
will be gone.

395
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,674
Is that a threat?

396
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:28,958
I would never threaten someone

397
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,061
that I want to be
in business with, Jessica.

398
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:34,064
It's just the truth.

399
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:38,935
I like him.

400
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,973
How did it go with Harvey?

401
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:47,360
Didn't.

402
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,479
What do you mean
"it didn't"?

403
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,415
You're the only man here
who can take on Jeff Malone.

404
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,085
How could he not see that?
I didn't bring it up.

405
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,704
Louis, winter is coming.

406
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,289
I know,
and I'm the night's watch.

407
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,209
But right now
we need to be patient.

408
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,679
Patience
is not your strong suit.

409
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,130
Well, today it is.

410
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:08,665
Because if there's one thing
that I've always known,

411
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,884
it's that you do not call
the pretty girl.

412
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:12,552
You wait for her to call you.

413
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,837
Louis, I'm seeing someone.

414
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,306
I'm happy for you,

415
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:17,557
though I have no idea why
you're saying that right now.

416
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,008
Katrina, trust me.

417
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,177
They're gonna find out
about Jeff Malone soon enough

418
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,529
'cause he's gonna come calling.

419
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:25,482
And when he does, they're gonna
come right over to me.

420
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,651
Like him all you want.
I'm not hiring him.

421
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:29,202
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

422
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:30,620
Because you don't like
making decisions

423
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:32,322
staring down the barrel
of a shotgun.

424
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:33,907
Jessica Pearson.
Nice to meet you.

425
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:35,792
Jessica,
the man walked in here

426
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,327
and offered to fight for us.

427
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:38,878
If it's not him,
who's it gonna be?

428
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,715
The guy in the office
next door.

429
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,083
Louis?

430
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,218
Harvey, Louis knows
everything there is to know

431
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:46,219
about the S.E.C.

432
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,054
He's damn good,
and you know it.

433
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,173
This guy isn't damn good.
He's a killer.

434
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:52,509
And he's a prosecutor.
We need a defender.

435
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,893
If I'm in a dark alley,

436
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,562
I'd take the killer
over the defender

437
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:56,763
seven days a week.

438
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:59,716
And Eric Woodall's gonna put us
in a dark alley.

439
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,101
Louis is a known quantity.

440
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:03,219
And right now Jeff Malone's
biggest selling point

441
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,938
is telling us
that Woodall is coming.

442
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:06,239
Louis sure as hell didn't,

443
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,057
which means
he either didn't know

444
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:09,559
or he wasn't man enough
to come in here

445
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,695
and take the job for himself.

446
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:14,864
Harvey, do you know why
I don't like being strong-armed

447
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,283
into decisions?

448
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:19,419
Because I'll never be able
to trust the person who did it.

449
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,705
Then figure out a way
to get someone as good

450
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:24,541
or hire this guy
and come to terms with it.

451
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:25,875
Because if it's Louis
against Malone

452
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:28,878
in a street fight,
I'm picking that dude.

453
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:39,022
Oh, thank you.

454
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,129
Hey, how'd your meeting go

455
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,308
with the mysterious
Harvey Specter?

456
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:43,593
Being a dick
doesn't make him mysterious.

457
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,595
Well, then I guess
you're an open book.

458
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,807
You know, I was gonna give you
those Daft Punk tickets,

459
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:50,283
but now after that,
I think I'll give them to Edna.

460
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:52,602
Okay, first of all, Edna
was 63 when Daft Punk was born.

461
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,454
Really?
With that skin?

462
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:55,538
You know what, I worked hard
to get you those things.

463
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:56,606
Why aren't you going?

464
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:57,940
I dropped the hammer
on Harvey,

465
00:18:57,992 --> 00:19:00,043
which means Rachel's
gonna be working all night.

466
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,278
Hey, what are you doing here?

467
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,280
Donna texted me
when I was at Columbia...

468
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:05,382
Mmhmm.

469
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:07,050
And told me
that Harvey gave me

470
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:09,552
the rest of the day off
because I'm kicking ass.

471
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,504
He's giving you
the rest of the day off?

472
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,889
Mmhmm, so I figured

473
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:16,959
we could celebrate over dinner
before the concert.

474
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,172
What, are you jealous 'cause
he never did that for you?

475
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,631
Um, no.
That's great.

476
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,767
You pick a place.
I'll meet you there.

477
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:26,186
I got to set up some meetings
for tomorrow first.

478
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,310
What about the little owl?

479
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:30,306
- Yeah.
- Okay.

480
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:42,035
Mike, what are you doing here?

481
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,789
You delivered a message,
so now I'm delivering one.

482
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:50,710
Pearson Specter
is formally in review.

483
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,512
What did you just say to me?

484
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:55,215
You want my business,
you're gonna have to earn it.

485
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,467
- I have earned it.
- By shit-ing on my plan?

486
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:58,852
You don't have a plan.

487
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,169
You're running into a wall.

488
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:01,304
It's not my job
to crash into it with you.

489
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:02,639
Crash into it?

490
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,173
You didn't even ask me
who I'm going after.

491
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:06,276
I didn't have to
because it doesn't matter.

492
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:08,023
But go ahead. Who is it?
Gillis industries.

493
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:10,029
That's not a whale.
That's a monster.

494
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:13,483
A man like Walter Gillis isn't
gonna listen to a guy like you

495
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:15,735
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

496
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,121
That's exactly
what you said to me

497
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:20,073
before I got him to sell me
his distribution centers.

498
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:21,691
Congratulations.
You got to walk his dog.

499
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,193
That doesn't mean he's gonna
let you marry his daughter.

500
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:26,796
Listen to me.
You want to be my guy?

501
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,425
You stop telling me
why I can't do this,

502
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:30,583
and you start figuring out
how I can.

503
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:31,885
I already told you
how you can.

504
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,729
You get some money,
start buying some shares,

505
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:35,588
and you walk in there
with a club

506
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:36,890
and the balls to use it
if you have to.

507
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,892
Harvey, when I told you
my plan's happening

508
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,510
whether you like it or not,
I meant it.

509
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,145
I'm interviewing law firms
tomorrow.

510
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:44,264
You show up with a better
attitude and another move,

511
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:47,216
or you just lost a client.

512
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:53,520
You want talk about it?

513
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:56,560
Talk about what?

514
00:20:56,611 --> 00:21:00,647
About whatever's going on
with you and Harvey.

515
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:04,952
Why does everybody think
that I was born yesterday?

516
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,103
I tell you that he gives me
the rest of the day off work,

517
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:09,155
you vanish until dinner,
and then you're pissed off

518
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:10,374
for the rest of the night,

519
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:12,326
so it doesn't take
a rocket scientist.

520
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,127
Clearly.

521
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:16,630
I meant "I love you."

522
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:18,498
Mmhmm, nice recovery.

523
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,283
Doesn't get you
out of answering my question.

524
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:21,295
You really want to know?

525
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,119
I'll tell you.

526
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:25,806
Harvey was Michael Jordan.

527
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,593
Now it's Lebron's time,
and he can't take it.

528
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:32,295
That's a pretty big accusation
to make.

529
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:34,681
Well, there's more
to the story than you know.

530
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,266
- What?
- Right, so come on.

531
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,635
I said I didn't want to get
between you two.

532
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:40,070
What?

533
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:45,158
Let's just say
that you kicking ass for him

534
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:48,328
isn't the reason
you got the day off.

535
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:55,202
I thought
you had law school today.

536
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:58,205
I do right after this.

537
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:00,290
He told you.

538
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:01,992
Did you think he wouldn't?

539
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,794
Look, if you want to send
a message to Mike,

540
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:04,995
go right ahead.

541
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:06,430
If you want me to send
a message to Mike,

542
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:09,016
tell me when and where, but...

543
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,602
Please don't ever use me
like that again.

544
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,505
You're right.

545
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:17,975
I'm what now?

546
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,860
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.

547
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:21,561
Is it April fools' day?

548
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,196
No, but don't ever
let it be said

549
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:24,364
that I can't admit
when I'm wrong.

550
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:25,983
Then I will stop
saying that.

551
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:27,567
Didn't you say
you have class today?

552
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:30,120
I'm on my way.

553
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,872
What was that all about?

554
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:32,956
Just some
administrative stuff.

555
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:35,826
Administrative stuff.
You and Rachel.

556
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:37,327
I don't want to talk
about it.

557
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:38,712
You mean about how everything
I said would happen happened,

558
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:40,864
and now you realize I was right
the whole time?

559
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,082
No one likes
a gloater, Donna.

560
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,333
Well, then I guess

561
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:44,534
the Harvey Specter University
of gloating

562
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:45,836
is gonna have to shut down.

563
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:49,840
I can still give lectures
on the weekend.

564
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:51,224
You want to hear it?

565
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:53,260
You were right.

566
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:55,679
Call Ray.

567
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,048
I'm gonna go let Mike know
I'm his lawyer.

568
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:01,651
You're gonna push
a meeting with me?

569
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:04,855
Harvey, Logan Sanders
is here to see you.

570
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:07,074
First of all,
I don't appreciate

571
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:08,918
you stomping into my office
with an attitude.

572
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:10,694
Yeah, well, I don't appreciate
being put off,

573
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:12,079
especially when I know
that you never pushed a meeting

574
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,413
with my father.

575
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:14,898
Your father
never went to Jessica

576
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:16,450
to set a meeting with me.

577
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:18,919
Then I assume that next time
I call you directly,

578
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:20,287
you'll pick up the phone.

579
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:24,458
Logan, let me give you
the ABCs of me.

580
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:27,094
I don't take meetings.
I set them.

581
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:29,746
And my respect isn't demanded.
It's earned.

582
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:32,599
That's only two things.
What's "C"?

583
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:35,085
"C" is for people who show me
they know "A" and "B."

584
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:37,971
Well, since we're quoting
<i>Jerry Maguire,</i>

585
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:39,940
all I want is for you
to show me the money.

586
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:43,276
You just took step number one
towards earning my respect.

587
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:45,228
And I dig that about you.
Great.

588
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,098
Would it be too much trouble for
me to discuss my business now?

589
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:50,700
Well, I was gonna move on
to <i>Crimson Tide,</i>

590
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,069
but, yeah, go ahead.

591
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,703
Knock yourself out.

592
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:55,622
You ever hear of a family
called the Winwards?

593
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:58,125
No. Should I?

594
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:59,442
In 1950, they were worth
the equivalent

595
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:01,661
of a billion dollars.

596
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:04,781
By 1988, one of them owned
a couple of dry cleaners.

597
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,216
And it didn't happen
because they squandered it.

598
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:08,502
It happened
because they stayed a dinosaur.

599
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:09,986
You don't want to become
a dinosaur.

600
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:11,138
No.

601
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:14,641
I like to think of myself
as a shark.

602
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,476
Keep moving forward or die.

603
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:18,145
You're talking
hostile takeover.

604
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,397
You think I'd be here
if I wasn't?

605
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,516
You just took step number two
towards earning my respect.

606
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,733
What's the company?

607
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:26,937
Gillis Industries,
and I already own 4.9%.

608
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:29,439
Logan, we have to end
this conversation right now.

609
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,571
What are you talking about?

610
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,075
I thought I just earned
your respect.

611
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:33,276
You did,
but we have a conflict.

612
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:34,661
What do you mean,
you have a conflict?

613
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:35,996
I mean we have a conflict.

614
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,998
What are you gonna do
about it?

615
00:24:38,082 --> 00:24:40,150
I'm gonna go
and resolve it.

616
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:43,370
Well, you better do it fast,
because I am in on this.

617
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:45,622
And that means you're either
with me or against me.

618
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:49,159
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

619
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:01,337
Hey. Prunie?

620
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,723
- What is that?
- It's a prune smoothie.

621
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:05,225
I invented it myself.

622
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,476
Rain check.

623
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:10,864
Louis, guess who
stopped by yesterday

624
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:12,868
for an impromptu meeting
with Jessica and Harvey.

625
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,701
Please tell me
it was Dick Cheney.

626
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:16,686
Why would you want it
to be Dick Cheney?

627
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:19,022
Why wouldn't I want it
to be Iron Dick?

628
00:25:19,073 --> 00:25:20,540
Holy shit, I think I know
who you were talking about.

629
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,459
I think you do too.

630
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:23,827
Is it a certain S.E.C. beast

631
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:26,496
whose name happens to rhyme
with schmeff schmalone?

632
00:25:26,547 --> 00:25:28,915
Schmess it is,
and schmess it does.

633
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,417
Well, schmuck me.

634
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:32,219
Louis, we have a problem.

635
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,370
What's the problem?
As if I didn't know.

636
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:41,711
I just got out of a meeting
with Logan Sanders.

637
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:43,847
Logan Sanders?

638
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:46,233
This isn't about--
about what?

639
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:48,318
Then-never mind.

640
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:49,736
What's the problem?

641
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,737
He wants to go
after the same company

642
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:52,105
that Mike pitched me first.

643
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,607
So what's the problem?
Mike brought it to you first.

644
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:54,941
You're obligated
to stick with him.

645
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:57,944
The problem is Mike formally
put us in review.

646
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,730
Holy shit.
That's why you're coming to me.

647
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:02,282
You're gonna lose Mike,

648
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:03,867
and you want to know
if there's any way around it?

649
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:06,336
- Is there?
- No, Harvey.

650
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:09,339
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to drop Mike.

651
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:23,104
- What happened with Harvey?
- Nothing.

652
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:25,656
He had an emergency with Mike.

653
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,493
Fine, but don't you think now
is the time to act for yourself?

654
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,505
No, we have a good plan,
and we're sticking to it.

655
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,182
They're stewing on Malone,
and the more they stew--

656
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:36,934
The more leverage we have.

657
00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:38,269
Name partner.

658
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,389
And as I've said,
all we need to do is be patient.

659
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:45,509
Well, patience may be
one of your virtues,

660
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,562
but it is not one of mine.

661
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:54,452
I didn't want to jinx it.

662
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,988
You didn't.

663
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:06,547
Katrina, this is
one of the sweetest things

664
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:07,915
anyone's ever done for me.

665
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,967
I want to make sure
you don't waste your opportunity

666
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:12,887
to get this.

667
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:15,973
I promise I won't.

668
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,934
What are you doing here?

669
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,653
We shouldn't be seen together.

670
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,054
You had no problem walking
into my place of business.

671
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:31,946
Why should I have a problem
walking into yours?

672
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,325
Because unless you're here
to tell me that I have the job,

673
00:27:34,393 --> 00:27:36,778
then you're putting
my position here in jeopardy.

674
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:38,062
How do you think I felt

675
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:39,497
when I found the man
that I'm sleeping with

676
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:42,200
standing in my conference room?

677
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:43,668
Jessica, will you please
lower your voice?

678
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:44,669
Not only that,
but you stood there

679
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:46,254
with a shit-eating grin
on your face

680
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:48,673
and tried to strong-arm me
into giving you a job.

681
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,709
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

682
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,462
You're not funny.

683
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:56,547
Why didn't you come to me first
with this?

684
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,683
Because if I had come to you
with this first,

685
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,135
you would have thought I was
trading on our relationship.

686
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,753
- Aren't you?
- No.

687
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:03,938
And if we weren't together,

688
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:05,423
I would have gone
to both of you, all right?

689
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:06,924
So I went to both of you.

690
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:09,694
Now it may not
have been perfect, but...

691
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:11,446
There was no perfect way
of doing it,

692
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,596
unless I hadn't done it.

693
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:14,265
Now that sounds
pretty perfect to me.

694
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,266
What are you so afraid of?

695
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:16,567
Do I have to draw you
a picture?

696
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:17,768
I'm not the one
that made up the saying

697
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,237
"you don't shit
where you eat."

698
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:21,789
Am I the shit or the food in
this little painting of yours?

699
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:23,207
Because if we're just a fling,

700
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:24,292
then what difference
does it make

701
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,993
whether I work with you
or not?

702
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,912
I didn't say
we're just a fling.

703
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:29,780
Then if there really
is a chance for us,

704
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:31,115
then why not go for both?

705
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,218
Because I've seen what happens
when things go south

706
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:35,670
between partners,

707
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:37,638
and I'm not willing to put
my business in jeopardy.

708
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:38,890
Your business.

709
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:42,143
Yes, my business.

710
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:45,096
The one that I have fought
tooth and nail to keep together,

711
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:48,299
the same business that
you strolled into with a shotgun

712
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,070
and said, "marry me,
or I'll start shooting."

713
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:55,189
Jess, if you want me
to apologize

714
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:56,974
for the way that I asked,
then I will.

715
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:59,694
But I don't ask for things
that I don't want.

716
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:02,313
And what I want is to work
at Pearson Specter

717
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:05,082
and to keep seeing you.

718
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,203
Those two things
are not both gonna happen.

719
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:11,122
Then I guess
you have to decide

720
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:12,823
what's more important to you--

721
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:17,044
what we have
or what you have.

722
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,936
Hey, Mike.

723
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:26,187
There's another prospect here
to see you,

724
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:27,855
but he's late,
and his tie's too fat.

725
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,006
Should I let him in?

726
00:29:29,057 --> 00:29:30,608
You tell her to say
all that garbage?

727
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:32,276
He didn't need to,
Johnnie fat tie.

728
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:34,195
Yeah, I guess I have time
for one more meeting.

729
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,897
- Mike, I need to talk to you.
- Although, I'm sorry, sir.

730
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:38,149
You've missed the pastries.
I can call you some up.

731
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,650
Listen to me.

732
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:41,352
I came down here
because I wanted to tell you

733
00:29:41,403 --> 00:29:43,237
if you want to run
through this wall,

734
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:44,238
I'm ready to run through it
with you.

735
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:45,239
Good.

736
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:47,909
But I can't.

737
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:48,910
What?

738
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:50,161
What I can do is tell you

739
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:51,496
I'm ready
to run through another one.

740
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:52,947
What the hell
are you talking about?

741
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,249
- We have a conflict.
- Bullshit.

742
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,535
Who is it?
It's not bullshit.

743
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:58,586
Then who is it?

744
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,921
You know
I can't tell you that.

745
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:00,972
No, what I know
is that it's very convenient

746
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,390
that you suddenly
have a conflict

747
00:30:02,474 --> 00:30:04,875
the day after you tell me
that my idea isn't good enough.

748
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,248
I don't find it convenient
at all,

749
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:07,395
but you put us in review,

750
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:09,263
and now I have to go
with the other client.

751
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:11,315
I put you in review because
you refused to get on board.

752
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:12,517
And I just told you,

753
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:13,985
I want to run
through another wall with you,

754
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:16,887
and we still can
if you drop this.

755
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:19,156
And why should I be the one
to drop it?

756
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:22,109
Because they're not going to,
and I have to stick with them.

757
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:23,744
And I'm telling you,
you're gonna lose.

758
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:24,862
What, because
you're on the other side?

759
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:26,163
Because their plan
is better.

760
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:27,532
Says
the professional bullshit-er

761
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,167
who has a brand-new vested
interest in me bowing out.

762
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:32,003
I'm gonna let that go.

763
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,454
But if you don't let this go,

764
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:38,593
I can't represent you
on anything until it's over.

765
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:42,880
Then I guess
we're done here.

766
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:01,949
You cook?

767
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:04,118
You come home to this
in your kitchen,

768
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:06,320
and that's what you're going
to ask me?

769
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:07,488
Well, I was gonna ask you

770
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:08,823
how the hell you got
into my apartment,

771
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,942
but I knew
you weren't gonna tell me.

772
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:13,244
Do you remember
when you told me

773
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:16,330
I should think about taking
some morning meetings?

774
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:21,252
I can't say that
it's never crossed my mind,

775
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,637
but you really think
it's a good idea--

776
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:23,754
Jeff Malone.

777
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:26,724
Well, he's not my type.

778
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:27,808
You gotta be kidding me.

779
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:29,060
Why didn't you tell me
yesterday?

780
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:30,645
Because I wasn't gonna
hire him yesterday,

781
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:32,480
so it was
none of your business.

782
00:31:32,564 --> 00:31:35,566
But today I might,
so now it is.

783
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:37,768
And you want to know
how I feel about it.

784
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:39,136
You're my partner.

785
00:31:39,187 --> 00:31:41,355
Well, I already told you
how I feel about hiring him.

786
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
This doesn't change that.

787
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:45,610
Good to know.

788
00:31:45,661 --> 00:31:50,147
Seems like something else
is on your mind.

789
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:52,700
He doesn't
just want to work together.

790
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:54,985
He wants us
to keep seeing each other.

791
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:56,987
And you don't want to risk
the one to have the other.

792
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,124
No. I don't.

793
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:01,659
I've been there.

794
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,294
I know.

795
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:08,499
Then you need to figure out
which is more important.

796
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,802
I guess I do.

797
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,274
So you two have, um...

798
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:19,843
Yes.

799
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:22,813
So he's seen you naked?

800
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:25,900
That's usually
how these things work.

801
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:34,492
Are you picturing me naked
right now?

802
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:36,460
Maybe.

803
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:38,212
Yes.

804
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:40,881
Go wash your hands.

805
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:47,338
Don't spend too much time
in that bathroom.

806
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:49,173
Let me get this straight.

807
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:50,874
You come to me
with a killer idea,

808
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:52,426
and all of a sudden
you don't want to do it anymore

809
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:53,978
'cause you lost your BFF?

810
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:56,597
I don't want to do it because
it's not a killer idea anymore.

811
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:58,766
- Why the hell not?
- Because Harvey has a conflict,

812
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,890
which means somebody already
has a dog in the fight.

813
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:02,353
- Who gives a shit?
- I do.

814
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:05,356
'Cause whoever it is
is already buying shares.

815
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:06,907
You didn't come in here
to give up.

816
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:08,526
You came in here
to get my money.

817
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:09,694
You're damn right
I did.

818
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:11,529
I give you my money,
now I have downside.

819
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,030
Jonathan, look.

820
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:15,449
You said you wanted
a home run.

821
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:16,667
You gotta pull out
your checkbook,

822
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,056
'cause I can't compete
without it.

823
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,870
- You could yesterday.
- Now it's today.

824
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,372
And you're still
going in there

825
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:22,573
another banker in a suit,

826
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:25,259
hoping he'll trust you
based on nothing.

827
00:33:25,343 --> 00:33:29,079
I've got more than nothing.

828
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:31,515
What the hell
are you talking about?

829
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,300
Trust me.

830
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:35,770
I did my homework.

831
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:37,488
Batter up.

832
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,225
What are you doing here?

833
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,553
I said I'd tell you

834
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:47,654
what we were gonna do
with your centers

835
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:48,988
five seconds after we closed.

836
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,591
When did we close?

837
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,677
About three seconds ago.

838
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,013
I guess we better hurry.

839
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:00,684
All right, what's going
to happen to my employees?

840
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:02,436
We're going to sell
your distribution centers

841
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:04,638
to a pharmaceutical company

842
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,189
as distribution centers.

843
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:07,441
They use your workers.

844
00:34:07,508 --> 00:34:10,227
They hit the ground running.
Win-win.

845
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:12,612
You're a man of your word.

846
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:17,684
But that's not
why you're here.

847
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:20,320
No, it isn't.

848
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:22,572
I'm not interested
in selling my business.

849
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:24,825
I know that,
because I know why

850
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,576
you've thrown your whole life
into this company

851
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:29,195
and why you chose the movie
business in the first place.

852
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,331
What's your point?

853
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:34,251
Phillip.

854
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:36,503
Your son.

855
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:39,089
You loved watching movies
together.

856
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:40,841
That's why you started
this company

857
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,809
and why you won't let go
of what it's become

858
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:43,894
for any amount of money.

859
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:46,229
How do you know that?

860
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:48,398
I told you.

861
00:34:48,483 --> 00:34:51,485
I do my homework.

862
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:55,105
You lost him,

863
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,690
and you needed an outlet,

864
00:34:56,741 --> 00:35:01,078
and that's what this company
is to you now--

865
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:02,079
your family.

866
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:04,397
I told you, I'm not selling.

867
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,249
And I told you,
they're coming after you

868
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,401
whether you like it or not.

869
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,337
And the difference
between me and them

870
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:11,838
is they want to tear
your company apart,

871
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:13,106
and I want
to keep it together.

872
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:15,575
You don't have the resources
to do that.

873
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:17,711
Yes.

874
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:21,014
I do.

875
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:23,082
As of an hour ago,
I started investing.

876
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:27,086
So by this time next week,
I will own 4.9%.

877
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:29,473
I didn't have
to tell you that.

878
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:33,276
And that's supposed
to make me trust you?

879
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:41,034
I lost both of my parents
when I was 11 years old,

880
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:45,122
so I know a little something
about needing family.

881
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:48,408
Walter...

882
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:51,611
I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

883
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:54,798
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

884
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,970
All right, I'm in.

885
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:08,795
Listen, Zane,
I want that goddamn filing

886
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:10,514
on my desk nine seconds ago,
or you can forget

887
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:11,648
you ever worked here.

888
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,983
Now excuse me.

889
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,568
I've got to go be a dick
to someone.

890
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:16,686
Sit down.

891
00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:20,824
Is this about you and Mike?

892
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:23,243
Listen to me--
this is gonna be a street fight,

893
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,112
and there's only gonna be
one man standing when it's over.

894
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:27,831
So I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

895
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:28,832
You don't need to.

896
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:31,334
I don't want out.
I want in.

897
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:33,453
And when I said, "you want me
to send a message to Mike?"

898
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:34,671
I meant it.

899
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:36,673
I was just gonna ask
if you were comfortable

900
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:37,991
getting me coffee
in the mornings.

901
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:40,093
I'm serious.

902
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,295
I didn't back down
from a fight with my dad,

903
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:44,831
and I'm not going to back down
from one with Mike.

904
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:47,333
Good.

905
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:49,669
Now, I actually am
gonna get coffee.

906
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,521
Great.
One sugar, a splash of cream,

907
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:54,057
and don't skimp on the hazelnut.

908
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:56,359
Too soon.

909
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,511
Instead of failing
to be charming,

910
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,530
why don't you do
something useful and get moving

911
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,866
on drawing up a tender offer
for Logan Sanders?

912
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,235
Logan?
No, you mean Max Sanders.

913
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,120
I keep forgetting that you're
in law school half the time.

914
00:37:07,187 --> 00:37:08,622
Max is retired.

915
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:11,625
It's Logan's show now.

916
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:18,164
You wanted to see me?

917
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:20,383
We need to move up
our timeline.

918
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:22,886
Well, I'm buying shares
as fast as I can.

919
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,137
I'm talking
about a tender offer.

920
00:37:24,204 --> 00:37:25,805
The plan is shock and awe.

921
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:27,707
If we rush a tender offer,
we won't have enough leverage

922
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:29,175
to force people
to vote with us.

923
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:30,260
It's fine
to have shock and awe

924
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:31,428
when you're the only one
in the game,

925
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,479
but Walter Gillis
knows we're coming,

926
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:35,348
and he got himself an ally.

927
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,399
How do you know that?

928
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:38,551
Because I do.

929
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:40,270
Your conflict--
who is it?

930
00:37:40,354 --> 00:37:43,023
- I can't talk about it.
- Well, when the hell can you?

931
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,659
In another hour.

932
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:51,998
You have it for me?

933
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:54,167
Harvey, you know you can still
get out of this if you want to.

934
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:56,453
Mike's not gonna sign that thing
if you tell him not to.

935
00:37:56,537 --> 00:37:57,537
It's too late for that.

936
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:59,256
Oh, my God.

937
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,041
Hey, just the woman
I wanted to see.

938
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:02,592
Donna, would you happen to have
the measurements

939
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:03,637
to Hardman's old office?

940
00:38:03,678 --> 00:38:04,678
Louis, get out of my way.

941
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:07,097
Whoa.
What's going on, Donna?

942
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,266
What's going on?

943
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,550
That bullshit Harvey told you

944
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:12,769
about waiting
for the girl to call,

945
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:14,387
it's bullshit.

946
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:17,590
He waited,
and now it's too late.

947
00:38:24,198 --> 00:38:25,765
Change of plans.
Cancel anything you have.

948
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:26,816
We're staying here all night.
What for?

949
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,151
The S.E.C.'s coming,

950
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:29,602
Jessica's hiring one person
to fight 'em,

951
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:30,820
and first thing tomorrow,

952
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:32,506
we need to convince her
that person's me.

953
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,442
Hey.

954
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:38,745
I see you have the movies.
Mmhmm.

955
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,215
I guess that means
you've decided

956
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,283
which relationship
you want us to have.

957
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:47,504
I have.

958
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:50,507
But it's not
what you might think.

959
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:56,146
If you still want the job,

960
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,932
it starts tomorrow.

961
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:04,270
I do.

962
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:07,907
Then tonight
is our last night.

963
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:10,410
We'll see if you still
think that in four hours.

964
00:39:10,477 --> 00:39:12,195
Oh, you want to go
three times?

965
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:14,164
Oh, I was including
one of the movies.

966
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:17,117
- No.
- No.

967
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:38,605
Finally got yourself
an office.

968
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:42,142
Maybe you forgot,
but I had an office before.

969
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,526
I just gave it back.

970
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:46,780
I remember,
as a show of loyalty.

971
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:49,733
Yeah, well, that was then.
This is now.

972
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:55,789
What you got there, Harvey?

973
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,073
You think you could meet
with Walter Gillis

974
00:39:57,158 --> 00:39:58,658
and I wouldn't find out?

975
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,377
No, I knew you'd find out.

976
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:03,546
I just didn't care.

977
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:05,415
Then maybe you won't mind
signing this.

978
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:08,501
Let me guess.

979
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:10,670
You want me to waive
the conflict that you still have

980
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:12,371
after hearing my plan first.

981
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:15,725
I sure didn't come here
to see your shit-y office.

982
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:18,762
Aren't you
supposed to be nice

983
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:20,597
to the person
you need something from?

984
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:23,433
They're still coming
whether you sign it or not.

985
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:28,354
If I don't sign it,
they won't be coming with you.

986
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,240
True.

987
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:33,443
Of course,
if you don't sign it,

988
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:36,729
it may cause some people to say
you're afraid of me.

989
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:39,783
And by "some people,"
I mean me.

990
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:41,567
Of course, if I sign it
just because you said that,

991
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,754
then it might cause some people
to say you baited me.

992
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,573
But I knew you were coming

993
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,260
the second I went to see
Walter Gillis,

994
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:52,262
so...

995
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:56,349
I went ahead
and signed one for you.

996
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,385
- I guess it's on.
- I guess it is.

997
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:02,105
You think we need to lay out
some ground rules?

998
00:41:02,189 --> 00:41:03,923
Rules?
In a knife fight?

999
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,479
I guess somebody ought to yell,
"one, two, three, go."

1000
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:10,763
One, two, three, go.

1001
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:14,267
You know, usually
when someone gets a new office,

1002
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:17,370
you're supposed to bring them
something, right?

1003
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:21,458
Like an orchid or something?

1004
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:23,126
No?

1005
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,129
Nothing?

1006
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:36,139
You signed the waiver,
didn't you?

1007
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:37,757
You know I did.

1008
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:40,343
Not gonna back down from Harvey.
Mm.

1009
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:44,964
And I suppose you got Gillis
on board with your plan?

1010
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:49,152
I wouldn't have needed
to sign the waiver if I didn't.

1011
00:41:49,236 --> 00:41:50,636
Hey.

1012
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:53,606
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

1013
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:54,741
This thing
between me and Harvey--

1014
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:56,860
it doesn't have to affect us.

1015
00:41:56,944 --> 00:42:00,663
We won't let it.

1016
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:02,665
I didn't know
that Logan Sanders

1017
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,418
took over his father's company
until today.

1018
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:07,170
What does that have to do
with anything?

1019
00:42:07,254 --> 00:42:10,840
- He's Harvey's client.
- Yeah, so?

1020
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:16,930
Do you remember
when I told you that I...

1021
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:20,099
That I once had an affair
with a married man?

1022
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:23,469
It was him.

1023
