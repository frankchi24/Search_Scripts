1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:03,074
I just wanted to tell you
that I appreciate you

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:04,275
patching things
up with him.

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:07,862
I would do anything
for the woman that I love.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,530
They are gonna come at us
any way they can,

5
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:10,948
and when they do,

6
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,523
it's not gonna be
about heat sensors,

7
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,034
it's gonna be about you.

8
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,454
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

9
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,205
that knows
those sensors are faulty.

10
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,780
I'm sorry, what is it
you need again?

11
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:22,376
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

12
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:24,678
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

13
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:28,215
Have you heard of the National
Transportation Safety Board?

14
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,552
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,389
which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

16
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:38,609
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

17
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:41,979
Your whole story about how
Louis got his name on the door

18
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,114
is bullshit.

19
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,365
Jeff.

20
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:47,451
It's over, Jessica.

21
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,569
We're done.

22
00:00:55,243 --> 00:00:59,046
I can't believe you actually
got them to admit what they did.

23
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,048
You better believe it,
because it's happening,

24
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:04,502
and it wouldn't be
happening without you.

25
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:06,420
You mean without me
being greedy.

26
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,088
Joe, that's not
what I was gonna say.

27
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:10,090
No, no, no, I know that
you don't think I care

28
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:12,977
about these people,
but I do.

29
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:14,428
But I'm also a working stiff.

30
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:17,181
I go paycheck to paycheck
for my whole life,

31
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:18,432
and then a thing like this--

32
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,401
Could turn your
whole life around.

33
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:25,105
Guy like you might not be
able to understand that.

34
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:28,108
I understand.

35
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,944
So it's a done deal?

36
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:31,529
Might take a few
days to finalize,

37
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,247
but yeah.

38
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,949
It's happening.

39
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:37,034
You have my word.

40
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:38,452
You're all right, Mr. Ross.

41
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,927
Harvey, you know the only
times you've been here at night

42
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:48,295
were the god-awful
dinner party--

43
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:49,463
And the other time.

44
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:50,931
Well, this isn't that.

45
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,299
I want to know
why Liberty Rail

46
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,268
has a video of you
in their file room.

47
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:55,519
What are you talking about?

48
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,237
I'm talking the fact
that our smoking gun

49
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:58,472
just became inadmissible.

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,320
- Harvey--
- How'd you get those documents?

51
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:02,193
Are you asking
if I did something illegal?

52
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,394
Because I didn't.

53
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:04,598
Well, they went to the D.A.,

54
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:06,113
which means they think you did,

55
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,898
so I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

56
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,567
how did you get
in their file room?

57
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,569
By walking through the
door they buzzed open.

58
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:12,987
And why would they do that?

59
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:14,154
Because I'm me.

60
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,990
What the hell
does that mean?

61
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:18,075
It means that I led
the woman to believe

62
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,679
that I was an official
from Washington.

63
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:21,161
Led them to believe it,

64
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,663
or flat out told them?

65
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,465
Because one kills our case

66
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,919
and the other puts you
in a world of shit.

67
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:30,137
Harvey, I'm not an idiot,

68
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:32,022
and I don't appreciate
being treated like one.

69
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:34,225
I told you I didn't do
anything illegal, and I didn't.

70
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:35,559
Not an idiot?

71
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:37,797
What the hell were you doing
there in the first place?

72
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,452
- Harvey.
- It was Mike's idea, wasn't it?

73
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,017
No, he didn't even
know about it.

74
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,685
- Where are you going?
- To see Mike.

75
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,687
I told you, he didn't even
know I was going to do it.

76
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:49,356
I don't care, because he
sure as hell knew after.

77
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,608
Let's go.

78
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:04,538
I am so proud of you.

79
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:07,341
I've done that before.

80
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:10,544
I'm not talking about that.

81
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,096
I'm talking about your case.

82
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:13,297
Ah.

83
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:15,021
You believed in it,
and you fought for it,

84
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,218
and I--
I love that about you.

85
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:22,473
And I love that you
love that about me.

86
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:25,059
When a person gives you
a compliment like that,

87
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:27,061
you're supposed
to give one back.

88
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:28,445
But I just did.

89
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,403
I said that you love
that I love that about me.

90
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:31,615
And what if I said I love
that you love that I love that

91
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,317
about you?

92
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,568
How would that make you feel?

93
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:37,121
So tired.

94
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:40,407
Well, we both know
why you're so tired.

95
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,042
Yeah, because I'm so good.

96
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,577
Don't you love that about me?

97
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,710
You knew Donna bullshitted
her way into that company

98
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:56,256
and you let us use
those work orders?

99
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:57,474
How did you find out?

100
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:58,926
It doesn't matter
how I found out.

101
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:00,227
Answer my question.

102
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:01,929
Yes, I knew, but what
difference does it make? We won.

103
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:03,263
We didn't win,

104
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:06,150
because Evan Smith has video
of Donna in their offices.

105
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,434
- What?
- She know about this too?

106
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,249
Harvey, she's just
trying to strong-arm us.

107
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:10,437
Are you listening to me?

108
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,272
They have the opposing
counsel's secretary

109
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,274
poking around
in their goddamn file room.

110
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:16,410
If I were the D.A.,
I'd sure as hell look into it.

111
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,245
- The D.A.?
- Yeah, the D.A.

112
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,613
Harvey, they let her in.

113
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:21,588
According to you,
but they're gonna claim fraud

114
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:23,334
or theft
or any number of things.

115
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,085
What are you gonna do?

116
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:27,454
I'm making a deal to drop this
case, that's what I'm gonna do,

117
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:28,956
and you're gonna file
the paperwork as soon as I do.

118
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,450
So you're just gonna
let this woman

119
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,658
blackmail you without a fight?

120
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,960
You're damn right I am.

121
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,128
Harvey, we can still
win this case and clear--

122
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,462
There is no case,

123
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,297
and I wouldn't give a shit
about it if there was.

124
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:38,632
I care about Donna.

125
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:39,633
And you think I don't?

126
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:40,718
You care so much for her?

127
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:41,969
Then draw up those papers,

128
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:44,304
because I'm letting
Evan know it's over.

What are you doing here?

141
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:29,846
We have a situation.

142
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,149
Is the fate of the firm
hanging in the balance?

143
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,518
- No--
- Then I don't give a shit.

144
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:36,987
You told Malone,
didn't you?

145
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,159
I didn't get a chance
to tell him,

146
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,743
because he had already
figured out

147
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,745
that I had been lying to him
this whole time.

148
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,033
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry.

149
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:52,048
This morning I thought
I was going away with him

150
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,503
for two weeks.

151
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:54,955
Now I don't know if I'm ever
gonna see him again.

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,456
He quit?

153
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:59,009
He didn't get around
to giving me his career plans.

154
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,877
You want me to talk to him
for you?

155
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:03,880
No, this is my mess.

156
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,682
And I will take care
of it myself.

157
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,046
You can take care of it
tomorrow.

158
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:09,052
Right now,
I'm making you a drink.

159
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,978
Zipadeedoodah
or Grab My Sack?

160
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,479
- What?
- Messenger service.

161
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:20,564
Which one do we use?

162
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:21,731
- I-I--
- You know what?

163
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,400
Use whoever you want.
Just take care of it.

164
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,084
Louis, don't you have
your own secretary?

165
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:27,070
Oh, you mean Norma,
who I can't find anywhere,

166
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:28,655
who is probably taking
the day off again?

167
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,907
Last year, she tried to get
Arbor Day off,

168
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,482
and I told her to blow a goddamn
tree and get her ass in here.

169
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,578
You know what,
Louis?

170
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:37,414
Norma has taken 4 days off
in the last 36 years.

171
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:39,068
Why don't you back
the hell off of her.

172
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,584
What the hell is the matter
with you?

173
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:42,752
You usually jump on
the Norma bashing train

174
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,838
like a hobo in a 1940s
action movie.

175
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,973
- I'm sorry; I just--
- What?

176
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:51,428
I bullshitted my way
into Liberty Rail

177
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,596
to get some documents.

178
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,763
They caught me on video,

179
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:55,658
and now they're threatening
to press charges.

180
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,017
You're not saying anything.

181
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,939
It's nothing.
It's fine.

182
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,692
Then why did you look
so concerned?

183
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,028
I was concerned,
but they're threatening charges,

184
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,579
which means
they want something,

185
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,748
and I know Harvey,
and whatever it is they want,

186
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,366
he'll find a way
to give it to him.

187
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,001
Okay.

188
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,087
Thanks, Louis.

189
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,338
I'll take care
of your stuff.

190
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:19,896
No, no.
You have enough on your mind.

191
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:22,375
I'll take care of it myself.

192
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,432
Mr. Specter,
don't tell me.

193
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,885
You're here to talk
about Ms. Paulsen.

194
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,937
I'm here to tell you
you made your point.

195
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,605
And what point is that?

196
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,440
If you drop any charges
against Donna,

197
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,885
we'll drop the lawsuit
against you.

198
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:41,027
Well, that's not
a very even trade.

199
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:44,564
I'm giving your client the
chance to get away with murder.

200
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,983
Last I checked, my client wasn't
being charged with murder,

201
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:48,652
and I don't need you
to drop your suit,

202
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:49,869
because you have no case.

203
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,037
No case?

204
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,657
Your client put a faulty train
on those tracks,

205
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,022
people died, and they knew
it could happen the whole time.

206
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,043
And you have no proof.

207
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,411
And where I come from,

208
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,547
you cut a deal with me
to make sure I stop looking.

209
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:03,333
Then I guess we come
from different places,

210
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,657
because I didn't give that video
to the district attorney

211
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,637
to leverage you into a deal.

212
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:10,507
I did it to blow you out
of the water.

213
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,842
This is a person's life.

214
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,844
Maybe you should have
thought of that

215
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,430
before you sent her
to rob my client.

216
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:21,484
Evan,
I care about this woman.

217
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,819
Look, I understand.

218
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,438
She's probably worked for you
for a long time.

219
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,123
Maybe you sleep together
once in a while.

220
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:29,526
But my job is to defend
my client

221
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,778
to the best of my abilities,

222
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,781
and that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

223
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,463
Holy shit.

224
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:53,600
You can't possible have
a check already.

225
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:57,554
I don't have a check,
Joe.

226
00:08:57,722 --> 00:08:59,022
We have to drop the case.

227
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,506
What the hell are you
talking about?

228
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:01,558
We had drinks last night.

229
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, we also had proof
last night,

230
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,561
and now we don't.

231
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,062
- Why not?
- It's complicated.

232
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,864
You know,
it's a lot of legal rigmarole--

233
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,399
- Hey, don't talk down to me.
- I'm not talking down to you.

234
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,813
But I'm also
not gonna stand here

235
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,035
and explain civil procedure.

236
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,903
Maybe I don't understand
civil procedure,

237
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:17,073
but I know enough to understand
when something doesn't add up.

238
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,075
We got the evidence
the wrong way.

239
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,493
Well,
get it the right way.

240
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:21,578
Subpoena it or something.

241
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:22,829
I can't.

242
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:24,464
What do you mean,
you can't?

243
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:25,982
That money was gonna
change my life.

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,584
And if you want to go to
a different law firm,

245
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:29,052
I understand.

246
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,971
You know as well as I do nobody
else is gonna take this case.

247
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,557
You told me you cared
about these people.

248
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:35,925
You gave me your word.

249
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,762
Yeah, and I wish I could
keep it.

250
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,009
I want those bastards
as much as you want this money,

251
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,098
but I've got no proof,

252
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,553
and you're not
a credible witness.

253
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,402
- Oh, that bullshit again.
- That's not bullshit.

254
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,404
If you had been straight with me
from day one,

255
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,072
we wouldn't even be in
this mess.

256
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,410
How much did they give you
to dump the case?

257
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,528
Had to be something.

258
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:57,497
Otherwise,
you wouldn't sell me out.

259
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,369
I'm sorry, Joe.
It's over.

260
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:07,957
You're sorry?

261
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:17,767
Jessica.

262
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:18,885
Do you need something?

263
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:21,137
I came by earlier,
and you weren't in.

264
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,139
I had a meeting, and I
really didn't think you wanted

265
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,724
to be looped in
on my schedule.

266
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,559
I don't,
and I'm not checking up on you.

267
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:29,145
I just didn't know if you
were coming in.

268
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,781
You mean you weren't sure
if I was ever coming in again.

269
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:34,067
You wouldn't be the first person
to leave a job

270
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,485
for personal reasons.

271
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,487
It sounds to me like you have
an agenda.

272
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:40,957
- I don't.
- Well, that's a first.

273
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,044
Are you saying that I came here
to push you out?

274
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:47,664
I'm saying that I've never known
you not to know what you want.

275
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,499
What I want is to talk
about us,

276
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,967
but you don't seem to want
to do that,

277
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,921
so I'm focusing on this.

278
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,673
I'm not resigning
my senior partnership

279
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:58,641
the day after
what happened happened,

280
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,059
if that's what
you're asking.

281
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:03,646
I'm asking if you plan
to resign it at all.

282
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,045
And I can't tell you that
right now, because I don't know.

283
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,350
Well,
when will you know?

284
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,519
Look, Jessica,
you're the managing partner,

285
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,938
so if you want to push me out,
push me out,

286
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,907
but if you're asking me
what I want to do,

287
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,409
I'm telling you
that I haven't decided.

288
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:28,538
How did it go?

289
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,456
Never mind how it went.

290
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,375
Where's Mike.
Did he file those papers?

291
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,030
I-I-I don't know.
He's not even in yet.

292
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:35,604
Well, you tell him
not to file anything,

293
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,514
and you tell him to do
whatever he has to

294
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:38,671
to stick it to that woman.

295
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:39,799
Why?

296
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:41,518
Because it didn't work.

297
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:43,887
What didn't work?

298
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:47,023
I tried to make a deal with Evan
to trade the case.

299
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:49,559
You mean you offered to drop
the case in exchange for me.

300
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:50,810
Yes.

301
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:53,646
And now what are we gonna do?

302
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:54,864
You're not gonna do anything.

303
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:56,366
I'm gonna do
whatever I have to

304
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,984
to get Terrance Wolf
to back off.

305
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:01,404
Harvey, there's no way the D.A.
handles a case like this himself

306
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:02,822
just because I work for you.

307
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,908
Whether he handles it himself
or not doesn't matter,

308
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,410
because this case won't even
exist in another hour.

309
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,160
How did it go?

310
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:17,661
I just told a man
that everything

311
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:18,745
I promised him was bullshit.

312
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,830
How do you think it went?

313
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:20,998
Oh, Mike, I'm sorry.

314
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:24,001
Oh, you should have seen
his face.

315
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:25,669
That money was gonna change
his life,

316
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:27,993
and then I dangled it in front
of him and ripped it away.

317
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:29,166
Yeah,
but it's not your fault.

318
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:31,058
You did everything you could.

319
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:32,643
He accused me
of selling out.

320
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,840
You know you didn't
do that.

321
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:34,928
Didn't I?

322
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,013
We gave up because--

323
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:37,598
Of me?

324
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:41,819
That's not what I
was gonna say.

325
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:42,903
Yeah, it was.

326
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,501
No, I was gonna say
because of Harvey.

327
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,602
What are you talking about?

328
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,137
Harvey never wanted
to take this case,

329
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,609
so he put a clock on it
to get me to drop it.

330
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:50,194
That's why we're where we are
right now.

331
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,029
Listen to me;
Harvey is out there right now

332
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,664
busting his ass
to fix everything.

333
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:55,032
No, Donna.

334
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:56,917
He doesn't give a shit about
this case, and he never did.

335
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,585
Then why did he send me here
to tell you to do

336
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:00,787
everything you can to stick it
to Evan Smith?

337
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,789
She didn't take the deal,
did she?

338
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:04,875
No, she didn't.

339
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,009
Donna, I'm sorry.

340
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:07,678
I didn't realize
that you were still--

341
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:08,879
On the hot seat?

342
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:12,015
Like I said, Harvey's
busting his ass to fix it,

343
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,967
which means
he's gonna fix it.

344
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,554
Now, finish what we started
and figure out a way

345
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:20,891
to win this case.

346
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,732
Harvey Specter.

347
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,484
I was wondering when you
would show up.

348
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:31,848
That's funny;
I was wondering why

349
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:33,263
you never sent me
a Christmas card.

350
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,872
Ha-ha.

351
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:36,456
You don't seem
the least bit worried

352
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,792
about the pending charges
against your secretary.

353
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,744
I'm not,
because she did nothing wrong.

354
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,079
Well,
you know what I think?

355
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,748
I think you wouldn't be here
if she did nothing wrong.

356
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:47,000
Listen to me.
She didn't steal anything.

357
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,720
She got those documents by
convincing them to let her in,

358
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:50,804
and that is not a crime.

359
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,556
And the last time
you were in my office,

360
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,592
you told me you hadn't committed
a crime to get the job done.

361
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,561
After I told you
you had an innocent man,

362
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,764
and all you cared about
was procedure.

363
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:02,816
All I cared about
was the law.

364
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:05,435
Well, if you're so concerned
with people breaking the law,

365
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,187
why don't you take a look
at those documents?

366
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:10,107
Because they prove Liberty Rail
actually committed a crime,

367
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:12,161
unlike Donna, whose only crime
is working for me.

368
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:14,194
I'm not investigating her
for working for you.

369
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,613
I'm investigating her
for felony fraud.

370
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,749
What the hell are you
talking about?

371
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:24,955
The woman that let her in
swears your secretary told her

372
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,958
she was with the National
Transportation Safety Board.

373
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,127
That's a federal agency,

374
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,463
which makes what she did
not a trick.

375
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:36,183
It makes it felony fraud.

376
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:42,689
My office.
Now.

377
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:48,061
Close the door.

378
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,062
Harvey, what happened?

379
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,564
What happened is,
you lied to me.

380
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:51,782
What are you talking about?

381
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,867
You told their secretary
you were with the NTSB?

382
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,820
- That's not what I said.
- Bullshit.

383
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:57,821
I know
when I've been lied to.

384
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:58,989
Come clean right now.

385
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:00,490
I--

386
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,160
- Right the hell now.
- I never said I was with them.

387
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:04,544
I said,
"Have you ever heard of

388
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,663
the National Transportation
Safety Board?

389
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:07,965
How is that any different?

390
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,883
- I'm sorry, I--
- You're sorry?

391
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:12,201
Harvey, I swear I didn't know
that that made it a crime.

392
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:13,804
You knew when I point-blank
asked you,

393
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:15,505
and you lied to me about it.

394
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,008
Well, I thought that you
would take care of it.

395
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:20,510
How can I take care of it if you
don't tell me the goddamn truth?

396
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,562
Do you think that I didn't want
to tell you the truth?

397
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,148
- Then why didn't you?
- Because I was ashamed.

398
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:29,019
I know that it sounds stupid,

399
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,688
but you and Mike and everyone
pull these rabbits

400
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:33,824
out of your hats all the time,
and I just sit outside,

401
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:36,026
and I answer the phones.

402
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:39,663
And then I got those documents,
and people said I saved the day.

403
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:41,999
And the next thing I knew,
you were on my doorstep

404
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:44,001
coming at me like I was
some sort of criminal,

405
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:48,455
and I panicked,
and I lied.

406
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,874
- Donna--
- I'm sorry, Harvey.

407
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,377
I know you are,
but this just got

408
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,595
1,000 times harder for me
to get out of.

409
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:58,682
You mean for you
to get me out of.

410
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:01,184
Donna, you of all people
should understand by now

411
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,719
that to me
they're the same thing.

412
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,398
What are you doing here?

413
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,533
I went to see you at work.
They said you called in sick.

414
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,201
I said,
what are you doing here?

415
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:20,454
I wanted to tell you
the good news.

416
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:22,011
I'm not dropping your case
after all.

417
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:23,907
Good for you.

418
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:25,909
Hey, Joe.

419
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,544
I know you've been
jerked around,

420
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:29,913
but things
are gonna change.

421
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:31,415
Gonna change?
Really?

422
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:34,134
I thought you said you got
the evidence in the wrong way.

423
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:36,553
Well, and you said we should
get it in the right way,

424
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,422
so that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

425
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:41,091
Like I said, good for you, but
you're not gonna do it with me.

426
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,893
Hey, Joe.

427
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,846
I can't subpoena those records
without the legitimate client.

428
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,932
I have no basis and no standing
to move forward if I did.

429
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:52,486
Oh, now you have time to explain
procedure to me, right?

430
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:55,021
Okay, fine.
I deserved that.

431
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:57,991
But, Joe, this case cannot
move forward without you.

432
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:01,945
You should have thought of that
before you cut me loose.

433
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,447
They got to you,
didn't they?

434
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,917
They gave you a few dollars
to shut you up,

435
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:08,502
and then they sealed
the agreement

436
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,753
with no admission
of guilt.

437
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:10,921
You know what?

438
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:13,090
I can't comment on that,
and you know why,

439
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:15,125
but let's get
one thing straight.

440
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,677
They didn't shut me up;
you did.

441
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:18,879
And if I took anything,

442
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:20,630
it was because I had
no other choice.

443
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,048
Joe,
listen to me.

444
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,184
If the check hasn't cleared,
we can still get out of it.

445
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:25,802
Don't come by here anymore.

446
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:29,439
So much for really caring
about those people.

447
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:33,477
Go to hell.

448
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:43,433
I thought nobody puts baby
in the corner.

449
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:44,684
Since when am I "baby"?

450
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:46,235
Since you're sitting
in the corner.

451
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,104
You're usually a power table
kind of girl.

452
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:50,490
Well,
I'm not tonight.

453
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:53,576
Jessica,
what's going on?

454
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:57,363
It's over
between me and Jeff.

455
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:59,082
What?
What happened?

456
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,833
It's not important.

457
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:03,369
One day the man is calling me
about taking you to Paris,

458
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:04,671
and the next it's over,

459
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,508
and the reason for all that
isn't important?

460
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,780
No, it isn't,
because right now,

461
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,915
I have to decide whether
he should stay at the firm.

462
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:11,678
Well, then I'd say the reason
that you broke up is important.

463
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:13,262
And I don't want to get into it
right now,

464
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,181
because it's not going
to change.

465
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:18,718
Wow,
heard that before.

466
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:22,805
Leah, I'm not like Dad,
and I'm tired of hearing it.

467
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,807
I know you always say
you're not like him,

468
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,393
but here you are scrubbing up
for the next surgery

469
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,362
instead of fighting for the man
that you love.

470
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:31,397
You know what?

471
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:35,068
Most sisters would say,
"I'm sorry, Jessica,"

472
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:36,369
and then give me a hug.

473
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,571
Jessica, I am sorry
that you're hurting,

474
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,219
and if you want something
sugarcoated,

475
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,292
I'll order you dessert, but that
is not how we show support.

476
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,628
You're right.

477
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:50,717
We show it by telling each other
what we think, so...

478
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:53,419
And what I think is,

479
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:56,339
two days ago,
this man loved you.

480
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:58,758
So unless you cheated on him,
stole from him,

481
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:02,478
or killed somebody,
it seems to me the two of you

482
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:04,731
should be able to get past
whatever it is you did do.

483
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:14,357
Joe Henderson backed out.

484
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:19,612
Harvey,
did you hear me?

485
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:21,447
They paid him off.
We have no case anymore.

486
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,700
And right now,
I have a bigger problem.

487
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:24,701
Donna lied.

488
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,369
What do you mean,
she lied?

489
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:29,122
I mean she didn't just bullshit
her way into that file room.

490
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,591
She used the words "National
Transportation Safety Board."

491
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,126
In what context?

492
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,795
In the context of committing
a crime to help you.

493
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:38,431
Are you accusing me of knowing
that she did that?

494
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:40,633
If you didn't know, it's because
you didn't want to know.

495
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,301
Harvey, she told me
she didn't steal those things.

496
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:43,886
I believed her
the same way you did.

497
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,354
And you lied
just like she did.

498
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:46,806
I did not lie.

499
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,525
Then how come when I asked you
where those documents came from,

500
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:51,194
you didn't say one word
about Donna?

501
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,396
Because you wouldn't have
listened to another word

502
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,481
I said after that, and I was
trying to get the job done.

503
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,256
Well, you got the job done
by risking her.

504
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,637
And how is that different than
all the times you risked me?

505
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:01,404
Because she's different.

506
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:13,633
Harvey,
I swear I didn't know.

507
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:16,252
Well, like I said, right now,
I've got a bigger problem.

508
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:18,721
Donna's gonna be charged
with felony fraud,

509
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,840
and she's guilty.

510
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,680
- Five elements.
- What?

511
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,565
Proving fraud consists
of five elements.

512
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:31,734
Okay, I'm aware of that,
and they have all of them.

513
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:33,486
What about injury?

514
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,855
How did Donna injure
Liberty Rail?

515
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:38,491
- You know how.
- I know, and you know.

516
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,326
But Evan Smith isn't gonna sit
in front of a jury

517
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,495
and explain why
those documents have value

518
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:45,281
without exposing her client
to criminal charges.

519
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:46,499
And without damages,

520
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:49,118
what Donna did is trespassing
at the worst.

521
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:50,453
What do you want me to do?

522
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:51,977
I want you to stay
on the civil case.

523
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,256
Harvey,
the lawsuit is dead.

524
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:54,540
We don't have a plaintiff.

525
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,468
Then get another one,
because I'm not letting

526
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,297
this woman get away
with a goddamn thing.

527
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:04,550
All right,

528
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:06,185
I'm paying you the courtesy
of a meeting.

529
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,637
What's on your mind?

530
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,355
Well, based on his reputation,
I would say that

531
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,224
he's going to try to weasel
his way out of this.

532
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,559
What I'm going to do
is save Mr. Wolf

533
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:15,528
from being embarrassed
in open court.

534
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,980
And I'm sure there's no side
benefit to you in the process.

535
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,148
You do know you're gonna have
to put Ms. Smith

536
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,533
on the stand,
right?

537
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,485
So do you; that's why you
had her come down here.

538
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:24,704
And did she tell you
what Donna actually took?

539
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:27,206
You told me what Donna took.

540
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:30,543
And I also told you that it
proves they committed a crime,

541
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:34,213
but she can't say that,
which means all Donna stole

542
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:35,832
was a meaningless stack
of papers,

543
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,500
and without actual damages--

544
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:38,668
I know the law.

545
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:40,392
Then you know you've got
a shitty witness.

546
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:46,509
Well?

547
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:48,523
I can't get into the details
of those documents,

548
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:50,396
but that doesn't mean
that they don't have value.

549
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,398
Of course they have value.
The saved you ass.

550
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:54,767
They're confidential.
They have trade secrets.

551
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:56,519
The only secret
that is in there

552
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:57,843
is that your trains
kill people.

553
00:21:57,938 --> 00:21:59,605
All right, enough.

554
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:04,577
Ms. Smith,
if you can't show damages,

555
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:06,162
I have no case.

556
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
You don't need damages.

557
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:08,414
You have intent.

558
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:10,366
And if you really knew
my reputation,

559
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,201
you'd also know
that I used to work here.

560
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:15,421
And I can tell you they've never
gone after anyone for intent

561
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:16,923
in the history
of the D.A.'s office,

562
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:18,541
and they're not gonna
start now.

563
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,265
It was good doing business
with you, Evan.

564
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:32,471
Hey.

565
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:34,473
Hey.
How are things?

566
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,275
You mean the things
that you said that Harvey

567
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,393
would take care of?

568
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:39,228
Yes, those are exactly
the things I mean.

569
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,780
Well,
those are exactly the things

570
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:42,648
that Harvey
just took care of.

571
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:43,783
He did?

572
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:48,871
He did.

573
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:54,327
Louis,
what's wrong?

574
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,711
Nothing's wrong.

575
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:58,831
It's just...
I know it wasn't gonna happen,

576
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:03,836
but when you first told me
they might press charges,

577
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:06,222
the thought of you
behind bars...

578
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,342
Oh, come on.

579
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:12,345
It just would have been
some cushy, white-collar resort.

580
00:23:12,512 --> 00:23:14,512
I could have finally gotten
my yoga certification--

581
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:17,650
It wouldn't have been.

582
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:19,518
But it doesn't matter,
because I was right.

583
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:21,654
Harvey did whatever it took.

584
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,691
Thanks, Louis.

585
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:28,527
God, he doesn't even know
how lucky he is to have you.

586
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,614
Norma's still out,
isn't she?

587
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:33,449
Her goddamn sister tripped
and fell in the tub,

588
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,834
and she went to help.

589
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:37,370
It's like she doesn't even care
about me at all.

590
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:52,051
I know you don't work
in maintenance,

591
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:54,136
but you do have access
to accounts payable,

592
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:55,438
so if you could...

593
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:58,774
look--no--hey, please,
just hear me...

594
00:23:58,892 --> 00:24:01,727
God damn it.

595
00:24:01,812 --> 00:24:04,313
Another one wouldn't take
your call?

596
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:05,531
No, none of them will.

597
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:07,400
I've been through
this entire directory.

598
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:09,235
As soon as I use the words
"crash," "heat," or "sensors,"

599
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:10,403
they all stop talking.

600
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:11,537
Mike, people died.

601
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:13,456
Somebody's got to want to do
the right thing.

602
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:15,324
Well, if somebody does,
I can't find them.

603
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:16,909
Okay what about
the victims' families?

604
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:18,434
Oh, you mean
the original plaintiffs.

605
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:21,297
Yeah, the problem is,
they already have a settlement.

606
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:22,415
Go on.
Look at it.

607
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,749
They weren't stupid.

608
00:24:23,884 --> 00:24:25,217
It prevents them from ever
going after them again.

609
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:28,554
Mike,
I'm just trying to help you.

610
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,839
I know you are.
I'm sorry.

611
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:31,590
I'm just frustrated.

612
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:34,176
If I can't find a new plaintiff,
I can't keep this case alive.

613
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:36,395
Wait a second.

614
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,565
You said no one at the company
will talk to you.

615
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:42,123
They won't, because they're all
afraid they'll lose their job.

616
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:44,687
All right, so what about someone
who has nothing left to lose?

617
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:48,858
What are you talking about?

618
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:51,744
I'm talking about him.

619
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:57,750
So I rescheduled the meeting
that you missed with Latham

620
00:24:57,868 --> 00:24:59,251
for 3:00 tomorrow.

621
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,569
Here are the newest contracts.

622
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,872
Also, Kathy Finn called
about the takeover,

623
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:05,624
so I sent her the latest specs,
and I told her to sit tight.

624
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,793
And I noticed the left pen on
your desk set was out of ink,

625
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:09,345
so I had the cartridge
replaced.

626
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:11,630
You could have done all of this
while I was out of the office.

627
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:13,849
I know, but then I wouldn't have
had a chance to thank you.

628
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:15,468
Donna.

629
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,803
Thank you, Harvey.

630
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:19,638
You're welcome.

631
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:22,308
Ms. Paulsen, Mr. Specter.

632
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:25,277
Terrance, you better be here
to give Donna a formal apology

633
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:26,479
from the D.A.'s office.

634
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:28,280
No.

635
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:31,067
I'm here to give
her lawyer this.

636
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:35,488
Harvey, what is that?

637
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:36,655
Donna,
leave the room.

638
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,873
You can tell her to leave.

639
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:39,492
Don't forget to tell her
her arraignment's

640
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:40,543
at 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

641
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,710
Arraignment?
For what?

642
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:42,828
You son of a bitch.

643
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:44,547
You amended the charges
to intent?

644
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:46,082
You said it's never been done

645
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:47,666
in the history
of the D.A.'s office.

646
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:49,335
I decided to make history.

647
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,587
By going after someone
for stealing nothing.

648
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:53,589
She went in there to find
the Hope Diamond.

649
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:55,808
Just because she came out
with a piece of glass

650
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:57,309
doesn't mean
it wasn't fraud.

651
00:25:57,394 --> 00:25:58,644
That's exactly what it means.

652
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:00,429
Every time I run into you,

653
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:03,516
you tell me whatever shady thing
just went down

654
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:06,685
was about the greater good
or that it didn't happen

655
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,239
or this, that, or the other,
but a crime was committed here,

656
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:11,440
and I'm going after her
for it.

657
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:13,409
Bullshit.
You're going after me.

658
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:15,828
Oh, you're telling me
you didn't order her to do it.

659
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:17,196
No, I didn't.

660
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,498
Well, we'll find out...

661
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,867
when she's about
to be convicted

662
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:26,589
and I offer her a deal.

663
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,974
What happens now?

664
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:36,443
What happens now is,
we go in there tomorrow

665
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,895
and enter a plea
of not guilty.

666
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,230
But I am guilty.

667
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:43,016
Donna, intent to commit fraud
is a bullshit charge,

668
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:44,871
and he's just using you
to try to scare you.

669
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:46,820
Well, it's working.
I'm scared.

670
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:48,655
- Donna--
- What's the punishment?

671
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,950
It doesn't matter, because
I'm gonna get you out of it.

672
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,160
Harvey,
what's the punishment?

673
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,328
Three to five years.

674
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,330
Oh, my God.

675
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:59,385
- Three to five years for what?
- Not now, Louis.

676
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,168
I just saw Terrance Wolf
at the elevator.

677
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:03,303
Three to five years for what?

678
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:06,173
He's charging her with intent
to commit fraud.

679
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:07,174
Holy shit.

680
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,975
Louis,
I don't want to hear it.

681
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:10,177
Well, you're going to,
because you were supposed to

682
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,311
get her out of this.

683
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:12,345
This isn't helping.

684
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:14,076
What the hell do you think
I've been doing?

685
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,232
I don't know, but whatever
it is, it didn't do a thing.

686
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:16,683
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

687
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:18,985
I told her that you were never
gonna let her get in trouble.

688
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,070
It's not so simple.

689
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,264
What the hell
isn't so simple?

690
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,190
She's guilty.

691
00:27:23,324 --> 00:27:25,108
Wolf is trying to use her
to turn on me,

692
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:26,726
because he thinks
I put her up to it.

693
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,028
Did you?

694
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:29,442
Harvey didn't even know
I did it.

695
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,780
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

696
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,699
- Because I'm taking over.
- No, you're not.

697
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,167
He's trying to get her
to turn on you.

698
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,669
You cannot be her lawyer.

699
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:37,871
She's not going to,
so what difference does it make?

700
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:40,757
The difference is, if you're out
of the picture, Wolf backs down.

701
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,043
From where he's standing,
I'm in the picture,

702
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,427
and he's never gonna
back down.

703
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:46,345
You don't know that,
and this is Donna's life.

704
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:47,787
And I'm not putting it
in your hands.

705
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,158
And it's not your decision
to make.

706
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,967
No, it's not.
It's Donna's.

707
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,853
And she's sticking with me.

708
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:00,694
Louis, please,
I know that you want to help,

709
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:01,811
but just go.

710
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,631
- Mr. Jaworski.
- Yeah.

711
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:23,789
My name is Mike Ross.
I'm with Pearson Specter Litt.

712
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:24,968
This is Rachel Zane.

713
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,803
She's one of our associates.

714
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,961
Sir, we'd like to speak with you
about the accident.

715
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,641
Look, I was already deposed
for that lawsuit.

716
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,809
The victims got paid.

717
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:34,367
I said everything
I had to say, okay?

718
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:36,646
We're not here
to come after you.

719
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,098
We want you to sue
Liberty Rail.

720
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,432
Oh, yeah?
And why would I sue them?

721
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,735
'Cause while you might have been
driving the train,

722
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,103
that accident wasn't your fault.

723
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:44,938
Is this some kind of a joke?

724
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:46,156
No, sir.
It isn't.

725
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:47,774
They made you the fall guy.

726
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,194
Bullshit.
Why would they do that?

727
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,946
Because they needed
to blame someone,

728
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,831
and not only were you
at the wheel,

729
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,333
you had no memory
of what happened.

730
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,035
Nah,
I don't believe it.

731
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,087
They're a good company.
They wouldn't do this.

732
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,339
Mr. Jaworski--

733
00:29:02,456 --> 00:29:03,673
Look,
I killed those people.

734
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,312
And they still gave me
early retirement

735
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,711
and let me keep my pension.

736
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,846
The reason they did that
was to keep you quiet.

737
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:15,302
I need you to get off
my property,

738
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,020
both of you.

739
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,057
Sir, you know that we're telling
the truth.

740
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:23,062
Yeah, well, is the truth
gonna support the family

741
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,228
of a guy who can't get another
job for the rest of his life?

742
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,030
If we win,
you'll be set up for life.

743
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,148
Ah, take a look at me.

744
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,400
I ain't the guy who wins.

745
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:32,452
I'm the guy who loses.

746
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,038
What if I can guarantee
to take care of all of that

747
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:36,373
no matter what happens.

748
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,829
What would you need me to do?

749
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:44,998
All rise.

750
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:50,920
You okay?

751
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,056
Mm-hmm.

752
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,391
Am I gonna have to talk?

753
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:55,908
Just be polite
and say "Your Honor."

754
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,927
It will be over
before you know it.

755
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:00,146
State versus Donna Paulsen.

756
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,850
Is the defense counsel prepared
to proceed with the arraignment?

757
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:04,851
We are, Your Honor.

758
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:06,403
Ms. Paulsen,
you have been charged

759
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,438
with felony intent
to commit fraud.

760
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:11,491
This carries a maximum sentence
of up to five years in prison.

761
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,693
Do you understand the charges
against you today?

762
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,111
Yes, Your Honor.

763
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,246
How do you plead?

764
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:19,249
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

765
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:20,417
Very well.

766
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:22,752
Mr. Wolf, is the state ready
to go to trial?

767
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,870
We are, Your Honor.

768
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:25,422
Trial is set
to begin Monday.

769
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:27,207
Next case.

770
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,875
All right, you made your point.

771
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,490
Let's plead this down
to a misdemeanor

772
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,095
and both go back
to our real jobs.

773
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:33,880
This is my real job.

774
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:35,715
Maybe if you had
a little more respect

775
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,718
for what it stands for,
you wouldn't be standing here.

776
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,855
Listen, I'm gonna wipe that look
off your smug face.

777
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,306
You give it a try,
Harvey,

778
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:45,358
but I've got all the evidence
I need.

779
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:55,902
You're gonna have to go
find yourself a new secretary.

780
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:19,142
I see you're back
to not knocking.

781
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,311
I take it that means
you've made up your mind.

782
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:22,979
I have.

783
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:24,097
And?

784
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:26,733
And what I've decided

785
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:29,102
is that you shut the door
on me the other night,

786
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:33,022
and it's not fair you to dictate
what I do and don't get to say.

787
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,941
I told you.

788
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:36,596
It doesn't matter
what you have to say,

789
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,328
because whatever it is,
I won't believe it.

790
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:43,166
Well, what if I was here
to tell you that I love you?

791
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,425
Jessica,
you lied to me for months--

792
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,761
Jeff, please.

793
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:58,047
Just listen.

794
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,216
I know I hurt you,

795
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,802
but you were the one

796
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:06,389
who wanted us to work together
and be in a relationship.

797
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:08,975
And you were the one who thought
it was a mistake.

798
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,027
Because I was scared.

799
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:13,897
But I changed my mind,

800
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:17,867
because you refused
to give up.

801
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:21,204
And now I'm refusing
to give up.

802
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:24,157
I want you to stay here.

803
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:26,826
I want us to have both.

804
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,830
Jessica--

805
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:35,218
You wanted me to let
my walls down.

806
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:38,004
Well, they're down.

807
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:05,845
Donna, why don't you go home?

808
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:08,117
You know I like to be alone when
I'm getting ready for a trial.

809
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,170
I need to talk to you.

810
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:11,271
What is it?

811
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:13,706
I think maybe Louis
was right.

812
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:16,709
You think Louis was right
about what?

813
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:18,294
Maybe he should be
handling my case.

814
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:25,351
Okay, well,
if that's how you feel.

815
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:27,469
I knew it; I knew you would
take this as an insult.

816
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:29,222
How exactly would you like me
to take it?

817
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:30,746
I would like you
to take it seriously

818
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,058
and talk about it with me.

819
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:35,895
Okay, Donna, why exactly would
you prefer Louis to handle this?

820
00:33:36,063 --> 00:33:37,897
Because I sat
in that arraignment today,

821
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:39,732
and it hit me
for the first time

822
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:43,236
that I might actually go
to prison.

823
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:45,738
And you were more concerned
with attacking Terrance Wolf

824
00:33:45,906 --> 00:33:46,906
than you were with me.

825
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,111
So you think Louis is right.

826
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,709
I piss off the D.A. too much.

827
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:51,878
- Well, you sure did today.
- Because he's coming at us.

828
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,379
And you're pouring gas
on the fire.

829
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,331
Because that's what I do,
and I don't need you

830
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,967
coming in here second-guessing
how I do my job.

831
00:33:58,085 --> 00:33:59,836
Harvey,
why are you attacking me?

832
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,837
I'm not the enemy.

833
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:02,005
You sure as hell are right now.

834
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,389
What?
Why am I the--

835
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,974
Because I'm getting ready
for a fight,

836
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:06,142
and you're telling me
you don't think I can win.

837
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,540
I'm not telling you that.

838
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:09,012
I'm telling you
that I'm petrified.

839
00:34:09,096 --> 00:34:11,731
And I understand, but I
don't have time to comfort you.

840
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:13,850
- Well, I need you to make time.
- And I can't, because--

841
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,102
Harvey,
this is my life!

842
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:21,991
When I told Louis how you
got me out of this thing,

843
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:24,160
he told me how scared he was
at the thought

844
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:28,865
of me going to prison,
and I just...need...

845
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:32,118
you...to--

846
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:35,088
Donna, the thought of you
going to prison

847
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,290
makes me want to drop
to my knees.

848
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:38,758
You want to hear me say it?

849
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,426
There it is.

850
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,711
But that's not gonna happen,

851
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,212
because I'm not gonna
let it happen.

852
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:47,267
But in order to do that,
you need to let me do what I do.

853
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:48,885
- Harvey--
- That's enough.

854
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,353
You want someone
to give you a hug?

855
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:51,688
Go to Louis.

856
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,473
You want someone to get you out
of this thing,

857
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:54,807
you need to leave me alone.

858
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:08,827
I need to know everything
you have,

859
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:09,792
and I need to know
right now.

860
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,801
We got the conductor to sign on,
but we have to give him--

861
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:12,802
I don't care what
I have to give him.

862
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:13,970
What does that give us?

863
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:15,772
What do you mean?
It gives us standing.

864
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,356
Now we can subpoena
those records.

865
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:18,608
Well,
that's not enough.

866
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:20,026
- It's a start.
- I don't need a start.

867
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:21,504
I need a finish,
and I need it now.

868
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:26,315
They're charging Donna,
aren't they?

869
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,067
She was arraigned
this morning.

870
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:31,654
If this thing goes to trial,
I can't guarantee a win.

871
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:33,372
So we're back to trading
the case for Donna.

872
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,957
Yeah, and I don't want to hear
your moral objections

873
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,959
about those people getting away
with murder.

874
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:37,960
I'm not talking about that,
Harvey,

875
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:39,158
but if Donna was arraigned,

876
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:40,773
it's not up to them
to drop the charges.

877
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:42,832
It's up to Wolf, and you know
he's never gonna do that.

878
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,596
I'm not talking about
dropping the charges.

879
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:46,828
I'm talking about making
this whole damn thing go away.

880
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:48,877
Harvey, if you're saying
what I think you're saying,

881
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,339
that's obstruction of justice.

882
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:51,841
The way I see it,
it's justice.

883
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:52,842
You know what I mean.

884
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:54,086
I do,
and I don't give a shit.

885
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:56,012
- This is Donna.
- All right, I get it.

886
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:57,730
But what if what I have
isn't enough?

887
00:35:57,848 --> 00:35:58,931
Like you said,
it's a start.

888
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:01,517
Have an official complaint
on my desk by the morning.

889
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,845
- And what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna get us enough.

890
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:17,700
All right, I hear you.
I hear you.

891
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:22,038
Do you know who I am?

892
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:23,039
No.

893
00:36:23,173 --> 00:36:25,341
Yeah,
Mike Ross works for me.

894
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,709
Hey,
I don't give a shit.

895
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:28,761
I told him not to take your case
in the first place,

896
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:31,347
because I knew you were
a goddamn shakedown artist,

897
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:33,111
but now someone I care about
is in trouble,

898
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:34,383
because you took a payout.

899
00:36:34,468 --> 00:36:35,718
Get out of my face.

900
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:36,936
Listen to me.

901
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:40,305
If you don't do
what we need you to do,

902
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,390
I will hurt you.

903
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:42,859
You better be prepared
to kill me,

904
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:44,810
because I'm not gonna give
that money back.

905
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:47,883
Well, if this is just
about money,

906
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:51,400
then we don't need to fight
at all.

907
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:55,655
Harvey,
this is becoming a habit.

908
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,659
I've seen you more than
my last three boyfriends.

909
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,575
Somehow that doesn't
surprise me.

910
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,294
You're funny.

911
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:02,795
I like you.

912
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:05,331
But I know you're not here
to mock my relationship,

913
00:37:05,414 --> 00:37:06,631
so what's on your mind?

914
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,830
We wanted to give you this.

915
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:09,468
What's this?

916
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:12,066
It's the lawsuit we filed
on behalf of Michael Jaworski.

917
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:14,757
You know, the man you let
take the fall for the accident.

918
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:15,961
Michael Jaworski can't sue--

919
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,476
What?

920
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:18,477
Sue you,
because you were smart enough

921
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:20,263
to take care of his expenses?

922
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,348
Well, now I'm taking care
of his expenses.

923
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:23,599
And now we have standing,

924
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:25,768
and we are going to subpoena
those documents.

925
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:28,321
Am I supposed to start quaking
in my boots?

926
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:30,856
Nope, we know
if you can doctor a report,

927
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:32,525
you can alter
those maintenance records.

928
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:33,659
I didn't alter anything.

929
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:35,494
Well, that's not what
Joe Henderson said.

930
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:37,530
He said you came to him,
admitted everything,

931
00:37:37,613 --> 00:37:39,581
and offered him a settlement
to keep quiet.

932
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,451
We didn't admit anything,
and that settlement is sealed.

933
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:45,004
Oh,
you mean this settlement?

934
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:48,507
We had an agreement.

935
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,065
Well, here's the thing
about paying people off, Evan.

936
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:53,095
Someone can always
pay them more.

937
00:37:54,798 --> 00:37:57,433
His word won't hold up
against Richard McIntyre's.

938
00:37:57,517 --> 00:38:00,303
Oh, he's not saying that Richard
McIntyre put him up to it.

939
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:01,387
He's saying you did.

940
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:02,772
That's bullshit.

941
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:04,357
And does that really matter?

942
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,810
What do you want?

943
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,862
You made the author
of that report disappear.

944
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,481
You made Joe Henderson
disappear.

945
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:14,700
Figure out a way to make
the witness against Donna

946
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:15,818
change her tune.

947
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:17,703
That's obstruction
of justice.

948
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:18,988
That's not my problem.

949
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:21,039
You son of a bitch.

950
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:22,458
It's your call.

951
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:25,544
Maybe people will believe Joe,
maybe they won't,

952
00:38:25,662 --> 00:38:26,796
but instead of making money,

953
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,748
you're gonna be
defending yourself in court

954
00:38:28,832 --> 00:38:30,967
for the next five years.

955
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:33,836
You're so sure we did this,
you're really gonna let us

956
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:36,055
get away with murder
for your secretary?

957
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:38,573
You're damn right I am,
and if I had to do it again,

958
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:41,560
I'd do it 100 times.

959
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,573
What's that?

960
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:56,826
You know what it is.

961
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:04,450
- Jeff--
- Jessica, you were right.

962
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:07,086
We either need to have both,
or it's not going to work.

963
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,873
And you don't want both?

964
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:15,378
Effective immediately,
I'm tendering my resignation.

965
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:20,049
Then I wish you luck.

966
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:24,603
Good luck,
Jessica.

967
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:47,947
Do you remember?

968
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,996
Yes, of course I remember.
It happened right there.

969
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Well,
it was your fault,

970
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:56,669
'cause you made me
burst out laughing.

971
00:39:56,803 --> 00:39:57,920
You didn't just burst.

972
00:39:58,055 --> 00:39:59,922
You spat a piece of shrimp
across the room

973
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:01,537
and into the back
of my mother's hair.

974
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,895
And she didn't even feel it
because of all the hair spray,

975
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:07,680
and it stuck in there
like a tick.

976
00:40:07,814 --> 00:40:08,898
Oh, my God.

977
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:10,599
I could hardly look at her
or that boyfriend

978
00:40:10,734 --> 00:40:11,734
for the next two hours.

979
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:12,768
What was his name again?

980
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,437
Who cares?
He was such a loser.

981
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:15,905
Oh, come on;
he was the reason you had

982
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,440
that god-awful party
in the first place.

983
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,416
Thank you, Harvey.

984
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,618
You don't need to thank me.
You already thanked me.

985
00:40:29,786 --> 00:40:32,338
No, I thanked you
for fixing it.

986
00:40:32,456 --> 00:40:36,375
Now I'm thanking you for not
bringing it up all night.

987
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,043
I just figured if you wanted
it brought up,

988
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:41,881
you'd bring it up,
and now you have, so...

989
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:49,105
I told you I'd never let
anything happen to you,

990
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:52,725
and I wont ever,

991
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:57,313
so you don't ever have to
feel scared like that again.

992
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:03,819
I thought you said you didn't do
the comfort thing.

993
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:05,371
I didn't say I didn't do it.

994
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:06,989
I said I didn't have time,

995
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:11,043
because I was so busy
saving your ass.

996
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:17,883
I'm sorry I doubted you.

997
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:23,005
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

998
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:32,481
Anyone else every loses faith
in me,

999
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:37,603
it doesn't matter.

1000
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:40,356
But with you,
it's different.

1001
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:50,866
I should go.

1002
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:00,009
Why?

1003
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:02,595
You know why.

1004
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:10,386
You know I love you,
Donna.

1005
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:27,775
