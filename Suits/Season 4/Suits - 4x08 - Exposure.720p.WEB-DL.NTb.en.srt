1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,003
- You really know him.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,371
- I really do.

3
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:07,339
- Never.
- No.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,141
- Why not?

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,043
- Because you can never go back.

6
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,678
- Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,279
Through switzerland
and the caymans

8
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,681
Before it comes out
on the other side.

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,149
- You're obligated to report it.

10
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,550
- I didn't,
and I'm not going to.

11
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,585
- What are you talking about?

12
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,120
Rachel, hey.
- Logan and I kissed.

13
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,789
Mike, no.
Please.

14
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,791
- When I said that it
didn't matter what I do next

15
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:29,628
Because I have you,
I was wrong because we're done.

16
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,463
- That's your fee
for putting this deal

17
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,798
Together.
- You son of a bitch.

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,366
You didn't bring me here
for you to sign on the arrows.

19
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,667
You brought me here for me
to sign on the arrows.

20
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,236
- Yep.

21
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,371
- You cannot take a job
with that man.

22
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,539
- What are you gonna
do about it?

23
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,274
- I hired mike ross
back at the firm.

24
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,410
- What?
- You're really gonna drop me?

25
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:45,511
- You're damn right I am.

26
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:49,114
I never want to see you again.

27
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,682
- Are you back here?
- No, no.

28
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:54,620
I'm--stay somewhere for a while.
- Mike--

29
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,121
- Rachel,
whatever you're gonna say,

30
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,157
Now is not the time to say it.

31
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,392
I'm coming back
to work tomorrow.

32
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,660
If you can't accept that,

33
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:05,497
Then whatever you were gonna
say to me won't matter.

34
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,262
- Thought you might need this.

35
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,563
- Thank you.

36
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:15,634
- So, the way I see it,
you've got three options.

37
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,204
You can wear what you
were wearing last night,

38
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,639
You can go back to your place
and change,

39
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,244
Or you can grab anything
you want from my closet.

40
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,746
Nothing? I thought for sure
you would leap at the chance--

41
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,415
- Mike's coming back to work
today.

42
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,550
- I know.

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,252
- What am I gonna do?
- You're gonna do

44
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,654
What you've been doing
since the day mike left.

45
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,157
You're gonna walk into harvey's
office with your head held high,

46
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,391
And you're gonna do your job.

47
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,659
- Mike's job.
- Rachel--

48
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:45,230
- I don't know how to be
near him without being near him.

49
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,567
- I'll tell you how.
Give him space.

50
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,235
- I don't want
to give him space.

51
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,237
I want to run to him

52
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,439
And hold him and tell him
that I love him.

53
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,607
- I know, but, rachel,

54
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,276
If you try to pull him
towards you right now,

55
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,944
All you're gonna
do is push him away.

56
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,413
Trust me.
Let things be.

57
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,714
They'll turn out the way
they're supposed to.

58
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,318
- You don't know that.

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,589
- I do know that.

60
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,958
Okay.

61
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,494
Rachel, I'm gonna tell you
something I've never told you.

62
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,502
I slept with harvey.

63
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:27,439
- Oh, my god.

64
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,507
But you told me that--

65
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,576
- I know what I told you.

66
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,444
It was once,
and I never would have done it

67
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,813
If we were still
working together.

68
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,748
But then,
he left the d.A.'s office,

69
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,620
And...It happened.

70
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,788
And then, the next time
I saw him,

71
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,456
He wanted me to come with him
to the firm,

72
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,991
And I did, and that was that.

73
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,793
- Would you have wanted
a relationship with him?

74
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,529
- I would have wanted to try,

75
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,732
But he wasn't ready.

76
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,668
And if I had pushed him
to be ready,

77
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,570
I would be sitting here
talking to somebody else

78
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,608
About somebody I used to work
with a long time ago.

79
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,676
- What are you saying?

80
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,878
- I'm saying everything turned
out the way it was supposed to.

81
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,580
- But you said the reason

82
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,851
That you two never--is
because you can never go back.

83
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,556
- I lied.

84
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,030
- Oh, I'd let you go,

85
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,965
But I was here first.

86
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,934
- Words to live by
by harvey specter,

87
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,703
The most selfish man
in the world.

88
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:32,838
- Don't mind if I do.

89
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,307
- Wait a second.

90
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,708
What are you
doing here so early?

91
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,043
- I always get in this early.

92
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,579
- You never get in this early,
and I know that for a fact

93
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,649
Because this is the time
I get in every single day.

94
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,816
- You should sleep in once
in a while.

95
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,984
It's good for you.
Trust me.

96
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,853
I do it every single day.

97
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,688
It just so
happens that this morning,

98
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,956
I have work to do.

99
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,325
- What work?

100
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,460
- The schmoolkinsberg brief.

101
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,863
- The schmoolkinsberg brief?

102
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,331
That's what you're going with?

103
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,565
- It's not gonna write itself.

104
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,601
- I'm taking your name
off the wall.

105
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,970
- Seriously, I'm here
for the tokyo markets.

106
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,705
- Name one tokyo market.

107
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,907
- The nikkei.
- Name another.

108
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,377
- Honda, toyota, kia.

109
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,578
- Kia's korean.

110
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,080
- Yeah, but they're
in the same time zone.

111
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,716
- Where it is currently dinner.

112
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,384
- I'm a tired
of this inquisition.

113
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,653
This is exactly
why I don't come in this early.

114
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,456
- And the reason that you're
here this early this morning

115
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,825
Is because it's
mike ross' first day back.

116
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,627
- Is it?

117
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,338
- Louis,
why are you here so early?

118
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,806
- I am taking
this forstman document,

119
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:45,811
And I am burying it
in the bowels of these files.

120
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,347
And then,
I am putting these files

121
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,416
Deep in the bowels
of our storage.

122
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,851
- Louis, please stop saying
bowels.

123
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,753
- Katrina, I don't have time
to give a sh-- about bowels,

124
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,588
'cause after this,
we are starting fresh.

125
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,523
And I don't want to hear about
gillis industries, sean cahill,

126
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,560
Charles forstman ever again.

127
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,802
- Well, look who it is,
bonnie and clyde.

128
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,404
Just the people
I wanted to see.

129
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,705
- What do you want, sean?

130
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,640
- To serve you with this.

131
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:19,511
- What the hell is that?

132
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,447
- He wants all files relating to
the gillis industries takeover.

133
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,582
- Oh, I don't want the files.

134
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,050
I'm taking them.
- Bullsh--.

135
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,753
We have 60 days
to fight that or comply.

136
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,154
- You want to tell him
or should I?

137
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,890
- It's not a subpoena, harvey.
It's a search warrant.

138
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,092
- So you're gonna give me
all the files,

139
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,162
Or you're gonna head downtown
with these two fine gentlemen.

140
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,730
- Okay, sean.

141
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,465
Have it your way.

142
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,967
You're going to take that hall.

143
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,602
You're going to run
into what appears

144
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,604
To be the mummified remains
of a legal secretary.

145
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,105
- Her name is norma.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,474
She's gonna limp you
up to the 60th floor

147
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,010
Where you will find
30 years worth of files

148
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,012
That haven't been sorted
since the reagan administration.

149
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,147
- Or is it the 56th floor?

150
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,149
- It could be the 35th floor
for all I know.

151
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,150
- The point is,
while you're trying

152
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,751
To find the ark of the covenant,

153
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,721
We'll be downtown in front of
a judge blocking this bullsh--.

154
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,423
- You think the threat
of you getting to a judge

155
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,725
Before I find what I want
is gonna get me to leave?

156
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,026
- Then stay,

157
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,162
But who do you think's gonna
get the job done faster?

158

- Welcome home, sailor.

169
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,146
You were out to sea a long time.

170
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,048
- I was, but now I'm back.

171
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,951
And this place
hasn't changed a bit.

172
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,486
Maybe it has.

173
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,887
Is this a new spinner's album?

174
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,089
- No, and you know it's not new.
You and harvey joked about it.

175
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,657
- I could have sworn
that was a different one.

176
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,159
- Said the man
with the photographic memory.

177
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,894
- Okay, that doesn't mean
I've seen every album--

178
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,262
- You have no idea
where to go, do you?

179
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,232
- Not a clue.
- Come with me.

180
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,870
- Donna, I went to the bullpen.

181
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,138
Some guy with a soul patch
was sitting at my desk.

182
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,040
- That's because
it's not your desk anymore,

183
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,976
And you're not cool enough
to pull off a soul patch.

184
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,177
- I dispute that.

185
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,045
- Are you even capable
of growing a soul patch?

186
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,148
- I had a goatee
my sophomore year of never.

187
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,683
- Look, it's not your desk
anymore

188
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,085
Because you're on the other side
of the bullpen now.

189
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,520
- Which other side?

190
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,555
- The other side. Like,
not the side that you were on.

191
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,823
- Towards the door
or away from the door?

192
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,957
- Which door are you talking
about?

193
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,092
<i>- Which door are you
talking about?</i>

194
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,894
- You know what?
Just shut up and keep walking.

195
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,028
You're not here five minutes,

196
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,630
And you're already a pain
in my ass.

197
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,868
This is the other side
of the bullpen.

198
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,672
- Are you serious?
- I know.

199
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,940
I fought it tooth and nail.

200
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,542
I mean, if it were up to me,
you'd be setting up shop

201
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,809
In the file room.

202
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,311
- You did this, didn't you?

203
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,281
- Well, I didn't not do it.

204
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,615
- Thanks, donna.

205
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:14,119
- It's good to have you back,
mike.

206
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,887
Well, some of us have work
to do,

207
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,922
And of course,
by "some of us,"

208
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,657
I mean you.

209
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,991
As soon as word got out
that you were coming back,

210
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,960
The partners started
taking numbers

211
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,196
To give the boy wonder
their work.

212
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,566
- Thanks, donna.
- You already thanked me.

213
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,834
- Not for that.

214
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,069
For not mentioning rachel.

215
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,604
- Mike--
- come on.

216
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,840
You expect me to believe
you don't know what's going on?

217
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,810
- I know enough to know
that it's between you and her.

218
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,923
- Sh--.

219
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,191
Look who's back.

220
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,661
- Sh--, look who's still here.

221
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,129
- Somebody had to pick up
your slack

222
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,265
While you were sh--ing the bed
on wall street.

223
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,367
- Which is why it's good to be
back here where there's a sh--y

224
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:05,337
Lawyer like you
to make me look good.

225
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,072
- It's good to see you.

226
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,106
- Thanks, katrina.

227
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,141
- Don't thank me.
Thank louis.

228
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,243
- Oh, I did
when he hired me back.

229
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,347
- I'm sure you did, and I'm sure
he would never tell you this,

230
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:19,851
But I wanted you to know what he
gave up to bring you back here.

231
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,320
- What are you talking about?
- Jessica gave louis one wish

232
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,822
When he closed forstman,

233
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,324
And he had a whole plan
to manage his work schedule

234
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,194
So he could try
to reignite things with sheila.

235
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,997
And he gave all that up
because he cared more about you

236
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,966
Than he did about himself.

237
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,337
- I didn't know that.
- Well, like I said,

238
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,339
I thought you should.

239
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,183
Welcome back.

240
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,165
- I have court in ten minutes.

241
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,100
Now, what are you three doing
in front of my face?

242
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,969
- We're here because he showed
up at our offices this morning

243
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,337
With a search warrant.

244
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,738
- A search warrant,
I'm sorry to say,

245
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,073
You have no authority to stop.

246
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,975
- Yes, you do
because he deliberately

247
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,877
Went outside your authority
to get it.

248
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,078
- What?
- Your honor,

249
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,446
I went to a different judge
because my office

250
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,081
Tried to reach you,
but you were unavailable.

251
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,849
Check with your clerk.
There's a record of the call.

252
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,685
- Did you make it
from judge franklin's house?

253
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,688
Because he's the one who signed
the warrant at 8:30 last night.

254
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,956
- The same judge you play golf
with every Thursday.

255
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,359
- And barack obama plays
basketball with eric holder.

256
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,727
Let's arrest everybody.

257
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,729
- I'm not interested
in everybody.

258
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,164
I'm interested in
why you went around me.

259
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,799
- Because I needed a warrant
last night

260
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,934
To stop them from destroying
evidence this morning.

261
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,203
- And the day someone's guilty
until proven innocent

262
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,939
Is the day that argument
holds an ounce of water.

263
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,441
- Better get your glass, harvey.

264
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,042
That day's coming
sooner than you think.

265
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,977
- Well, it's not today.

266
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,212
I'm revoking your search warrant

267
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,413
Until we can have
a full hearing.

268
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,015
- Your honor--
- now, that's enough.

269
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,085
If you want to go rummaging
around in a law firm's files,

270
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,487
You better come to me
with more than innuendo.

271
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,258
- I better get going.

272
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,127
I have to look up
the word "innuendo,"

273
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,798
If you know what I mean.

274
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,768
- Harvey, I'm telling you, that
man is not going to stop coming.

275
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,270
- I'm going to suggest
something radical here.

276
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,839
- And what is that?

277
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,074
- We could just give him
what he wants.

278
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,809
The fact is
we've got nothing to hide.

279
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,045
- Harvey, I don't care
that we have nothing to hide.

280
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,880
A police officer
follows a car long enough,

281
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,248
He's gonna find
a busted taillight.

282
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,984
And even if he doesn't,
he's gonna bust it himself.

283
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,152
- Well, what are you
suggesting we do?

284
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,054
- I don't know,
but this whole witch hunt

285
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,857
Is about cahill thinking
you colluded with mike ross.

286
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:39,958
So now that he's back,

287
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,526
Why don't you collude
with that fraud

288
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,495
And get us the hell
out of this?

289
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,538
- See you got yourself
an office.

290
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,840
- Yeah, it's not as nice
as the one I had, but--

291
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,208
- It's still a step up.

292
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,477
- You mean because it's smaller
or because the view is worse?

293
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,847
- I mean
because it's my old office.

294
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,082
- You're sh--ing me.

295
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,784
- Look in the top left drawer.

296
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,093
- You're serious.
- I am.

297
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,327
- Donna said she did this.

298
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,396
- She had the idea
to give you an office.

299
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,165
It was my idea
to give you this office.

300
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,499
- And it just
happened to be empty.

301
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,500
- Something like that.

302
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,502
- Right.

303
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,505
- It's good to have you back
where you belong.

304
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,340
Okay, enough fun.

305
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,276
Sean cahill's trying
to go through every file

306
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,111
We have on the takeover.
You in?

307
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,913
- I sure as hell
don't want to do an amicus brief

308
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,414
For paul porter.
- Good.

309
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,049
Then figure out a way
to keep cahill

310
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,450
From getting his hands
on our documents,

311
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,519
And do it fast
because we don't have much time.

312
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,288
- Harvey, have you considered

313
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,456
The fact that he's been
going after us for collusion,

314
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,892
And we didn't collude?
- What are you getting at?

315
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,961
- Why don't we just give
him all the files?

316
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,029
We have nothing to hide,

317
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,463
And fighting him makes it
look like we do.

318
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,832
- That's what I said
to jessica.

319
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,966
You know what she said to me?

320
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,835
"a cop follows a car
long enough,

321
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,236
"he's gonna find
a busted taillight.

322
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,405
And even if he doesn't,
he's gonna bust it himself."

323
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,010
Speaking of jessica,

324
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:11,382
You never told me how she felt
about me coming back.

325
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,352
- Find a way to beat cahill,
and then ask me that again.

326
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,961
- You just had to get
to him first, didn't you?

327
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,496
- What are you talking about,
louis?

328
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,232
- You think I didn't notice
you conveniently put henderson

329
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,100
In my old office so you
can give mike your old office?

330
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,168
- For your information,

331
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,238
Louis, henderson
begged for your old office

332
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,206
Because he thinks
you're the best attorney

333
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,641
That's ever walked the face
of this earth.

334
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,543
- Oh, bull--really?

335
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,379
- Absolutely.

336
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,282
- So you're not just saying
that to butter me up

337
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,184
So I'll let this go?

338
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,452
- Hand to god,

339
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,420
Or as henderson would say,

340
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,589
"hand to louis."
- okay, then.

341
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,960
Just as long as you're not
trying to pull one over on me.

342
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,528
That henderson is going places.

343
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,939
Don't move.

344
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,540
- What are you doing?

345
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,076
- Taking a mental picture
of this moment.

346
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,511
- Louis, that's not a mental--

347
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,247
- Mike ross, the prodigal son,
returns.

348
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,582
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

349
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:22,186
- And louis, I want to thank
you again for bringing me back.

350
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,621
I'm never gonna forget it.

351
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,258
And if there is every anything
that I can do to repay you--

352
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,660
- Mike, please.

353
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,028
Don't insult me.

354
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,298
You do not owe me,
and if you really care about me,

355
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,302
You will never mention
repaying me with a favor again.

356
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,404
- Really appreciate it, louis.
- Good.

357
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,539
Now, I need you to drop
whatever it is you're doing--

358
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,241
- Oh, louis,
I can't drop what I'm doing.

359
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,575
Harvey just asked me to--

360
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:48,379
- You just told me
never to mention that again.

361
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,948
- What, do you think
I meant that?

362
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,250
Now, what you say is,

363
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,318
"screw what harvey
asked me to do.

364
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,352
"I don't give a sh-- about him.

365
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,987
I only give a sh-- about you,
louis."

366
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,155
- Louis, this isn't
just for harvey.

367
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,256
It's for the firm, okay?

368
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,457
Sean cahill--
- bullsh--.

369
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,359
That's just the kind of thing
that harvey--

370
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,261
Did you just--did you just--

371
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,329
Did you just say, "sean cahill"?

372
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,496
- Yeah.
He's trying to get access

373
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,031
To our files
on the gillis takeover.

374
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,300
- Why didn't you
say that in the first place?

375
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,969
We need to fight
this son of a bitch

376
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,170
With the full force
of the law, mike.

377
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,705
- That's what I was doing.
- Then, do it.

378
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,073
You don't have time
to work on this case.

379
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,141
I need to bring it to katrina.

380
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,610
- Louis, are you okay?
- No, I am not okay.

381
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,179
Mike, this is an attack
on our firm,

382
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,281
And an attack against one of us
is an attack against all of us.

383
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,083
Get the hell to work.

384
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,388
We're in trouble.

385
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,623
Sean cahill is trying
to get the gillis files.

386
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,059
- Louis,
you buried that document.

387
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,361
- You don't understand.

388
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,329
The sec is gonna have
these files forever,

389
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,131
And eventually,
they're gonna see the money

390
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,632
Went in one place
and came out the other,

391
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:45,303
And I'm the person who did it.

392
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,704
- What do you need me to do?

393
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,273
- I want you to cover up
my tracks as best you can.

394
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,641
- And what are you going to do?

395
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,478
Never happened
in the first place.

396
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,421
- What are you doing here?

397
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,656
I didn't think we had
any further business to discuss.

398
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,191
- We don't.
We just have a problem

399
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,693
With the business we just did.

400
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,528
- Are you here to shake me down
for more money?

401
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,796
- I'm here to give it all back.

402
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,798
- Louis, I told you--
- no, just listen to me, okay.

403
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,135
The sec--they're trying
to get access to our files.

404
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:20,338
That happens, they see that
your payout was routed offshore

405
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,506
And you didn't pay taxes on it.

406
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,808
- They'll see
I haven't paid taxes.

407
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,377
I have until the third quarter
of two years from now

408
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,812
To report that income,

409
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,547
And if I need to, I will.

410
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,349
- Are you crazy?

411
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,683
They're not idiots.

412
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,753
Nobody has money wired through
a swiss bank and the caymans

413
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,789
If they're planning
on reporting it to the irs.

414
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,625
- That's not proof of anything,
and the only thing

415
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,693
They'll definitely find if they
get a look at those files

416
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,162
Is that you embezzled money.

417
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,630
So get out of my office.

418
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:46,798
- Listen to me, goddamn it.

419
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,668
We need to undo this deal.

420
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,603
- I tell you what, louis.

421
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:57,542
Have a seat.

422
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,445
You want peace of mind?

423
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,748
Draw up the same paperwork
we already signed.

424
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,285
Only this time, have harvey
sign it instead of you.

425
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,519
- What?

426
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,689
- Taking his client
is one thing.

427
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,723
Framing him for a felony?

428
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,825
That's another.

429
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,526
- It's your call.

430
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,228
Use your name,
replace it with his,

431
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,629
I don't give a sh--.

432
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:22,600
But the deal
is staying in place.

433
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,520
- I heard they hired
a new hotshot attorney,

434
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,422
But they never said
how handsome he was.

435
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,190
- Look, rachel,
I'm really swamped right now.

436
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,427
- Too swamped to even
stop by and say, "hello"?

437
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,596
- Saying hello is just
gonna lead to saying a lot more,

438
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:55,299
And now is not the time
to have it out.

439
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,268
- Well, I'm not here
to have it out with you.

440
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,338
I am here to work with you
on fighting off sean cahill.

441
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,539
- I don't need any help.

442
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,141
- But you just
said you were swamped.

443
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,775
- Because I'm trying to avoid
having a conversation with you,

444
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,179
Which, obviously, isn't working.

445
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,381
- Well, mike,
I am harvey's associate now.

446
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,316
So you working a case with him,
you're working it with me.

447
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,684
- He didn't say anything
to me about it.

448
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,553
- Well, he said it to me.

449
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:19,490
Why do you think I'm here?

450
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,425
- I don't care what he said.
It's not a good idea.

451
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,694
- What isn't? For us to even be
in the same room together?

452
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,329
- Not right now.
No.

453
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,431
- You're the one
who chose to come back here.

454
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,567
- So?

455
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,868
- So you don't get

456
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,371
To act disappointed
that I work here too.

457
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,639
- Rachel. Listen to me.

458
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,474
I told you that I needed space.

459
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,709
- What do you call
staying in a hotel?

460
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,312
- Based on this conversation,
I call it a smart move.

461
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,381
- Okay, mike, I'm sorry.

462
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,482
Where are you going?

463
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,317
- Get some air.

464
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,491
- Wow.

465
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,526
They hire you back after helping
them break the law,

466
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,195
And this is
what they give you for lunch?

467
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,530
- You wouldn't ask that if you'd
ever had one of these bagels.

468
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,766
- Maybe not,
but let me ask you this.

469
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:05,436
You remember that game show
called let's make a deal?

470
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,671
- Not interested.

471
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,239
- You haven't heard
what's in it for you.

472
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,840
- I don't need to hear
what's in it for me because I

473
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,243
Know what's in it for you.

474
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,511
- You're a smart kid.

475
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:14,779
I see why they wanted you back.

476
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,314
- I'm gonna get back
to my bagel, which is gonna

477
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,250
Taste so much better
when I'm not looking at you.

478
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:23,321
- All right, before you gobble
that up, think about this.

479
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,990
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna get those files,

480
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,992
But there's nothing to stop you
from giving them to me

481
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,727
All on your own.

482
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,329
If you do that,

483
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,598
Any of those files
that say "mike ross,"

484
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,868
I'll replace with "anonymous
former employee."

485
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,903
- That would be tempting, sean,

486
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,706
If I actually had something
to hide.

487
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,615
- Oh, I do have
one more question, though.

488
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,451
Is harvey footing the bill?
- What?

489
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,320
- For your room
at the soho grand.

490
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,422
That's where you're staying,
right?

491
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,557
You should try the cobb salad.

492
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,593
It's out of this world.

493
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,999
- Guess who just got
propositioned

494
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,700
By a striking blonde?

495
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,902
- Please tell me
it was kate upton.

496
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,337
- Isn't she a little young
for you?

497
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,006
- Last night, she told me
I was the perfect age.

498
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,540
- To be her father.

499
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,342
- When are you gonna understand
they all want a daddy, mike?

500
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,644
- You want to talk about cahill
or just

501
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,479
Keep bragging about things
that never actually happened.

502
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,714
- What did cahill want?
- It's not what we wanted.

503
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:24,982
It's what he gave me.

504
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,317
- Well, let's have it.

505
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,752
- Son of a bitch
knew I was staying at a hotel.

506
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:28,986
- What are you getting at?
- Didn't you say

507
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,022
He sidestepped judge hopkins
to get a search warrant

508
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,390
For our files?

509
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,958
- You're thinking
he went around hopkins

510
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,426
To get authorization
to follow us?

511
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,728
- I'm thinking he never
got authorization at all.

512
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,030
- Then we need to get a list

513
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:41,599
Of the sec's requests
for surveillance by tomorrow.

514
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,334
- I have a friend at justice.

515
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,902
- Since when?

516
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,804
- Okay, I don't,
but I thought it sounded cool.

517
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,606
- Mike, this is serious.

518
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,541
We need that list,
and we need it by tomorrow.

519
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,510
- On it.

520
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,452
- Good new, louis.

521
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:05,856
I not only misfiled
and misdated that document,

522
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,959
I added in 10,000 others
that look just like it.

523
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,862
That thing is as buried
as it's ever going to be.

524
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,566
It's all for nothing.

525
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,669
- What happened with forstman?
- What do you think?

526
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,004
He didn't go for it.

527
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,574
- No, something else happened
because you wouldn't

528
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,776
Be this upset
if he just turned you down.

529
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,845
- He wouldn't undo anything,

530
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,948
But he is willing to let me pin
the whole thing on harvey.

531
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,583
- How could you even do that?

532
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:33,684
- Oh, I don't know.

533
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,387
Make up a new document,
forge his signature.

534
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,955
Doesn't matter 'cause
I'm not gonna do it.

535
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,725
- Louis--
- katrina, enough.

536
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,493
You did good work,

537
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:45,363
But the truth is, if we
have to turn over those files,

538
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,430
They find that transaction.

539
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm gonna end up in prison.

540
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,040
- Then you and I better

541
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,643
Figure out a way to make sure
harvey wins that motion.

542
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,817
- Okay.

543
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,088
- Don't you have a funny way

544
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,090
Of giving someone space.
- What?

545
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,993
- Not only did you do exactly
what we talked about not doing

546
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,896
But you lied, and you
used harvey's name to do it.

547
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,831
- I am sorry.
- No, sorry's not good enough.

548
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,667
This is the second time we've
had this conversation recently,

549
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:27,138
And I want to know why the hell
we're having it again.

550
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,806
- I didn't mean to lie.

551
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,941
I just--I went to mike to talk--

552
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,476
- That's my point.

553
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,878
You couldn't even make it
through one day?

554
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,079
- I thought that I could.

555
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,715
And then, I saw
him sitting there, and I just--

556
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,417
- Rachel, just because
something's hard to do

557
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,851
Doesn't mean
that you can't do it.

558
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,820
- Okay. I shouldn't have
brought harvey into it,

559
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:45,423
But I am not going to apologize
for talking to mike

560
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,658
Because he and I aren't the same
as you and harvey.

561
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,527
- Excuse me?

562
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,529
- That didn't come out that I--
- I did not tell you

563
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,164
That for you to just
throw it back in my face.

564
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,965
- I didn't mean
to throw it in your face.

565
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:59,170
I respect that you let things
take their natural course,

566
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:03,040
But I want to make things work
with mike,

567
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:07,144
And the only way I know how
to do that is to fight for him.

568
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,146
- Fight for him all you want,

569
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,015
But don't lie about harvey
ever again.

570
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,843
- You missing it in here
already?

571
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:41,645
- Just passing through.

572
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,180
- I lied to you.
- I know you lied to me--

573
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:46,050
- Not that.

574
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:50,754
Harvey never assigned me
to your case.

575
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,624
I did it
because you left our home,

576
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,159
And you came here.

577
00:24:55,161 --> 00:25:00,164
And all I can think every time
I look at you is how sorry I am.

578
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,739
- And the reason
I want you to leave me alone

579
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:13,210
Is all I can think
when I look at you is him.

580
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,649
- Then why did you come back?

581
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:22,186
- I was drowning,
and louis threw me a lifeline.

582
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,522
- I'm your lifeline, too.

583
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,757
- A lifeline? You're the one
that threw me overboard.

584
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,727
- Mike--
- and why did it have to be him?

585
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,800
I don't need you to keep
telling me that you're sorry

586
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,770
Or to be charming
or anything else.

587
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:46,210
I just need to get that image
out of my head.

588
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,803
- Did you get it?
- No.

589
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,672
- A little heads
up would have been nice.

590
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,240
I don't exactly
have a backup plan.

591
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,709
- Well, good thing I do.
- What are you talking about?

592
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,779
- It doesn't matter whether we
have proof of our theory or not.

593
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:24,048
It just matters whether or not
our theory is true.

594
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,149
- You typed up a fake list.

595
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,917
- Exactly.
Brilliant.

596
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,118
- It would have
been a little more brilliant

597
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,787
If you didn't get here
at the last second.

598
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,156
- It wouldn't work if it doesn't
look real, and that takes time.

599
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,591
- Okay, just give it to me.

600
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,359
- I got it.

601
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,733
- Oh, well, well.

602
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:43,968
If it isn't the wonder twins.

603
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,970
Form of "douche bag."

604
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,938
- Shape of "got you
by the balls."

605
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,306
- No, no, no, no.
It's got to be an animal.

606
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,208
- I don't care
what it has to be.

607
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,011
What that is,
is every surveillance request

608
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,879
From the sec
in the last three months.

609
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,247
Mike, why don't you tell him
what's on there?

610
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,184
- Oh, he knows what's on there
and what's not on there,

611
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,620
Which would be me and you.

612
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,388
- Wait a second,
doesn't that make any evidence

613
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,123
He's planning on using today
inadmissible?

614
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,993
- I believe it would.

615
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:11,195
- Save yourself
the embarrassment, sean.

616
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,797
Withdraw your request
for a warrant, a subpoena,

617
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,932
Or anything.

618
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,735
- All right.
Let's get this thing going.

619
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,970
What are you two doing
at his table?

620
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,774
- You want to tell him
or should we?

621
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,644
- Your honor, I am formally
withdrawing my request

622
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,945
To go through their files.

623
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,847
- Then, why are we all here?

624
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,682
- Because I want it to be
on the record

625
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,417
That logan sanders requests

626
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,219
The release
of all communications

627
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,755
Between these two gentlemen
on his behalf.

628
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,323
- What?
- You heard me.

629
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,726
- Your honor, how do we know
that signature isn't fabricated?

630
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:43,794
- Go ahead.

631
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,663
Give mr. Sanders a call.

632
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:49,199
He'll tell you it's true.

633
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,101
Because unlike you,
he was more than happy

634
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:55,973
To sign the request
in exchange for immunity.

635
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:59,043
- Pending verification
of this signature,

636
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:03,147
You are to give him everything
he asks for immediately.

637
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:06,684
- Your honor.

638
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,186
I told you I'd get those files
sooner or later.

639
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,156
Guess it's gonna be sooner.

640
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,130
- What's that?

641
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,399
- It's 50 different ways we can
stop sean cahill in his tracks.

642
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,101
- Why did you--
- I told you.

643
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,403
An attack on one of us
is an attack on all of us.

644
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,806
Harvey is my brother, and if
cahill's coming after him,

645
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:31,041
He is coming after me.
- Louis, it doesn't matter.

646
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,409
There's nothing
we can do about it.

647
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:35,212
- Logan sanders cut a deal
with cahill.

648
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,214
We have to release
all communications

649
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,817
Between me and harvey on gillis.

650
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,218
- Just between you and harvey?
That's it?

651
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,219
None of the forstman stuff?

652
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,487
- That's it.

653
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,055
- Thank god.
We're in the clear.

654
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,091
- Louis, one second ago, you
said that an attack on harvey

655
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,459
Was an attack on you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

656
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:51,495
- But that doesn't make
it a good thing.

657
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,963
- Doesn't it?
- What are you--

658
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:55,065
- Mike, did you
collude with harvey or not?

659
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,934
- Of course I didn't.
- That's exactly my point,

660
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,903
So as far as I'm concerned,
this matter is done.

661
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,015
Guess what this is?

662
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,017
- Louis, I was never really
a star trek fan.

663
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,322
- It's the resting heart rate
of a happy man.

664
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,823
- It's over?

665
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,325
- We're sending them files,

666
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,228
But we're not sending
them our files.

667
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,496
- I don't understand.

668
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:28,298
- Logan sanders signed a deal,

669
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,234
Blah, blah, blah.

670
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:33,170
They're not getting
the forstman document.

671
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:35,005
- And that's the end?

672
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,508
- That's the end.
- Congratulations, louis.

673
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,079
- Thank you, katrina.

674
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,547
You know what,

675
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,115
Why don't take the rest
of the day off and check out

676
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:49,119
- Thank you, louis,
though I may do something else.

677
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,287
- Suit yourself,
but I'm telling you right now.

678
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,222
It's a game changer.

679
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,191
They--

680
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,168
- Am I to understand
logan sanders waived privilege?

681
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,136
- Yeah, it's his right.
- Goddamn it, harvey.

682
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,539
You never should have cut
that man loose as a client.

683
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,008
- Well, I cut him loose because
I knew he was the kind of person

684
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,309
Who would do what he just did.

685
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,077
- Bullsh--.
You cut him loose

686
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,079
Because you knew mike ross
was coming back here.

687
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,114
- Well, you're damn right I did.

688
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,515
I'm not gonna apologize for it.

689
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,517
- You should have
discussed it with me first.

690
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,954
- Well, it's easier to ask
for forgiveness than permission.

691
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,489
- Forgiveness?

692
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,424
You just said you're not
going to apologize for it.

693
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,160
- You know what? I'm not because
I don't want to hear a lecture

694
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,095
On the amount of billings
his company brought in.

695
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:35,365
- You mean the $20 million
going back over two decades.

696
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,234
- I don't give a sh--
if it's $100 million.

697
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,570
You want to have it
out over which clients we keep,

698
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:40,838
I'm happy to.

699
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,406
But in this case,
I made a call,

700
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,007
And you're either gonna back
me or you're not.

701
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,509
- We need to stop fighting.

702
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,844
- Excuse me?

703
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,245
- We're not fighting.
- Yes, we are.

704
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,613
- I'm not talking about you two.

705
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,015
- Then what the hell
are you talking about?

706
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,617
- Cahill.

707
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,918
- You want us to give in?

708
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,488
- No. I'm saying
he wants all the files,

709
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,525
Let's give him all the files.

710
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,110
- Rachel,
what are you doing here?

711
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,411
I told you needed some time.

712
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,114
- And then you told me that you
needed to get that image

713
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,649
Out of your head.
- Which is why I need--

714
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:29,620
- No.
No, it isn't

715
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:33,590
Because you'll never completely
get it out of your head.

716
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:39,930
- Tess.
- Yes, tess.

717
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,465
And my image isn't made up,

718
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:46,503
And it wasn't of two people
kissing.

719
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,605
But I got over it
without getting rid of it

720
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:52,442
Because forgiveness
doesn't work that way.

721
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,412
- You knew how I felt about him.

722
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,682
You knew what it would do to me,

723
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,250
And you did it anyway.

724
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,220
- And I told you
I made a mistake.

725
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,358
- What do you want from me,
rachel?

726
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,261
- I want you to decide

727
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:16,133
If you love me
more than you hate what I did.

728
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:20,971
And if you don't,

729
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,539
Then I want you to tell me
that it's over.

730
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:27,244
And if you do,
then I want you to come home.

731
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,103
- Afternoon, sean.
- Well, you're in a good mood

732
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,604
For a man who keeps getting
his ass kicked.

733
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,274
- Well, at a certain point,
you get tired of fighting.

734
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,275
- Well, I wouldn't know,

735
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:59,576
But after this,
we can grab a beer,

736
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:03,547
And you can tell me
what it's like to be a loser.

737
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:04,982
Your honor.

738
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,149
- Mr. Specter,

739
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,119
You better be here
to hand over your clients files.

740
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:11,054
- I'm here to do more than that.

741
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,457
We're handing
over all of the files

742
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,258
In the gillis industries
takeover,

743
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,095
But I want the court to catalog
every piece of paper

744
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:20,664
In there so sean doesn't "find
one" that was never there

745
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,366
In the first place.

746
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:26,169
- Isn't this what you were
arguing against from day one?

747
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,772
- We changed our minds
because we have nothing to hide.

748
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,574
- No, no.
This is a ploy.

749
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:33,243
He's trying to get me on record
stating that we have everything,

750
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,778
And if I find nothing,

751
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,280
He's gonna file
malicious prosecution charges.

752
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,517
- Actually, sean, I'm filing
those charges right now.

753
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,320
And when you don't find anything
in the contents

754
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,422
Of everything you ever asked
for, this bullsh--

755
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,157
Search becomes exhibit a.

756
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,559
- Your honor, he has no basis
to file that action.

757
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,294
- I can't stop the man
from giving you

758
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:55,399
Exactly what you were in here
asking me for two days ago.

759
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:59,169
Now, are you gonna proceed under
threat the malicious prosecution

760
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:02,339
Or not?

761
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:03,673
- What's the matter, sean?

762
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,076
Afraid you won't find anything?

763
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,778
- Just give me the files.

764
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,084
- You wanted to see me?

765
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:17,554
- I wanted to give credit
where credit is due.

766
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,755
- Cahill went for it.

767
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,557
- Yes,

768
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,161
And when he finds nothing,
we'll be done with him.

769
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,295
Good job.

770
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:28,665
- Thank you.

771
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,601
And thank you
for taking me back,

772
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,370
Especially since I know
you didn't want to.

773
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,539
- Would you have wanted
to if you were me?

774
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,774
- I did just come up
with that fix.

775
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:43,113
- A fix for cahill coming after
you for colluding with harvey?

776
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:48,218
A problem I never would have had
if I'd never met you.

777
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,586
- Why'd you call me down here?

778
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,556
- I want to know
why the hell you came back.

779
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,827
- You know, it's funny. If you'd
asked me that this morning,

780
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:59,296
I would have said because I had
no place else to go.

781
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,598
- I didn't ask you this morning.

782
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,734
I'm asking you now.

783
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,839
- Then it doesn't matter
why I came back.

784
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:12,142
What matters is that I'm staying

785
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:15,112
Because this is where I belong.

786
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,556
- Hey, just the person
I was looking for.

787
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,625
- You heard?
- I heard that I just

788
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,727
Booked a plane ticket
to boston to surprise sheila,

789
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,562
And I need you to cover
the mcbain hearing tomorrow.

790
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:37,167
- Louis, the mcbain hearing
is the least of our worries.

791
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,702
- What do you mean?

792
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:41,438
- Harvey went to court
this morning and agreed to hand

793
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,441
Over every single document
on the gillis takeover,

794
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,742
Including forstman.

795
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,612
- What?
Why would--

796
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,748
- Because he thinks
we have nothing to hide.

797
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,886
- Sh--.
Then it's only a matter of time

798
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,420
Before I'm marched
out of here in handcuffs.

799
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,588
- I'm not gonna
let it come to that.

800
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,423
- Oh, how the hell
are you gonna stop it?

801
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:04,427
- By replacing one document
with another.

802
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,329
- I am not framing harvey.

803
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,266
- This isn't framing harvey.

804
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:11,701
It's freeing you.
- What are you talking about?

805
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,436
- This makes it look
like forstman's payment never

806
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,505
Went to any offshore accounts

807
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,873
And that you never took a piece
of it.

808
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,743
- No, that's forgery.

809
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:25,549
- Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

810
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:26,917
- I didn't ask you to do this.

811
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,586
- Then don't use it,

812
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,855
But you're the one who said that
if we give them those files,

813
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,924
It's only a matter of time.

814
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:37,794
Louis, cahill's looking for dirt
on harvey and mike,

815
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,796
Not you and forstman.

816
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,565
He won't even give this
a second glance.

817
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,466
- But if he does,
it puts harvey in jeopardy,

818
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:48,405
And I might as well frame him
just like forstman wanted me to.

819
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,540
- Then you have a decision
to make because they're turning

820
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,510
Everything over
first thing tomorrow.

821
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:14,464
- Louis, is everything okay?

822
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:17,434
- Yeah, everything's fine, mike.

823
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,581
- Donna?

824
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,383
- What can I do for you, harvey?

825
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,285
- Everything taken care of
for the file transfer tomorrow?

826
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,520
- It was taken care of 20
minutes before you asked for it.

827
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,689
- Great. Here's howard, miller,
and klein.

828
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,324
I'd like to get a jump
on these right now.

829
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,293
- Oh, it's late, harvey.
We've had a long day.

830
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,694
Maybe we can just--
- come on.

831
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:47,030
We can order from that sh--y
thai place you love.

832
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,732
Knock this out in two hours.

833
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,335
- Is that an order or a request?
- What are you--

834
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:53,803
- I have a date tonight, harvey,

835
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:57,040
So unless you think we're gonna
lose howard, miller, or klein,

836
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,009
I'm leaving.

837
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,380
- Have a good night.

838
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:06,483
- Thanks, harvey.

839
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:07,517
- Don't forget to use
protection--

840
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,652
- Stop right there.

841
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,453
- Oh, so when I go out
with someone,

842
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,455
You can give me all the sh--
in the world, but when you do--

843
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,858
- Yep. That's exactly
how it works.

844
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,729
Get used to it.

845
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,865
- What's wrong with you? You
look like you just saw a ghost.

846
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,466
- I feel like I did.

847
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,335
I think we have a problem.
- What do you mean?

848
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,503
We just took step number one

849
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,405
To finally putting
this cahill bullsh-- behind us.

850
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,874
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I don't think it is behind us.

851
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,443
- What?
- I don't know what louis did,

852
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,878
But I think
he did something wrong.

853
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,379
- What are you talking about?

854
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,548
- When he came to me yesterday,
he was chomping at the bit

855
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,450
To help fight cahill.
- That's louis.

856
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,352
He'd take a bullet for
this firm, you know that.

857
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,788
- Then why did he immediately
change his tune after I told him

858
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,791
That logan was only
releasing our communications?

859
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:48,825
- He seemed relieved?

860
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,493
- He seemed ecstatic,

861
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,862
And before that, he was pissed
that I was working on your stuff

862
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,598
Until he found out
it was to fight cahill.

863
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,767
- What exactly are you
thinking he might have done?

864
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,069
- I don't know exactly,

865
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:04,007
But I think he cut some sort
of deal with forstman.

866
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,041
- He did cut a deal
with forstman.

867
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,509
- I'm talking about
an illegal deal.

868
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,945
- Mike,
I know forstman's a snake,

869
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,547
But this is louis
you're talking about.

870
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,615
- I know, but you weren't there
when he made me that offer.

871
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,351
I'd never seen him like that.

872
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:17,487
He was desperate to keep me
from working for "that man."

873
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,722
- Mike--
- and then on top of that,

874
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:21,057
I found out what he gave up
to get me back here.

875
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,860
- Sheila.

876
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,864
But why would he care about us
handling over everything

877
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,700
If he didn't care about
the communications between us?

878
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,869
- Because if he did make
a dirty deal with forstman,

879
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,637
It wouldn't have been
in those documents.

880
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,041
It would have been
in the other documents.

881
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,776
- The documents
we just told the court

882
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,579
We're happy to turn over.

883
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,147
- What are you gonna do?

884
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:46,716
- I'm gonna find out
what the hell louis did.

885
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,754
- Go home, mike.

886
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,723
There's nothing
you can do tonight.

887
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:56,679
- I made a huge mistake.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
