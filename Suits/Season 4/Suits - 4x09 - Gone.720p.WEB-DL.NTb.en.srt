1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:06,071
- I want you to decide if you
love me more than you hate

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:11,043
What I did, and if you do,
then I want you to come home.

3
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,778
- The only they'll definitely
find if they get a look at

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,713
Those files,
is that you embezzled money.

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,317
- Listen to me, god damn it.
We need to undo this deal.

6
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,719
- We have nothing to hide.
- No, no, this is a ploy.

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,122
He's trying to get me on
record stating that we have

8
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,257
Everything,
and if I find nothing,

9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,626
He's gonna file malicious
prosecution charges.

10
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,796
- Actually, sean, I'm filing
those charges right now.

11
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,398
- Harvey went to court
this morning,

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,767
And agreed to hand over
every single document

13
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:38,070
On the gillis takeover,
including forstman.

14
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:41,040
- Sh--!

15
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,508
Then it's only a matter of time

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,176
Before I'm marched
out of here in handcuffs.

17
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,677
- If he did make
a dirty deal with forstman,

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,379
It wouldn't have been
in those documents.

19
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,647
It would've been in--
- the documents

20
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,582
We just told the court
we're happy to turn over.

21
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,750
- What are you going to do?

22
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:55,187
- I'm gonna find out
what the hell louis did.

23
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,824
- I made a huge mistake.

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,100
- What's going on?

25
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,468
- Louis, I want you
to tell harvey

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,570
Exactly what you just told me,
or I will.

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,805
- He doesn't have to.

28
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,473
He made a dirty deal
with forstman.

29
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,308
- Harvey, I can explain.

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,709
- Explain what, that you
put the firm in jeopardy

31
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,311
All because you had
to be the hero?

32
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,579
- I didn't do it
to be the hero.

33
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,713
I didn't even know

34
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,182
I was gonna do it at all.
- What?

35
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,185
- The deal was closed, and
you were so happy we won.

36
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:29,154
Then I went back that night,
forstman said if I didn't

37
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,223
Funnel the money overseas,
the deal was off,

38
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,325
So I did it.

39
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,229
- There's more.

40
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,531
<i>- How do you know
there's more?</i>

41
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,401
- Because with forstman
there's always more.

42
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,874
- He made me take a million
dollars out of the deal

43
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:52,411
So I couldn't turn on him later.

44
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,780
- Jesus christ.
- I had no choice!

45
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,381
- Bullsh--,
you had no choice!

46
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,383
You could've said no at any
goddamn point along the way,

47
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,853
But you didn't, because all
you cared about was yourself.

48
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,521
- Okay, if I care
about myself so much,

49
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,656
How come I'm in here telling
you that I'm gonna confess?

50
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,891
- You want to confess?
Be my guest!

51
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,795
- Harvey, that's enough.

52
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:15,434
Louis...The problem with
that is that we're innocent.

53
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,270
Cahill's plan is to throw mud
against the wall

54
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,304
And see what sticks.

55
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,173
You tell him
about what you did,

56
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,576
And all of a sudden,
everything sticks.

57
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,845
- Okay.

58
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,814
But I have to do something
to help.

59
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:33,285
- You will,
when the time comes.

60
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,621
Right now, I need
to talk to harvey.

61
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,799
- I can't believe
you're taking this

62
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,834
As well as you are.

63
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,335
- I'm not taking
this well at all.

64
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,771
- Then what the hell are
you being so nice to him for?

65
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,439
- Did you hear?

66
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,607
He was going to confess.

67
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,276
I had to calm him down.

68
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,178
- So you're not
gonna stand by him?

69
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,579
- Stand by him?

70
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,914
The second this
thing is over,

71
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,584
I'm gonna fire
his goddamn ass.

72
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,189
- How was your shower?

73
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,423
- It was great.

74
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,958
Rachel, you don't
have to clean up for me.

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,426
I live here.

76
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,763
- I know, I just...I want
everything to be perfect.

77
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:21,433
- It is.

78
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,602
Is this my parents'
photo album?

79
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,939
- Oh, yeah, it was in
the back of the closet.

80
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,975
- Yeah, I know where it was.
Why is it out here?

81
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:36,248
- Because I was looking for
pictures of you.

82
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,720
What do you want to do
for dinner tonight?

83
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,754
- I was thinking
maybe we could hit

84
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,389
That little mexican spot.

85
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,592
- No. You just got back here.

86
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,893
I don't want to go anywhere.

87
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,562
- I don't either, but we
don't have anything to eat.

88
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,297
- Don't we?
- Well, I know for a fact

89
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,299
We don't have any bean
and cheese burritos.

90
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,867
- Mm, then why are there
six of them in the fridge

91
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,837
Right now?

92
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,546
- You hate them.

93
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,449
- I do, but you love them,
and I wanted you

94
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,285
To have them here
when you came home.

95
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,320
- And what if I
didn't come home tonight?

96
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:19,725
- Then I would have bought
fresh ones again tomorrow.

97
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,828
- Thanks, rachel.

98
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,264
- It's good to have you home.

99
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:29,334
- It's good to be home.

100
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,375
- What happened?

101
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,443
- I thought you had a date.

102
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,479
- I canceled it,
and I asked you a question.

103
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,647
- I don't want
to talk about it,

104
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,948
Because I know what
you're going to say.

105
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,850
- Harvey, I don't even
know what exactly louis did.

106
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,885
- He broke the law
to close forstman.

107
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,655
- He broke it or forstman
made him break it?

108
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,391
- You don't have to say
it, donna,

109
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,625
I've heard
it a thousand times.

110
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,460
Louis only did this
to get my approval.

111
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,329
And you know what,
I don't give a sh--

112
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,730
That I agreed to be
his best man.

113
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,866
He put you, me, and every one
of us in jeopardy

114
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,000
To get what he wanted.

115
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,568
- Well, I was
gonna say that,

116
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,803
But instead I'll say this:

117
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,471
You put us all
in jeopardy too.

118
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,939
- When the hell
did I do that?

119
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,442
- The day you hired mike,
and by the way,

120
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,077
I'm guessing he wouldn't
even be back here

121
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,812
If louis hadn't done
what he did.

122
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,615
- Then tell that to jessica,
'cause when it's over,

123
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,685
She's gonna fire him.

124
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,026
They keep this
place open late for you?

125
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,861
- Ownership
has its privileges.

126
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,398
What do you want, harvey?

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,966
- I want you to undo
the dirty deal you made

128
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,368
With louis litt.

129
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,870
- Dirty deal.
Doesn't sound like me at all.

130
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,739
- How does prison sound?

131
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,674
Because the s.E.C.
Is gonna get a record

132
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,543
Of the sh-- you pulled
tomorrow morning.

133
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:48,080
- There is no record,
'cause I didn't do anything.

134
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,781
Louis litt came to me,

135
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,883
And he's the one
who embezzled money.

136
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,852
- And your grudge
isn't with louis.

137
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,556
It's with me, so let him go.

138
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,124
<i>Live to fight me another day.</i>

139
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:03,962
- If I let him off,
I let you off,

140
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,831
And I don't think
I want to do that.

141
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,533
- Then you're forcing me to
turn you in for what you did

142
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,770
12 years ago.

143
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,773
- No way.
You're not gonna do that,

144
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,641
Because you did it too, pal.

145
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,478
- You're right, I did.
But if you did it to louis

146
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,814
And you did it to me, you
did it to a hundred others.

147
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,950
And if you don't
do what I'm asking,

148
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,985
I'll just have to find
the one in a hundred

149
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,887
That's in a position
to turn on you.

150
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,156
- I'll take my chances, harvey.

151
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,058
Now, get out of my face.

152
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,495
Let me finish my cigar in peace.

153
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,835
- ♪ see the money,

154

- You know?
- Of course I do.

163
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,974
- I never meant to--
- louis...

164
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,477
I understand why you did
what you did.

165
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,480
- You do?
- Yes. You went down a path

166
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,681
With the best intentions,

167
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,616
And then it just got
worse and worse

168
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,618
Until it was too late.

169
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,989
- Feel like sh--.
- And you should.

170
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,592
- What?

171
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,961
But you just said--
- I understand? I do.

172
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,197
But I don't think you
understand that every

173
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,699
Other time you screwed up,
it was a mistake,

174
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,901
And this time,
it was a choice!

175
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,036
- That's what harvey said.

176
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,137
- Of course
that's what harvey said.

177
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,638
And just because I get
what happened,

178
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,775
So if you've come
in here to ask me

179
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,610
To go to him for
the millionth time, I'm--

180
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,078
- No, I'm not here for that.

181
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,013
- Then--then what
are you here for?

182
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:06,117
- I'm here to ask you
if I'm gonna get fired.

183
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,152
- What?

184
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,820
- I saw how he looked
at me, donna.

185
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,222
I know he trusts you,

186
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:15,494
But I need to know if harvey's
planning on firing me.

187
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,928
- No, louis.

188
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,497
To my knowledge,

189
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:23,869
Harvey isn't planning
to fire you.

190
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,872
- Thank you, donna.

191
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,841
I knew I could count on you.

192
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,719
<i>- Can't remember the last time
I saw you in here.</i>

193
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,755
- I can't remember the last time
this firm faced prosecution.

194
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,790
- I can: Ava hessington.

195
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,859
To this again.

196
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,060
How the hell did it?

197
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,829
- We stepped into the ring
with charles forstman.

198
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,864
- I'm guessing he didn't
budge last night.

199
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,266
- He didn't.

200
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,568
He sheltered himself, and
he'd rather laugh in my face

201
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,938
Than be 100% protected
against the s.E.C.

202
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,139
- You have a plan "b"?

203
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,774
- He doesn't, but I do.

204
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,276
- What the hell is it?

205
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,177
- What would you do
if you were cahill?

206
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,013
- Go through every
one of these boxes,

207
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,281
And start deposing us.

208
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,783
- Okay, so what if
while he's doing that,

209
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,554
We start deposing him?

210
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,826
- Did you come here to
personally deliver my files?

211
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,795
- I came here to
personally deliver this.

212
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,230
- Well, if it's an invitation
to your birthday party,

213
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,732
I think I'm busy that day.
- That's too bad.

214
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,101
I promised the children a clown.
- You've got to be kidding me.

215
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,704
You got judge hopkins
to let you start depositions

216
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,139
On your malicious
prosecution bullsh--?

217
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,740
- He didn't think
it was bullsh--,

218
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,008
Which is why
he's letting me start

219
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,209
With your boyfriend
eric woodall.

220
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,612
- You trying to take
my eye off the ball, harvey?

221
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,913
- This is the ball, sean.

222
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,817
It's a wrecking ball,
and it's headed your way.

223
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,360
- Louis, where the hell
have you been?

224
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,295
Those documents are
on their way over.

225
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,797
- Katrina, relax.

226
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,265
- Relax?

227
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,334
The last time I saw you,
you were worried

228
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,602
About going to prison.

229
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,637
What did you decide to do?

230
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,638
- I went to harvey
and jessica,

231
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,639
And I told them everything.

232
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,907
- What?

233
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,076
- Jessica said that
I made a mistake,

234
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,844
And they're working
on a way out.

235
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,181
- Louis, have you seen
any mafia movie ever made?

236
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,916
- I'm not really
a fan of the genre.

237
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,384
I find it to be a little
offensive to italians--

238
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,952
- Shut up, and listen.

239
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,189
She's telling you to your
face she'll let you live,

240
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,258
But behind your back, she's
making plans to whack you.

241
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,327
- Holy sh--, I'm living
on borrowed time.

242
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,363
- Unless you fix this,
because if you don't,

243
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,933
Even if jessica manages
to keep you out of prison,

244
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,902
She'll be coming
to fire you.

245
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,210
- Jessica, I was just thinking

246
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,178
About our dinner plans tonight,

247
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,747
And I think that...

248
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,848
What's wrong?

249
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,216
- We're going
after eric woodall.

250
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,919
Harvey moved up the time line.

251
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,656
- And since this is
harvey's case now...

252
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,157
Why are you talking to me?

253
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,727
- 'cause I need you to find
out every dirty thing

254
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,931
Eric woodall has ever done,
condoned, or been part of.

255
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,100
- Jessica, I really
don't feel comfortable

256
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,970
Participating in blackmail
without knowing why.

257
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,105
- It's not blackmail,
it's evidence,

258
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,440
And I'll tell you why.

259
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,809
Because malicious prosecution
is easier to prove

260
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,044
When there's a track record.

261
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,745
- Yeah, there's only
one problem with that.

262
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,682
You see, just yesterday, we
agreed to hand over our files

263
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,949
Because we had nothing to hide,

264
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,185
And now, you want me
to go after the s.E.C.,

265
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,920
Which means we do.
- Jeff--

266
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,690
- Jessica, hide it
from them all you want, okay?

267
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,991
But we talked about this,
and you said

268
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,093
That I shouldn't be treated
like any other partner,

269
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,762
So don't come in here
hiding it from me.

270
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,464
- You want a straight answer.

271
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,332
I'll give you a straight answer.

272
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,102
Harvey did not collude
with mike ross,

273
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,371
But sean cahill doesn't
give a sh-- about that.

274
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,174
So I need you to do
whatever you have to

275
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,077
And get me something
on these guys.

276
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,222
- Hey, how did cahill
handle our surprise?

277
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,356
- Actually, I got
to hand it to him.

278
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,226
He handled it
pretty damn well.

279
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,894
What?
- You guys had

280
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,129
Your whole
wonder twins riff,

281
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,430
And now you're
giving him respect?

282
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,833
What's next: A time share
in the florida keys?

283
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,934
- Easy, tiger.

284
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,035
- Just saying, I got
two words for you:

285
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,337
Bro-mance.

286
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,906
- Before you order us
a gift off our registry,

287
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,108
Let me tell you
what he's been up too.

288
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,077
He had judge hopkins sign
off on his depositions,

289
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,214
Meaning he's coming at us
the same time we go after him.

290
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,182
- We can handle it.
- Can rachel?

291
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,017
- What?

292
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,786
- Take a look.

293
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,421
She's first on the list.

294
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,323
- And you want me
to tell her it's coming.

295
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,758
- I want you
to do more than that.

296
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,025
I want you to prep her.

297
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,361
- Harvey,
that's not a good idea.

298
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,230
- Yes, it is--you're
the best person for the job.

299
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,831
- I am the worst
person for the job.

300
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,966
- And you're only saying it

301
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,467
Because it makes you
feel uncomfortable.

302
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,369
How do you think cahill's
gonna make rachel feel

303
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,472
When he gets her under oath?

304
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,152
- Usually, people don't
start by washing their hands.

305
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,188
- Usually, people aren't
here to talk about louis.

306
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,358
- Donna.
- Jessica, he made a mistake.

307
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,528
- "mistake" implies that he
did something by accident.

308
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,329
Louis made a choice.

309
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,031
- And you're making
the choice to fire him

310
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,800
When this is over.

311
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,202
- And how the hell is that
any of your business?

312
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,338
- I just thought if louis
could help get you out of it--

313
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,506
- Help get me out of it?

314
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,175
He's the one
that got me into it.

315
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,276
- And if this were harvey,

316
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,811
You'd let him try
to make up for it.

317
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,179
- And if this were harvey,

318
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:37,048
I'd have the confidence
that he would.

319
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,984
- Jessica,
louis did all of this

320
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,821
Because he is dying
for your approval.

321
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,289
You never have
confidence in him,

322
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,957
And you never treat him
the way you treat harvey.

323
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,158
- So this is my fault?

324
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
- I'm saying
harvey's made mistakes,

325
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,296
And you've forgiven him.

326
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,364
I've made mistakes,
and you've forgiven me.

327
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,401
- You're right, donna,
you did make a mistake once,

328
00:13:56,403 --> 00:14:00,505
And I did forgive you,
but first I fired you.

329
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,507
And if you don't back off me
right now,

330
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,444
I will do it again.

331
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,048
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a deposition to get to.

332
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,520
- Please state your full name
for the record.

333
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,121
- Eric ignatius woodall.

334
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,524
- Ignatius?
- Like the saint.

335
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,925
- I doubt that.

336
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,061
And how long have you
worked for the s.E.C.?

337
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,095
- Two months.

338
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,263
- And where were you
before that?

339
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,365
- I worked at
the u.S. Attorneys' office.

340
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,134
- Until I got you fired
for malicious prosecution.

341
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,369
- You didn't get me fired.

342
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,605
You slandered me
to a person in power,

343
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,640
Which caused me to leave
a job I loved.

344
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,175
- To avoid getting fired.

345
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,444
- You have no proof of that,
and he has no knowledge of that.

346
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,414
- Does he have any knowledge
of his feelings towards me?

347
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,483
- I don't have any feelings
for you, mr. Specter,

348
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,386
And for your information,
I landed on my feet.

349
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,154
- Yes, we know,
at the s.E.C.,

350
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,923
But we don't want
to talk about that.

351
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,158
We want to talk
about jim pembry.

352
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,029
- You don't seem
too comfortable anymore, eric.

353
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,665
Who's jim pembry?

354
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,667
- I worked with jim
at the u.S. Attorneys' office.

355
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,469
- On the arthur cohen
prosecution?

356
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,070
- I believe he did
some work for me.

357
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,672
- You believe?
You sent him

358
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,575
Over 1,200 emails on that case
over four years.

359
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,110
- If you say so.

360
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,578
- Actually, your
computer records say so,

361
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,246
And I could read them all,

362
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,348
But I'd rather start
with my favorite.

363
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,617
"I don't care what we
get arthur cohen on.

364
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,320
"tax evasion, insider trading,
jaywalking if we have to,

365
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,522
But we're putting that
piece of sh-- behind bars."

366
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,590
- Where the hell
did you get that?

367
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,025
- It's not important
where we got it,

368
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,059
But that we got it.

369
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,127
- Emails get heated.

370
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,228
It was the middle of a case.

371
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,229
- The problem is, eric,

372
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,997
This was dated
two years before

373
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,098
You even brought
your big case.

374
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,967
- Do you have a question?
- I sure do.

375
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,335
You decide someone's guilty,

376
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,970
Then you find the crime
to fit them.

377
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,438
Isn't that true?
- No.

378
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,473
- You want me to get
you for perjury too?

379
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,375
You tried to get
arthur on one thing.

380
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,344
Instead, you got him
on another, didn't you?

381
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,012
- Don't answer him.
- Yes.

382
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,714
- And that's exactly what you
want to do with me, isn't it?

383
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:50,982
- That's enough.
Stop typing.

384
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,116
We're done here.

385
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,685
- To answer your question...
- Don't--

386
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,554
- You're damn right it is.

387
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,489
- That's okay.
It may not be on record,

388
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,527
<i>But I got what I wanted.</i>

389
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,203
- You're not my usual guy.

390
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,172
- I'm not a usual anything.

391
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,008
- No, you're not.

392
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,178
- We got him, thanks to you.

393
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,512
- Thanks to jim pembry.

394
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,982
- I'm not here to celebrate
with jim pembry.

395
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,452
Jessica, we may have
landed the first punch,

396
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,487
But we're next up.

397
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,089
And cahill's gonna
be brutal on us.

398
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,391
- No, he isn't.
- What do you mean?

399
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,692
- We're going to court
tomorrow,

400
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,995
And with any luck, we're
gonna get this whole thing

401
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,297
Tossed before he even
has a chance to depose us.

402
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,432
- Well, then, maybe
we should go to dinner.

403
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,534
- I have a better idea.

404
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,571
Let's order in.

405
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,582
- Miss zane, do you
live with michael ross,

406
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,650
The lawyer on the other
side of this takeover?

407
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,519
- Yes.

408
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,788
- And, uh, and at any point
during the takeover,

409
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,289
Did you discuss business
with him?

410
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,324
- No.

411
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,426
- You expect me
to believe that?

412
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,660
- I don't care whether
you believe it or not,

413
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,796
Because it's the truth.

414
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,533
- The truth.

415
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:21,539
Did you discuss logan sanders
with mr. Ross?

416
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,474
- Yes.
- I'm confused.

417
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,209
You just said that
you didn't discuss business

418
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,245
With mr. Ross,
yet now you're saying

419
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,547
That you discussed the man on
the other side of the takeover.

420
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,416
How can one of those be
true and not the other?

421
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:34,352
- That wasn't about business.
- Then what was it about?

422
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,355
- It was about the fact
that I used to be involved

423
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,158
With logan sanders.

424
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,659
- And did you assure mr. Ross

425
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,693
That you wouldn't
become involved

426
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,262
With logan sanders again?

427
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,329
- What does that have
to do with--

428
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,432
- Answer my question.
- Yes, I did.

429
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,133
- And yet, over the course
of the takeover,

430
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,668
You did become involved
with him again, didn't you?

431
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,236
- No, I didn't.

432
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,205
- You had no physical contact
of a sexual nature at all--

433
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,140
- Mike, please, I don't--
- just answer my question.

434
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,376
- We kissed once,
and that was it.

435
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,412
- Did you sleep with him?
- He is not going to ask me--

436
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,147
- You just lied.
You said you weren't involved,

437
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,515
And then you said
you kissed him.

438
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,750
So I'm gonna ask you again:

439
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,552
Did you sleep
with logan sanders

440
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,088
After you assured the man
that you supposedly love

441
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,622
That you wouldn't
become involved again?

442
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,157
- I'm not gonna answer that,

443
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,126
Because it doesn't have anything
to do with collusion.

444
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,394
- It goes to credibility.
It goes to

445
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,830
What you're capable of,
whether a jury should trust you.

446
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,264
- A jury or you?
- What difference

447
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,866
Does that make?
- The difference is

448
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,768
<i>You're the one that's doing it,
because you don't trust me.</i>

449
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,504
- Because harvey needs me to.
- It is vicious, and it's cruel.

450
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,738
- I am doing my job.
- Mike, I thought

451
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,308
You were over this.
- Well, I'm goddamn not!

452
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,152
- I didn't sleep with logan.

453
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:50,294
I kissed him,
and I hate myself for it.

454
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,867
Mike, I'm so sorry.

455
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,637
And I can apologize to you
every day

456
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,905
For the rest of my life,

457
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,541
But I-I...

458
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,244
I don't know what else to do,

459
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,880
Other than
to tell you that...

460
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,414
You mean more to me

461
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:15,586
Than anything in the world,
and I need you to believe me.

462
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,822
I need you to believe me
so that we can move on

463
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,825
And live our lives.

464
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,400
- Think that's enough
questions for tonight.

465
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,810
- Louis, what the
hell are you doing here?

466
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,712
- I read
the eric woodall deposition,

467
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,713
And I thought I could help.

468
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:43,915
- Help what?

469
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,483
- You're here
to shut down sean cahill,

470
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,684
And he's not gonna give up
without a fight.

471
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,252
- Louis, I don't
have time for this.

472
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,854
So take your arguments
and get the hell out of here.

473
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,922
- Please, jessica,
I want to help.

474
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,390
- I don't need your help.

475
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,824
We're about to put
this thing to bed.

476
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,894
- And I feel responsible.
- You are responsible.

477
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,963
You are the entire
reason we are in jeopardy,

478
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,233
And you want to sit your
stupid face in front of cahill?

479
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:05,303
You may as well wear a sign
that says "depose me next."

480
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,573
And if he does that, you will
tumble like a house of cards,

481
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,575
Because you are ruled
by your emotions,

482
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,511
And that is the reason
why we are in this situation

483
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:16,447
In the first place.

484
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:17,915
- Can I at least sit
in the gallery?

485
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,550
- I don't care where you sit,

486
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,851
But cahill's gonna be here
in 30 seconds,

487
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:25,289
So it better be
far away from me.

488
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,390
- What the hell
is he doing here?

489
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,558
- The important thing is

490
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,494
<i>Is that he's not sitting
here anymore.</i>

491
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,633
- Mr. Cahill, this email
makes a strong case

492
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,235
That eric woodall
has a propensity

493
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,536
For malicious prosecution.

494
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,570
- Yes, it does, your honor,

495
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,372
But I'm the one pursuing
this case,

496
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,773
Not eric woodall,

497
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,875
And I don't have a propensity
for anything.

498
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,911
I'm a simple man
trying to do my job.

499
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,513
- You expect us to believe
that the guy you came up with

500
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,850
At the department of justice
comes over to the s.E.C.,

501
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,986
And you immediately
start coming after us,

502
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,587
And it's a coincidence?

503
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,556
- Doesn't take much to connect
the dots here, your honor.

504
00:20:58,558 --> 00:20:59,924
- Well, as long as
we're connecting dots,

505
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,592
I can connect a few too.

506
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,760
Let's start with jeff malone.

507
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,428
A man who used to work
at the s.E.C.

508
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,831
Now conveniently works
at pearson specter.

509
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,566
- It's not against
the law to change jobs.

510
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,434
- Yes, but why
did he change jobs?

511
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,303
- Because he was instructed
to come after us

512
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,804
On behalf of the s.E.C.

513
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,972
- So he says.

514
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,307
I think it's because
he wanted to work

515
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,910
With his girlfriend
jessica pearson.

516
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,312
- Excuse me?

517
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,580
- Ms. Pearson hired mr. Malone,

518
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:24,448
Because if you're planning
to break some rules,

519
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,883
You need someone
to navigate them for you.

520
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,318
Who better to do that
than your boyfriend

521
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,352
Who works at the s.E.C.?

522
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:29,887
- That's ridiculous.

523
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,522
- Do you have any proof
of this allegation?

524
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,425
- Right here.

525
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,460
I can call you
up to the stand,

526
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:40,331
Or we can do this right now.

527
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,334
Were you seeing jeff malone

528
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:46,971
During the time
that he worked for the s.E.C.?

529
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,079
Please let the record reflect
ms. Pearson said yes.

530
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,747
- Well, a romantic relationship
isn't proof

531
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,450
Of a conspiracy,
but it's not irrelevant.

532
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,786
I'll allow you to move
forward with depositions.

533
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,956
- I don't care
what we have to do.

534
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,992
I'm not losing
to that son of a bitch.

535
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,098
- Despite what we just proved,
you're not losing to him,

536
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,433
You're losing to me.

537
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,601
And as far
as depositions go,

538
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,604
Now it's our turn.

539
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,582
- Louis.

540
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,984
Is there something
I can help you with?

541
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,988
- I was just thinking
things were so much simpler

542
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,123
When I was in here.

543
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,525
- Yeah, louis...

544
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,728
- I know about you and jessica.

545
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,829
- What?

546
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,131
- It came out in court.

547
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:50,568
See, I thought you were
using me to get ahead,

548
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,904
When you really just wanted
to spend more time with jessica.

549
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,674
- What are you doin'
in here, louis?

550
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,743
- I'm here to apologize.

551
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:01,078
You wanted to be my friend,
and I rejected you

552
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,749
Because you were
trying to protect her.

553
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:08,719
You must've felt so alone.

554
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,887
And believe me,

555
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,757
I know what it's like
to feel alone.

556
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,559
- You're not alone.
- Oh, I am.

557
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,995
Jessica said that I'm
responsible for everything

558
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,831
That's happening,
and she was right.

559
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,601
No one made me make that
dirty deal with forstman,

560
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:24,902
And now she won't forgive me.

561
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,139
I'm alone.

562
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,875
- And you want me to
talk to her for you.

563
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:34,645
- You're the only
one I can go to, jeff.

564
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:38,082
And you're
the closest person she has.

565
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,752
- Sure, louis.

566
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,755
I'll talk to jessica
for you.

567
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:52,863
- Hey.

568
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:53,964
- Hey.

569
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,466
- You're off the hook
with cahill.

570
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:58,135
He's gonna start with me
and harvey in the morning.

571
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,470
- Am I?

572
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:02,473
- Are you what?
- Off the hook.

573
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:06,544
- Rachel...

574
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,780
I didn't mean
for what happened to happen.

575
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,883
- But it did.
- I know.

576
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,187
- Mike--
- I still haven't gotten

577
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,522
A full night's sleep
since you told me.

578
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:22,026
- I know that you're
not completely over it.

579
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,163
But things are gonna
come up, and I--

580
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,934
- Want me to not be
vicious and cruel.

581
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,636
- Do you think
that's possible?

582
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,839
- I hope so.

583
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,875
- I hope so too.

584
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,947
If it means anything,

585
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,715
I haven't gotten
a good night's sleep

586
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:48,486
Since any of this
happened either.

587
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,989
- Maybe we can both
give it a shot tonight.

588
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,867
- Let's start with one
for you, mr. Ross.

589
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:07,771
Were you on good terms
with him when you left?

590
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,807
- Yes.
- Oh.

591
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,041
Well, then, why weren't
you representing him

592
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,910
On the gillis industries
takeover?

593
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,178
- Because he wasn't
technically our client

594
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,713
At the time.

595
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,114
- Well, if you're
on such good terms,

596
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,115
Why wasn't he a client?

597
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,985
- Because sometimes
brothers fight.

598
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,988
- And sometimes
they pretend to fight.

599
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,556
- What are you getting at?

600
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,558
- I'm getting at the fact
that you supposedly

601
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,859
Were fighting when
this thing started,

602
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,562
Yet you claim that you
weren't fighting when it ended.

603
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,297
- Who says we weren't
fighting when it ended?

604
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,999
- You did,
when you hired him back.

605
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,868
- Yeah, and the cowboys
signed deion sanders,

606
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,903
Even though they were rivals.

607
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,204
You want to know why?

608
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,772
'cause he was awesome,
and they were tired of him

609
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,307
Intercepting their passes.

610
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,142
- He didn't intercept passes
for you.

611
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,210
He fumbled the ball.

612
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,811
- Bullsh--. He hit
it out of the park.

613
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,313
- What park are
you playing at?

614
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,917
He sides with walter gillis,
buys a ton of shares,

615
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,051
Then ditches poor walter,

616
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,753
And then walks away
from the whole thing.

617
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,621
Why would you even want
a guy like this on your team?

618
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:58,923
What am I missing?

619
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,758
- You're missing the fact
that he kicked ass

620
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,761
His first time out, and anybody
would be lucky to have him.

621
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,863
- Then why didn't
anybody take him?

622
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,097
- What?

623
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,567
- I checked with every
major law firm in the city,

624
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,769
And not one of them
received a resume from you.

625
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,338
Why is that?
Because it's clear as day.

626
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,874
You're hiding something,
and I'll tell you what it is.

627
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,176
It's because you always
knew that he was coming back

628
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,912
Because you and he were in
this together the whole time.

629
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,081
- The problem with your
theory is neither one of us

630
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,916
Got a nickel from
this alleged collusion,

631
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,318
And you've got
no proof we did.

632
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,655
Because it doesn't exist.

633
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,624
- So you're both insisting
that neither one of you

634
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,892
Got any money?

635
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,926
- Damn right.

636
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,196
- That tells me
that someone else did.

637
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,667
Thank you, gentlemen.

638
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,903
I believe you showed me where
I should focus my manpower.

639
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:49,039
Somewhere in those files
there's a payment

640
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,909
From somewhere to someone,
and I'm gonna find it,

641
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:55,045
Because you can't hide
money from the s.E.C.

642
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,656
- Son of a bitch.

643
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,858
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

644
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,127
- About louis making
a dirty deal with forstman.

645
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,730
- He told you.
- He thought I already knew.

646
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,665
He found out
we were together,

647
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,234
And unlike you, he assumed
that people in relationships

648
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,235
Share sh-- like that.

649
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,371
- Goddamn ticking time bomb.

650
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,640
- Do you hear yourself?

651
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:25,009
I'm coming to you with
a problem between you and me,

652
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,910
And you're focused on louis.

653
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,046
- I'm focused on louis
because right now his actions

654
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:30,314
Threaten this entire firm.

655
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,783
- Which brings me right
back to where we started.

656
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,118
Why didn't you tell me
about louis

657
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,321
When I asked you what
the dirt on woodall was for?

658
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,923
- I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you

659
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:44,094
In the position of having
to lie for me in a deposition.

660
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:49,199
Is that "focused
on you and me" enough?

661
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,135
- Jessica...

662
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,803
When are you gonna understand

663
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,205
That I can handle
crossing lines,

664
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,408
But I won't
handle you lying to me?

665
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,311
Now, how much
trouble are we in?

666
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:04,348
- That's what I'm
gonna find out.

667
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,689
- Louis, did you see this?
- No, what is it?

668
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:15,292
- It's cahill's deposition
with harvey and mike.

669
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:19,329
Skip to the end.

670
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:22,099
- Jesus christ, he's honing in
like a bloodhound.

671
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,901
It's only a matter of time.

672
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,402
- There's got to be a way
we can get this filed--

673
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,470
- There isn't.

674
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,706
- Louis.
- I'm done.

675
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,878
I'm done.

676
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,348
And if I don't
do something now,

677
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,085
So are harvey and mike.

678
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:44,354
- Where are you going?
- To finish what I started.

679
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,889
- You know what I think?
- What?

680
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,424
- I think we both could've
used a better lawyer

681
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,926
In that deposition.

682
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,061
- You think this is funny?
- No, I don't.

683
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,463
- Then help me
figure a way out,

684
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:55,265
Because if we don't, they're
gonna find out about louis,

685
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,434
And everything cahill's
been saying about us

686
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,336
Is gonna start looking true.

687
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,739
- We have to stop cahill from
going through those files.

688
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,207
- We tried that.
- We have to try again.

689
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,943
We have to prove that cahill
is only on this investigation

690
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,311
<i>Because woodall hates you.</i>

691
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,214
- The problem is we don't
have a link between them.

692
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,282
- And they have a link
between jessica and malone.

693
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,852
- So we'd have to convince
judge hopkins

694
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,821
Their relationship has nothing
to do with this whole thing,

695
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,958
Which...
We'll never be able to do.

696
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,060
- How do they even know
about jessica and malone?

697
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,262
- I don't know.
Someone at the s.E.C. Must've

698
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,164
Seen them together while
malone was still working there.

699
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,465
- You think
they were holding hands?

700
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,400
Come on, harvey, this is
jessica we're talking about.

701
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,202
- Talking about me, what?

702
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,537
- Holy sh--, you're right.

703
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,039
She was married,
and I didn't even know it.

704
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,075
- Cahill had us followed
without authorization.

705
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:39,376
- And there's no way
he had authorization

706
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,812
To follow a government official.

707
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,147
- You need to pay
that man a visit.

708
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,883
<i>- I need to pay
that man a visit.</i>

709
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,256
- Yep.

710
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,490
Oh, sorry, maybe you
didn't hear the news.

711
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,425
Jeff malone doesn't
work here anymore.

712
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,960
- And I'm guessing you know
exactly where he is,

713
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,562
Since you've been
following him for months.

714
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,130
- I haven't been
following him at all.

715
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,431
I've been following you.

716
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,167
- Well, it doesn't really
matter who you followed,

717
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,435
Since there's no way
you got authorization.

718
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,404
- You think judge hopkins
is going to look into

719
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,972
Those dreamy brown eyes of yours

720
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,574
And drop the case
because of that?

721
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:13,076
- No, I think
you're gonna drop it.

722
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,112
- Hmm.
- 'cause if you don't,

723
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,114
It's no longer
malicious prosecution.

724
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,582
It's abuse of power.

725
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:21,084
You did it to mike ross,
you did it to me,

726
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:23,153
And we're gonna find out
who else you did it to.

727
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,354
- Take a shot.

728
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,856
It'll take you two years
to make a case,

729
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,125
And even if it sticks,
I'll get a slap on the wrist,

730
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,961
But harvey specter
will already be in prison.

731
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,229
- You dirty son of a bitch.

732
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,131
- Dirty?

733
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,365
I may bend the rules,

734
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,334
But I'm doing it
because you are guilty.

735
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,969
- That's exactly
what eric woodall said

736
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,971
Before we got his ass fired.

737
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,306
- Well, I'll tell you
what I told harvey.

738
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,841
I'm not eric woodall,

739
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,242
And sending
some guy named louis litt

740
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,377
To confess to some
fabricated bullsh--

741
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,413
Isn't gonna make me stop.

742
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:52,382
It's gonna make me
come at you harder.

743
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,893
- Maybe no news is good news.

744
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,361
All right, maybe
no news means bad news.

745
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,866
- When it comes to jessica,
no news is no news.

746
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,634
- Harvey, you have a minute?

747
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,369
- What do you want, louis?

748
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,204
- I'd prefer to tell you alone.

749
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,506
- Mike knows everything,
so spit it out.

750
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,142
- Okay, um, but I think
you both should know

751
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,878
That whatever happens to me,

752
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,413
I had the dignity to come to you
and tell you like a man.

753
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,082
- What did you do?
- He did exactly

754
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,516
What I told him not to do.

755
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,652
He went to the s.E.C.,
and he confessed.

756
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:29,920
- Wait, jessica, please.

757
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,488
- Please what?
Don't kill you?

758
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,323
Because one thing
is for sure.

759
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,093
When all this is over, I'm gonna
fire the sh-- out of you.

760
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:38,262
- Fire me?

761
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,563
You should be thanking me.

762
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,231
I read the transcript.

763
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,600
Cahill knows
about the hidden payment.

764
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,903
I went there
to save all of you!

765
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:48,372
- And I told you
the second you did that,

766
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,540
These two go from being
probably innocent

767
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,309
To definitely guilty.

768
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:55,178
- Goddamn idiot.
- Wait a second. We--

769
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,581
Louis, if you confessed,
then why are you here?

770
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,616
- They sent me home.
- What?

771
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,084
- What exactly did you
say to cahill?

772
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,085
- I didn't talk to cahill.

773
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,620
I mean, I was in his office,

774
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:06,123
But then eric woodall comes in,
takes me down the hall.

775
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,157
I confessed to him.

776
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,326
- You told
the head of the s.E.C.

777
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,361
You committed a federal crime,
and he sent you on your way?

778
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,663
- Yes.
- And he didn't try to get you

779
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:14,431
To implicate harvey?
- No, in fact,

780
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,066
He didn't seem to care at all.

781
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,402
- And you specifically told him
about your deal with forstman?

782
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,137
- Yeah. He said
they're not interested

783
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,338
In little fish like me.

784
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,506
- You might be
a little fish to him,

785
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,608
But forstman
is a goddamn whale.

786
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,976
- It doesn't matter.

787
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,477
Woodall hates me:
I'm the one he wants.

788
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,147
- But why not use forstman
to reel you in

789
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,015
And get two
for the price of one?

790
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,283
- Unless for some reason

791
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,586
Woodall doesn't want to drag
forstman into this.

792
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,989
- Because
they're in bed together.

793
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,657
That's a big leap.

794
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,959
- Harvey, you said
you told forstman

795
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,260
The s.E.C. Was on his ass,
and he acted

796
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,995
Like he was wearing
a teflon suit.

797
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,430
- He acted
the same way with me.

798
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,465
- And when assholes
act invincible,

799
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,267
It's because
they think they are.

800
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,269
- It's the only
thing that makes sense.

801
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,237
- You two find the link
between those two,

802
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,274
And find it tonight.

803
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,055
- This could be something.

804
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,024
Look.

805
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,226
In April of last year,

806
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,528
Charles forstman made huge
contributions

807
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,431
To these three senators.

808
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,533
- So what?
He's got money to burn.

809
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,135
- Yeah, but four weeks later,

810
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,536
These same senators
helped appoint eric woodall

811
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,538
To head the new york office
of the s.E.C.

812
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,773
- That doesn't prove
a direct link

813
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,541
Between forstman and woodall.

814
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:34,144
- It's still a link, harvey.
- And it's how this sh-- works.

815
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,313
It's totally legal, and it's
not gonna do a thing for us.

816
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,414
- Well, what do you want?

817
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,383
A picture of him handing woodall
a bag of money?

818
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,517
Because we're never
gonna get that.

819
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,786
- Maybe we don't need it.

820
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:45,789
- You better be here
with something good.

821
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,029
- I am.

822
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,264
Charles forstman made me take
a million dollars

823
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,599
To keep from turning on him.

824
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,301
What if he made woodall
take a taste too?

825
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,703
- You think we
don't know that?

826
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,338
That's the "bag of money"
problem.

827
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,506
- It wouldn't be
a bag of money,

828
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:03,673
Because if it's untraceable,

829
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,208
He wouldn't have leverage
over woodall.

830
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,177
- That's great,
but we can't get access

831
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,278
To woodall's bank accounts.

832
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,679
- We can't.

833
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,114
But cahill can.

834
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,616
- Okay, what good
does that do us, huh?

835
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:16,686
They're together.
- What if they're not?

836
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,089
I told you,
I went to see cahill.

837
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,524
He wasn't there.

838
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,459
Five minutes later,
eric woodall shows up.

839
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,194
I say two words:
"charles forstman."

840
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,796
He hustles me outta there
like I'm his mistress

841
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,531
With his wife
coming up the driveway.

842
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,534
Why would he not wait
for cahill?

843
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:33,270
- You want us to get cahill
to turn on woodall.

844
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:36,273
- Wouldn't you?
- Maybe louis is right.

845
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,275
Maybe there are lines that
woodall's willing to cross

846
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,342
That cahill won't.

847
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:40,677
- That's a big "maybe."

848
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,679
- You have a better idea?

849
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,415
- No, I don't.

850
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,384
- Look, guys, we all know

851
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:50,854
That jessica's gonna
fire me after this.

852
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,090
I just want to help,

853
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,192
Make things right.

854
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,296
- Get your coat.

855
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,606
You really looking through
those all by yourself?

856
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,341
- Are the witches of eastwick
here to tell me

857
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,210
How to run my department?

858
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,678
- We're here to make
things easier for you.

859
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,879
- Oh.

860
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:19,783
- Buried in one of these boxes
is a copy of this.

861
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,218
It proves collusion.

862
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,686
Not between me and mike.

863
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,856
Between him
and charles forstman.

864
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,424
- And you're just
gonna give this to me?

865
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,525
- Yup.

866
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:29,559
And you're gonna
give it to woodall,

867
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,161
And we're gonna
see what he says.

868
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,163
- And what he's gonna say is
that he doesn't give a sh--

869
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,364
About charles forstman,

870
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:35,899
Just like he told me
when I confessed to him.

871
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,400
- What exactly
are you implying?

872
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,668
- We're not implying anything.

873
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,604
- We're telling you that
after woodall lost his job,

874
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,839
Forstman got him installed
at the s.E.C.,

875
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,709
And all he had to do
in return was protect forstman.

876
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:46,810
- Where's the proof?

877
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,545
- In eric woodall's
bank accounts.

878
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,680
- Oh, so you want me to go
through his bank accounts

879
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,215
Based on your word.

880
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,850
- You followed us
based on his bullsh--.

881
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,352
- Based on the word
of my friend.

882
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,887
- Why don't you ask your
friend if he has a problem

883
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,588
Giving you access
to his accounts?

884
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,157
- If he doesn't,
then we're wrong,

885
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,192
And we've just handed you
the smoking gun.

886
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,194
- And if you're right,
you want me to let him

887
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,662
Off the hook for what he did.

888
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,797
- Woodall already
said he's a little fish.

889
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,433
We're asking you to
throw him back in the water.

890
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,601
- What the hell's
going on in here?

891
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,636
- Hey, eric.

892
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:13,870
It's good
to see you again.

893
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,372
Sean, isn't this great
that we're all together?

894
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,374
Did you see me come in?

895
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:18,575
Afraid of what I'd say?

896
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,844
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

897
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,179
- Eric, these gentlemen
came in here

898
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,680
With these wild accusations

899
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,949
That you and charles forstman
are in bed together.

900
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:29,619
- A bed filled
with forstman's money.

901
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,422
- Yes, charles forstman
gave me millions of dollars.

902
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,191
That's why I drive a subaru.

903
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,959
- Yeah, I didn't spend
the money he gave me either.

904
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,661
That doesn't mean he
didn't make me take it.

905
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,696
- I don't give a sh--.
I'm not you.

906
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,565
- Eric, obviously these
allegations are crazy.

907
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,500
- Of course they are.

908
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:45,835
- So just...

909
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:49,272
Prove it to 'em
you've got nothing to hide.

910
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,244
- This is ridiculous.

911
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:57,547
I...Am not gonna dignify...

912
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,789
I'm your boss.

913
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,691
- Gentlemen,
give me a minute.

914
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:08,892
- Yep.

915
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:15,298
- And by a minute,
he means 10 to 15 years.

916
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,833
- In about a half an hour,
you're gonna need

917
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,535
A really good lawyer.

918
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,837
And when that happens,

919
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,608
Don't call me.

920
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,586
- Which lawyer do you
think woodall called?

921
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,588
- Well, if he was smart,
he would call daniel hardman.

922
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,991
The best person to defend
a criminal is a criminal.

923
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,560
- And hardman's a much better
lawyer than you anyways.

924
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,929
- Oh, very funny.

925
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,664
Thank you.

926
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,967
- Thank you, louis.

927
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,345
- Please.

928
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:03,713
- I'll try.

929
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,889
- Donna told me she
already said this to you,

930
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,925
But I want you to
hear it from me.

931
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:20,463
I wouldn't be back here
if it wasn't for louis.

932
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,466
- I'll take care of it.

933
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,343
Woodall's taken care of,
and so is everything else.

934
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,578
- Not everything.
- Jessica--

935
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,448
- Harvey, I've already
made up my mind.

936
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,518
- You weren't there.
He helped get us out of this.

937
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,986
- After he put us
goddamn in it.

938
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,954
- And I put us in it
just as much,

939
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,523
The day I hired mike ross.

940
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,692
- Are you looking
to save louis,

941
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,527
Or to get yourself fired too?

942
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,462
- I'm saying he
did some bad sh--,

943
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,964
But so have I,
and so have you.

944
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,367
- You and I
don't mess sh-- up.

945
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:58,535
We fix it.

946
00:38:58,537 --> 00:38:59,736
- Which is what he did today.

947
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,538
- You want to talk
about what he did?

948
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,607
I told him not to confess,
and he went straight down

949
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,843
To the s.E.C.,
and he sang like a canary,

950
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,446
After he did the same
thing with jeff malone.

951
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:10,647
- That doesn't--
- doesn't what?

952
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:13,350
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.

953
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,852
Let's talk about
his greatest hits.

954
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,055
Last year, he blew up
our merger negotiations

955
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,957
Because of a cat.

956
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,994
This year, he led mike ross
straight to charles forstman.

957
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,497
He unwound the wexler shares
after I specifically told him

958
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,933
Not to,
and to top it all off,

959
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,869
He took a million-dollar
payout to commit tax fraud

960
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,705
That could've landed
you ten years in jail.

961
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,108
And he didn't tell us about
that until it was too late,

962
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,610
And he only did that
because he had to.

963
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:41,978
- I'm still not doin' it.

964
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,380
- I tell him to do something,

965
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:46,983
And he never goddamn does it.

966
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,120
Now, I told myself
I'm gonna do something.

967
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:53,123
And I'm gonna goddamn do it.

968
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,928
- Then let me do it.

969
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:04,868
- Why you and not me?

970
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,404
- Because you want
to deliver the message

971
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:10,039
"his services
are no longer needed,"

972
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,975
And I want to tell him
"good-bye."

973
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:14,477
- You're really
going to do this?

974
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,728
- Harvey,
this place is all he has.

975
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,563
- I know.

976
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,601
- I'm coming with you.

977
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,745
Dear harvey and jessica,

978
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,480
There comes a time

979
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,449
When a man must
look at himself in the mirror,

980
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,983
To judge himself

981
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:57,153
Instead of waiting
to be judged by others.

982
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:00,957
And for me,
that time is now.

983
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,992
You both know
I came to pearson specter

984
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,728
Right out of law school,
but what you may not know is

985
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,932
This is the only place
I've ever worked.

986
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:12,802
It's the only place
I've ever wanted to work.

987
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,138
It is my life...

988
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,874
It is my home...

989
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:21,744
And the people that work here
are my family.

990
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,746
You're like my parents.

991
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,982
And the partners,
they're like my brothers,

992
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,118
And associates under my care
are like my children.

993
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,087
And I'm ashamed
to admit it, but...

994
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:34,724
I put all of you in jeopardy
for my own personal gain.

995
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,693
I told myself
it was for the greater good,

996
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,628
But the truth is
I just wanted to feel

997
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,165
On the same level
as both of you, I...

998
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,200
I can deny that no longer.

999
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:47,036
I can excuse
my actions no longer.

1000
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,506
Although we've had our
differences over the years,

1001
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:53,142
There are no two people
I respect more.

1002
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,112
Your names are on the wall
for a reason,

1003
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,148
And mine is not for a reason.

1004
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,184
And I refuse to put
either one of you

1005
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,820
Through the pain
of having to fire me.

1006
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,688
So effective immediately,

1007
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,025
I, louis litt,

1008
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,228
Am resigning
from pearson specter.

1009
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,261
Please take care of my home.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
