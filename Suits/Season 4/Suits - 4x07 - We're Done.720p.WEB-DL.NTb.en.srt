1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,702
- I want you to go back
over your work

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,037
With a fine-tooth comb.

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,438
- We're as protected
as we can be.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,073
- Every partner at this firm

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,775
Goes over their work
if I say so.

6
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,277
- I'm not every goddamn partner.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,479
- I made a deal with forstman.

8
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:14,747
- This has got to be

9
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,615
The most genius thing
you have ever done

10
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,651
In your entire,
wonderful life.

11
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,453
- Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,055
Through switzerland
and the caymans.

13
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,256
- Louis, that's illegal.

14
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,125
- You didn't see the look
on harvey's face

15
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,393
When he found out
that I was the one

16
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,462
And I am not gonna see
the look on his face

17
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,064
When he finds out that I didn't.

18
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,265
- There isn't enough money
in the world

19
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,533
For me to ever trust you again.

20
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,735
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

21
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,370
You're fired.

22
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,076
- No, I can't.
- Rachel. Rachel.

23
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,077
- What the hell is this?

24
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,779
- A job offer.

25
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,480
- I am going to tell mike
what happened.

26
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,750
You will be risking
your whole life with mike.

27
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,620
- I'm risking it if I don't.

28
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,753
- I heard.

29
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,321
- How?

30
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,355
- Amy.

31
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,390
- Why would she--

32
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,358
- So that you wouldn't have to.

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,493
Here.

34
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,795
- Sh--.

35
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,531
I didn't even think
about what would happen to her.

36
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,833
- Mike, you don't have
to think about anyone

37
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,301
Except for you right now.

38
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,103
- I don't want
to think about me.

39
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,738
All I've done is let everyone
down, including you.

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,408
- You have not let me down.

41
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,410
- You don't even know
what I've done.

42
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,450
- Whatever it is,
it can't be as bad as--

43
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,285
- As I think?

44
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,592
Rachel, I lost my job.

45
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,659
I lost the takeover.

46
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,294
I lost walter gillis
his company.

47
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,863
I cut a deal to sell out the man

48
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,564
Who gave me a chance
in the first place.

49
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,368
The guy who made me
do that called me his guy

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,769
And then offered me a job.

51
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,439
So what does that make me?

52
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,907
- It makes you a human being.

53
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,587
- I don't know what to do.

54
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,755
- I don't either.

55
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:41,260
But we don't have to do
anything tonight.

56
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:42,895
- Louis, you need to calm down.

57
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:43,896
- I broke the law.

58
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,597
- Please keep your voice down.

59
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,266
- Why?
Let any man judge me.

60
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,333
So says the good book.

61
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,236
I think I know
what the goddamn good book says.

62
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,604
- Listen to me.

63
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,640
You did what you had to do.
- Oh, really?

64
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,575
Well, that's not what you said
when you found out.

65
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,878
- Because I was trying to get
you not to go through with it.

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,647
But you made a decision.
I understand why.

67
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,382
And now that it's done,

68
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,918
I'm not going to let you
beat yourself up about it.

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,619
- Yeah, well, you may not,
but what do you think harvey

70
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,221
And jessica are going to do
when they find out?

71
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,457
- Louis, you have been a hero
again and again.

72
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,359
And if the one time
they actually treat you like one

73
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,794
You crossed a little line
to get there,

74
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,763
That doesn't make you horrible.

75
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:20,632
- You know what?
You're absolutely right.

76
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,934
And as of this second,

77
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,936
I'm going to start acting
like the hero that I am.

78
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,571
Hey, jerk-off.

79
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,573
Who do I have to blow
to get some more nuts?

80
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,546
- It turned out he knew
all about the crop reports.

81
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,749
I nailed him on six counts
of mail fraud.

82
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,320
- Did you tell them the one
about how you got your head

83
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,754
Stuck up eric woodall's ass?

84
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,925
- Excuse me for a second.

85
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,629
What the hell
are you doing here?

86
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,763
- You think you're
the only person

87
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,365
Who can have someone followed?

88
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,366
- You have no right.

89
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,634
- Oh, I have every right.

90
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,369
I just didn't need
to hire someone

91
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,505
'cause it turns out you come to
the same sh--hole every night,

92
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,908
Telling the same stories
to the same people

93
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,711
Because you have no place
else to go.

94
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,912
- If you're thinking
you can bait me

95
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,013
Into taking a swing at you,

96
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,314
You might be right.

97
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,916
- Why don't you take a swing
at this?

98
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,818
- Oh, you're trying
to bribe me now.

99
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,287
- That's a certified letter
outlining everything

100
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,522
That's happened
since you started targeting me,

101
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,291
Every bullsh-- move you've made.

102
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,526
- It's not bullsh--.
It's an ongoing investigation.

103
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,928
- And it's turned up bullsh--,

104
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,030
Which I've outlined
for judge hopkins.

105
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,999
Everything
from targeting my clients

106
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,267
To having me followed.

107
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,368
So now you have ten days

108
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,936
To dispute
my accounting of events,

109
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,772
And when they're done,
I expect to never see you again.

110
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,707
- You don't know me that well.

111
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,377
- Sean, any time
you want to put the badge down

112
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,679
And fight me man-to-man,

113
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,881
You know where to find me.

114
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,894
- ♪ see the money,

- How's the job hunting going?

124
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,532
- What do you want, forstman?

125
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,902
- Oh, now that you don't
want my money, it's forstman?

126
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,004
No mister?

127
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,872
What happened to the obsequious
little sh--

128
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,408
Who approached me in a coffee
shop with his hand out?

129
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,410
- He realized that you
don't deserve any respect.

130
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,778
- I don't need your respect.

131
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,413
I need an answer
on my job offer.

132
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,848
- Thought I was pretty clear.

133
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,684
- Your mouth said one thing.

134
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,386
Let's see what your eyes
have to say.

135
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,760
- A million dollars.

136
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,796
Is this a joke?
- It's your signing bonus.

137
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,499
Are you ready
to come work for me now?

138
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,902
- Thought I was
an obsequious little sh--.

139
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,538
- You are, but so was I
when I was your age,

140
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,708
And look what happened to me.

141
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,778
- You could make it ten million,
charles.

142
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,547
- I'm not gonna make it
ten million.

143
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,815
The offer is one,

144
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,817
And that's
where it's standing.

145
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,552
You have a day.

146
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,588
If you decide
not to take my offer,

147
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,090
I will know
you're not only an asshole.

148
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,393
You're a fool.

149
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,927
Let's go.

150
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,407
To what do I owe the honor?
What can I do for you?

151
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,041
- Louis, I am coming to you

152
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,144
Because the question
isn't what you can do for me,

153
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,646
But what can I do for you?

154
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,747
Harvey and I were very impressed

155
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,115
By what you did
with charles forstman.

156
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,550
- I'm impressed
that you understand

157
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,684
How impressive it was.

158
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,153
- And since we
couldn't figure out

159
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,955
How best to show our gratitude,

160
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,158
I'm here to ask you
what you would like.

161
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,893
- I'm sorry.

162
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,797
You want to give me--
- a reward.

163
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,498
- Anything I want?
- All you have to do is ask--

164
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
- Pearson, specter, litt.

165
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,735
- Excuse me?
- I think I was clear.

166
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,203
I want my name on the door.
It can go third.

167
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,939
- Louis, named partner isn't
something I can just hand out.

168
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,040
- But you just said
I saved the day.

169
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,609
- You just said
you saved the day.

170
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,678
I said we wanted
to show our gratitude.

171
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,046
- By telling me
I get to choose whatever I want,

172
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,681
Except for the one thing
I really want.

173
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,882
- Maybe I should have been
more clear.

174
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,050
- Maybe you should have.

175
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,187
I mean, you're a goddamn lawyer,
after all.

176
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,621
- Louis,

177
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,892
Then let me be clear right now.

178
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,562
I am giving you an opportunity

179
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:47,699
To accept a well-deserved
thank-you with grace.

180
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,701
You can either take it,

181
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,870
Or you can turn it
into a personal snub

182
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,573
And ruin all the goodwill

183
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:59,544
That you've just earned
with me and harvey.

184
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,680
The choice is yours.

185
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,151
- Can I get back to you on that?
- I'm sorry. What?

186
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,753
- Can I get back to you on that?

187
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,856
- That's all I can hope for,
louis.

188
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,228
- Hey.

189
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,563
So I just wanted
to run through your schedule

190
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,598
For the rest of the week.

191
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,665
- Mm, go ahead.

192
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,801
- You've got ellis
at 4:00 today,

193
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,669
Mckinney at 10:00 tomorrow,

194
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:29,007
And when should I pencil you in
to go see mike?

195
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,543
- See him for what?
- To be a friend.

196
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,011
- Donna,
as far as he's concerned,

197
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,813
I sold him out
to win the takeover.

198
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,748
I am the last person
he wants to see right now.

199
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,983
- And I would agree
with all that,

200
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,785
Except for the fact
that mike got fired.

201
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,687
- What?

202
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,055
When?
- Last night.

203
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,558
Because you should be
hearing it from him,

204
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,194
And they would rather be
alone and miserable

205
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,595
Than ever run the risk
of being accused

206
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,830
Of needing someone.

207
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,064
- He has rachel.

208
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,199
- Who is the one person
mike believes

209
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,934
Will stand by him
no matter what,

210
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,069
Which makes her the one person
he won't believe

211
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,772
When she says
he didn't completely fail.

212
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,208
- How important
is the meeting with ellis?

213
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,576
- He says it's urgent.

214
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,178
- Tell him I have to reschedule.

215
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,261
- Rachel or donna?

216
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,996
Who told you to check up on me?

217
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,231
- You don't think
I'd do that on my own?

218
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,299
- No, I don't.

219
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,700
- Well, I wouldn't have

220
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,068
Because I didn't think
you'd need it.

221
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,204
Then I found out you got fired.

222
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:36,942
People lose their jobs
every single day.

223
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,944
- Yeah, not people like you.

224
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,145
Something's going on.

225
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,179
Why'd you get fired?

226
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,280
- You mean other than the fact

227
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,949
That I picked a fight
I couldn't win?

228
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,317
- I don't care
how it turned out.

229
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,852
You went 15 rounds
on your first shot.

230
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,189
No way jonathan sidwell
lets you go after that.

231
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,027
It was forstman, wasn't it?

232
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,830
- I only got his money
if I agreed to cut sidwell

233
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,865
Out of the deal.

234
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,300
- And sidwell found out.

235
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,002
- He didn't just find out.

236
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,972
- That son of a bitch.

237
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:10,241
That son of a bitch
has offered me a job.

238
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,844
- Mike, you can't do it,
and you know it.

239
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,946
- What choice do I have?

240
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,781
I was an investment banker
for ten minutes,

241
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,950
And I blew the only deal
I'm ever gonna get near.

242
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,252
- Well, that sounds exactly
like the kind of bullsh--

243
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,722
Forstman tells people
to wrap them around his finger.

244
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,256
- Doesn't mean it's not true.
- Yes, it does.

245
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,926
I could get you
five interviews before tomorrow.

246
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,094
- And how are you going
to do that?

247
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,129
- By making
five goddamn phone calls.

248
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,198
- And what are you gonna say
when they answer?

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,001
I was a harvard-educated lawyer
working for you?

250
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,771
I might as well go back
to being a fraud.

251
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,709
- What if I can get jessica
to take you back?

252
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,980
What if you could bring
my parents back to life?

253
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,050
Have about the same chance
of happening.

254
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,952
- Mike, I'm trying to help you.
- And I appreciate that.

255
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,720
But I only have two references,
harvey,

256
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,389
You, who has to lie for me,

257
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,990
And jonathan,
who wants to kill me.

258
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,394
- Mike.
- Harvey, it's enough.

259
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,828
As much as you want to help me,

260
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,997
You have no idea what it is

261
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,901
To have been a fraud
and have to start all over.

262
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,404
- I don't.

263
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,039
But someone else does.

264
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,117
- Well, well.

265
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,888
If it isn't employee
number 7611053.

266
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,922
- You still remember that.

267
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:35,026
I never lied about having a head
for numbers.

268
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:39,030
- I never said how sorry I was
for what happened to you.

269
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,432
- You don't need to be sorry,
mike.

270
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,867
The truth is,
I should be thanking you.

271
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,002
- What?

272
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,870
- You know what I do now?

273
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,240
Statistical analysis
for fantasy baseball.

274
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,009
- That's awesome.

275
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,277
- You don't know the half of it.

276
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,279
My old, better job,

277
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,182
I sat in my office,
crunched my numbers,

278
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,783
Made a lot more money,

279
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,086
Barely knew the name
of one person on my floor.

280
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,922
Now my best friends
are people I work with.

281
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,829
Well, why'd you call me?

282
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,097
- The last time I saw you,

283
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,431
You had no idea
what you were gonna do

284
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,501
With the rest of your life.

285
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:20,071
You had
to completely start over,

286
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,740
And it looks like you did.

287
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,875
I guess I--
- want to know how.

288
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,378
- Start by starting.

289
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,214
- What does that mean?

290
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,281
- It means, for six months,

291
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,917
I threw myself
a giant pity party,

292
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,422
I was gonna get out
of the mess I was in.

293
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,457
And then one day
I said, "enough's enough."

294
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,793
And instead of asking questions,

295
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,896
I started looking for answers.

296
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,297
- And you found
fantasy baseball.

297
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,433
- No, I found out
that how much money you make

298
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,003
Is not the most important thing
in the world.

299
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,540
Who you spend it with,
every day, is.

300
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,012
- Thanks, stan.
I appreciate it.

301
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,847
- Whoa, mike.

302
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,250
Why exactly is it
you need to start over?

303
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,987
That's a long story.

304
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,156
- I have time.

305
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,558
- Another day, stan.

306
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,262
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

307
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,396
Clear your schedule tonight.

308
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,098
- Done. Why?

309
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,900
- Jessica offered me
anything I want

310
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,134
As a reward for my heroism,

311
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,569
And we're gonna figure out
what that is.

312
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,404
- What's to figure out?
Named partner.

313
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,840
- No, not that.
Anything but that.

314
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,141
- What do you mean,
"anything but that?"

315
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,910
There isn't anything but that.

316
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,144
- Oh, you think
I didn't ask for it?

317
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,245
The words were out of my mouth

318
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,814
Faster than esther
when she was 13.

319
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,182
- Louis, I don't care
about your slutty sister.

320
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,516
You deserve named partner.

321
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,851
- And I don't care
that you don't care

322
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,586
Because it's not gonna happen.

323
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,856
Now, we were given a chance
to take the high road,

324
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,892
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

325
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,427
- If I were ever going to be
attracted to you,

326
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,429
Now would be the time.

327
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,865
Instead I'll prepare a list
of demands befitting a hero.

328
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,935
And don't ever talk about being
attracted to me again.

329
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,303
It weirds me out.

330
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,277
- The answer's no.

331
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,579
- You don't even know
what I'm here for.

332
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,280
- I know
what you're not here for.

333
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,082
To tell me after a long night
of soul-searching,

334
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,450
You've decided to give me
full control

335
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,518
Of gillis industries.

336
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,989
But I am here to give you
full control of this.

337
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,164
- This isn't public information.

338
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,132
- It will be in 24 hours.

339
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,467
So it's legal to give it to you.

340
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,035
- And it gives me a 24-hour edge

341
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,937
If I decide to act
on this information.

342
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,873
- Which, as you can see
from that filing,

343
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,041
Would be
a very profitable thing to do.

344
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,310
- And all I have to do in return
is use your law firm?

345
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,312
- I don't care
what law firm you use.

346
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,380
I just want you to have
mike ross

347
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,481
Run point on the deal.

348
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,649
- Then we're back
where we started,

349
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,150
And you can get the hell
out of my office.

350
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,386
- Jonathan,
I know what he did,

351
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,456
But he thought he had no choice.

352
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,025
- When a person
thinks he has no choice

353
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,593
Is when you see
his true character.

354
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,362
- You think you have no choice

355
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,130
Other than to be vindictive
right now.

356
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,032
- This isn't vindictive.
It's common sense.

357
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,636
You don't give the fox
another run at the henhouse.

358
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,404
- You wouldn't have even had
a shot at the henhouse

359
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,605
If it wasn't
for him getting you out

360
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,340
From under tony gianopolous.

361
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,409
- And I repaid him for that
by giving him his first shot

362
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,510
At investment banking.

363
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,544
- And where I come from,

364
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,346
The way you really repay someone

365
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,949
Is by giving them
a second goddamn shot.

366
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,252
- Then go the hell back
to where you came from.

367
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:25,256
And, hey,
if you think he's so great,

368
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,658
Take him back there with you.

369
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:39,103
- Louis, you have a minute?
- Not really.

370
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,939
I'm in the middle of some
very important gift-choosing.

371
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,140
- What?

372
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,441
- Yeah,
wouldn't you like to know?

373
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,609
But you never will

374
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,244
Because a person only gets gifts

375
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,346
When they fix the mistakes
that jeff malone's made.

376
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,049
- Actually, louis,
that's why I'm here.

377
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,184
I wanted to thank you
for catching that error

378
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,219
On the wexler stock.

379
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,321
- You want to thank me?

380
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,256
- Yes, louis, I do.

381
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,158
Look,
I know you don't trust me,

382
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,393
But you got us out of a jam,

383
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,629
And I'm here to thank you,
man-to-man.

384
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,164
- Bullsh--.

385
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,732
You're here to kiss my ass
because you found out

386
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,367
That I'm now above you
in the pecking order.

387
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:13,604
And all I found out is that
you fixed this thing for harvey,

388
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,007
And I am here to thank you.

389
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,375
- I'm not talking about harvey,
and you know it.

390
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,344
- No, louis.
- Don't play dumb with me.

391
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,112
I'm talking
about jessica pearson,

392
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,047
The woman whose ass
you've really been kissing,

393
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,749
The very same woman
who came to me

394
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,418
And asked me to check your work.

395
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,055
Yeah, uh-huh.

396
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,692
I have some lipizzaner stallions
to look at.

397
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,771
- You had louis litt
check my work?

398
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,773
- I was wondering
when we might get into this.

399
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,675
- Well, the wondering is over
because it's now.

400
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,710
And if you were going to do
something like that,

401
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,345
You should have discussed it
with me first

402
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,713
Before going behind my back.

403
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,517
And you stood right there
and said your work was perfect

404
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,785
And I should trust you.

405
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,186
- You see,
that's the problem right there.

406
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,721
You don't trust me.

407
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,724
And now you're just rubbing
my mistake in my face.

408
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,726
- If the goal
was to rub it in your face,

409
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,161
I would have done that already,

410
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,796
And we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

411
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,798
- In that case, maybe
we should keep our conversations

412
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,566
On a professional level
for a while.

413
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,568
- You're the one
who wanted to do both.

414
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,737
- And maybe I was wrong.

415
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,141
- I never said
I didn't trust you.

416
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,510
I said I didn't trust
your work on wexler.

417
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,746
- That's the difference
between us, jessica.

418
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,215
You see, when I say, "trust me,"

419
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,651
I mean trust the man
who works for you

420
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,520
And the man that's with you.

421
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,066
- You wanted to see me?

422
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,267
- You don't seem in a good mood.

423
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,069
- I'm not.

424
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,136
- We can talk about it later.

425
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,471
- I walked
all the way down here.

426
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,173
We can talk about it now.

427
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,809
- I was just gonna ask
how louis' talk went.

428
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,646
That is not an "I have to come
talk to you" conversation.

429
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,621
- I want to bring mike back.

430
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,358
That is not a conversation
I ever want to have.

431
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,359
- Jessica--

432
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,361
- Harvey, I haven't slept better

433
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,763
Since his last night,

434
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,731
Except for every night since,

435
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,233
And I'm not going back.

436
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,302
In case
you really were wondering,

437
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,238
Louis took his thank-you
like a dick.

438
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,574
And if that's all,
I'm going home.

439
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,122
- Hey.

440
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,257
- Hey.

441
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,392
Are you cooking?
- Mmm.

442
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,494
I make one thing,

443
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,196
And I make it awesome.

444
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,633
- Mike, every single guy
thinks that his spaghetti sau--

445
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,839
Oh, my god. That's amazing.

446
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,710
- Not every single guy
was raised by his grandmother.

447
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,646
Now you sit down, shut up,

448
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,616
And tell me about your day.

449
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,918
- What got you
in such a good mood?

450
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,153
- Oh, you know, nothing.

451
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,387
Just spent the afternoon

452
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,289
Figuring out what I'm gonna do
with my life.

453
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,191
- Well, that sounds
like quite the afternoon.

454
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,693
What did you figure out?

455
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,664
- Well, I figured out
I don't want

456
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,366
To take the job with forstman,

457
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:32,637
And I don't want to be
an investment banker.

458
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,306
- So what do you want to be?

459
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,440
- I don't know.

460
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,479
But I know
I want to be with you.

461
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:45,349
- What are you saying?
- I want to start over.

462
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,517
- I don't understand.

463
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,585
- Rachel, when I met you,

464
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,753
I had nothing in my life

465
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,256
Except what came
from being a fraud.

466
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,759
And now I have nothing in it
except being with you,

467
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,761
And I wouldn't go back
even if I could because...

468
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,895
- Mike--

469
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,265
- I don't care
what I do for a living.

470
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,533
I mean, I'll figure it out,

471
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,303
But as long as I have you,

472
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,639
I have everything.

473
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,509
Rachel?

474
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,377
- What--
I didn't mean to make you cry.

475
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,213
I meant to make you
feel better.

476
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,215
Hey, hey,
everything's going to be okay.

477
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,784
- No, it's not.
- Rachel, what's wrong?

478
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,252
- I'm sorry.
I just need a minute.

479
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,753
- Rachel.
- I just need a minute.

480
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,622
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I'm right here. You can tell me.

481
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,490
What's going on?
- I can't.

482
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,226
- Rachel, stop.
Yes you can.

483
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,660
Hey, hey.
- No, you don't--

484
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,796
I don't deserve you.
- What are you talking about?

485
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,698
Rachel, hey--
- logan and I kissed.

486
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,635
- What?

487
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,704
- We were just talking,

488
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,372
And then he--

489
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,640
- He what?

490
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,342
- Mike, please.

491
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,810
I am so sorry.

492
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,511
Mike, no, please.

493
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,783
Please, it didn't mean anything.

494
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,985
Wait.

495
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,822
I'm...

496
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,474
This is how you handle losing?

497
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,276
- I'm not here
about gillis industries.

498
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,343
- Ooh, you gonna fight me?

499
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,846
- You stay the hell away
from rachel.

500
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,382
- Well, that's up to her.

501
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,516
But if she does come back here,

502
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,385
It won't be to tell me
to stay away.

503
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,664
- Ah!

504
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,314
I don't know what she told you.

505
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,718
But she let it go on
a long time.

506
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,757
And she didn't just like it.

507
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,093
She loved it.

508
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,401
- You told him.

509
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,570
- I don't even know where he is.

510
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,772
- He's at harvey's.

511
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,574
- How do you know?

512
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,109
- Where did you go?

513
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,884
- Forstman?

514
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,086
- Logan.

515
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:37,722
- Gillis.

516
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,523
- Rachel.

517
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,059
- Get the hell in here.

518
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:45,663
- I never should have told him.

519
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:48,499
- Rachel,
there's no use thinking that.

520
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,636
- What if he doesn't forgive me?

521
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:53,804
- You don't know that he won't.

522
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,906
- You don't know that he will.

523
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,043
"this will bore a hole
in his head."

524
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,845
- And you're the one who said
you had to find a way

525
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,447
To trust him with the truth.

526
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,615
- He walked out.
I can't just--

527
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,683
- Stay here tonight?

528
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,451
Of course you can.

529
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,055
- I'm not going back there.

530
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,490
- I'm not saying you have to.

531
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,592
I'm saying
you need to calm down.

532
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,060
- Would you calm down
after someone

533
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:20,564
- I would if I knew he was just
trying to get in my head.

534
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,533
- How the hell do you know
that's all it is?

535
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,935
- Because that piece of sh--
did it to you before,

536
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,570
And I let him
because I'm his lawyer,

537
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,938
But I'm not gonna let him
do it to you now.

538
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,409
He put the image in there,
and now I can't get it out.

539
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,543
- Mike--

540
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,744
- Look, I need to know
if it's true.

541
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,746
- And what good
is gonna come of that?

542
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,786
- I just need to know.

543
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,921
- Then there's only one way
to find out.

544
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,856
But you're not gonna find out
tonight.

545
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,058
Here.

546
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,111
- Mike.

547
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,013
Oh, my god, I was so worr--

548
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,785
Oh, my god, your face.
What happened?

549
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,788
- You know what happened.

550
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,090
- You went to see logan.

551
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,659
- I want you to tell me
exactly what happened

552
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:25,129
Between you and him.

553
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,064
- Okay, why don't we just
go home right now,

554
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,666
And we can talk
about all of it there?

555
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,835
- You're gonna tell me
what happened right here.

556
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,603
- Mike, I--

557
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,771
- I need to know
that I can trust you,

558
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,005
Because you said

559
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,540
That it didn't mean anything,
but he said--

560
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,944
- Mike, please.
- Did it mean something or not?

561
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,179
- It meant something
when it happened, but now--

562
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,014
Okay, look.
Okay.

563
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,616
I made a huge mistake,

564
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,851
But you just asked
if you could trust me--

565
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,652
- Trust you?

566
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,187
You didn't tell me about this
for a week,

567
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,822
And then when you finally did,
you lied.

568
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,825
You walked out before I could
tell you the whole story.

569
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,895
There's no way you were going
to tell me that whole story.

570
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:01,031
- Mike, please.
- He said that you loved it!

571
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,240
And when I said
that it didn't matter

572
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:12,076
What I'd do next
because I have you?

573
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,880
I was wrong

574
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,214
Because we're done.

575
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,799
Okay, listen, rachel.
When you are done can you just--

576
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,001
Holy sh--, are you?

577
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:39,036
- No, I'm not.

578
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,238
- So help me, if harvey
mistreated you, I will--

579
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,239
- It wasn't harvey, louis.

580
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,741
It's mike.

581
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,075
- That son of a bitch.
Where is he?

582
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,711
Because I'll--
- it wasn't him. It was me.

583
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:54,718
- Look, I know
that he hurt you with sheila,

584
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,987
But I love him,

585
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,255
And I lost him.

586
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,657
And I don't really know
what to do.

587
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,226
- Oh, come on, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

588
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,162
Listen to me right now, okay?

589
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,031
Whatever I may think of mike,

590
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,100
I have no doubt
that he loves you.

591
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,304
And when two people
love each other,

592
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:17,174
No problem is insurmountable.

593
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,777
- That's bullsh--.

594
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,580
And you of all people know it.

595
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:23,814
- What?

596
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,316
- You and sheila
loved each other,

597
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:27,585
And you still broke up,

598
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:31,655
Even though neither of you
had done anything wrong.

599
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,057
- That's different.

600
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,693
- Did you hear me?

601
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,861
I did something wrong.

602
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,730
And now he doesn't trust me,

603
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:43,968
And I can't make him
trust me or forgive me.

604
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,271
So it doesn't matter
how much I love him, okay?

605
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,839
Becau--

606
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,307
- Okay, all right, listen.

607
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,077
Rachel, you have so much
going for you.

608
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,747
It's gonna be okay.

609
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,248
- And what good is any of it

610
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,318
If I don't have the one person
I want to share it with?

611
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:20,270
- You told mike after you
explicitly told me not to.

612
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,907
- I don't have
to explain myself to you.

613
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,310
- Really?
- I didn't mean for it--

614
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,245
- It doesn't matter what you did
or didn't mean to happen.

615
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,380
It happened,

616
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:30,681
And I know why it did.

617
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,016
- What are you talk--

618
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:35,986
- You told him
because deep down inside,

619
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,389
And you knew this
would make it happen.

620
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,723
- That is bullsh--.

621
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:43,193
Because that is exactly
what you said to me

622
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,962
When I told allison about us.

623
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,263
- That has nothing
to do with this.

624
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,399
- And since
you obviously came here

625
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,134
To find out where it is
we stand,

626
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,136
Let me tell you.

627
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,771
There is no us.

628
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,939
There will never be an us.

629
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:59,276
And no matter what happens
between me and mike,

630
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,213
That you and I are ever gonna
have a conversation again.

631
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,016
- You're my lawyer.
- Not anymore, logan.

632
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,785
So whatever real or fake meeting
you have with harvey,

633
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,986
You can go to it now,

634
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,088
But I won't be in it

635
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,956
Or any other meeting
you have here in the future

636
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,925
Because we're done.

637
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,968
- Louis, glad you're here.

638
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,870
I just got off the phone
with charles forstman.

639
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,006
He wants to cross the "t"s,
dot the "I"s,

640
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,874
And be done with this deal,
and so do I.

641
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,977
Nobody wants to be done
with that man more than me.

642
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,146
I'm actually heading over there
in an hour,

643
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:41,852
That I finally figured out
what I want as my reward.

644
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:45,089
- And what is that?

645
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:49,293
To allow for telecommuting
whenever I deem appropriate

646
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,261
And a month's more vacation
every year

647
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,930
To be used at my discretion.

648
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,798
- Anything else?

649
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,933
- I want it in writing,

650
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,134
And I want my partnership
protected

651
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:00,904
For as long
as this situation persists.

652
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,139
- Okay.

653
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,373
Before I give you
what you're asking--

654
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,109
- Jessica, you said I could have
whatever I want.

655
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,045
- I'm not trying
to talk you out of anything.

656
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,880
I just want to say that the fact

657
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,282
That named partner
isn't happening now

658
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,318
Doesn't mean it never will,

659
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,753
And I'd hate to see you

660
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:19,022
Throw in the towel
because you've lost faith.

661
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,491
- Yeah, well, the only thing
I'm throwing

662
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:23,861
Is my hat in the ring
for sheila's heart.

663
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,462
- I don't understand.

664
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,499
- I love her.

665
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,902
And I miss her.

666
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,805
And I want to try
to win her back,

667
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,342
And I need these things
to make that happen.

668
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,480
- Then you have them.

669
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,022
- Rachel, are you okay?
- I don't know.

670
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,290
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

671
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,958
I just can't be here,
and I can't be at home.

672
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,094
I can't be anywhere.

673
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:58,896
- Go see him.

674
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:01,064
- I don't even know where he is.

675
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,134
- Yes, you do.

676
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:08,038
He came here,
and everything went to sh--.

677
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,508
And I tried to explain,
and he wouldn't listen.

678
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,577
And then he said
we're just done.

679
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,046
- Rachel.
- I'm sorry, donna.

680
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:31,028
- Harvey, I know about
your issues with infidelity,

681
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,029
But--

682
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,430
- Donna, stop right there.

683
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,165
- No, I'm not gonna stop

684
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,267
Because you need to go talk
to mike about rachel.

685
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,038
- Need.
- Yes, need.

686
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,273
- Listen to me because I'm only
gonna say this once.

687
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,275
What she did
is between the two of them,

688
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,977
And I'm not gonna get
in the middle of it

689
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,379
One way or another,
but if I did,

690
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:53,317
It sure as sh--
wouldn't be to defend her.

691
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,118
- Harvey, your lack
of emotional awareness

692
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,554
- What the hell
are you talking about?

693
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,556
- I'm not asking you
to do this for rachel.

694
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,558
I'm asking you
to do this for mike.

695
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,493
- Like I said, I'm busy.

696
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,502
- May I?

697
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,471
- Since when do you
need permission?

698
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,206
- To come in, I don't.

699
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,108
- No, you don't.

700
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,378
- And I'll come back when you're
in a more receptive mood.

701
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,515
What exactly
am I being receptive to?

702
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:37,027
- You are not just any partner
in this firm.

703
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:43,267
And I need to take that
into consideration from now on.

704
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,036
- You sound like you're
saying that as damage control.

705
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,138
- I'm saying it
because I mean it.

706
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,640
- Then why does it still sound
like you're talking

707
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:52,342
To your employee?

708
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,379
- Because it's hard for me

709
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,180
To say
that I don't want to lose you

710
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,683
Over some stupid work bullsh--.

711
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,989
- Now, that's
what I'm talkin' about.

712
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,427
- So you just wanted to make it
hard for me.

713
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,030
- I just wanted
to hear you say it.

714
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,666
It being hard for you is on you.

715
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,169
- So we're good.

716
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:22,439
- Oh, yeah. We're good.

717
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,108
- All right.

718
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,710
- Jessica, one more thing.

719
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:31,315
If you don't want to lose me
over some stupid work bullsh--,

720
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:34,117
Then please don't do
stupid work bullsh--.

721
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,290
- You're fired.

722
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,597
- "simple term condition,"

723
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,233
Blah-blah, blah-blah.

724
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,070
- Yeah, it's all there.

725
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:55,005
You just need to sign
by the arrows.

726
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,407
- Mm-hmm.

727
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,510
Walk me through this one
more time.

728
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:04,715
Agrees to pay you
the aforementioned amount.

729
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,450
- Through a swiss account
or the caymans?

730
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:07,751
- Both, per your instructions.

731
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:10,020
Now are we done?

732
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:14,191
- You went to a lot of trouble
to shelter some money for me.

733
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,159
- Because you forced me to.

734
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,762
- Which got me to wondering.

735
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,630
What's to keep you from walking
out of here,

736
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,499
Growing a conscience,

737
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,068
And telling someone
about our little arrangement?

738
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,737
- Because if I do, I'll be
admitting to my own guilt,

739
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,171
Which you damn well know.

740
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,376
- Right, but what exactly
are you guilty of?

741
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:39,449
- That's your fee
for putting this deal together.

742
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,684
- I don't want a fee.

743
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,353
- That's exactly
why you're gonna take it.

744
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,356
You didn't bring me here
for you to sign on the arrows.

745
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,724
You brought me here for me
to sign on the arrows.

746
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,593
- Yep.

747
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,294
And I don't give a sh--
what you do with the money

748
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,462
After it goes into your account,

749
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,197
But it's going in there.

750
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,298
- I won't.

751
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,633
- It's up to you.

752
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,202
Now you can either close
this deal

753
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,604
Or go back
to writing in your diary

754
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:03,607
About what a loser
harvey specter thinks you are.

755
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,445
Sign it, pal.

756
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,358
- Mike,
what are you doing here?

757
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,527
- What are you doing here?

758
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:01,264
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

759
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,499
I'm here to take a job.

760
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,267
- Wait. What?

761
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,570
No, you can't do that.

762
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,639
- What do you care?
- Mike, listen to me.

763
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,609
I know I'm mad at you
about sheila,

764
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,777
But I don't care
about that right now.

765
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,213
You cannot take a job
with that man.

766
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,348
- I don't have
any other options, louis.

767
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,817
Because you paid that man
greenmail

768
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,652
To walk away from my deal
in the first place.

769
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:23,854
- Believe me, I wish I hadn't.

770
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,789
- What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

771
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,724
- Mike--
- you know what?

772
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,293
Doesn't matter.
None of it matters.

773
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,296
- This is about rachel,
isn't it?

774
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,899
She told me she hurt you.

775
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,734
Believe me, I understand,

776
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,237
But you cannot do this
because of that.

777
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,471
- This is a job, louis,
all right?

778
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,873
I'm not robbing a bank.
- It's not a job!

779
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,508
It's a decision,

780
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,742
And I'm not gonna let you
make it.

781
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:46,776
- Yeah?

782
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,646
What are you gonna do about it?

783
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,715
- Anything I have to.

784
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,892
- I thought
you wanted to see me.

785
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,894
- I wanted to see you both.

786
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:07,364
Is this about implementing
your request with sheila?

787
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,466
- It's about retracting
my request with sheila.

788
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,634
- What happened?
I thought--

789
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,202
- Nothing happened.

790
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,837
I hired mike ross
back at the firm.

791
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,572
- What?

792
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,773
- If sheila and I
are meant to be,

793
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:17,774
We'll make that work,

794
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,377
But mike was gonna do something

795
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,812
That I could not let him do.

796
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,782
So I'm using my reward on him.

797
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,784
- Okay, lewis, I--
- it's a great choice.

798
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,586
I'm proud of you.

799
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,421
Why don't you give me a minute
with jessica

800
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,490
And see if we can't get him
an office?

801
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:37,494
- Thank you, harvey.
Thank you both.

802
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:40,564
- I'd still like to be able
to take rosh hashanah off

803
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,966
If that's okay.

804
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,602
- I think we can work
something out.

805
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,739
- No way.
- Jessica.

806
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,775
- Mike ross is not coming back
to this firm.

807
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,443
- You heard louis.
He already gave him the job.

808
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,844
- He can un-give him the job.

809
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,513
- It's too late for that,
and you know it.

810
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,715
- Well, it damn sure didn't help
when you jumped on in there

811
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,916
And told him
it was a great choice.

812
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:03,653
And if I hadn't jumped in
and let you speak your mind,

813
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:04,788
You know
what he would have heard?

814
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,523
Something's wrong
with mike ross.

815
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,592
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do, and so do you.

816
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,293
This is louis
we're talking about.

817
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:11,761
And you rejected
his first request.

818
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,430
- Because it was unreasonable.

819
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:14,898
- And the only way
you're gonna convince him

820
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,467
That this is unreasonable
is to tell him why.

821
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,971
- Jessica, the only way
to make him take that offer back

822
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:24,674
Because he's gonna ask you why
again and again.

823
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:25,942
And no matter what you say,

824
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,644
He's gonna know
you're full of sh--.

825
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,613
And then how long do you think
it's gonna take him

826
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,314
To remember that last year,

827
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,683
He wondered if mike
even went to harvard.

828
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:40,523
- You could at least pretend
to hide how happy you are.

829
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:41,958
- I may be happy about it,

830
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,526
But you know I'm right.

831
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,528
And the truth is,

832
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,998
I never should have let him go
in the first place.

833
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,542
- You look a lot better
than the last time I saw you.

834
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,710
- Well, didn't you hear?

835
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:01,778
I got a new job.

836
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,747
- Oh, I heard.

837
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,382
- What're you getting at there,
harvey?

838
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,017
- What am I getting at?

839
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,018
Louis hires you.

840
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,419
You don't run it by me.

841
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,688
You don't even tell me
it's happening.

842
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,791
All I am anymore to you
is a clean set of sheets.

843
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,793
- Speaking of which, you might
want to up the thread count.

844
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,528
And run it by you?

845
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,530
You were practically begging me
to come back yesterday.

846
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:21,598
- I didn't beg sh--.

847
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,999
I posited a theory.

848
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,634
We both knew
it was never gonna happen.

849
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,036
I was just trying to make you
feel better.

850
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,805
- I guess it took louis
to do what you couldn't do.

851
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,474
- Hire an unqualified fraud?

852
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,943
I did that already.

853
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,078
Seriously, mike,

854
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,681
It's good to have things
back to normal.

855
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:40,817
- Yeah. Normal.

856
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:44,921
- Mike, I'm gonna say
something to you

857
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,923
That I have never told
you before.

858
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,925
I admire what you have
with rachel.

859
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,061
- Harvey--
- no, let me finish.

860
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,529
It's real.

861
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:53,563
It's hard to come by,

862
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,831
And all you have to do
to keep it

863
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,499
Is forgive her.

864
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,769
So if you want to stay
here tonight, by all means,

865
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,439
But I think
you should go home.

866
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,079
- Where are you going?

867
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,547
- I have to take care
of something

868
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,882
I should have days ago.

869
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,758
- Harvey.
You wanted to see me?

870
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,495
I wanted you to take a look
at a draft of the paperwork

871
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:26,663
To wrap up your deal.

872
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,398
- Why would you--

873
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,599
- Because I wanted
to let you know

874
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,935
How things are gonna be
moving forward.

875
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,704
You're gonna sign these papers
at 8:00 a.M. Tomorrow,

876
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,907
And at 8:01,

877
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,809
You're gone.

878
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,413
Harvey.

879
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:44,514
- Look, I don't give a sh--

880
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,082
How much business
you give my firm.

881
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,817
I never want to see you again.

882
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:48,952
- You're really gonna drop me?

883
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,387
- You're damn right I am.

884
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,889
And if you go to jessica
to try to overrule me,

885
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,825
The next time, it won't be mike
you get in a fight with.

886
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,160
It'll be me.

887
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,785
- You're home.

888
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,754
- I am.

889
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,059
Why aren't you at work?

890
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,561
- Because I spent
the whole day moving

891
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:05,728
From one place to another,

892
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,865
And I just had to talk
to you.

893
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,201
- How'd you know I'd be here?

894
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:14,838
- I didn't.
I just went to harvey's.

895
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,575
- Yeah.

896
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:21,177
Not there anymore.

897
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,579
- Are you back here?

898
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,914
- No.

899
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:30,253
No, I'm going to stay
somewhere for a while.

900
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:31,621
- Mike--

901
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:32,789
- Rachel,
whatever you're going to say,

902
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,757
Now is not the time to say it.

903
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:42,732
If you want there to be
a chance for us...

904
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:46,135
At all,

905
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,737
Just go back out a little longer

906
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,173
And let me get my things
together.

907
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,216
One more thing.

908
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:07,257
I'm coming back to work
tomorrow.

909
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:11,594
Then whatever you were going
to say to me

910
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,096
Won't matter.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
