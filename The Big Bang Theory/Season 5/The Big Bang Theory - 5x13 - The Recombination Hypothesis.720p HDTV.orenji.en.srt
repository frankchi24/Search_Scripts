1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:02,824
You feel like trying
something new for dinner?

2
00:00:02,825 --> 00:00:05,171
Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:07,349
You ever wonder how
humans would be different

4
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:10,614
if they evolved from lizards
instead of mammals?

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,952
Okay, let's talk
about that.

6
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:19,171
As you know, lizards--
cold-blooded animals--

7
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,296
lack the ability to
sense temperature.

8
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:24,274
But they do move more
sluggishly when it's cold.

9
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,995
So, lizard weathermen
would say things like,

10
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:30,345
"Bring a sweater,
it's slow outside."

11
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,534
I love my mind.

12
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,115
We all do.

13
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:38,544
Now, how about dinner?

14
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:42,848
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy
insects or smaller lizards.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,890
We could also pull each other's
tails off and grill them;

16
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:46,931
they'll just grow back.

17
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:50,791
Oh!

18
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:54,755
My life-size cardboard
Mr. Spock is here!

19
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:58,463
I know he wouldn't care for
an outburst of human emotion,

20
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:01,355
but, oh, goodie, oh,
goodie, oh, goodie.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,972
Commander Spock requesting
permission to be unfolded.

22
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:08,992
Excuse me.

23
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,543
Permission granted, Commander.

24
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:15,813
Which is why the more
intelligent the monkey,

25
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,484
the more feces they fling.

26
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:22,022
(knocks)
Excuse me, Amy.

27
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:24,098
Penny, do you have plans
for dinner tonight?

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,491
Why, you guys going somewhere?

29
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,649
No, I mean just you and me.

30
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:29,966
You mean, like a date?

31
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,922
Not like a date, a date.

32
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:36,175
Ooh...!
Ooh...!

33
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:40,257
Um... o-okay.

34
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,278
Sure.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,986
Ooh...!
Ooh...!

36
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,261
SHELDON:
Oh, no!

37
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:49,374
They sent the wrong Spock!

38
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:54,205
Live long and suck it,
Zachary Quinto.

39
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:56,449
<font color=#00FF00>The Big Bang Theory 5x13</font>

Original Air Date on January 19, 2012

40
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,489
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

41
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:24,644
This is so exciting.

42
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,309
If Leonard and Penny
get back together,

43
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,523
Howard and I can go on
double dates with them.

44
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:32,470
How come you never invite
Sheldon and me on a double date?

45
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:35,799
Mm, uh...

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,781
How's it going
in there, Penny?!

47
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,778
PENNY:
Just a sec.

48
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,625
Too much?

49
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,788
Yes.
No.

50
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:50,284
Okay, just hang on.

51
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:54,080
You just can't handle
her raw sexuality, can you?

52
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:57,193
When did you and Leonard
break up?

53
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:58,959
Uh, about two years ago.

54
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,238
Why do you think
he asked you out again?

55
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,188
I don't know.

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,420
Maybe he's dying.

57
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:05,568
That would be so romantic.

58
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,683
He's not dying.

59
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,630
Too bad.

60
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:12,127
If he were, she could just
throw him in bed

61
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,275
and ride him
right up until he flatlines.

62
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,801
How about this?

63
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:23,815
Maybe.
Come on.

64
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,662
Yeah, okay, no.

65
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,793
Do you think
you'll sleep with him tonight?

66
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:30,125
PENNY:
Absolutely not.

67
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,458
Look, we're just
gonna have dinner

68
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,239
and, you know,
see how it goes.

69
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,486
If he were dying,
would you sleep with him?

70
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:37,101
What?!

71
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:38,733
Assuming he were
dying of something

72
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:41,447
that couldn't be
sexually transmitted.

73
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,893
You know, like a spear wound
to the head.

74
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,525
Okay, he is not dying.

75
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,188
How do you know?
Are you a doctor?

76
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,403
You can make-believe, though.

77
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,550
Sometimes Howard and I pretend
that his arrhythmia is acting up

78
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:56,248
and I'm a sexy cardiologist.

79
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,459
And the naughty part is
I'm not in his HMO network.

80
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,120
Screw it. I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of this.

81
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,620
It's just dinner.

82
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,334
With a dead man.

83
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:10,899
(growls playfully)

84
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,864
Amy, stop it.

85
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,246
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

86
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:15,529
BERNADETTE:
Relax.

87
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,610
You know Leonard's
always been crazy about you.

88
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:18,825
It's gonna be great.

89
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,439
I know, but we've finally
gotten to a place

90
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,071
where we can hang out
without it being weird.

91
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,070
And what if something
goes wrong? Then what?

92
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,834
Guess it'll just
be Sheldon and me

93
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:28,681
going on a double date
with Howard and Bernadette.

94
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:32,394
Sure, we'd love that.

95
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:36,089
Change your clothes;
we got a lot riding on this.

96
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,049
Mm...

97
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,597
I want to build a road,

98
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,693
but I need wood.

99
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:50,925
Do either of you fellows
have wood?

100
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:59,416
I don't understand the laughter.

101
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:02,179
The object of Settlers of Catan

102
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,194
is to build roads
and settlements.

103
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:05,642
To do so requires wood.

104
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:09,156
Now, I have sheep; I need wood.

105
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:13,184
Who has wood for my sheep?

106
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,949
(both laughing)

107
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,795
Okay, how do I look?

108
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:21,460
More to the point, why
are you doing this?

109
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,375
What are you talking about?

110
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:23,839
Did you forget
what Penny did to you?

111
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:26,087
It took you two years
and defiling my sister

112
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,651
to turn that frown upside down.

113
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:31,981
I didn't defile your sister,
we had a relationship.

114
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:35,511
I heard you call her
Brown Sugar.

115
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:38,341
In my book,
that's defilement.

116
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:39,873
You want to know my opinion?

117
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,304
Oh, boy, do I!

118
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:44,468
Sarcasm?

119
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,800
No.

120
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:49,097
All right, then.

121
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,794
The reason you're fixated on

122
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:54,508
a good-natured simpleton
like Penny is that

123
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,921
she's the exact opposite of
your first romantic attachment:

124
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,886
your brilliant
yet intimidating mother.

125
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:02,134
Where on earth
did you get that from?

126
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:05,497
<i>It's in her book,
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.</i>

127
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,608
That doesn't make it true.

128
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,323
It's called nonfiction
for a reason, Leonard.

129
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:14,587
See you later.

130
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:17,235
If they ever make
a movie version

131
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:19,816
of that book, you know who
should play Leonard's mother?

132
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,497
Sandra Bullock.

133
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,361
Why?

134
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:27,207
Because she's great
in everything.

135
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:32,052
Now, where were we?

136
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:34,217
Oh, yes.
Does anyone have any wood?

137
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,266
(both snickering)

138
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,580
Oh, come on!

139
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:38,379
I just want wood.

140
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,176
Why are you making it so hard?

141
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,726
(both laughing)

142
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:51,565
So, do they have a name
for a first date

143
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,447
with someone
you used to go out with?

144
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,527
Oh, that's a good question.

145
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,059
How about "awkward"?

146
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:00,073
Yeah, that sounds right.

147
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:01,854
Yeah?

148
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:05,601
Hey, how about if we pretend
we're actually on a first date?

149
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:06,882
See how that goes.

150
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,898
Okay.

151
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,013
(clears throat)

152
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,560
So, Polly,
tell me about yourself.

153
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:13,592
(chuckles)

154
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:14,591
It's Penny.

155
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:16,539
Oh, sorry, yeah.
Awkward.

156
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,869
(laughs)

157
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,219
Okay, uh, let's see.

158
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:23,465
I'm from Nebraska, and ever
since I was a little girl,

159
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:26,046
I dreamed of moving to L.A.
and becoming a movie star.

160
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:27,627
Anyway,

161
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:30,408
after four years of acting
lessons and waiting tables,

162
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,356
I've done
a hemorrhoid commercial

163
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:35,037
and a production of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.

164
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,152
(chuckles)

165
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:39,199
So, you know,
dreams do come true.

166
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:41,113
Your turn.

167
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,179
Uh, let's see.

168
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:43,361
(clears throat)

169
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,674
Uh, I am an experimental
physicist at Cal-Tech,

170
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,938
most of my research is
with high-powered lasers,

171
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,269
and, oh, I've just gotten
a big government grant

172
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,601
to see if they can be used
to knock out

173
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:54,716
incoming ballistic missiles.

174
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:56,164
Wow. Can they?

175
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,962
Oh, God, no.

176
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:03,324
The money's pretty good.

177
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:08,035
And I used the equipment
to make my own Bat-signal.

178
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,167
(laughs)

179
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,333
Bat-signal?

180
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,782
What are you, some kind of nerd?

181
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:15,527
Not some kind of nerd,
I'm the king of the nerds.

182
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,993
(laughs)

183
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,988
What does that mean?

184
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,736
Uh, it means
if anyone displeases me,

185
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,332
I don't help them
set up their printer.

186
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,014
(laughs)

187
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,512
You are so funny.

188
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:30,728
Good.

189
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,643
Remember that
when I take my shirt off.

190
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,841
(both laugh)

191
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:36,722
Leonard, this is nice.

192
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,003
I'm so glad we did this.

193
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,103
Me, too.

194
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:42,283
So what do you think?

195
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:43,548
Are we gonna get back together?

196
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,162
Whoa. Not so fast.

197
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:48,010
I'm sorry, what did I say?

198
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:51,740
Leonard, you know I will always
have feelings for you.

199
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,288
Oh, God.
What?

200
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,704
You said "always."

201
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,268
You'll always have
feelings for me.

202
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,200
So?

203
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,732
So, that sounds more like

204
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:00,647
<i>something you'd say
if you didn't want</i>

205
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:01,779
a relationship with someone.

206
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:03,194
"This isn't working out,

207
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,975
but I'll always have
feelings for you."

208
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,856
"I'm sorry I slept
with your best friend,

209
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,754
but I'll always have
feelings for you."

210
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,220
"Here's the thing, Lisa,

211
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:13,966
I'm into dudes now, but I'll
always have feelings for you."

212
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:16,347
How would you say it?

213
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,245
I have feelings for you.

214
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:19,543
It's the same thing.
No, it's not.

215
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:20,909
"Always" made it worse.

216
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:21,907
You're overthinking this.

217
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,123
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

218
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,538
You always overthink things.

219
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,254
Th-There you go.
"Always" made it worse.

220
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,398
See, this is where everything
goes wrong: when we talk.

221
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,159
Well, I don't know how you have
a relationship without talking.

222
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:37,659
Hey, I went out with this guy TJ

223
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,023
for eight months,
we never talked.

224
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,238
To this day, I don't even know
what TJ stands for.

225
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,885
Wait, if you guys
didn't talk, what--

226
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,650
Never mind, stupid question.

227
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:52,875
And now that I have
some wood,

228
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:57,138
I'm going to begin
the erection of my settlement.

229
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:00,750
He's got to be
doing this on purpose.

230
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:02,299
(laughs)

231
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:05,695
Ooh, 8:30.

232
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:09,192
You and Penny decide to go out
and paint the town beige?

233
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:12,354
You're 30 years old
and you live with your mother.

234
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:17,183
I guess it didn't go well.

235
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:18,715
We don't know that.

236
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:19,864
Not to a certainty.

237
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,612
All we know
is that Leonard is home.

238
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:25,525
(Leonard screams)

239
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:28,005
How about now?

240
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,935
Again, not enough
evidence.

241
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:33,966
For all we know,
he's being murdered.

242
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,628
Now, back to our game.

243
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,975
You were in the middle
of an erection.

244
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:47,335
Oh, of course.
It's right here in my hand.

245
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,076
(cell phone chimes)

246
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:01,270
(grunting quietly)

247
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,818
What does she want from me now?

248
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,463
What's up?

249
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:11,960
Do not overthink this.

250
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,299
I don't understand.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

251
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,662
Okay, but earlier
it seemed like...

252
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:26,877
No talking.

253
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:31,106
Even during? 'Cause
sometimes I have questions.

254
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,880
(panting)

255
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,225
Well, that was fun.

256
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:46,006
Yeah, except for when I got
the foot cramp.

257
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:47,703
You hung in there, though.

258
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:50,500
There was a lot at stake.

259
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,231
So what do you
want to do now?

260
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,811
Well, I want to go get
my asthma inhaler,

261
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:58,009
but it might ruin the moment.

262
00:11:58,011 --> 00:11:59,824
(grunts)

263
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:02,821
Just, just
help me out here.

264
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,485
How does a miserable date
end in sex?

265
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:08,066
I don't know,
it's complicated.

266
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:09,814
Well, I'm
a pretty smart guy,

267
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,195
and right now my brain has
dibs on the blood supply,

268
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,193
so give it a go.

269
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:16,806
Okay, it's just,

270
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,721
at the restaurant
when you said

271
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:20,137
you wanted us to
be together again,

272
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,948
it got very real very
fast and I panicked.

273
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,180
Why?

274
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:28,245
What are you
afraid of?

275
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,959
Well, what if
we do go out

276
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,541
and I do something stupid
and dump you again?

277
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,838
What if I dump you?

278
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,988
(scoffs)

279
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:40,782
Come on, be serious.

280
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:43,279
Well, how about
if we don't think

281
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:45,243
about this
as a relationship?

282
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,774
It could be more like
a new version of software.

283
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:49,772
Penny and Leonard 2.0.

284
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:52,286
We can test it internally,
shake out the bugs,

285
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,085
and if we both feel
it's solid,

286
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,765
then we'll roll it out
to the public.

287
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:59,712
So we don't tell people
we're back together?

288
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:00,677
Exactly.

289
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,759
We pretend like our date
went badly.

290
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,906
Well, we don't really
have to pretend.

291
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:07,170
And we let them think
that we decided

292
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:08,336
to just be friends

293
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:10,250
and that everything's cool.

294
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,782
Okay, great.

295
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:12,781
(grunts softly)

296
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:14,946
Hey, I just remembered.

297
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,226
I still got one
of your inhalers.

298
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:21,522
I can't believe
you kept this.

299
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:24,186
Yeah, I was gonna throw it
away, but I just couldn't.

300
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,767
That is so sweet.

301
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,931
(sighs)

302
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:33,027
In 25 to 30 minutes
I'm gonna show you

303
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,625
how much
this means to me.

304
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:40,086
(toilet flushes)

305
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:47,694
Leonard?

306
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:49,876
Yeah, hi, hi.

307
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,789
How's it going?

308
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,488
Uh, can't complain.

309
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,452
Thanks for asking.

310
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,648
Well, what were you doing out
at 3:00 in the morning?

311
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,510
<i>Well, uh, uh...
what are you doing up?</i>

312
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,108
I was using the bathroom.

313
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:10,971
Yeah, well, so was I.

314
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:13,102
Really?

315
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,799
I didn't see you in there.

316
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:21,709
Obviously... when I saw
that you were in ours,

317
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:25,089
I went and used another one.

318
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:28,786
Where?

319
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:31,699
The, the gas station
across the street.

320
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,646
In your pajamas?

321
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:37,194
Yes.

322
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,408
Without shoes?

323
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,854
Yes.

324
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:46,517
On a cold
winter's night?

325
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,562
Yes.

326
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:55,557
Seems unlikely.

327
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,838
Did you bring
your asthma inhaler?

328
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,218
Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.

329
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,662
Well, then,
I guess it's plausible.

330
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:09,826
D-- hang on a
second, mister.

331
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,041
What?

332
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:15,752
After you used the facilities
at the gas station,

333
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,118
did you make a purchase?

334
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,816
What?

335
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,397
It's customary, when
using the restroom

336
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,860
at a retail establishment,
to make a small purchase.

337
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:25,942
Did you?

338
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:27,391
No.

339
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,755
(scoffs)

340
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:30,937
Here's two dollars.

341
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,597
Go buy some beef jerky.

342
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:46,071
I don't want beef jerky.

343
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,200
It's not about you.

344
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:52,748
It's about a poor immigrant
from Pakistan

345
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,562
trying to make his way
in America

346
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:55,994
by working the graveyard shift

347
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,657
at the Colorado Boulevard
Chevron.

348
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:02,737
Fine.

349
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,815
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.

350
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,478
Leonard will be here
in a moment.

351
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,008
He's looking
for a different parking space.

352
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,974
Why?

353
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,339
We were next to a car

354
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,920
with an "Ask me about my
grandchildren" bumper sticker,

355
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:21,634
and I was afraid if we ran
into them on the way out,

356
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:24,248
I'd be obligated
to do so.

357
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,025
I'm so disappointed it didn't
work with him and Penny.

358
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:30,691
Me, too.

359
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:31,857
Out of deference
to them,

360
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:35,319
let's not flaunt our
happy relationship.

361
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:37,651
You have a keen insight
into the human heart,

362
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:40,098
Amy Farrah Fowler.

363
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:45,392
We are next to a Suburu with
a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.

364
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:48,106
Well, I doubt they'd want to
talk about that, so we're fine.

365
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,336
I'm surprised to see you here

366
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:53,634
after it went
so badly with Penny.

367
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:55,266
Well, hey, we're grown-ups.

368
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:56,714
We can still be friends.

369
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,011
Boy, I don't know if I
could be friends with Howie

370
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,410
if we broke up.

371
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:01,259
Why not?

372
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,073
I'm a very vengeful person.

373
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:06,537
Really?

374
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,617
With access
to weaponized smallpox.

375
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,613
Here you go, guys, let me get
you going with some water.

376
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,195
You need menus
or you know what you want?

377
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,643
Leonard knows what he wants,
but it looks

378
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,592
like he's not gonna
get it from you.

379
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,137
Howard.
No,

380
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,520
that's okay, Bernadette.

381
00:17:22,522 --> 00:17:24,769
Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

382
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,233
Yeah, it's all good.

383
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:29,180
We-We'll always have
feelings for each other.

384
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,625
Oh, that's nice.

385
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:36,789
See, she knew
what "always" meant.

386
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,586
Wow, you're like a dog
with a bone, aren't you?

387
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,801
I'm just making a point.

388
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,281
Is the point that you don't know
when to let something go?

389
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:45,129
People, people,

390
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,629
please,
before you say

391
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,211
something you
both regret,

392
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,042
I'd like to place my order.

393
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,822
Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon.

394
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:54,320
You know why we can't be
together?

395
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:55,769
Because you always have
to be right.

396
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,267
Oh, that is not true.

397
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:58,532
I got to go
with Leonard on this.

398
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:01,030
He is wrong
more than anyone I know.

399
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,693
You know what?
I just realized I'm on a break.

400
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:04,942
I'll get someone else.

401
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:06,758
Well...

402
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,471
Leonard, promise me that when
our new waitress comes over,

403
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:12,468
you will not start a complicated
on-again, off-again relationship

404
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,216
with her,
because I am very, very hungry.

405
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,710
(grunting quietly)

406
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:22,906
(phone chimes)

407
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,951
Unbelievable.

408
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:34,578
Mind explaining to me
why you were being

409
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,111
such a jerk at the restaurant?
Well,

410
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:37,991
I was trying to act like
we weren't seeing each other.

411
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,390
That was the plan, right?
No,

412
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,721
the plan was to tell people
we decided to stay friends.

413
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:42,885
That's a little hard to do

414
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:46,432
when you're always being
such a tool bag.

415
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,230
You know what? I don't have to
stand here and take this crap.

416
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:51,095
The hell do you think
you're going?

417
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,258
Isn't sex after fighting
kind of what we do now?!

418
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,756
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

419
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,795
What are we doing?

420
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:07,993
What do you mean?

421
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:11,707
Every scenario I play out
for you and me ends badly.

422
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:14,087
That's because you
overthink everything.

423
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,351
<i>SHELDON: Leonard, are you listening
to me?</i>

424
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:17,783
What?
Yeah.

425
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,781
This is a disaster.

426
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,030
I distinctly ordered

427
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:23,478
the Leonard Nimoy Mr.
Spock cardboard standee.

428
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,025
Why would
I feel safer

429
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:27,889
with Zachary Quinto
at the foot of my bed?

430
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:33,266
<i>I don't know, he was
pretty badass on Heroes.</i>

431
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:36,496
You're right, I'll
give him a shot.

432
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:40,343
Hang on.

433
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,007
Penny, do you have
plans for dinner?

434
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,623
Why, you guys going somewhere?

435
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,538
No, I mean just you and me.

436
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,335
Ooh...!
Ooh...!

437
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,832
Uh, have you thought
this through?

438
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:54,361
Yes, and I think
we should go anyway.

439
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:57,991
No, can't do it.

440
00:19:57,993 --> 00:19:59,856
Sorry, Quinto,
you're going back.

441
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:10,912
If you and Leonard
get back together,

442
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:12,410
Sheldon and I
will finally have someone

443
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,092
to go on double dates with.

444
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,407
What about me and Howard?

445
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,839
Fine, we can double
with you, too.

446
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:21,034
So insecure.

447
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,916
Where are you guys going to eat?

448
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:27,730
Penny?

449
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,239
Do you, Penny, take Leonard to
be your lawful wedded husband?

450
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,280
Well, it's
a little late for me

451
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:45,561
to start saying no,
isn't it?

452
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,058
Penny.

453
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,173
Sorry,
just remembered

454
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,021
I've got to stop
at the drugstore.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
