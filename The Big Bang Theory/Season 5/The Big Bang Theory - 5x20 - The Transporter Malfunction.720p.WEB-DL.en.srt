1
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:04,984
Oh, my God.
I love this chicken.

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:06,569
Oh, you know
what they say,

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:10,072
best things in life
are free.

4
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:12,041
Okay, you're right.
I eat your food a lot.

5
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:12,992
Now, how about this?

6
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,793
You can raid my fridge
anytime you want.

7
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:16,579
Oh, that's
very kind of you.

8
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,748
Next time I have a hankering to
wash down a D-cell battery

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,417
with a jar of
old pickle juice,

10
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:23,575
(clicks tongue)
I'll come a-knockin'.

11
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:26,228
Hey, Raj, you didn't
send your RSVP in.

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,848
I'm suppose to ask you if you're
bringing someone to the wedding.

13
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:30,110
I'll let you know.

14
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,204
Well, can you make it soon?

15
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,579
There's a battle royale going on
over the seating charts.

16
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,707
In one corner, Bernadette's mom,
in the other three, mine.

17
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,131
Yeah, I hate
wedding receptions.

18
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:41,622
Yeah, I wish the bride and groom

19
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:43,151
would take a cue
from Bilbo Baggins.

20
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,369
Slip on the ring, disappear,
and everyone goes home.

21
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:49,495
Mm, you liked
Professor Geyser's wedding.

22
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:51,724
They had a
make-your-own-sundae bar.

23
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:54,161
Oh, that was
a night to remember.

24
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:58,727
Do you know, on one trip,
I just had a bowl of nuts.

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,441
Anyway, you got to let me know
if you have a plus one.

26
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:03,788
Because if not, my mom's trying
to sneak in the doctor

27
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,298
who sucked the fat
out of her neck.

28
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,083
All right, uh, fine.

29
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,086
I'm coming and
I'm bringing somebody.

30
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:14,571
Uh, Koothrappali plus one.

31
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:15,533
Who you bringing?

32
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:16,984
Who are you bringing?!

33
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:19,960
He's bringing me;
who are you bringing?

34
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:23,879
Wow, what a bunch of
Nosey O'Donnells.

35
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:25,547
Come on, who is it?

36
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:26,962
I'm not telling.

37
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:30,069
I'm from Asia,
I'm mysterious, deal with it.

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,776
Howard aren't having
a make-your-own-sundae bar?

39
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,783
I don't think so.

40
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:36,801
Well, you should.

41
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:38,877
50% of marriages end in divorce,

42
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:42,737
but 100% of make-your-own-sundae
bars end in happiness.

53
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,889
Hello, Mummy, Daddy.
How are you?

54
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:15,038
Pretty good.
Can't complain.

55
00:02:15,127 --> 00:02:16,385
Oh, I'm sure you can.

56
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:19,111
Just give it a minute.

57
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:20,718
Listen, uh,

58
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,629
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

59
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:25,303
I wasn't ready until now, but...

60
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:26,977
I think it's time.

61
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:28,543
It's finally happening.

62
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:31,197
You're coming out of
the closet, aren't you?

63
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:34,982
We love you, and we accept
your alternate lifestyle.

64
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:38,343
Just... keep it to yourself.

65
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,218
No, I'm not gay.

66
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,836
If anything, I'm metrosexual.

67
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,456
What's that?

68
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,157
It means I like women

69
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,410
as well as
their skin-care products.

70
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,128
Well, if you're
not coming out,

71
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,064
why did you call us during
the cricket semifinals?

72
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:57,201
I'm tired of trying
to meet someone,

73
00:02:57,203 --> 00:03:00,921
and I think I'd like you
to help me find a...

74
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:02,790
a wife.

75
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,534
And just to clarify...

76
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:06,358
a female wife?

77
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,450
Yes!

78
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:11,610
Matchmaking--
very smart move, son.

79
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,833
Much better than
marrying for love.

80
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,492
We married for love.

81
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:25,162
And it's been
wonderful!

82
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,685
Quantum physics
makes me so happy.

83
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:33,037
Yeah, I'm glad.

84
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,723
It's like looking
at the universe naked.

85
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:40,377
(moaning sigh)

86
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:43,497
(knocking)

87
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,382
Hi. Guys got a minute?

88
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:46,634
Sure. What's up?

89
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:49,202
Well, I was thinking about
Sheldon's little joke

90
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:51,071
the other night about me
eating all your food.

91
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:53,280
Oh! That was no joke.
But...

92
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,321
I understand your confusion,

93
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:57,477
as I am our group's
resident cutup.

94
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,331
I'm sorry,

95
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,232
you are our resident cutup?

96
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,568
Yes.

97
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,553
Oh, prove it.

98
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,605
Knock-knock.

99
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,273
- Who's there?
- Interrupting physicist.

100
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:12,192
Interrupting phys...
Muon! (laughs)

101
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,564
Anyway, I got a little residual
check from my commercial,

102
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:19,717
and I thought, hey,
how about I get the guys

103
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,069
a little thank you
to pay them back?

104
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:22,903
So, Sheldon...

105
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,460
ta-da!

106
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:27,227
(gasps)
A vintage mint-in-box

107
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:30,122
1975 Mego <i>Star Trek</i>
Transporter

108
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:31,644
with real transporter action.

109
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,551
Hot darn!

110
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,983
Where did you get that?

111
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,692
From Stuart,
at the comic book store.

112
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,180
You went to the
comic book store by yourself?

113
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,254
Yeah. It was fun.

114
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,646
I walked in, and two different
guys got asthma attacks.

115
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:48,839
Felt pretty good.

116
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,304
This calls for an
expression of gratitude.

117
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:53,970
Ooh, am I about to get
a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

118
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:56,349
No, not this time.
Then they wouldn't be special.

119
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:57,938
(clicks tongue)
Thanks, Penny.

120
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:01,072
You're welcome.

121
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,293
Don't worry,
I didn't forget about you.

122
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:04,343
Oh...

123
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,066
Leonard, I got you...

124
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:08,873
a label-maker!

125
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:17,311
Wow...

126
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:18,753
No, it's great.

127
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:21,738
- Also mint-in-box.
- Mm.

128
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:24,481
And I got you
a transporter, too!

129
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,016
Awesome!

130
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,451
Look, it was actually
designed for

131
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,983
my vintage Mr. Spock
action figure.

132
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:35,347
Oh, that's great! Let's open
them up and put him in there.

133
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,431
- Open it?!
- Oh, good Lord, no!

134
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,830
Why? They're just toys.

135
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:41,999
- They're collectibles.
- They're mint-in-box.

136
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,751
Come on. Can't we open
one up and take a look?

137
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:45,986
(screams)
No, don't!

138
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:49,123
Once you open the box,
it loses its value.

139
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,459
Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me the
same lecture about my virginity.

140
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,463
Gotta tell you,
it was a lot more fun

141
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:58,649
taking it out
and playing with it.

142
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:04,004
Are you sure you want us here
when you meet this woman?

143
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:04,972
Oh, yes.

144
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,140
In my culture, it's expected

145
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,142
to have a chaperone
to oversee a first date.

146
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:10,728
Plus, I want to make a good
impression, and no offense,

147
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,481
but with you guys here,
I look like I'm six-two.

148
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:18,986
The nuns always chaperoned
the dances at my high school.

149
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:23,123
They used to make us leave room
between us for the Holy Spirit.

150
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,658
Uh, Hindus do the same thing.

151
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,661
Except they leave room
for a cow. (chuckles)

152
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:31,215
Listen, I love your charming
racist humor, but any chance

153
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:33,584
you could not mock
my religion while she's here?

154
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,803
Yesterday, you made fun of me
for eating lox.

155
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,805
It's different, your people
don't worship lox.

156
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:40,858
Clearly, you've never been
to brunch with my cousins.

157
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:43,624
So, arranged marriages--
the parents just decide

158
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,359
and then you have
to get married?

159
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:47,301
No, no, I get a say in it.

160
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,350
But I'm sure whoever shows up
will be better company

161
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,781
than the threesome
I've been having

162
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:53,375
with Aunt Jemima
and Mrs. Butterworth.

163
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,818
Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

164
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:57,842
Ah, yes.

165
00:06:58,077 --> 00:06:59,109
You must be Lakshmi.

166
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:00,393
Uh, nice to meet you.

167
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:01,862
Nice to meet you, too.

168
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:02,746
(chuckles)

169
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,231
Oh! These are my friends.

170
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,649
- This is Bernadette.
- Hello.

171
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,436
- And this is Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

172
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,017
- You, too.
- Please, have a seat.

173
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,040
(quietly):
I'm thinking double wedding.

174
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:20,464
SPOCK:
<i>Dr. Cooper.</i>

175
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:25,402
<i>Dr. Cooper?</i>

176
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,637
Is someone there?

177
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,239
<i>Down here.</i>
<i>On your desk.</i>

178
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,703
Spock?

179
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,618
<i>I need to speak with you.</i>

180
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:40,455
Fascinating.

181
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,937
The only logical explanation
is that this is a dream.

182
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:46,858
<i>It is not the only</i>
<i>logical explanation.</i>

183
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:49,693
<i>For example,</i>
<i>you could be hallucinating</i>

184
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:54,198
<i>after being hit on the head</i>
<i>by, say, a coconut.</i>

185
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,847
Was I hit on the head
by a coconut?

186
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:01,922
<i>I am not going to</i>
<i>dignify that with a response.</i>

187
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:03,929
<i>Now to the matter at hand.</i>

188
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,497
<i>You need to play</i>
<i>with the transporter toy.</i>

189
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,395
But it's mint-in-box.

190
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:09,546
<i>Yes.</i>

191
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,632
<i>And to open it</i>
<i>would destroy its value.</i>

192
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:14,585
<i>But remember, like me,</i>

193
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,653
<i>you also have a human half.</i>

194
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:20,640
Well, I'm not going to
dignify that with a response.

195
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:23,060
<i>Consider this.</i>

196
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:24,928
<i>What is the purpose of a toy?</i>

197
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,330
To be played with.

198
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:29,333
<i>Therefore, to not</i>
<i>play with it would be...?</i>

199
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,492
Illogical.

200
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,190
Damn it, Spock, you're right.

201
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,651
I'll do it.

202
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,879
<i>Sheldon, wait.</i>

203
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,830
<i>You have to wake up first.</i>

204
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,358
Oh, of course.

205
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,026
Set phasers to dumb, right?
(chuckles)

206
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:48,822
Goodie, goodie, goodie!

207
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,557
This is wrong, this is wrong.

208
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,171
I'm so excited,
but this is wrong.

209
00:08:58,229 --> 00:08:59,980
I'm going to do it.

210
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,732
I'm doing it.

211
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:03,784
I did it.

212
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:07,037
(sniffs)

213
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,355
(sighs)

214
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,208
That's what I always thought
1975 smelled like.

215
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:17,631
One to beam down,
Mr. Scott.

216
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,466
Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

217
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:21,001
Energize.

218
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:26,490
Energize.

219
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,210
(plastic clink)

220
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:38,101
No. No.

221
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,103
Don't be broken.

222
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:42,739
Oh, please, don't be broken.

223
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:47,694
What did you make me do?!

224
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:50,998
Okay, okay, think.

225
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:59,623
It's only logical.

226
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,289
My goodness,

227
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,906
that was delicious.

228
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:10,709
Well, I hope you saved room
for chocolate lava cake.

229
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:12,750
Impressive.

230
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,891
What goes into
making something like that?

231
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:16,762
Well, you start
out by trying to

232
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,699
make chocolate soufflé,
and when it falls, you panic,

233
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,645
quickly change the name,
and voila, lava cake.

234
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,692
I bet our parents are dying to
know how things are going here.

235
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,644
Well, let's see.

236
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:31,814
Yep, three missed calls.

237
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,616
Four missed calls,
two text messages

238
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,684
and a failed video chat.
I win!

239
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,236
(chuckles)

240
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,956
So, what are
we going to tell them?

241
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,792
I'd like to tell them
things are going well.

242
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:43,960
Me, too.

243
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,628
But before we get
their hopes up,

244
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,080
we should probably make sure
we're on the same page.

245
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,999
Okay.

246
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:52,385
What page are you on?

247
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:53,669
I'm on the one

248
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,838
where I'm under
a lot of pressure

249
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,374
from my parents to get married
and settle down

250
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:00,009
and have a family,

251
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:03,162
and I'm going to do it
so they don't find out I'm gay.

252
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,233
Say again?

253
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,567
I'm gay.

254
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,337
Like... dude-on-dude,

255
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,973
but with women?

256
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,442
I know a fake marriage
isn't an honest way to live,

257
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,894
but you of all people
should know how difficult it is

258
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,396
to come out in our culture.

259
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:23,232
Why me of all people?!

260
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,685
Well, there's a rumor
back in New Delhi that you're--

261
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,186
how shall we say--

262
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,839
comfortable in a sari.

263
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,924
I'm not gay!

264
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:33,426
Really? The chocolate lava cake,

265
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:36,095
the little soaps
in the bathroom, and I'm sorry,

266
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:38,798
but you're wearing
more perfume than I am.

267
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,269
That's Unbreakable
by Khloe and Lamar.

268
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,971
And for your information,
it's unisex.

269
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,690
Fill in the blank.

270
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,425
I love the nightlife...

271
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:50,876
I like to boogie.

272
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:51,927
Got you.

273
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,564
With women! I like
to boogie with women!

274
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,500
That's disappointing.

275
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:00,202
You were exactly the kind
of phony-baloney husband

276
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:01,771
I was looking for.

277
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:03,439
Thank you.

278
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:07,410
And once again, my
baloney likes girls.

279
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,778
W-W-Wait!

280
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,997
You don't want to put a
bite of that in your mouth

281
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,433
without trying my
homemade Chantilly cream.

282
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:18,104
Yeah, okay,
that time I heard it.

283
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,736
Oh, dear.

284
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:37,239
Two suns and no sunscreen.

285
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:43,312
<i>Hello again, Sheldon.</i>

286
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,184
What is it now, Tiny Spock?

287
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:50,252
I am very disappointed in you.

288
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:52,855
You broke your toy
<i>and switched it with Leonard's.</i>

289
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,224
<i>You should be</i>
<i>ashamed of yourself.</i>

290
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,960
You're the one who told
me to play with it.

291
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,262
<i>If I told you to jump off</i>
<i>the bridge of the</i> Enterprise,

292
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:01,730
<i>would you do it?</i>

293
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:04,899
Oh, if I got on the bridge
of the <i>Enterprise,</i>

294
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:07,044
I would never, ever leave.

295
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:11,928
<i>Trust me, it gets old</i>
<i>after a while.</i>

296
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,877
<i>You must right</i>
<i>your wrongs, Sheldon.</i>

297
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,482
Why? I got away with it.

298
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:20,985
Leonard has his toy,
and he's never going to open it,

299
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:22,354
so he won't know it's broken.

300
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,593
And I have a toy
that isn't broken.

301
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:25,871
Everybody's happy.

302
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:27,781
<i>Well, I am unhappy.</i>

303
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:30,442
I thought where you come from
they don't have emotions.

304
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:35,418
<i>I come from a factory</i>
<i>in Taiwan.</i>

305
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,550
<i>Now, do the right thing.</i>

306
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,710
You know what you are?

307
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:42,297
Well, you're
a green-blooded buzz kill.

308
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:44,873
Perhaps it's time
you beam on out of here.

309
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,808
Fine.

310
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,960
<i>I will just use</i>
<i>the transporter.</i>

311
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:49,369
Oh, right.

312
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,614
<i>You broke it.</i>

313
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,442
Very well.

314
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:57,623
Cooper to <i>Enterprise,</i>
one to beam up.

315
00:13:58,023 --> 00:14:00,156
Energize.

316
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,628
(roaring)

317
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:08,747
(screaming)

318
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,266
(grunts softly)

319
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:13,632
Tiny Spock, help.

320
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,651
Ready for lunch?

321
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,149
Yeah, one sec.

322
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:24,008
Oh, good.
Ma would've killed me

323
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:27,376
if she found out
I broke my retainer.

324
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,351
Hey, uh...

325
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:31,753
can I run something by you?
It's about Lakshmi.

326
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,022
Yeah, sure.
How are things going?

327
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:35,630
We hit a couple
of bumps.

328
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:36,835
She lives
over in Manhattan Beach,

329
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,953
so it takes, like, an hour
to get there.

330
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,308
And she's a lesbian.

331
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,745
What do you mean,
"she's a lesbian"?

332
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,251
Well, you know how
whenever you and I would try

333
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,238
to hit on women in bars
and they'd blow us off

334
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,422
and then we'd tell each other
they were probably gay?

335
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,518
It's like that.

336
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:55,075
Except this time, it's true.

337
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,499
Then why did she even
go out with you?

338
00:14:58,537 --> 00:14:59,580
She was looking

339
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,416
for a husband so she can
appear to be straight.

340
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,432
And, you know,

341
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:04,615
it sounded crazy
to me at first...

342
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:07,961
but I'm actually
thinking about doing it.

343
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,012
Okay, so the reason
that might sound crazy...

344
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:14,029
is 'cause it's <i>crazy!</i>

345
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:16,754
Look, Howard,
you're in a relationship.

346
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:18,543
You know you have
to make compromises.

347
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:22,228
Yes, but my compromises
are about which bedspread to buy

348
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,337
or whose turn
it is to do the laundry,

349
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:26,278
Bernadette's or my mom's.

350
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:31,058
It's a great deal.

351
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,793
We both get our parents
off our backs,

352
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:35,396
I don't have to come home to an
empty apartment every night.

353
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:38,065
Plus, once I'm married, I
can finally eat carbs again

354
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,818
and let myself go.

355
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,136
Why don't you
tell your parents

356
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:45,522
you want to try
to find someone else?

357
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:48,575
Maybe one who hasn't slept with
more woman than you.

358
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:51,195
Because this one
wants to marry me.

359
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:54,147
I might never find
another one who does.

360
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,333
So you're seriously thinking
about marrying someone

361
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:58,335
you're never gonna
have sex with?

362
00:15:58,337 --> 00:15:59,787
I can't believe your attitude.

363
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:02,873
I thought you were in favor
of gay people getting married.

364
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,127
Yes, to other gay people!

365
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:11,315
Do you hear how
homophobic you sound?

366
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:27,147
(sighs)

367
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,838
Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

368
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,397
Nothing!

369
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,899
What?

370
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,101
Nothing. I said nothing.

371
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:05,102
That was weird.

372
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,437
Really? I don't
even notice anymore.

373
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:11,391
I cannot believe you guys
aren't gonna play with these.

374
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,393
Well, I told you, you don't.
It's mint-in-box.

375
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,230
I don't know.
I just think it's a waste.

376
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:18,398
(squeals)

377
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:24,237
Relax. I'm just
looking at the box.

378
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,923
Perhaps you should
look with your eyes

379
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:29,242
and not your muscular
Nebraska man hands.

380
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:32,245
What is your problem?!

381
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:35,415
My problem is that I don't want
you to break Leonard's toy.

382
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,301
Which you probably
did by shaking it!

383
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,137
She shook it,
we all saw her.

384
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,438
Leonard, I bought you this

385
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,473
'cause I wanted you
to have fun with it.

386
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:45,442
I don't want it
to sit in this box.

387
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:48,061
You know,
you're right.

388
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,196
I mean,
it's from you,

389
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,448
I'm never
gonna sell it.

390
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,933
- I'm opening it.
- Yes!

391
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:54,651
(nervous yelp)

392
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:07,047
- It's broken.
- What?

393
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,166
Oh, nice job, man hands!

394
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:11,585
I didn't break it.

395
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:14,671
I guess Stuart
sold it to me like this.

396
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:17,257
Yes. Yes, he did.

397
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:20,727
That is a perfectly satisfying
and plausible explana...

398
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:22,446
Let's all be mad at Stuart!

399
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:25,315
You know, I paid
a lot for this.

400
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,133
Let's take it
over there and show him.

401
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,619
Absolutely.

402
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:32,322
Wait!

403
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,994
It was me.

404
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:40,330
I opened your toy...

405
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:44,284
discovered it was broken
and didn't tell you.

406
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:46,870
Why would you
open mine?

407
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:49,089
I didn't. That was a lie.

408
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:51,842
I opened my own toy...

409
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:55,379
and it was already broken,
so I switched them.

410
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:57,848
You should talk
to Stuart.

411
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,950
I can't, because that was a lie.

412
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:03,553
Yours was broken
in an earthquake--

413
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:05,973
and that's a lie.

414
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,676
What is the truth?

415
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:12,446
My Mr. Spock doll
came to me in a dream

416
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,197
and forced me to open it.

417
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:18,285
And when the toy broke,
I switched it for yours.

418
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,353
Later, he encouraged me
to do the right thing,

419
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:21,688
and I defied him.

420
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,992
And then I was attacked
by a Gorn.

421
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:30,914
Okay, that I believe.

422
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,366
Leonard, Penny, I just,
I want you both to know

423
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,702
that I regret my actions
towards the two of you.

424
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:37,704
That's a lie.

425
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:40,257
So, is that one mine?

426
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:41,258
Yes.

427
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,343
Well, hand it over
so I can open it.

428
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:44,978
Okay.

429
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,714
And, Leonard, even though
I don't have one anymore,

430
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:50,050
I hope you have fun
playing with it.

431
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:52,903
And that's a lie, right?
It's a big, fat whopper.

432
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:56,239
I hope it breaks.

433
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:04,128
This is a treat.

434
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:05,995
What brings
you guys by?

435
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,348
Raj, Howie told me what's
going on with you and Lakshmi.

436
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,883
You told her?

437
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,553
I told everybody.

438
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,222
We believe there's
someone out there

439
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:17,724
who will love
you for you.

440
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,592
Actually, we kind of
agreed to disagree

441
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,644
on that one,
but we both think

442
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,879
you shouldn't
marry this woman.

443
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:26,882
So, while I'm waiting for
this mysterious perfect match

444
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:30,236
who may or may not exist,
I'm supposed to just be alone?

445
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,572
Not necessarily.
I think

446
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:36,492
we found someone
for you to cuddle with.

447
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:39,495
(gasps)
Oh, my goodness.

448
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:43,732
Aren't you the cutest
little Yorkie ever!

449
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:46,735
You got him for me?

450
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:50,123
Her. We thought you two
would hit it off.

451
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,574
I think we already have.

452
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,409
Thank you guys so much.

453
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:57,465
Let's go see
if you fit in my man purse.

454
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,103
Heterosexual, my ass.
