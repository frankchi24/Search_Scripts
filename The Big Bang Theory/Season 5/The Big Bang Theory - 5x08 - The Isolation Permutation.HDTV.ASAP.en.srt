1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,446
So, Bernadette, how goes
the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:06,013
Well, if you don't mind
looking like

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:07,815
an orange traffic cone, great.

4
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:10,568
Girlfriends,
I have the answer

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,736
to our dress problems.

6
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:12,787
Really?

7
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,905
12 years ago,
my cousin Irene

8
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:16,023
and her entire family died

9
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:18,025
in a horrific
carbon monoxide accident

10
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:20,077
the night before her wedding.

11
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,713
That's horrible.

12
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,498
Yes and no.

13
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:27,551
All those bridesmaids dresses
remain unused

14
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:29,754
and available to us for free.

15
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:31,756
So it seems

16
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,557
that cloud of
odorless deadly gas

17
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,342
had a silver lining after all.

18
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:36,844
Check it out,

19
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:37,878
still in the bags.

20
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,847
The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

21
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:43,818
I don't know.

22
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,486
Dead people's dresses?

23
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:47,521
Yeah, and
cap sleeve

24
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:49,273
Eh...

25
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,558
Oh, I was hoping
you wouldn't notice.

26
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,694
Irene was always
a slave to a good bargain

27
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:54,895
when it came to clothes,

28
00:00:54,897 --> 00:00:57,164
and sadly as it turned out,
space heaters.

29
00:00:58,366 --> 00:00:59,950
Ladies, please.

30
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:04,455
These four walls once housed
an intellectual salon

31
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:06,573
where the mind
received nourishment

32
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:08,125
as well as the stomach.

33
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:11,078
But through no one's fault,
Penny,

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,131
the quality of
dinner conversation

35
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,250
in this apartment
has declined.

36
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:20,271
And again, I'm looking at
no one in particular, Penny.

37
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:22,723
Fine.

38
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:24,275
What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?

39
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:26,727
"What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?"

40
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,896
Why do you hate us?

41
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:31,431
I've prepared a number of topics

42
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,983
that should appeal
to both the advanced

43
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:35,653
and novice
conversationalists.

44
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:37,705
Okay, that time
you looked at me.

45
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:39,707
Who didn't?

46
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,125
Your skin is
like alabaster.

47
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,461
Do you even
have pores?

48
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,549
"Faster-than-light particles
at CERN--

49
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,484
"paradigm-shifting discovery

50
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:53,838
or another Swiss export as
full of holes as their cheese?"

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,222
And converse.

52
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,025
All right, who wants to go

53
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,426
to my apartment and look at
bridal magazines?

54
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:00,728
Oh, me.

55
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,564
Through no one's fault, Sheldon,
we're leaving.

56
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,234
Wait for <i>moi.</i>

57
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:09,153
You're leaving?

58
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:11,939
Sheldon, sometimes you forget,
I'm a lady.

59
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,073
And with that comes

60
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:14,658
an estrogen-fueled need
to page through

61
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,077
thick glossy magazines
that make me hate my body.

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,168
New topic: women.

63
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,205
Delightfully mysterious
or bat-crap crazy?

64
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,206
Totally.

65
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,657
What's wrong with cap sleeves?

66
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,294
If you have the right figure
for it, they're adorable.

77
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:05,206
Hey, Amy, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

78
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,042
Your neurology department
loaned me a culture of prions

79
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:10,828
for my research on bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.

80
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,686
She popped by to borrow
a cup of mad cow disease.

81
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:23,107
It's hard to make degenerative
brain maladies hilarious,

82
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,943
and yet somehow you do it.

83
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,897
That's fun to have
in a lunchroom.

84
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:31,115
The real fun starts
when you get to pick the rat

85
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,184
you're going to feed it to,
and maybe you choose

86
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:36,037
the beady-eyed little mother
who's been biting you all week.

87
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,823
Please, we're eating.

88
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,458
Can we get that
off the table

89
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,459
and change the subject?

90
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:42,410
Can we?

91
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,245
Stand back...

92
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:48,883
while I turn this conversation
into a "conver-sensation."

93
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,002
This time, it's your fault.

94
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:54,556
I have 100
alphabetized topics from

95
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:57,592
"artichoke-- come on, people,
it's just a giant thistle,"

96
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:02,897
to "zzz-- the onamona-poetry
of sleep."

97
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:04,882
Amy, how long
would it take

98
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:07,902
for that mad cow disease
to kill me?

99
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,938
I don't know,
four or five years.

100
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,724
No, it's not gonna do it.

101
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:19,747
Oy. Bernadette keeps
texting me pictures

102
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:22,333
of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.

103
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,952
They're out shopping right now?

104
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:24,919
Yeah.

105
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,120
Just the two of them?

106
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:27,738
I guess.

107
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:32,043
That's cool, that's cool.

108
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:33,962
Why are they asking me
about this stuff?

109
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,432
What guy knows
what a sweetheart neckline is?

110
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:52,280
Leonard's coming down
the home stretch!

111
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,035
Come on, horsey,
you can do this!

112
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:02,323
Damn. Come on, thigh muscles,
you can do this!

113
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,793
Yes! First place.

114
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:09,881
I would have been a great jockey
if I weren't too tall.

115
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,885
And scared of horses.

116
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,136
Sheldon, you're up.

117
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:16,638
What?

118
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,805
Come on, it's your turn.

119
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:20,341
We said we'd get more fresh air.

120
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:21,926
Sorry.

121
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,261
I'm a little distracted.

122
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:25,430
I can't seem
to get in touch with Amy.

123
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,298
I tried e-mail, video chat,

124
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,799
tweeting her,
posting on

125
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:31,269
her Facebook wall,
texting her, nothing.

126
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,237
Did you try calling her
on the telephone?

127
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:36,157
The telephone.

128
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,280
You know, Leonard,
in your own simple way,

129
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,982
you may be the wisest of us all.

130
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:47,168
Voice mail.

131
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,922
Curiouser and curiouser.

132
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,590
If you're worried,
we can go over there

133
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:53,824
and see if she's all right.

134
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:54,992
Okay.

135
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:56,461
You know, I heard
in the news

136
00:05:56,463 --> 00:06:00,431
a bobcat has been spotted
in her neighborhood.

137
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:03,301
I don't think
Amy was eaten by a bobcat.

138
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:06,187
Who thinks Amy was
eaten by a bobcat?

139
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,639
You do?

140
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:12,643
Leonard, I was just mentioning
an interesting local news item.

141
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:15,863
Now, thanks to you, I'm worried
Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.

142
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:17,949
Forget about the bobcat.

143
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:20,702
How can I?
You won't stop talking about it!

I don't like weepy. Let's go.

Where are you going?

157
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:01,492
I'm single, I don't
need this crap.

158
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:05,062
Sheldon, what are you
doing here?

159
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:06,197
You didn't respond to

160
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,166
any of my electronic
communications.

161
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:09,951
I wanted to be alone.

162
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,539
Would you like to talk about it?

163
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:19,677
And keep in mind that "no"
is a perfectly viable answer.

164
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,014
Sheldon, my world is
crumbling around me.

165
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:25,249
Point of order.

166
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,252
As you're in distress,
it would be customary

167
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:30,471
for me to offer you
a hot beverage.

168
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:33,524
But I'm a guest in your home,

169
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:37,028
so it would be customary for you
to offer me a beverage.

170
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:41,949
How do you want to proceed
vis-à-vis beverages?

171
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,117
It doesn't matter.

172
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,486
Nothing matters.

173
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,792
If you'd like to take your mind
off what's troubling you,

174
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:55,163
uh, word on the street is
a bobcat has been spotted.

175
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:57,948
Penny and Bernadette
went shopping

176
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,783
for bridesmaids dresses
without me.

177
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:05,456
And that made
you feel... sad?

178
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,058
Yes.

179
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,810
I knew it.

180
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:10,761
Just keep going.

181
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:12,847
I guess I'm
good at this.

182
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,851
It's just, I thought
they liked hanging out with me,

183
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:19,237
but I guess I was
fooling myself.

184
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,989
When they were
over here,

185
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:25,809
did you fail to offer
them a beverage?

186
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,748
'Cause I can see how that
could stick in someone's craw.

187
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,918
Sheldon, I'm going
to ask you something,

188
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,003
and I'd like you
to keep an open mind.

189
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:37,371
Always.

190
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:40,541
At this moment, I find myself

191
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:42,760
craving human intimacy
and physical contact.

192
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,662
Oh, boy.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,936
You know ours is a
relationship of the mind.

194
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,338
Proposal.

195
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,357
One wild night
of torrid lovemaking

196
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,893
that soothes my soul
and inflames my loins.

197
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:06,200
Counterproposal.

198
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:09,520
I will gently
stroke your head

199
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:13,357
and repeat, "Aw,
who's a good Amy""

200
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:18,412
How about this?

201
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:21,165
French kissing--
seven minutes in heaven

202
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,135
culminating in second base.

203
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:30,308
Neck massage...

204
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,929
...then you get me
that beverage.

205
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,886
We cuddle. Final offer.

206
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:45,439
Very well.

207
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:54,599
Oh, boy.

208
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:20,041
I'm just saying,
second base is right there.

209
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,508
Mm, I'm thinking
about adopting

210
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:31,961
some quirky affectation,
like a pipe or a monocle

211
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,680
or a handlebar mustache.

212
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:37,500
For all those girls out there

213
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:40,369
looking for
the Indian Monopoly man?

214
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:45,074
This is not a safe place.

215
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,393
You can't share anything here.

216
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:53,365
The two of you need to get
your women in line!

217
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:55,985
What?

218
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,786
Last night I was strong-armed

219
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,938
into an evening
of harp music and spooning

220
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,874
with an emotional
Amy Farrah Fowler.

221
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,075
This on a night

222
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:04,943
that I had originally
designated for solving

223
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,279
the space-time geometry
in higher-spin gravity

224
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,798
and building my Lego Death Star.

225
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:14,420
And why? Your gal pals,
Penny and Bernadette,

226
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,722
went out shopping for some
wedding nonsense without Amy,

227
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,058
an action they took
with no thought or regard

228
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,177
as to how it would affect me,
the future of string theory

229
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:24,730
or my Lego fun time!

230
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,850
What do you want <i>us</i>
to do about it?

231
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:30,185
You clearly weren't listening
to my topic sentence:

232
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:32,104
Get your women in line!

233
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:35,658
You make them apologize to Amy
and set things right.

234
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,644
I am a man of science,
not someone's snuggle bunny!

235
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:41,313
Why do I have
to talk to Penny?

236
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:42,665
She's not my girlfriend.

237
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,416
You invited her to lunch
four years ago.

238
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,785
Everything about her is on you;
you make it so!

239
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,124
- Moo-shu is Penny.
- Thank you.

240
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:53,542
Where's Sheldon?

241
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:54,927
He was up late last night,

242
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,130
so I gave him an early dinner
and put him to bed.

243
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,632
That's so sweet.

244
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,885
Yeah, but now he's gonna be
up at dawn and want to play.

245
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,471
So, listen, guys,

246
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,057
the reason he was up late
is because he was

247
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,358
taking care of Amy.

248
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,893
She's kind of upset.

249
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:11,944
Why?

250
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,612
Her feelings got hurt
because you guys

251
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,030
went dress shopping without her.

252
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:17,032
I told you that
would happen.

253
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,318
Okay, look, this is her first
time being a bridesmaid

254
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,687
and she's just getting
a little crazy with it.

255
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:24,241
She keeps on telling us
stories about bridesmaid

256
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:26,479
traditions in other cultures,
and they're all about

257
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,198
getting naked and
washing each other.

258
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,419
Yeah, and
she keeps trying

259
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,672
to figure out if our
cycles have synced up

260
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:43,258
so we can call ourselves
"The Three Menstra-Teers""

261
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:48,230
We thought it would be easier to look
at dresses one time without her.

262
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:49,848
I feel terrible.

263
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,017
I know. Me, too.
We'll talk to her.

264
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,267
Hey, wait,

265
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,569
how did she find out?

266
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,939
Raj did it.

267
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:02,861
And he says he
would do it again.

268
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:05,914
Hey, I'm sorry.

269
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,734
You sent me the picture;
I wasn't thinking.

270
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,619
- Oh, Howie.
- Well, hey, I'm usually

271
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,070
pretty good at
not blabbing.

272
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:13,872
You tell me
tons of stuff

273
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:16,592
about these guys,
and I never repeat it.

274
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,512
- What do you tell him?
- Oh,

275
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:21,747
you know, just pillow talk.

276
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,299
You guys have nothing
to worry about.

277
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:26,101
Hold on, did you talk about us
when we were dating?

278
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:29,371
No. All your little
secrets are fine.

279
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:36,195
Yes, absolutely fine.

280
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,766
I'll tell you later.

281
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:47,122
Come on, tumor.

282
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:51,543
Come on, tumor, Mama needs an
aggressive little glioblastoma.

283
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:55,464
Yay, brain tumor!

284
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:59,951
Probably not the same reaction
you had when <i>you</i> got the news.

285
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,589
- Hi.
- Hello.

286
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:05,174
What are you doing here?

287
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,176
Well, look, we just
wanted to apologize

288
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,511
for not bringing you
with us the other day.

289
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:12,097
That's not necessary--
it's like <i>Sesame Street</i> says:

290
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:14,483
"One of these things
is not like the other,

291
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:17,986
one of these things
should die alone."

292
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,355
Come on, Amy, let us
make it up to you.

293
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:21,607
We'll have a girl's night;

294
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,192
we'll do whatever
you want.

295
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,810
We can go down
to the Korean baths

296
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,495
and do that thing
you were talking about

297
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,664
where we wash each other.

298
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:32,484
With-with loofah mitts,
no hands.

299
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,571
It's okay.
I'm glad this happened.

300
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,290
I can stop pretending
that some beautiful girl

301
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,008
and her cute-in-
the-right-light friend

302
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,261
want to hang out with me.

303
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,329
Amy, we're really sorry.

304
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,997
Yeah, we
feel awful.

305
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,183
Don't. I'll be okay.
You're not the first girls

306
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:50,886
I thought were friends with me
who ended up shunning me.

307
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,105
It's like elementary school,
junior high,

308
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:55,107
high school, undergrad,
grad school,

309
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:58,060
and that semester abroad
in Norway all over again.

310
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,611
Oh, come on, Amy.

311
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,364
You don't get it.

312
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,116
Look at this brain.

313
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:06,952
I don't really want to.

314
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:09,154
This is us.

315
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:11,156
Bernadette,
you are the analytical,

316
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:12,858
scientific left hemisphere.

317
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,044
Penny, you're the creative,
spontaneous right hemisphere.

318
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,297
And where's Amy?

319
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,866
She's right here--
the sad little tumor

320
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:23,469
no one wants to go
dress shopping with.

321
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:27,673
Amy, you're not a tumor.

322
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,058
Penny, tell her
she's not a tumor.

323
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:43,388
Did you know that when
Alexander Graham Bell

324
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,252
invented the telephone,

325
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,989
he proposed answering
it with "ahoy"?

326
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,747
Ahoy.

327
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,501
I like it.

328
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:58,036
Amy? Is that you?

329
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:00,205
Have you been drinking?

330
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,842
I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?

331
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:07,513
Well, all right.
We're on our way.

332
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,214
What's going on?

333
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:13,886
It would seem Amy is drunk
in a liquor store parking lot.

334
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:15,354
Really? Amy?

335
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:17,139
Leonard, be glad
you can't keep a woman.

336
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:18,607
They are a handful.

337
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:27,032
Oh, look.

338
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:28,767
It's Sheldon and little Leonard.

339
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,203
Hi, little Leonard.

340
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,405
Hi, Amy.

341
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,040
Hey, Cuddles.

342
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,209
Cuddles?

343
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:38,994
Yes, Cuddles.
We cuddled.

344
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:40,412
Grow up, Leonard.

345
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:45,000
- Amy, what are you doing here?
- Well,

346
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:47,219
I came here to get
a bottle of wine

347
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:50,121
like Penny taught me to do
when you're sad.

348
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:53,805
Yeah, but why didn't you
go back to your apartment?

349
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,144
Didn't you go
to high school, Leonard?

350
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:58,313
Parking lots are where
all the cool kids hang out.

351
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:01,800
Not that the rat bastards
ever invited me.

352
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:03,352
Maybe we should
get you home.

353
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,303
Oh, hang on, hang on,
hang on. Sheldon,

354
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:09,024
what would it take for you
to go into that liquor store,

355
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:10,609
buy a bottle of hooch,

356
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:13,061
take me across the
street to that motel,

357
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:16,164
and have your way with me?

358
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:20,869
Yeah, Sheldon,
what would it take?

359
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,425
I'm begging both of you,
please, let's go.

360
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:27,843
Okay.

361
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,327
Come on.

362
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:31,046
- Upsy-daisy.
- Whee!

363
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,682
Ooh, finally someone
found second base.

364
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:40,589
I know how you feel.

365
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:44,893
I got a knife slicing
through my frontal lobe, too.

366
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,896
Hi.

367
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,180
What do you want?

368
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:51,617
Do you want me to give
the friendship bracelet back?

369
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:54,786
I never gave you
a friendship bracelet.

370
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:58,457
When we first met, I made one
and pretended you gave it to me.

371
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,509
You can have it back
if you want.

372
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:05,263
No, you made that for you;
I want <i>you</i> to have it.

373
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:08,750
We know you're upset,
and you have every right to be,

374
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:11,136
but if it's okay with you,
we'd like a second chance

375
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:12,203
to make things right.

376
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:13,772
We are really sorry,

377
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:16,425
and we were trying to think
of some way to show you

378
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:17,893
how much we
care about you.

379
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:18,927
Which is why

380
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:20,896
it would mean so much
if you would agree

381
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,931
to be the maid of honor
at my wedding.

382
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:26,401
What? Wait, is this some kind
of practical joke?

383
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,570
Like in Norway,
when my "friends"

384
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:31,773
trapped me in a sauna
with a horny otter?

385
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:38,330
No. I-I want you to be
the maid of honor.

386
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:39,948
Oh, my gosh.

387
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,668
No one's every asked me to be
the maid of honor before.

388
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,952
Well, that's not true.

389
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,672
Once, but then they all died.

390
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:50,258
So is that a yes?

391
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,294
Yes. Yes.

392
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:53,962
Oh, my gosh,

393
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,297
I-I have so much to do.

394
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,683
There's the bridal shower
and the bachelorette party.

395
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,468
What should we do for
the bachelorette party?

396
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,587
Oh, I know-- we'll go to
a Native American sweat lodge,

397
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,272
we'll take peyote,
roll around in the mud,

398
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,391
and paint fertility symbols
on Bernadette's naked body.

399
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:07,943
So that's happening.

400
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,062
Yeah, sure, sure.

401
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:12,647
Vegas is fun, too.

402
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:13,699
I feel like crying.

403
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,367
Of course, I could
just be hormonal.

404
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,286
Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are
finally syncing up. Bernadette?

405
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:19,955
No? Penny?

406
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:21,573
- Sorry.
- Really?

407
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:22,541
Okay, yeah.

408
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:23,792
Yay!

409
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,956
Maid of honor
Amy Farrah Fowler's

410
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,542
amazing behind-the-scenes
wedding video,

411
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,227
take one.

412
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,330
We're just trying on dresses--

413
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,532
do we really need
to record this?

414
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:47,335
I'm sorry, are <i>you</i>
the maid of honor?

415
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,471
I <i>am</i> the bride.

416
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:53,174
So no. And action.

417
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,943
What do you think?

418
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,612
I love it!

419
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,380
What are you, a nun?

420
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:03,251
Come on, bestie,
let's see some skin.

421
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,653
Amy! Looking sexy!

422
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,939
You think they don't
have mirrors in there?

423
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,307
I know how I look.

424
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,697
Oh...!

425
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:19,417
Bernadette, you
look beautiful!

426
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,983
- You do.
- Thank you.

427
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:24,125
Not Penny beautiful,
but beautiful.

428
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,809
Come on, bestie,
you're up.

429
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,461
Give me a minute.

430
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,297
What is taking
you so long?

431
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,332
Oh, Amy!
Get the hell out of here!

432
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,635
- Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, God.

433
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,186
- Amy!
- Sorry.

434
