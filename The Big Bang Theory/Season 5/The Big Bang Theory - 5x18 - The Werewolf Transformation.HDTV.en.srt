1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,304
I'm just gonna run to the
store and get a few things.

2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:05,339
I'll pick you up
when you're done.

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,790
Okay.

4
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:09,665
I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

5
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:10,864
Hey, Sheldon.

6
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,700
Hello. I'm here for my haircut

7
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:14,034
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

8
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:15,970
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's
in the hospital.

9
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:17,171
He's pretty sick.

10
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:21,008
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

11
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,578
Why do these things
always happen to me?

12
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:25,563
I can cut it for you.

13
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,448
You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

14
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,351
I get my hair cut
by Mr. D'Onofrio.

15
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:31,652
You believe
this guy?

16
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:32,853
(murmurs)

17
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:34,888
Excuse us for a second.

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,407
Sheldon, it's okay,
he can do it.

19
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:37,525
He's a barber.

20
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:40,328
He's not a barber,
he's the nephew.

21
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,862
He's an example
of the kind

22
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:45,166
of nepotism that runs rampant
in the barbering industry.

23
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:46,834
Besides, Mr.
D'Onofrio knows

24
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:49,403
exactly how I like my
hair done because he has

25
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:52,607
all my haircut records
from my barber in Texas.

26
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,408
What are you talking about?

27
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,543
When I first
moved here,

28
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:58,179
I was nervous about
finding a new barber,

29
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,097
so my mother had all
my haircut records

30
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,249
sent here to
Mr. D'Onofrio.

31
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:06,721
There's no such thing
as haircut records.

32
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:09,523
Yes, there are.

33
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:10,725
Have you ever seen them?

34
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,294
No, but my mother assured
me they were sent here,

35
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:15,112
and I'll bet you
dollars to donuts

36
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,714
that this one
doesn't have them.

37
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:18,549
Uh, excuse me.

38
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:21,152
Do you have access
to my haircut records?

39
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:22,787
Your what?

40
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,605
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,

41
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,123
this is the way
the world ends--

42
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,126
not with a bang
but with a nephew.

43
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,381
Sheldon, you're a grown man,
he's a professional,

44
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:37,301
and your haircut is number three
on that poster from 1946.

45
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:39,119
Just sit down

46
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:40,137
and let him do it.

47
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,789
Fine, but if I come
out of this

48
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,774
looking like a dork,
it's on you.

49
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,483
(clears throat)

50
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,185
So my kid said
the funniest thing today.

51
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,269
Nope.

52
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,659

Can you pass
the Parmesan cheese?

65
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,969
Sure.

66
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:47,613
What are you doing?

67
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,648
I'm trying to get the hair
out of my eyes.

68
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:50,656
LEONARD:
Sheldon,

69
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:53,191
you are one day late
for your haircut.

70
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:55,877
Thank you for captioning
my nightmare.

71
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:00,331
Lookie here,
I got my travel orders.

72
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,035
"Payload Specialist Howard
Wolowitz is requested

73
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:06,737
"to report to the NASA
Johnson Space Center,

74
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,839
"Houston, Texas,

75
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,008
for astronaut training
Monday 8:00 a.m."

76
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,011
Yeah, but it's from NASA,
so it's 0800.

77
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:14,762
But it says
"8:00 a.m""

78
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,416
You read it as "0800."

79
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:20,518
It doesn't have an
"O" in front of it.

80
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,221
You know what does have
an "oh" in front of it?

81
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:26,074
"Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,
and you're dying of jealousy."

82
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,360
So, what kind of
things are they...?

83
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,929
Will you stop that?

84
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,417
I can't help it,
I feel like a teen heartthrob.

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,937
You know, Sheldon,
I used to cut my brother's hair.

86
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:40,938
I could do it for you.

87
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,908
Penny, I know you mean well,

88
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,794
offering the skills
of the hill folk, but, um,

89
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:48,579
here in town,

90
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,498
we don't churn our own butter,

91
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,667
we don't make dresses
out of gunny sacks,

92
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:55,136
and, uh, we sure as shootin'
don't get our hair cut

93
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:56,137
by bottle-blonde...

94
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,022
Sheldon, be nice.

95
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:00,591
I'm sorry,
it's the bad boy attitude

96
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:01,976
that comes with this hair.

97
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,814
You could go to my guy.

98
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:08,683
He's at Juan-Juan
in Beverly Hills.

99
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,735
They bring you a cup of tea,
they'll massage your scalp.

100
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:13,804
It's about $200, but sometimes
you look in the next chair

101
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:17,191
and you see a superstar
like Tony Danza.

102
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:19,310
WOLOWITZ:
Quick question here:

103
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:21,329
Have we actually changed
the conversation

104
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,864
from "I'm going
to astronaut training"

105
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,649
to "Sheldon can't
get a haircut"?

106
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:26,801
Now who's dying of jealousy?

107
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:30,288
"Oh," it's you.

108
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,626
♪ I'm a cowboy ♪

Sheldon,

115
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:55,246
you're ruining girlfriend-
boyfriend sing-along night.

116
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:57,515
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:00,735
I'm looking for a barber
and I'm running out of time.

118
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:01,836
My hair is growing at the rate

119
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:05,239
of 4.6 yoctometers
per femtosecond.

120
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:08,876
I mean, if you're quiet,
you can hear it.

121
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:12,530
What about Supercuts?

122
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:13,531
I tried once.

123
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,849
They do men's and women's hair

124
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:17,251
in the same room
at the same time.

125
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:20,221
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
with mousse.

126
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,807
Well, this isn't
a crisis.

127
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,926
Why don't you just let
your hair grow out a little?

128
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:26,043
Why don't I let

129
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:27,161
my hair grow out?

130
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:29,797
Um, why don't I start
wearing Birkenstocks

131
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:32,817
and seeking validation
of my opinions by asking

132
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,368
"Can you dig it?"

133
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,038
Well, I don't know.

134
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,173
I think you might look
sexy with long hair.

135
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,161
The kind that flows down
to your shoulders

136
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:46,614
and blows back
while riding on a horse.

137
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:51,352
Bareback and bare-chested.

138
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:56,374
I'm gonna go brush my teeth;
it might take a while.

139
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,547
Hi.

140
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:03,948
Hi, sweetie.

141
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,149
I miss you.

142
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,717
I miss you, too.

143
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,303
So tell me
all about your first day.

144
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,789
Oh, wow, where do I even start?

145
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,109
I got to experience
zero gravity.

146
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,394
Cool. How do they do that?

147
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:17,395
It's pretty neat.

148
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:18,629
You get in this plane

149
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:22,650
that goes almost straight up
for, like, 20 seconds,

150
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:27,288
and then straight back down
like it's going to crash, and

151
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,573
they do it

152
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:30,575
over and over again, you know,

153
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,776
no matter how many times
you throw up.

154
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:34,612
You threw up?

155
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:38,166
Yeah... and the craziest part
is, because there's no gravity,

156
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:42,920
the throw-up kind of
floats there...

157
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,121
in a little ball,

158
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,606
and

159
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:49,143
if your mouth is open
because you're screaming...

160
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:53,898
...sometimes it just floats
right back in.

161
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,283
(laughing)

162
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:00,354
Boy, does everyone laugh
at you when that happens.

163
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:01,355
That sounds mean.

164
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,406
No.

165
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:03,908
Yeah, I would have laughed, too,

166
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,077
but I didn't want the vomit
to come back out.

167
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,113
(laughs)

168
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,082
Anyway...

169
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:12,983
Oh, could you do me a favor

170
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:16,337
and overnight me
some more underwear?

171
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,655
Sure, why?

172
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:19,040
I got a look at the centrifuge

173
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,741
they're going to spin me
around in tomorrow,

174
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,110
and I have a hunch
I packed a little light.

175
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:25,046
(chuckles nervously)

176
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:33,854
Mr. D'Onofrio?

177
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,640
It's Sheldon.

178
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,392
They didn't have
anything barber-themed

179
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:42,146
in the gift shop,
so I got you this.

180
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,181
I don't know if you can read
his little T-shirt.

181
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:47,201
It says, um,
"Get well bear-y soon."

182
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:50,955
Trust me, if you were even
a little conscious right now,

183
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:51,989
you'd be laughing.

184
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:53,207
(laughs)

185
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,212
Anyway...

186
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:02,883
There's new studies that show,
people in comas are aware

187
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:05,202
of everything going on
around them.

188
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:08,256
With that in mind,
if you can hear me,

189
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,174
move away from the light

190
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:13,978
and toward the sound
of these scissors.

191
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,062
(door opens)

192
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,731
Can I help you?

193
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:17,982
Yes.

194
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:21,936
Do you have something
I could use as a cape?

195
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:24,555
Oh, dear,
did we spit out our pills,

196
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:28,159
slip out of the ninth floor,
and go on a little adventure?

197
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:30,161
Oh, no,

198
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:33,230
no, I'm just here
to get my hair cut.

199
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,952
I-I see.

200
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:40,921
J-Jus-Just wait here one moment.

201
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,957
Security!

202
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,576
I got to run.

203
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:48,796
But not with scissors--
that would be unsafe.

204
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,238
So, if I move
my horsey here...

205
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:07,243
...isn't that checkmate
and I win?

206
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:15,351
Hmm.

207
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:19,055
Well, is it
or isn't it?

208
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,959
You know, I think this is
a good stopping point.

209
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,895
Uh, it's your
first real game.

210
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,730
I threw a lot
of information at you.

211
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:28,898
Well, no,

212
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,266
I mean,
your king is trapped.

213
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:33,069
He can't go here
because of my lighthouse,

214
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,771
and...

215
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:39,909
he can't go here because
of my pointy-head guy.

216
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:43,746
Like I said, complicated game.

217
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,965
So did I win or not?

218
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,250
Did you have fun?

219
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,052
Because if you had fun,
then you are, you are a winner.

220
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:51,337
That's, that-that's
what chess is all about.

221
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,007
Hello.

222
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,008
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

223
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,392
Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.
Eh, why?

224
00:09:56,394 --> 00:10:00,280
My spot, your spot--
what difference does it make?

225
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,269
Okay, what just happened?

226
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,637
I don't know.

227
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,739
Between you playing chess
like Bobby Fischer

228
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:12,692
and Sheldon being okay
with you in his spot,

229
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:15,078
I'm guessing someone went
back in time, stepped on a bug,

230
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,647
and changed the course
of human events.

231
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:21,000
Uh, sweetie,
are you all right?

232
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:23,503
No, I'm not all right.

233
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,205
It's been six days since I
was supposed to get a haircut

234
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,625
and nothing horrible
has happened.

235
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,678
Okay, I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

236
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,296
Leonard, explain it to her.

237
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:36,466
Oh, uh, he's crazy.

238
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:39,352
I have spent my whole life

239
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,554
trying to bring order
to the universe

240
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:44,507
by carefully planning
every moment of every day.

241
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:45,675
But all my efforts--

242
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,111
our dinner schedule,
my pajama rotation,

243
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,346
my bowel movement spreadsheet--

244
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,848
it's clear now,

245
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,651
I've been wasting my time.

246
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:58,988
Good. I'm taking that
disgusting chart off the fridge.

247
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,541
You know, Sh-Sheldon,

248
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:03,293
sometimes it's nice
not knowing what's coming.

249
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,627
I mean, look at me and Leonard.

250
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,829
We went out, we broke up,
now we're trying again.

251
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,197
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

252
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,050
Oh, please, everyone knows
what's going to happen.

253
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,704
But I see your point.

254
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:16,339
I think this could
be good for you.

255
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,925
Maybe it's time for you
to shake things up a bit.

256
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,094
You're right.

257
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,346
I should embrace the chaos.

258
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,098
Great.

259
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,566
What are you going
to do first?

260
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:27,600
I don't know.

261
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,068
I could do anything.

262
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,070
All bets are off.

263
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:34,524
The world is my oyster.

264
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:35,875
I got it.

265
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:39,245
I'm going to put
on my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

266
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,285
I got to tell you,
I'm a little worried about him.

267
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,121
If I were you, I'd be
worried that a girl

268
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:51,407
who's never played chess in
her life just kicked your ass.

269
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:06,873
Hi.

270
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,008
Howie, what happened to you?

271
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,945
We did overnight survival
training in the wilderness.

272
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,697
Big fun.

273
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,533
Big, big fun.

274
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,153
I was gonna freshen up for you

275
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:24,307
but I blacked out a little
on the way to the bathroom.

276
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:26,826
Survival training?

277
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:27,943
Is that like camping?

278
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:28,995
Uh-huh.

279
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,731
Except you don't
have food or water,

280
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:35,234
and they don't have
a sunset Sabbath service

281
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:38,254
like they do
at Camp Hess-Kramer.

282
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:40,807
Do you sleep in tents?

283
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:41,958
No.

284
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,460
I slept in a hole

285
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:48,431
I dug in the ground
with my bare hands.

286
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:51,868
And at some point
during the night,

287
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,338
an armadillo crawled in

288
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,940
and spooned me.

289
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,360
Poor baby.

290
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,495
But I did it.

291
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,414
I survived.

292
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,935
I wasn't sure I was going to
when the sandstorm hit.

293
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:12,672
I just pulled my turtleneck
up over my head

294
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:16,342
and waited for death.

295
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:20,129
But somehow as I sat there,

296
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:24,500
wrapped in a cocoon
of my own neck-sweat,

297
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:29,288
I found that primal part
of the human spirit

298
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,342
that just wants
to keep on living,

299
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:36,078
no matter what the cost.

300
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,396
You're so brave.

301
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,065
I'm proud of you.

302
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:42,752
I ate a butterfly.

303
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:52,345
It was so small and...

304
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,747
beautiful,

305
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,467
but I was so hungry.

306
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:02,889
Are you crying?

307
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:05,708
No, I don't think it's possible.

308
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,212
I'm severely dehydrated.

309
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:12,799
My pee is like toothpaste.

310
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:16,686
Howie, if you're not able
to do this, come home.

311
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,722
It won't change
how I feel about you.

312
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:22,742
Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

313
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:25,828
If I do, I'll just be a guy

314
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,832
who had a chance to be an
astronaut and gave it up.

315
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:32,067
Well, is there anything
I could do to help?

316
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:34,170
No.

317
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:35,338
Wait.

318
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,275
Send more underwear.

319
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,529
(bongos playing in living room)

320
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:51,521
Don't let this
be Sheldon playing bongos.

321
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,064
(bongos playing)

322
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,389
(rhythmically) Hello, Leonard,
do you like my bongos?

323
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:15,110
Bet you didn't know
that I had bongos.

324
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,280
Sheldon, it's 3:00 o'clock
in the morning.

325
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,448
3:00 in the morning

326
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,285
is a good time for bongos.

327
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:24,887
I was sleeping.

328
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,123
Leonard sleeps
while I play bongos.

329
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,561
No, he doesn't.

330
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,347
Leonard no sleep
while I play bongos.

331
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,465
Bongo solo.

332
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,104
Stop! Stop it!

333
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,240
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

334
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,664
- What the hell?!
- Oh, hi,

335
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,815
Penny, guess what?

336
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:55,001
Sheldon got bongos.

337
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,619
Why did you get bongos?

338
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,487
Richard Feynman
played the bongos.

339
00:15:58,489 --> 00:15:59,922
I thought I'd give that a try.

340
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,657
Richard Feynman
was a famous physicist.

341
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,325
Oh, Leonard, it's 3:00 o'clock
in the morning.

342
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,211
I don't care if Richard Feynman
was a purple leprechaun

343
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:07,179
who lived in my butt.

344
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:11,217
Penny meant if he were
a purple leprechaun.

345
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,334
Penny forgot

346
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,520
to use the subjunctive.

347
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:18,173
Sheldon, go to bed.

348
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,692
You have work in the morning.

349
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:20,943
Maybe, maybe not.

350
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:23,846
Maybe tomorrow I start
a bongo band and tour the world.

351
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:28,200
No, no, hang on,
uh, uh,

352
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:29,518
Roommate Agreement.

353
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,622
No hootenannies, sing-a-longs,
or barbershop quartets

354
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,041
after 10:00 p.m.

355
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:36,242
Roommate Agreement?

356
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:37,359
Are you kidding?

357
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:38,661
We are living in a world

358
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,630
of chaos.

359
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,648
Roommate Agreement.

360
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,835
Where are you going?

361
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:48,037
Wherever the music
takes me, kitten.

362
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,925
I play bongos

363
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,060
walking down the stairs.

364
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:57,480
(tumbling down stairs)
Oh! Oh!

365
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:03,719
(playing bongos) Never play bongos
walking down the stairs.

366
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:06,405
(knocking)

367
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:10,609
Surprise.

368
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,445
What are you doing here?

369
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,163
I'm here to help you
get through this.

370
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,332
You can't do it on your own,
you need someone

371
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,583
to take care of you.

372
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:18,884
Oh, I love you so much.

373
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,202
Oh, I love you.

374
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:23,589
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard,
your bath is getting cold!

375
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,094
Don't worry, once
she falls asleep,

376
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,846
I'll spoon you
like an armadillo.

377
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:39,138
He showed up in the middle
of the night with his bongos.

378
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,092
I foolishly thought it was some
sort of musical booty call.

379
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:46,128
Poor guy.

380
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,898
He must have been exhausted.

381
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,734
Sheldon like to sleep
while Leonard play the bongo!

382
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,455
That was kind of uncalled for.

383
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,940
No, it was called for.

384
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,626
What's going on?

385
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:01,627
All right, Sheldon,

386
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:03,129
this craziness
has gone on long enough.

387
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:05,414
Please come home
so I can cut your hair.

388
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,750
Penny, you're not trained.

389
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,251
You're not licensed.

390
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:13,222
Most importantly, you don't have
access to my haircut records.

391
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,044
All right, honey, look,

392
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:20,396
we've known each other
for a long time now, right?

393
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,798
I've taken you to Disneyland,

394
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,934
I kicked a bully
in the nuts for you,

395
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:26,936
I sing you "Soft Kitty"

396
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,938
when you're sick,

397
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,523
you've even saw me naked once.

398
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:33,676
I'm sorry,
what?

399
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,644
It was a long story.

400
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,980
Anyway, Sheldon, I promise
I know what I'm doing.

401
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:39,532
Please let me cut your hair.

402
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:42,535
Amy, what do you think?

403
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:46,321
There's not a hair on my body
I wouldn't let this woman trim.

404
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,849
Fine, let's go.

405
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,221
Thank you for letting me
sleep on your couch.

406
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:04,006
There's only so many times
a woman can say,

407
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,357
"How about the bed?"

408
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,180
What's this
about Sheldon seeing you naked?

409
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:15,034
Oh, relax. It was just
her bottom and her breasts.

410
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,152
Almost done.

411
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:28,954
At the end of the haircut,

412
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:32,324
Mr. D'Onofrio
would tell me a dirty joke.

413
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:35,928
Sorry, I don't know
any dirty jokes.

414
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,281
That's okay,
I never understood them anyway.

415
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,385
Okay, what do you think?

416
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:48,023
Hm, well,

417
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:50,959
it's a little Hollywood.

418
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,296
But I think
I can pull it off.

419
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:55,631
Well done, Penny.

420
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:56,848
Ha, told you.

421
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,700
Okay, I'm just gonna clean up
your neck a little

422
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:01,787
and then you are good to go.
Fun time.

423
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:02,871
(giggles)

424
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:05,791
Sorry, sometimes the clippers
tickle me.

425
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,326
Okay.

426
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:09,528
(laughs)

427
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,885
Okay, yep, we're all done now.

428
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:17,869
It's just... it's good.

429
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,422
Let me just take that
away from you.

430
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,090
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

431
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:24,259
You are welcome.

432
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,159
(door closes)

433
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,999
Yeah, I'm gonna have to move.
