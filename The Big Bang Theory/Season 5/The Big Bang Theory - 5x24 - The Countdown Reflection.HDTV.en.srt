<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,779
Who says something like that

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,743
right in the middle of sex?!
I don't know.

4
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:07,527
It was the heat of the moment!

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,929
No, the heat of the moment is
"Ooh, yeah, just like that."

6
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,032
Not, "Will you marry me?"

7
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:17,253
NASA really wants my telescope

8
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:18,454
up on the Space Station,

9
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:21,257
so they're putting me
on an earlier launch.

10
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:22,842
When?

11
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:24,577
A week from Friday.

12
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:27,430
What? We're getting
married that Sunday.

13
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:29,081
You're right.

14
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,217
I can't go to space.

15
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,602
I have to get married.

16
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:34,520
No one can say
that's not a good reason.

17
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:36,589
I'll call them back.

18
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:38,391
We'll have the wedding
when you get back.

19
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:40,426
Your dad's going
to be furious.

20
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:42,094
There's no way
he's going to let us

21
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:44,230
postpone this
wedding. Well, we tried.

22
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:46,616
I'll talk to him.

23
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:49,101
He won't say no
to his little girl.

24
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:52,071
No! I, uh,
I should talk to him.

25
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:53,206
Man to man.

26
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,208
All right, look,
I'm going to level with you.

27
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,944
I'm terrified about
going into space.

28
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:01,881
You know, what if
I don't make it back?

29
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,951
It's going to be okay, son.

30
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:07,203
You really think so?

31
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:09,088
Of course.

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,491
A pretty girl
like Bernadette,

33
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:14,210
she'll find a new guy.

34
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,104
Hey, Mike?

35
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:26,239
Yeah...

36
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,275
I changed my mind.
I don't want to do this.

37
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,011
Good one.

38
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:33,996
Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

39
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:36,582
I also have a hysterical bit
planned for later

40
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:39,652
where I pretend to cry
through the whole launch.

41
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:53,833
Sheldon, what channel
is NASA TV?

42
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:57,470
289, right between
the Game Show Network at 288

43
00:01:57,472 --> 00:02:01,390
and the East coast feed of the
Disney Channel on 290.

44
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:04,560
I love his eidetic
memory, it's so sexy.

45
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,548
Sheldon, what are the
ingredients in Pringles?

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,850
Dried potatoes, vegetable oil,

47
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,685
corn flour, wheat starch,

48
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:14,570
maltodextrin, salt,

49
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:18,291
and my favorite ingredient
of all, uniformity.

50
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:21,911
The uterus quivers,
does it not?

51
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:24,029
There's Howard's rocket,
live from Kazakhstan.

52
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,748
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

53
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,416
I don't think I can watch.

54
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:29,919
You're nervous? I've been
stress-eating for four days.

55
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:31,671
Look at me.

56
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm wearing my fat pants.

57
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:37,844
Remarkable.
In just under a half hour,

58
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:40,062
200 metric tons
of fuel will

59
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:41,981
ignite in a
controlled explosion

60
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:44,600
right beneath
Howard's keister.

61
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:46,986
And all from a country whose
entire contribution

62
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:51,657
to the global economy, has been
Tetris and mail-order brides.

63
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,528
Give me those
damn Pringles.

64
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:01,467
<i>Da.</i>

65
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,870
Okay, we're in
the final countdown.

66
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,154
How you doing over there?

67
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,873
Good! Good!

68
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,292
Oh, quick question,
I missed it in the briefing.

69
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:11,310
How much urine

Hey, Froot Loops, want
to hit your fan switch?

81
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,405
Check.

82
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:53,511
He calls you Froot Loops because
of your very gay haircut?

83
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,281
No, it's...
'cause I live with my mom

84
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:59,300
and she makes me Froot Loops.

85
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:04,188
Go with gay story, people
are more accepting of that.

86
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,641
Actually,

87
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:10,261
Froot Loops just got
married to a girl.

88
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:11,962
Congratulations.

89
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:14,849
Thanks, we decided to do it
before the launch.

90
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:17,585
You and Mrs. Loops
have a big wedding?

91
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,822
Not exactly.
Listen, if you don't mind,

92
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,807
I'm not really up for chatting.

93
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,309
I'm just going to
sit here quietly

94
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:28,646
and let my life
flash before my eyes.

95
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,335
That went really quick.
Let me try it again.

96
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,691
Close your eyes.
Put out your hand.

97
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:42,627
I got you something special.

98
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,546
Come on, Howard.
I'm not falling for that again.

99
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:50,000
No, here...

100
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,522
Oh, Howie.

101
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,107
A little star.

102
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,525
It's beautiful.

103
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:58,893
Put it on me.

104
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:01,479
Okay, but I'm going to have
to get it back for you

105
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,982
so I can take it to the
International Space Station.

106
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:07,618
That way, when I come home,

107
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,405
you will have a star
that was actually in space.

108
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:14,375
Oh... my God.

109
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:17,027
Take that, every guy who's ever
bought you anything.

110
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,233
This is the most amazing
gift I've ever gotten.

111
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,535
Really? Well, if you like it
that much,

112
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:26,420
then close your eyes
and put out your hand.

113
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,643
I'm going to the
supermarket to buy

114
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:35,045
snacks for your trip!
Do you want me to

115
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:38,683
get those little boxes
of Froot Loops you like?!

116
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:41,102
No! When I eat Froot Loops,

117
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:43,220
the other astronauts
make fun of me!

118
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,026
Howard, I don't want
to wait until

119
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:50,294
you're back to get married.

120
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,612
What?

121
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:52,863
I want to be
married to you

122
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:54,565
before you get
in that rocket.

123
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,234
But I'm leaving in two days.

124
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:00,454
What about Apple Jacks?!

125
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:03,741
I don't need
to take cereal!

126
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,626
What kind of
breakfast do you think

127
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:08,629
they're going to
give you in Russia?!

128
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:13,050
They invented blintzes!
I'll be fine!

129
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:15,519
They invented
the lightbulb in New Jersey!

130
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:19,223
It doesn't mean they hand them
out to you when you go!

131
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:23,227
We'll have a quick little
ceremony with just our friends,

132
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,645
and we'll still have
the big reception

133
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:26,397
with everyone when
you get back.

134
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,782
Wow.

135
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:29,700
Okay. Let's get married.

136
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:37,792
You know what,
I'll buy you All-Bran

137
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:40,578
in case you get
stopped up in outer space.

138
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:47,835
So anyway, we decided to go down
to City Hall this afternoon

139
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:51,172
get married, and then have the
reception when Howard gets back.

140
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:53,174
Great!
That's so good!

141
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:55,292
I mean, we know it's short notice,
but we'd love you all to come with us.

142
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:59,230
No, no, no, this is not
the wedding I wanted!

143
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:02,516
I want to wear
my maid of honor dress

144
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:04,602
and walk down the aisle
with a hundred eyes on me,

145
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:07,805
while a string quartet plays
"The Way You Look Tonight."

146
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,695
That wasn't going to be
our processional music.

147
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,364
Well, it was going
to be mine!

148
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:15,863
Thank you for the invitation,
but I have to decline

149
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:18,649
because it doesn't sound
like something I'll enjoy.

150
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,286
Come on, Sheldon,
it'll be fun.

151
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:24,606
That's what you said about
<i>The Green Lantern</i> movie.

152
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:28,943
You were 114 minutes of wrong.

153
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,980
So, what do you say, Amy?

154
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,333
Can I wear my
maid of honor dress?

155
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:37,485
Seriously? You're going to
wear that thing to City Hall?

156
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,455
It's all I have left! You're going
to take that from me, too?!

157
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,764
Amy, you look great.

158
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,115
I know.

159
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:55,686
Where'd you get a beer?

160
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:57,521
From that happy young couple
over there

161
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,957
with all the tattoos.

162
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,743
Beautiful story:
they're in rival drug gangs,

163
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:03,494
and they're getting married.

164
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:06,414
Shh, no one can know.

165
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,751
Look at all these people
in love.

166
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:11,819
It kind of gets you
thinking, doesn't it?

167
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:13,888
It does, indeed.

168
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,340
Leonard...

169
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,342
is it awkward being here
with Penny given that

170
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,594
you recently
proposed to her?

171
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:23,681
You proposed to Penny?

172
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,566
I don't want to talk about it.
Where did he pop the question?

173
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:26,759
What did you say?

174
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:28,520
She said, "No."
Can we drop it now?

175
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,854
It wasn't a real proposal.

176
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,322
Why wasn't it
a real proposal?

177
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,307
He asked her
during coitus.

178
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:37,895
Did you get down on one knee
or where you already there?

179
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,451
Howard, don't talk like that
on your wedding day.

180
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:44,702
Sorry, Ma... Bernadette.

181
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,871
Ma... Burna...
You're ma Bernadette.

182
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:50,091
Good move telling Sheldon.

183
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:52,243
What, I can't propose?
I can't talk to my friends?

184
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,178
Is there anything else
I'm not allowed to do?

185
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,763
All right,
that's enough.

186
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,015
Today is not
about you two.

187
00:08:57,017 --> 00:09:00,218
Today is about
Howard and Bernadette

188
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,586
and me.

189
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:05,106
Folks, can I have
your attention.

190
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,191
It's 5:00, we're going to be
able to take three more couples.

191
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:10,028
The rest of you will have
to come back on Monday.

192
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,562
Oh, no.

193
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:12,580
I got this.

194
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:13,731
Excuse me?

195
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,350
But is there any way
you could squeeze us in?

196
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:19,654
See, I'm an astronaut and

197
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:23,291
I'm leaving for Russia
on Sunday so

198
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:26,744
I can take a Soyuz rocket to the
International Space Station.

199
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,097
Yeah, me, too.
I'll see you there.

200
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:34,168
I can't believe we're not
going to get married.

201
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,170
Excuse me, I'm going
to go see if the couple

202
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:38,005
at the front of the line
needs a maid of honor.

203
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:50,567
<i>So, I tell my wife,</i>

204
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:53,035
"Get a dog, don't get a dog,
I'm not walking it,

205
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:55,838
I'm not feeding it,
I'm not picking up after it."

206
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,909
You know you're going
to wind up walking it.

207
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,061
I know.

208
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:05,414
Uh, shouldn't you guys
be talking about

209
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,000
space stuff
instead of dogs?

210
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:09,501
Dimitri,

211
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:11,637
Froot Loops would be
more comfortable

212
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,906
if we talked about
space stuff.

213
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,158
Okay,

214
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,077
I'm going into space,

215
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,697
and when I come back,
I have to pick up a poodle crap.

216
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,501
Is that better?

217
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,955
Thanks.

218
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,995
You know, we could always drive
to Vegas and get married.

219
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,394
No, it's that
kind of tacky?

220
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,013
Hey, I know tons of people
who got married in Vegas.

221
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:40,932
Are any of them
still married?

222
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,935
Yeah, I mean, not to
the same people but...

223
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:47,855
There's got to be some place
special we could do it.

224
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:52,560
Leonard, where did you
envision marrying Penny?

225
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,397
Will you shut up?

226
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,168
Well, I know how to
make it special.

227
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,170
I told you we are not
recreating the wedding

228
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,704
from <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

229
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,807
Yes, you made that
brutally clear to me.

230
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,128
What I was going to suggest is
if that you're willing to wait

231
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,214
until Sunday morning,
the Google satellite

232
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:14,465
will be over Pasadena.

233
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:18,102
You can have your wedding
photographed from space.

234
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:19,971
Oh...
That's so cool.

235
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:21,939
Oh, wait to go, Raj.
I keep telling you,

236
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:23,391
if I wasn't an astrophysicist,

237
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:25,259
I would have been
a party planner.

238
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,529
It was always a coin flip.

239
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,283
Okay, so we know we're going
to do it Sunday morning.

240
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:36,187
Now we need to find a good place
for the satellite to see us.

241
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,805
How about our roof?

242
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:40,741
Oh, I like that.
That's great.

243
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,160
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe
my maid of honor dress

244
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:44,778
is going to be on Google Earth.

245
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,782
So, we have the
where and the when,

246
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:51,952
but we still need to figure out
who's going to do the ceremony.

247
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:53,504
Well, that's easy.
Anyone can go online

248
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:54,805
and get ordained as a minister.

249
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,924
I know a piercing parlor,
where, for a hundred bucks,

250
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,626
they'll marry you
and stick a wedding ring

251
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,962
through any body part you want.

252
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,649
Great, well,
who's it going to be?

253
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:06,317
I'll do it,

254
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:10,187
provided I can perform
the ceremony in Klingon.

255
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,689
No.

256
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:15,109
What do you see in her?

257
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,833
Leaking? What's leaking?

258
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:25,753
Fuel. Shh.

259
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:36,213
There's fuel leaking
and we're still going to go?

260
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:40,017
Don't lose your Froot Loops,
Froot Loops.

261
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,136
This happens a lot.

262
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,639
Nine times out of ten,
no problem.

263
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:47,308
What happens on the tenth time?

264
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,560
Problem.

265
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:54,365
Hey, guys,
before I forget,

266
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,567
I got you a little
groomsman present.

267
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,703
Oh, thanks, man.
You didn't have to do that.

268
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,439
Fantastic Four,
annual number three from 1965,

269
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,990
in mint condition.

270
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:06,694
The one where Mr. Fantastic and
the Invisible Girl get married.

271
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:08,129
Oh, wow.

272
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,414
Oh, dear.

273
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,584
I was afraid of this.
What?

274
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:17,588
While a thoughtful gift, this
comic book in this condition

275
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,724
is worth at least
a hundred dollars.

276
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:20,825
Yeah, so?

277
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,209
I bought you an Bernadette

278
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:24,979
a gravy boat worth $88.

279
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:28,099
Which places me in your debt

280
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,017
and I can't be in your debt

281
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,371
because someday you might
ask me to help you move...

282
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:38,075
...or to kill a man.

283
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:41,078
I doubt he'll ask you
to kill a man.

284
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,830
Well, what if it's
his only way out?

285
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:43,998
I can't risk it.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,702
Here is $12.

287
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:51,205
Now, we're even.

288
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,623
Wait...

289
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,459
I bought a card.
Give me two dollars.

290
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:01,182
And for the record, this is why
I hate gift-giving.

291
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,021
Who is it?

292
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:08,723
It's the groom.

293
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:12,526
You can't come in.
Bad luck to see the bride.

294
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,363
Okay, uh, fine.

295
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:17,565
Bernie, I have to go
pick up my mother!

296
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,200
I'll be right back!

297
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:22,319
Why can't she drive herself?!

298
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,572
She doesn't want to sit in
her dress and wrinkle it

299
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:27,908
so I'm going to lay her down in
the back of my neighbor's van!

300
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:31,328
All right, just hurry!

301
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,298
Okay, I'll see you later,
Ma... uh...

302
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,883
lovely bride-to-be.

303
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,004
I really got to watch that.

304
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:47,294
Come on, Raj,
we're ready to start.

305
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,763
What, we're ready,

306
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:52,032
when I say we're ready.

307
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,135
Ooh.

308
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:58,239
Okay, now we're ready.

309
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:02,693
Ma, you want to move your chair
over here so you can see?!

310
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,111
I'm fine where I am!

311
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,647
I don't want to
fall off the roof!

312
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,285
You'll fall through the roof
before you fall off it.

313
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,672
Penny.

314
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:18,626
(Vivaldi's <i>Spring</i> plays)

315
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:23,597
Your new mother-in-law's
a piece of work.

316
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,549
Not now, Dad.

317
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,468
She's got a
bigger mustache than me.

318
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,356
Here you go.

319
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,308
"Here you go"?

320
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,777
What am I, a football?

321
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:47,705
Like that guy
could catch a football.

322
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:49,557
Howard and Bernadette,

323
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,743
the five of us stand before you
as your friends

324
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,695
and newly ordained ministers.

325
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:57,698
Louder!

326
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,968
They all got ordained,
they're all marrying us,

327
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,336
it's adorable!

328
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,672
If you want to hear it,
come closer!

329
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,761
Guys, when I look
at the two of you

330
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:15,516
starting your lives together,
it fills... my heart...

331
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:19,770
It fills my... heart...

332
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,939
Okay, I'm going
to need a minute.

333
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,942
Okay, I'll, I'll go.

334
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,328
Howard and Bernadette,
I know you two

335
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,914
planned on getting married
in a big fancy wedding,

336
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,283
but when you're in love,
it doesn't matter where

337
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:33,617
or how these things happen.

338
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:37,070
It just matters that
you have each other.

339
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:40,708
Hmm.

340
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,210
Problem?

341
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,129
No.

342
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:47,848
I think the
Reverend Hofstadter

343
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,633
is making an
ironic connection

344
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,803
between your statement about
love and your rejection

345
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:54,421
of his proposal
in the bedroom.

346
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:56,993
Oh, grow up.
Hey, I didn't say it.

347
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,193
All right, that's enough 
from the both of you.

348
00:16:58,194 --> 00:16:59,021
Well, he started it!

349
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:00,162
Well, I'm ending it!

350
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:07,067
Bernadette, I want to thank you

351
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,336
for allowing me to be
your maid of honor.

352
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:11,372
I also want you to know,

353
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,290
that I will be happy
to do it again

354
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:16,210
if this marriage craps out.

355
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:23,167
Thank you, Amy.

356
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,252
Very touching.

357
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:28,455
Howard and Bernadette,

358
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:31,592
you are lucky enough to be best
friends who love each other.

359
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:34,011
And that's the
strongest kind of love

360
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:39,633
because at its core, it has
kindness, patience, and respect.

361
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:44,521
Qualities that are <i>hard</i> to find
in people these days.

362
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,729
Would you like
some aloe vera?

363
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:53,948
You just got burned.

364
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,619
All right, my turn.

365
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:02,623
Howard, Bernadette...

366
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:09,496
Sheldon! I told
you no Klingon!

367
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,718
Fine, I'll do it in English,

368
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,470
but it loses something.

369
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,192
The need to find another human
being to share one's life with,

370
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,161
has always puzzled me.

371
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:28,983
Maybe because I'm so interesting
all by myself.

372
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,520
With that being said,
may you find as much happiness

373
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:37,658
with each other
as I find on my own.

374
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,360
The Klingon would have
made you cry.

375
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:45,249
I believe you two
have prepared vows?

376
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,755
Howard Joel Wolowitz,
like you,

377
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,874
this is going to be
short and sweet.

378
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,178
I love you with
all my heart and soul

379
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,615
and promise
to be with you forever.

380
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:09,106
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

381
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,058
Speak up!

382
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,561
Hey, from now on, she's the
only women who can yell at me!

383
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,734
Until I met you,

384
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:25,622
I couldn't imagine spending
my life with just one person...

385
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:29,626
...and now I can't imagine

386
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,579
spending one day
of it without you.

387
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,751
By the power vested in us,

388
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:39,670
by the state of California...

389
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:41,388
and the Klingon High Council...

390
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:47,478
...we now pronounce you husband
and wife.

391
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,539
That's ignition.

392
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,908
I love this part!

393
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,359
Me, too!

394
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:20,862
I have strongly mixed feelings!

395
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:24,817
Oh, my God,
it's happening.

396
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:25,968
Did I miss it?

397
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,419
No, come on in. Hurry.

398
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:31,440
I love that man.

399
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:34,209
Me, too.

400
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,199
I can't believe it.

401
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:43,886
This whole time, a small part
of me thought he was lying.

402
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:50,559
This is it.

403
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:54,896
Boldly go,
Howard Wolowitz.

404
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:01,460
