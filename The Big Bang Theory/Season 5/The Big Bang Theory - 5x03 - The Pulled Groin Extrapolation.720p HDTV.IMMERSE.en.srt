1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,735
Who wants the
last dumpling?

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,086
Ooh, me!

3
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,454
Penny, a moment.

4
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:07,539
We just had Thai food.

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,459
In that culture,
the last morsel is called

6
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:13,629
the "greng jie" piece,
and it is reserved for

7
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:16,765
the most important
and valued member of the group.

8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,774
Thank you all
for this high honor.

9
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,646
I've seen pictures
of your mother; keep eating.

10
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,570
All right, honey, if we're gonna
make the movie, we should go.

11
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,159
This may be hard
for you to hear,

12
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:47,246
but when I say "honey,"
I mean my fiancée.

13
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,084
Yeah, well, now it means her.

14
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:55,804
It's okay if he
wants to come.

15
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,423
Fine. But next time,
we get a sitter.

16
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:01,977
All right, I got to go to work.
I'll walk down with you.

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,228
Wait.

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,131
Which is closer to the new
train store in Monrovia,

19
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,317
the movie theater
or The Cheesecake Factory?

20
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,402
Neither of them are close.

21
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,404
Oh, well, then I guess
it doesn't matter which one

22
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,322
of you drives me.

23
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,773
Let's play a fun guessing game

24
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,491
to see who gets to take me.

25
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,862
All right, this four-letter word
describes either

26
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:23,782
a printer's type size
or a compulsion to eat dirt.

27
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,534
Okay, I'm not driving him.

28
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:27,953
Penny, don't give up,
you can get this.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,675
Aren't you going
with Sheldon?

30
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,962
No, I have no interest
in model trains,

31
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,716
stores that sell them, nor
their heartbreaking clientele.

32
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:41,934
Oh.

33
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,137
Well, I have
some work to do, so...

34
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,905
I can't imagine
that would disturb me.

35
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,207
Carry on.

36
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,610
Okay.

37
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,862
Wouldn't you be
more comfortable at home?

38
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,952
Not really, no.

39
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,154
All righty then.

40
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,373
Guess I'll just
get started.

41
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,792
Leonard, please. I don't need

(sighs softly)

53
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:56,841
- Amy?
- Yo.

54
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,194
You okay?

55
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,095
Oh, sure.

56
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:04,031
I thought you were reading.

57
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,949
I was.

58
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,702
Now I'm thinking about
what I read.

59
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,232
You all right, Leonard?

60
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,551
You seem very uncomfortable.

61
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:27,638
I-I'm fine.

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,556
Should I go?

63
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:31,975
I've been told sometimes
I overstay my welcome.

64
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:35,162
Wha... who told you that?

65
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:39,566
Well, most recently
my gynecologist.

66
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,307
Well, you stay
as long as you'd like.

67
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,859
I'm glad to hear you say that,

68
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,912
because I'm having
a wonderful time.

69
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:52,996
(chuckles)

70
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:56,750
I said the same thing
to my gynecologist.

71
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:03,507
What are you going to get
at the train store, Sheldon?

72
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,459
Oh, I'm not
buying anything.

73
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,494
They're having a lecture.

74
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,596
"H-O gauge railroading.

75
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,216
Half the size of O-gauge,
but twice the fun."

76
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:16,603
Very controversial topic.

77
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,505
Which side do you come down on?

78
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,607
I'll let you know after tonight.

79
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,310
Unlike some people,
I'm going in with an open mind.

80
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:25,195
Who am I kidding?

81
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:28,348
Of course we all know
it's O-gauge or no gauge.

82
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,536
Can you believe grown men sit
around and play with toy trains?

83
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,788
That's pretty big talk
for a man

84
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,041
with a closet full of magic
tricks at his mother's house.

85
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,079
First of all, they're not
tricks, they're illusions.

86
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,247
And...

87
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,800
secondly, when we get
married, they're all going up

88
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:49,636
in the attic so you can have
that closet for clothes.

89
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:52,556
Why would I keep clothes
at your mother's house?

90
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,224
Well, don't think
of it that way.

91
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:56,376
Once we move in,
it'll be our house.

92
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,844
Is she moving out?

93
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,212
Why would
she move out?

94
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:00,981
It's her house.

95
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,383
Hang on.

96
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:06,570
You seriously think I'm going
to live with your mother?

97
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,188
Howard, I think
I can help here.

98
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,824
Yes, Bernadette,
that's exactly what he thinks.

99
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:11,942
Why not?

100
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,027
It's a great house,
plenty of room,

101
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:16,113
and if we have kids,
Mom's there to help.

102
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,998
You know, en she tells "The
Three Little Pigs" story,

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,785
she actually has hair
on her chinny-chin-chin.

104
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,287
I'm not gonna live
with your mother.

105
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,073
Not now, not ever.

106
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:30,761
Wow, someone obviously
has some mommy issues.

107
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,414
Raj, take me home.

108
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,850
Don't listen to her.
Go to the movie theater.

109
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,218
Take me home now.

110
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,186
Movie theater!

111
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,187
(groans)

112
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,722
Okay, everybody
calm down.

113
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:44,391
There is a simple
solution here.

114
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:45,976
Raj, take me to the train store,

115
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,278
and then I don't care
what you people do.

116
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,237
How was your shower?

117
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:00,607
It was good, good.

118
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,877
Just out of curiosity, what time
do you usually go to bed?

119
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,212
Oh, I'm up all night.

120
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:06,963
I'm like a possum.

121
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:11,685
Boy, you were not liked
in high school, were you?

122
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:13,203
Not really.

123
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,055
- Is that my yearbook?
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,224
"Dear Leonard,
you're really good at science.

125
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:20,927
Maybe one day you'll come up
with a cure for being a dork."

126
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:23,430
Well, it wasn't spray-painting
a lightning bolt

127
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:26,566
on my briefcase,
I can tell you that.

128
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:27,984
If it makes you feel any better,

129
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,237
the only person who signed
my yearbook was my mother.

130
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,172
- Aw.
- "Dear Amy,

131
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,774
"Self-respect and a hymen
are better than friends and fun.

132
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,109
Love, Mom."

133
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:40,480
Well, you can add
Jerry's Junction

134
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,082
to the list of train stores

135
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:45,485
Sheldon Cooper will never
set foot in again.

136
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,104
Rough night, Casey Jones?

137
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,873
You don't know
the half of it.

138
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,258
It was billed

139
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,211
as a lively give-and-take on
the merits of model train sizes.

140
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,763
But it was actually a setup
to intimidate

141
00:06:56,765 --> 00:07:00,350
weak-minded spineless rubes
into buying H-O starter sets.

142
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:01,468
What's in the bag?

143
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,888
I don't want to talk about it.

144
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,774
But it's not a spine,
I'll tell you that.

145
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:10,443
Well, I had a delightful
evening, Leonard.

146
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:11,778
We should do this
again sometime.

147
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,813
Ah, sure.
That'd be nice.

148
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:14,898
Glad to hear it.

149
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,683
I need someone to accompany me
to the wedding

150
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,902
of Dr. Moranelli
and Dr. Gustufson this Friday.

151
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,537
They're kind of
the Brad and Angelina

152
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,522
of the primatology department.

153
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:23,957
Wouldn't you rather
bring Sheldon?

154
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,444
I would, but the last wedding
we went to was a disaster.

155
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,880
He behaved like a child
the entire time.

156
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,214
Not my fault.

157
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:34,467
You said there'd be
other scientists there my age.

158
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:39,806
Doesn't matter.
You're out, he's in.

159
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:42,259
No date to the prom,
two dates to a wedding.

160
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,345
Hmm, how times change.

161
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:51,351
(singsongy): Ha-ha, you have
to go to a wedding.

162
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,389
(doorbell rings)

163
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,390
WOLOWITZ:
I'll get it!

164
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,558
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Could you get it?!

165
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,993
I just said
I'm getting it!

166
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:01,394
Fine, I'll get it!

167
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:04,030
I got it!

00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,616
Oh, hi.

169
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:07,867
Hey.

170
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,336
I don't want to fight.

171
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,454
I was just surprised
when you sprung

172
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,340
the whole living-with-your-mom
stuff on me.

173
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:17,761
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I
didn't run it by you first.

174
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,879
MRS. WOLOWITZ: I don't know who
you're talking to,

175
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:20,914
but in or out!

176
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,984
We don't need bugs!

177
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:26,186
The bugs
only come here

178
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:28,388
because you're
their queen!

179
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,443
Listen, how about this.

180
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,362
Before we make any
kind of decision

181
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:37,697
about where we live,
we have a trial run.

182
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,699
Stay here for a weekend,
see what it's like.

183
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,701
And your mom would be
okay with that?

184
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:42,986
Sure she would.

185
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,605
Ma, do you mind if Bernadette
stays here this weekend?!

186
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,325
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Hey, if she's willing to
give the milk away for free,

187
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,493
who am I to say no?!

188
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:55,582
See? She's
good with it.

189
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,117
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Frankly, after all
your sleepovers

190
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:02,005
with the little brown boy,
a girl is a big relief!

191
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:16,677
All these years,
I've been so wrong.

192
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,714
The tinier the train,
the more concentrated the fun.

193
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,486
You're a brain scientist.

194
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,555
Can you explain to me
why a brilliant man

195
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:29,889
likes playing
with toy trains?

196
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,576
Not without cutting
his head open, no.

197
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:36,496
How about making my
eyes like Cleopatra?

198
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,448
Really? For a wedding?

199
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,783
Perhaps you're right.

200
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:41,401
My cheekbones and
beckoning pelvis

201
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:44,037
already have a certain "hello
sailor" quality to them.

202
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,923
Ready.

203
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:49,426
Aw.

204
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,211
So handsome.

205
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:53,346
Like James Bond.

206
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:57,350
He's better than James Bond,
because he's tinier.

207
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,704
I got you this
to give to me.

208
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:03,940
Oh, sweetie,
guests don't normally

209
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:05,442
wear corsages to a wedding.

210
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:06,977
That's more of a prom thing.

211
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:08,195
I never went to my prom.

212
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:09,946
My mom paid my cousin
to take me,

213
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:13,033
but he just used the money
to buy drugs.

214
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:15,652
Put the corsage on her.

215
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:24,795
When you're done copping a
feel, that goes on my wrist.

It's official.

219
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,223
I'm an H-O trainiac.

220

Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

Does your mother always
cut your meat for you?

223

Only when it's fatty.

224
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,192
Well, don't be jealous, babe.

225
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,577
Someday you'll get to cut it
for me.

moody self-obsession

it's okay to have fun
once in a while.

318
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:36,756
You're welcome.

319
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:38,858
And also for breaking
the head off the ice swan

320
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,777
so I could hold it against
my pulled groin.

321
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,479
I excel

322
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,431
at spatial reasoning, and I had
a hunch that the graceful slope

323
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:48,151
of its neck would cradle
your genitals nicely.

324
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:52,572
Well, okay.
Again, thank you.

325
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:55,241
And again, you're welcome.

326
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:58,495
Want to come in?

327
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:00,163
No, thanks.
I'm gonna head home.

328
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:02,332
'Kay. Well, good night.

329
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,968
Good night.

330
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:13,292
Ames, hi.
How was the wedding?

331
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:18,314
Great. Until I accidentally made
Leonard fall in love with me.

332
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:22,485
Come in, let's talk.

333
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,939
Do you want a
glass of wine?

334
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,408
Wine is one of the reasons
I'm in this fix.

335
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,859
That and this dang pelvis.

336
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,681
Okay, I'm sorry,
what exactly happened?

337
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:36,933
The inevitable--
he was lonely and vulnerable

338
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,434
from missing his girlfriend,

339
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:39,652
while I was charming,

340
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,721
supportive and,
let's face it, in this dress,

341
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:45,358
the perfect combination
of Madonna and whore.

342
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,111
Oh, God,
did he make a move on you?

343
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,896
No, but it's only
a matter of time.

344
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:52,582
How could I have not
seen this coming?

345
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:56,703
Now I'm gonna have to break
the little sad sack's heart.

346
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:59,455
- Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.
- Oh, Penny,

347
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:02,342
much as I would treasure
knowing that the two of us had

348
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,010
been defiled by the same man,

349
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,012
Leonard just doesn't get
my motor running.

350
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:11,351
So, um, what are
you gonna do?

351
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:14,270
Do you want me to talk
to Leonard, let him down easy?

352
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:16,639
No. I'll let him have tonight.

353
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,724
Then in the morning,

354
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:19,526
I'll send him an e-mail
letting him know

355
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:22,111
this body is never
gonna be his wonderland.

356
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:26,766
I mean, frankly, you've got
a better shot than he does.

357
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:37,944
Leonard.

358
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:39,412
Check it out.

359
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:41,614
I bought an N-gauge locomotive.

360
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:43,716
Half the size of H-O.

361
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:47,220
Look, it fits in my mouth.

362
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:49,556
Sounds like you
had a <i>great</i> night.

363
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,624
(muffled):
I did.

364
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:54,561
- How was yours?
- Not bad. I had a lot more fun

365
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,295
with Amy than I
thought I would.

366
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:58,681
What exact
do you mean by that?

367
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,266
Well, it turns out
she really knows

368
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:03,019
how to help a guy loosen up
and have a good time.

369
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:07,023
Although, truth be told, my
groin's a little worse for wear.

370
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:10,159
Ow!

371
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,746
Why did you do that?

372
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:17,250
To send a message:
she is not for you.

373
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:18,651
What?

374
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:20,003
Not for you!

375
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,601
Good morning, handsome.

376
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:40,420
Morning, Mom.

377
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:43,607
It's me.

378
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:49,429
Yes, it is, and you're
so pretty in the morning.

379
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:53,100
Your mom and I
made you breakfast.

380
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,485
(laughs)
Oh, wow.

381
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:56,704
So you guys are getting along?

382
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:58,322
Yeah, I guess.

383
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:00,107
We're very different
people, Howard,

384
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,943
so communication's
a little tricky.

385
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:04,829
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Does he like the pancakes?!

386
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,131
He didn't try them yet!

387
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,285
Is there any butter?

388
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,304
- It's butter-flavored syrup.
- Oh.

389
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:14,972
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
So, what's the word?!

390
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:17,224
He wants butter!

391
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,761
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
It's butter-flavored syrup!

392
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:23,430
I just told him that!

393
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:30,771
I don't need any butter.

394
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:34,191
If you want butter,
I'll get you butter.

395
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,613
Well, I guess
I'll cut these by myself.

396
