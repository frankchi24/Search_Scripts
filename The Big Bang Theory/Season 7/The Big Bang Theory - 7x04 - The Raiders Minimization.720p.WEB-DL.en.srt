1
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,291
So what'd you think?

2
00:00:11,364 --> 00:00:12,783
It was good.

3
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,134
That's it?

4
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,580
"Good"?

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,696
I enjoyed it. When you told me I was
going to be "losing my virginity,"

6
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:23,458
I didn't think you meant showing me <i>Raiders
of the Lost Ark</i> for the first time.

7
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:27,135
My apologies. I chose
my words poorly.

8
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:31,375
I should have said you were about to
have your world rocked on my couch.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,738
Anyway, thank you
for watching it.

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,831
It's one of my
all-time favorites.

11
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:42,302
It was very entertaining... despite
the glaring story problem.

12
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:44,936
Story problem?!

13
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,826
You-- oh, Amy...

14
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,995
What a dewy-eyed
moon-calf you are.

15
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> is the love child
of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,

16
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,241
two of the most gifted
filmmakers of our generation.

17
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,397
I've watched it 36 times,

18
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,764
except for the snake scene
and the face-melting scene,

19
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:08,800
which I can only watch when
it's still light out, but...

20
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,301
I defy you to find
a story problem.

21
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:13,974
Here's my jaw...

22
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:15,765
drop it.

23
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:18,001
All right.

24
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:21,790
Indiana Jones plays no role
in the outcome of the story.

25
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,726
If he weren't in the film, it
would turn out exactly the same.

26
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:29,249
Oh, I see your confusion.
You don't understand.

27
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:33,118
Indiana Jones was the one
in the hat with the whip.

28
00:01:34,223 --> 00:01:37,184
No, I do, and if he
weren't in the movie,

29
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,109
the Nazis would have
still found the ark,

30
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:42,318
taken it to the island,
opened it up and all died...

31
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,222
just like they did.

32
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:51,528

43
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,062
Hey!

44
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,821
Hi! I thought you went to the
comic book store on Wednesdays.

45
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,377
Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy
were having date night

46
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,852
and they don't need me
there to make it awkward.

47
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:31,892
They have each other for that.

48
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:35,951
- So, how was school?
- Oh, good. Check it out.

49
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,902
The Disappointing Child
by Beverly Hofstadter.

50
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:51,020
- You bought my mom's book?
- Yeah!

51
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:54,289
It's on the recommended reading
list for my psychology class.

52
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:00,624
Come on.
Not that book.

53
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,577
It-It's got, like, every horrible
story from my childhood in it.

54
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:08,725
Oh, cool. Are there pictures?

55
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,071
Seriously, please
find another book.

56
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,613
Oh, come on. Why? How
bad could it be?

57
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:19,275
There-There's chapters about potty
training, and bed-wetting and...

58
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,519
masturbation.

59
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,807
Basically, if something came
out of me, she wrote about it!

60
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,158
You know what? Do whatever you want,
just don't talk to me about it.

61
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,728
Not even the chapter on the
breast-feeding crisis?

62
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,232
It was not a crisis.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,411
Apparently, I favored the left
one, she got a little lopsided.

64
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:51,896
Oh, my God, you still go left!

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,283
Which celebrity would you say
I look like the most?

66
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:01,039
Halle Berry.

67
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,323
Why?

68
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:08,021
Stuart and I are putting dating profiles
online, and it's one of the questions.

69
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,869
And thank you-- I'd kill for
that woman's bone structure.

70
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,827
Why are you reading
Pride and Prejudice?

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,371
I'll tell you why.

72
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:20,024
Amy ruined <i>Raiders of
the Lost Ark</i> for me,

73
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:24,382
so now I'm trying to find something
beloved to her and ruin that.

74
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:28,159
Because her life wasn't enough?

75
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,854
Wait...

76
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,896
how can, how can anyone
ruin <i>Raiders? </i> It's perfect.

77
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:35,940
Yeah, except for the fact

78
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,139
that Indiana Jones is completely
irrelevant to the story.

79
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:43,256
With or without him, the Nazis
find the ark, open it and die.

80
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:49,918
- Aw! - Aw!
- Aw!

81
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:55,365
Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis
were digging in the wrong place.

82
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,078
The only reason they got the ark
was because Indy found it first.

83
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:01,263
Actually, they were only digging in the
wrong place because Indy had the medallion.

84
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,610
Without him, they would have had the
medallion and dug in the right place.

85
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,711
- Aw! - Aw!
- Aw!

86
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:15,373
Okay, I know you don't
want to talk about it,

87
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,971
but can I just ask you one
question about your mom's book?

88
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:19,321
No.

89
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:22,743
I just want to know why a five-year-old
boy puts on his mom's makeup

90
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,824
and wears balloon boobies.

91
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:30,454
They weren't boobies,
they were muscles.

92
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,263
And the makeup was green. I was
pretending to be The Hulk.

93
00:05:35,496 --> 00:05:37,930
- You were wearing her bra. - That was
to keep my muscles from sagging!

94
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:40,056
Can we please stop
talking about this?!

95
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:42,505
Okay, okay.

96
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:44,155
But you know,
as a student of psychology

97
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:47,346
who got a check-plus on her
first homework assignment...

98
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:51,529
I think, sometimes, it's good
to open up about these things.

99
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,654
Okay, fine.

100
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,720
Do you want to know why
I dressed like The Hulk?

101
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,230
Because I was always mad
at my mom

102
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,662
and I wanted to smash
my way out of that house.

103
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,912
- Well, why were you so angry?
- Gee, I don't know.

104
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:05,235
Maybe it's because I was always the
subject of her little experiments.

105
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:08,044
Did you get to the chapter where
she staged the Easter egg hunt

106
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,992
with no eggs to see how
long I'd keep looking?

107
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,109
The answer, by the way: June.

108
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,930
Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I
wish there was something

109
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:21,733
- I could do to make you feel better.
- I do, too, but there's not.

110
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,530
Really? Are you sure about that?

111
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,896
Of course, who am I to argue
with a check-plus student?

112
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,940
Mmm...

113
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:36,044
Just warning you-- I'm gonna go right.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

114
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,315
Is makeup really necessary?

115
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:49,524
Well, when someone looks
at your dating profile,

116
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:51,332
the first thing they see
is your picture.

117
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:54,126
I just want to make sure you
look fun and full of life

118
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,081
and not like a body they just
pulled out of the river.

119
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:01,472
All right, here we go, and...

120
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,959
smile.

121
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:10,205
Okay, uh-uh,
that one's in the bank.

122
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,763
How about this?

123
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,814
Turn away,
and then turn back into it.

124
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,454
But when you do, imagine the camera
is the girl you want to meet.

125
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,984
You got it.

126
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,338
Okay, uh, let's try it again.

127
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:38,153
Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you
want to meet doesn't want to hurt you.

128
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,102
I don't think
I can give you that.

129
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,485
Come on. One more time.

130
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:58,430
Yeah, it's, it's a little blurry, but
I think that works in your favor.

131
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,368
- Do you want a beer?
- Sure.

132
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:03,797
Hey, have you finished
writing your profile yet?

133
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:05,172
Almost.

134
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,429
Oh, what did you put as the
one-word description of yourself?

135
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:11,221
I put: unobjectionable.

136
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:15,269
But now that I hear it out loud, it
just seems like I'm being cocky.

137
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,896
What did you put
for your best feature?

138
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,563
My parents' money.

139
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:23,787
Uh, what did you put
for your best feature?

140
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:26,008
I put: not applicable.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,297
Come on, dude, you're being
too hard on yourself.

142
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:31,059
You've got a lot of
good stuff going on.

143
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,213
Really? Like what?

144
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:35,193
Well, okay, you're a,
you're a talented artist,

145
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:37,043
you own your own business.

146
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,736
Neither of those things have
ever helped me meet a woman.

147
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:45,097
Okay, well, can we imply
that you're well-endowed?

148
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:50,350
I do have one oddly
long testicle.

149
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,253
Okay, now you're
talking like a winner!

150
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,167
Whatcha doin'?

151
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:05,326
Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> is a flawless masterpiece.

152
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,524
He's got too much pride, she's got
too much prejudice-- it just works.

153
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:14,582
So you're looking to ruin something
for her in the funny pages?

154
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,742
Amy has a fondness for
the comic strip <i>Marmaduke.</i>

155
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:20,229
Mm-hmm. And...?

156
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:23,199
And I think I've got it.
Consider:

157
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:26,200
a family possesses a
dog that is so large

158
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:29,918
and poorly disciplined, he
causes nothing but problems.

159
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,134
Why do they keep him?!

160
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:35,914
Maybe they fell in love with him
as a puppy

161
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:38,015
and didn't know how big
he was gonna be.

162
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:39,943
Of course.

163
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,408
You know, why couldn't she
just like <i>Ziggy?</i> Yeah?

164
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,746
That thing's riddled
with plot holes.

165
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,240
- Sorry, buddy.
- Ooh!

166
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,959
I think she's a fan
of <i>Garfield</i> as well.

167
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:55,493
Oh, darn it, now so am I.

168
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:59,599
I'll see you later. I gotta go watch
a stupid football game with Penny.

169
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:00,890
Wait-- hang on.

170
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,447
You've spent time with Amy.

171
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,807
Can you think of
anything she's fond of

172
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:08,196
that has a bunch of flaws
she hasn't noticed?

173
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,825
I gotta go.

174
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,261
- You ready to go?
- Yep.

175
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:25,762
Hey, and maybe this time you don't
try and talk sports with the guys.

176
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:27,577
Some sports bar.

177
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,912
It's like they never
even heard of Quidditch.

178
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:31,915
Do we really have to go?

179
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,890
Oh, come on. Every time we're about to hang
out with my friends, you don't want to.

180
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,634
It's like, "It's too loud," or
"the bathroom's too dirty,"

181
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:40,334
or "they put a chicken wing
in my ear..." I mean...

182
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:43,461
Well, you're-you're right.
Let's just go.

183
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:46,249
- Hey, what's going on with you?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

184
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,516
All right, hang on.

185
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,199
Is this still about
your mom's book?

186
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,486
No. Not everything
is about my mom.

187
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,697
'Cause if you're still upset
about that, we don't have to go.

188
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,081
Except this is totally
about my mom.

189
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,632
I'm so sorry. I never
should have read that book.

190
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:03,348
You know what? You want to just get
dinner and watch the game here?

191
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:05,817
- That sounds nice. Yeah.
- Okay.

192
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:09,125
Or, you know, we could get take-out and
watch the Blu-ray extended version

193
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,643
of <i>The Hobbit</i> movie
with commentary track.

194
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:18,084
On account of how sad
I am about my mom.

195
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:25,231
Leonard, you ready for lunch?

196
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,926
One sec!

197
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:29,687
Hey. Sorry.

198
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:34,400
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi.

199
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,925
All right, sweetie. You
hang in there today.

200
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,681
I'll try, but I might
be sad again tonight.

201
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:40,287
Okay.

202
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:45,878
Wow! Sex at work?!

203
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:48,186
Leave it alone.
That's my girlfriend.

204
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:51,069
- Sorry.
- Who just had sex with me at work!

205
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,045
Damn. How'd you
swing that?

206
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:56,621
Well, whenever I talk about
how awful my mom was,

207
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:59,080
Penny will do anything
to make me feel better.

208
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,225
- Seriously?
- Look, I mean...

209
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:03,416
I'm not proud of it,
but it does work.

210
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,656
I-I got her to watch a six-part
documentary on <i>Monty Python.</i>

211
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:12,105
Even I was bored, I just wanted to
see if she'd make it to the end.

212
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:15,041
- You sound kind of proud of it.
- I am; I'm really proud.

213
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,918
Yeah.

214
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,513
Hello, Sheldon. Is
everything okay?

215
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:21,555
Yes.

216
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:22,563
Why?

217
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:24,977
Well, the last time you made
an unscheduled video-chat,

218
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,904
there was a curly fry
in your regular fries

219
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:30,151
and you thought someone might
be trying to slip you a mickey.

220
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,742
April 13...

221
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:36,482
a dark night, indeed.

222
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,948
So what can I do for you?

223
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,595
I'm calling to invite you to a
spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.

224
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,608
- Really?
- Yes.

225
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:49,051
You were kind enough to watch
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> with me.

226
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,295
So I'd like to return the favor

227
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:56,296
by inviting you to watch an episode of
your favorite childhood television series,

228
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:58,414
<i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

229
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,287
That sounds lovely.

230
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:05,062
Why are you rubbing
your hands together?

231
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,623
Um...

232
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,621
I'm putting on lotion.
Are you in or not?

233
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:14,494
- Of course I'm in.
- Excellent.

234
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,252
Then I shall see you tomorrow.

235
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:17,833
Good night, Dr. Fowler.

236
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,425
Good night, Dr. Cooper.

237
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:22,348
Good night, indeed.

238
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,023
What a rube.

239
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,887
Why would I put on lotion
when I have such soft hands?

240
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,930
You were really quiet during dinner.
Is everything okay?

241
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:36,169
Yeah. I guess I was just
thinking about my mom, and

242
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,339
how sad my childhood was.

243
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,786
Yeah, I bet it sucked. I'm gonna
take a bath; you do the dishes.

244
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:48,157
How about I take a bath with
you and see what happens.

245
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,509
Here's what's gonna happen:

246
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:53,027
I'm gonna take a bath, and
you're gonna do the dishes.

247
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,703
That's it? No compassion?

248
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,277
Aw, poor Howie. We good?
I'm gonna take a bath.

249
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,079
Bernie...

250
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:02,539
God, what is going on with you?

251
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:04,911
I'm sharing my pain.

252
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:08,796
And I'm not buying it.
Try again.

253
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:12,943
I'm learning to be
a man in a culture

254
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:15,846
where it's increasingly
difficult to know how...?

255
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,977
Strike two.

256
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,379
I'm copying Leonard. When
he does this to Penny,

257
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,492
they have sex and
watch <i>Monty Python.</i>

258
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,626
- Howard! I know.
- It was dumb, I shouldn't have done it.

259
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:29,379
And it's making me feel sad...

260
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,883
So sad.

261
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,686
You know, why don't you
take a bath? I'll do the dishes.

262
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:43,205
Three, two, one...

263
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:44,975
That's it.

264
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,808
Our dating profiles are
live on the Internet.

265
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:52,738
Attention all shoppers: my
business is open for business!

266
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:55,676
That's right, ladies.

267
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:59,467
For all you know, I'm confident
and fun to be around.

268
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:06,304
Oh, cool, it tells you when
someone's reading your profile.

269
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,201
"Jenny309."

270
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,838
I hope that's not her weight.

271
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,108
If it is, I'll...
I'll take her.

272
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,931
Good one.

273
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:21,337
Ooh, I got one, too.

274
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:24,075
The ladies are coming to us.

275
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:27,474
Oh, man, if I'd started
this years ago,

276
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:30,066
I'd be divorced two
or three times by now.

277
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,522
What...? Another one.

278
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:35,595
You know,
it... it's weird.

279
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,179
When they're reading
your profile, does it...

280
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,941
does it make you feel exposed?
Like they see you naked?

281
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:45,371
Well, they're not running
away screaming, so, no.

282
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,637
I love <i>Little House.</i>

283
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:53,464
It made me want to live on a farm
so much I tried to milk my cat.

284
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,977
That tangy bowl of Cheerios
was not worth the stitches.

285
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:07,247
Well, you sit back, relax and
enjoy a beloved childhood memory.

286
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:13,732
You see that cabin there?

287
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:17,728
I read they were illegally
squatting on Indian land.

288
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:23,451
Yeah. Personally, I think what we did
to the Native Americans was wrong,

289
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:26,218
but this is your
favorite show, not mine.

290
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:31,670
Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls,
eating that peanut butter sandwich.

291
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:35,108
Peanut butter?! Huh!

292
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:41,840
That's strange, since peanut butter
wasn't introduced until the early 1900s.

293
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,513
If I knew this show was about time travel,
I would have watched it much sooner.

294
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,968
You're trying to get back at me for what
I said about <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

295
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,535
That's silly.

296
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,744
Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a
telephone, since telephones only existed

297
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,605
in large cities at that time.

298
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:06,169
This is more like <i>Little
House on the Preposterous.</i>

299
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,718
Sheldon, we're
in a relationship.

300
00:17:09,924 --> 00:17:12,407
When you get angry,
just tell me.

301
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,557
You don't need to seek revenge.

302
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:16,433
Are you sure?

303
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,534
Every time my dad
stayed out all night,

304
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,780
my mom would put hamster
poop in his chewing tobacco.

305
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,969
Well, that's not how
we're going to do it.

306
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:28,571
Fine.

307
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:30,369
I'm mad at you.

308
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:34,869
Not only did you ruin <i>Raiders</i> for me, you
may have ruined the whole franchise.

309
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:38,997
Except for the fourth one, which was
bad before you got your mitts on it.

310
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,123
I-I shouldn't have said it.
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,540
Thank you.

312
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,168
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.

313
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,381
But not as good as
I'm going to when I tell you

314
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,595
that your precious Garfield has
no reason to hate Mondays.

315
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:56,329
He's a cat. He
doesn't have a job.

316
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:04,140
Hey, I was just--
what is happening?

317
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:07,204
Oh, just a little treat.

318
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:10,470
I know you've been feeling really
bad about your mom lately.

319
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,396
Oh, oh, I have. So bad.

320
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,964
And I wanted to make
you feel better,

321
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:18,579
so I planned something
very special for you.

322
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,515
Uh-huh, uh-huh. I can
already feel it working.

323
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,696
Hello, Leonard.

324
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:29,636
Mom?!

325
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:32,796
I understand you have been
whining about my parenting

326
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:35,671
in order to emotionally
manipulate your girlfriend.

327
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:37,280
I... uh...

328
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,717
Bernadette told me everything.

329
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:40,970
Now you don't get
the left or the right.

330
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:47,801
Let's discuss why you continue
to involve me in your sex life.

331
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:51,083
Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.

332
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:56,032
When you were six years old, you
walked in on me and your father naked.

333
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:01,429
I was swatting his bottom with
your brand new Ping Pong paddle.

334
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,877
I didn't dream that?

335
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,517
How did that make you feel?

336
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:14,787
Penny, come back! I'm
sad for real now!

337
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:20,766
In the last two hours, 162
women have read our profiles.

338
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:22,547
How many of them have
sent us messages?

339
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:24,322
- Combined?
- Yes.

340
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:26,040
Zero.

341
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:30,128
Dude, this is...
this is brutal.

342
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:32,875
I don't think I've
ever felt so rejected.

343
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,135
And I had a rescue dog who
ran back to the pound.

344
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:40,728
This is the worst.

345
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:44,674
If we're gonna get shot down, we might as
well just go to a bar and do it old school.

346
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:46,485
And make them
look us in the eye.

347
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,533
Yeah, anything is
better than this.

348
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:50,079
Hello.

349
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,006
Not interested.

350
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,292
I was wrong.
This is worse.

351
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,748
Wait, wait-- if it wasn't
for Indiana Jones,

352
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,831
the ark would never have
ended up at the warehouse!

353
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,500
That's true!

354
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:15,670
He collected and delivered the ark to
the proper authorities for filing.

355
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:16,733
Like a hero!

356
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,273
- Yeah!
- Yes! - Right!

357
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:23,964
Although, technically, Indy was supposed
to take the ark to a museum to be studied.

358
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,012
He couldn't even get that done.

359
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:29,545
Aw...
