1
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:04,864
Should you really be
sitting in Sheldon's spot?

2
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:06,258
(groans)

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,194
He's in Texas.
He'll never know.

4
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:09,962
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

5
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:11,564
Yeah, he has
a very sensitive butt.

6
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,434
Well, it's true.

7
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:18,838
Once I saw him sit on a bunch
of loose change and add it up.

8
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:21,440
Have you heard from Howard?

9
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:23,676
I did.
His talk at NASA went great.

10
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:24,910
Sheldon didn't heckle him?

11
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:26,579
No, in fact, he was
so well-behaved,

12
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,280
Howie bought him
a Buzz Aldrin bobble head

13
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:29,582
and astronaut ice cream.

14
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,816
(knocking on door)

15
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:32,184
Hey, guys.

16
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,486
Oh, hi. - Hi, Stewart.
Hey, Stewart!

17
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:35,354
How's it going?
Good.

18
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:37,990
Sheldon's out of town,
so we can do whatever we want.

19
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:40,126
We even ordered from
the Thai place he doesn't like.

20
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:41,260
Oh, how is it?

21
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:43,295
Disgusting. Do not tell him.

22
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:45,765
What do you guys want
to do tonight?

23
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:46,832
I don't know.

24
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,401
Well, I told Howie
if I wasn't busy,

25
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:50,002
I'd spend the night
at his mom's.

26
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:52,271
So for God's sake,
think of something.

27
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:54,840
(Stuart coughing)

28
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,142
Stuart?

29
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:57,176
Are you okay?

30
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,545
No, I don't feel so...

31
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:01,213
Oh, Stuart?
Stuart?

32
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:03,115
Oh, my God,
you guys need to do something!

33
00:01:03,117 --> 00:01:05,184
Stuart?
Calling 911.

34
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,319
Well, it's too late.
What do you mean it's too late?

35
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:10,556
He's been murdered
by someone in this room.

36
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:12,091
(dramatic music plays)

37
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:14,460
Oh, my God.
Oh, come on!

38
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,995
Welcome to another classic

39
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:19,832
Koothrappali
murder mystery dinner.

40
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:20,900
I'm leaving.

41
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:23,302
You can't leave.

42
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:24,970
You're a suspect in
the mysterious murder

43
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:27,006
of Stuart Bloom.

44
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,175
(dramatic music plays)

45
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,577
I didn't know his
last name was Bloom.

46
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,946
Yeah, it's Bloom.

47
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:35,181
Are you really gonna
lie on the floor

48
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:36,549
and pretend
to be dead all night?

49
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:38,751
What do you think

60
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:11,886
Are you gonna make us pretend
to be a bunch of lame characters

61
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,588
with silly accents?

62
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,557
"Lame characters
with silly ac..."

63
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,260
What kind of actress are you?

64
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:22,630
You're right, I'm sorry.

65
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:25,133
It... sounds like fun.
Thank you.

66
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:26,868
That kind of actress.
This sucks!

67
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,938
Come on, guys.

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,105
Raj put a lot of
effort into this.

69
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,140
And that's great.

70
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:35,443
It's not sad, it's great.

71
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,378
I think it might be fun
to be someone else tonight.

72
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,013
Actually, you're all just
gonna be yourselves.

73
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:40,815
Oh... ugh.

74
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:43,618
All right,
if I'm doing this,

75
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,553
I'm playing to win,
so just to be clear:

76
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,956
If we're ourselves, that means
one of us killed Stuart?

77
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,057
Very good, Bernadette.

78
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,592
You are a regular
Byomkesh Bakshi.

79
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:54,796
What is that, like,
the Indian Sherlock Holmes?

80
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:58,700
Or is Sherlock Holmes
the English Byomkesh Bakshi?

81
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,003
According to Wikipedia,
Sherlock Holmes came first.

82
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,872
Great, everyone's
a Byomkesh Bakshi.

83
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,908
Now... here are

84
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,310
some secret facts

85
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:10,645
about each of you,

86
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:13,581
including whether
you are the murderer.

87
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,949
Throughout the game, feel free

88
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,385
to ask each other questions
to uncover clues.

89
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:18,920
Got it. Hey...

90
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:21,222
who's the murderer?

91
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:25,226
Any question but that.

92
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,228
Sorry. Hey...

93
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,064
who's <i>not</i> the murderer?

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,736
Bernadette, can you not stand
so close to me?

95
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:35,737
What do you care? You're dead.

96
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:36,938
Suit yourself.

97
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,640
But I can kind of...
see up your skirt.

98
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,551
Thank you
for my bobble head.

99
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:53,788
Thank you for not making fun
of me during my speech.

100
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,957
It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?

101
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:01,729
We can't show up to
your mom's empty-handed.

102
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,364
We should bring something.

103
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,932
I already am.

104
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:06,868
I'm bringing
the gift of knowledge.

105
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,736
Oh, boy.

106
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,905
Despite what her Bible says,

107
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,840
recent archeological
studies indicate

108
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:15,710
that although camels are
referenced in the Old Testament,

109
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:17,578
they didn't exist
in the Middle East

110
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,981
until hundreds of years later.

111
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,784
I was gonna say we pick up
a cake or a pie.

112
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,353
But an insult to her faith
is always thoughtful.

113
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,558
So, what happens next?

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,126
I can't tell you that.

115
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:33,461
But perhaps the killer dropped

116
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,129
a fun and imaginative clue

117
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,831
somewhere in the apartment.

118
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,965
Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge,

119
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,802
and see if there are
any clues inside a beer.

120
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,438
Hey, I-I found something.

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,373
It looks like a little man
with a briefcase.

122
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,542
Oh, no, no.
That's Clarence Darrow.

123
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:50,945
It's from a game Sheldon made up
called <i>Chutes and Lawyers.</i>

124
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,582
You slide down a chute
and then work your way back up

125
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:56,784
through the appellate system.

126
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,823
Well, unlike that,
my games are much more fun.

127
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:02,890
Okay, can I ask you something?

128
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,292
Why do you like making us
do this stuff?

129
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:06,627
Well, I guess
it goes back to

130
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,996
when I was a fat kid in India,
and didn't have any friends.

131
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:10,298
I didn't know you were fat.

132
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,632
Yeah, I was...

133
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,402
I was 200 pounds by the time
I was in middle school.

134
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,304
Kids were mean.

135
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,505
Cows may be sacred there,

136
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:19,707
but it doesn't help
if you look like one.

137
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:22,743
Anyway, I was pretty lonely,

138
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,612
so I had to make up
my own stories and games,

139
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:25,913
and I promised myself

140
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:28,082
if I ever made
any friends that...

141
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:30,518
that I would play
those games with them.

142
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
That is so sweet.

143
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:34,288
I've seen old pictures of you.

144
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,057
You were never a fat kid.

145
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:37,825
No, I was svelte as a gazelle.

146
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:42,430
A gazelle blessed with a flair
for storytelling.

147
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,732
(dramatic music plays)

148
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:48,870
Hey, what about this?
It looks like a receipt.

149
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:49,804
What's it for?

150
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:50,905
For a cup of coffee.

151
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:52,907
But it's dated
20 years from now.

152
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,342
From the future?!

153
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:56,511
How fun and imaginative.

154
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,448
So one of us came back
from the future

155
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,216
to murder Stuart?
Correct.

156
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:04,118
Does the gazelle with a flair
for storytelling

157
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,654
know he's just ripping off
<i>Terminator?</i>

158
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:09,123
Does the smart-ass know
that <i>Terminator</i> was actually

159
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,858
ripped off from an <i>Outer Limits</i>
script called

160
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,027
<i>Demon With a Glass Hand,</i>
by Harlan Ellison?

161
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:16,330
Oh, does the gazelle know that
according to Harlan Ellison,

162
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,733
it was not ripped off
from <i>Demon With a Glass Hand,</i>

163
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:21,335
but was ripped off from another
<i>Outer Limits</i> script

164
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:22,937
he wrote called <i>The Soldier?</i>

165
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,173
I'm gonna need
another clue.

166
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,144
Okay...

167
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:32,113
give me
the flowers and pie.

168
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,215
But if we show up
and you're holding them,

169
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:36,150
she'll think
they're only from you.

170
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:37,552
They are only from me.

171
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:40,521
You said the gift
of you was enough.

172
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:42,990
Yes... but now

173
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:44,725
that I've seen
what the gift of me

174
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,127
with flowers and pie looks like,

175
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,662
there's no going back.

176
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:53,000
Boy, I can't wait to see
the look on her face...

177
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:54,202
We're leaving right now.

178
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:55,369
What's wrong?
Nothing.

179
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,772
What? Sheldon, tell me
what's going on!

180
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,173
I saw my mommy with a naked man

181
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:00,808
and she was trying
to be a mommy again.

182
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:15,453
You ready to talk about it?

183
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,588
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

184
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:23,194
Okay.

185
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,134
Do you have any idea
what it's like to see

186
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,069
your mother ravaging someone?

187
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:32,506
Does a brisket count?

188
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,544
I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough.

189
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:39,045
But didn't she know
we were coming?

190
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:40,046
No.

191
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:41,915
I wanted to surprise her.

192
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:45,018
What am I supposed to say to
her after something like this?

193
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,853
Well, did she see you
in the window?

194
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:47,954
No.

195
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,055
Then don't say anything.

196
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:51,258
I have to.

197
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,027
How can we ever hope to have
a healthy relationship

198
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:56,429
if I don't tell her
how disappointed I am,

199
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,798
and that I'll never forgive her?

200
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,868
Well, don't do it on the phone.

201
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,370
No, I'm just going
to tell her I'm coming

202
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:06,740
so she can give that Good
Time Charlie the heave-ho.

203
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,508
That's some tough talk.

204
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,143
I may need to cut you off.

205
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,279
Yeah, maybe you better.

206
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,481
I took a pretty big sip.

207
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:20,187
Look, she's a grown woman.

208
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,857
And-and your dad's been
gone a long time.

209
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,793
Maybe this is
none of your business.

210
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,762
I beg to differ.

211
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:31,231
I used to live in
those genitals.

212
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,668
And if someone wants
to move into my old room,

213
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,102
I should at least get a vote.

214
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,909
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Okay, murder suspects,

215
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,912
Leonard has found the time
machine the killer must've used.

216
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:47,047
You're all inside it,

217
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:49,683
and we hurtle
through the very fabric of time.

218
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:52,953
(electronic
sound effects playing)

219
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:01,094
And welcome
to 20 years in the future.

220
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,731
Hey, you guys
just time-traveled.

221
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,334
Stop looking so bored.

222
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:09,803
Well, my beer isn't flat
and my rack's not saggy.

223
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,938
So far, the future's great.

224
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:16,176
Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

225
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:18,345
Fine, just try not
to look too alive.

226
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,446
That's my jam.

227
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,252
So one of us went back
in time to kill Stuart?

228
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:26,353
But why?

229
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:28,188
Perhaps this will help.

230
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,289
Here are some facts

231
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,926
about yourselves in the future

232
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,996
that might contain a clue.

233
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:36,997
Hey, I-I won

234
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,965
the Nobel Prize in physiology.

235
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:41,701
Then I used the money to buy
Stuart's comic book store,

236
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:45,438
and close it down so Sheldon
would pay attention to me.

237
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,410
Not the worst idea.

238
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,147
Hey, I'm a famous actress
living in London.

239
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,082
Hmm! I'm a professor at Stanford.
Hmm!

240
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,984
So I guess you two are
making it work long distance.

241
00:09:57,986 --> 00:09:59,252
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Oh, no.

242
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:01,521
In this game,
as your careers both took off,

243
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:02,355
you drifted apart.

244
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,057
Kind of like how future me

245
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,326
lost touch with you guys
after I became boy toy

246
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,963
for the wrinkled,
but still flexible, Madonna.

247
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,533
What does
your card say, Bernadette?

248
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:14,634
LEONARD:
Eh, eh, eh, hang on.

249
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,636
Do-do you think
we'd really drift apart

250
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:18,204
if we both became successful?

251
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:19,673
Of course not.

252
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:21,341
If I became a famous actress
and had to move,

253
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:22,776
you would just come with me.

254
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:26,379
But if I get a chance
to be a tenured professor,

255
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,948
I might not have that much
choice in where I end up.

256
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,784
Yeah, but if I become
a successful actress,

257
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,352
we wouldn't need the money.

258
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,388
Well, you don't go
into science for the money.

259
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,389
Speak for yourself.

260
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,358
Last month,
my company both invented

261
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,361
and cured
Restless Eye Syndrome.

262
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:46,466
Ka-ching,
ya blinky chumps.

263
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:50,003
So, wait, if my career
took me somewhere else,

264
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:51,404
you might not go?

265
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:52,872
Well...

266
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,874
(sings dramatic stinger)

267
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,511
He started it.

268
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,047
Okay, okay, guys--
new back stories.

269
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,184
Uh, Penny and Leonard,
you two lovebirds are

270
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,453
super successful
and living in New York.

271
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:08,254
Uh, you're an actress,
you're a professor

272
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,756
and you have
three beautiful kids.

273
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:10,790
Great.

274
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:11,925
Really? You think I'm putting

275
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:13,426
this body through three kids?

276
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:17,864
Okay, let's do this.

277
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:18,898
Good luck.

278
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,033
You...

279
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,701
Aren't you gonna come with me?

280
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:24,204
While you confront your mother
about her sex life?

281
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:27,774
I'd rather go back to that bar
in ass-less chaps.

282
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:35,482
Mother?

283
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:36,883
Mother.

284
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:38,351
Mother?

285
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:41,254
Shelly!
I'm so glad you're here!

286
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,223
I saw you having naked sex.

287
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,594
What are you talking about?

288
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:49,796
Earlier, I came here
to surprise you.

289
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:52,799
I looked in the window
and I saw you with a man.

290
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,635
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry.

291
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,270
Come in.

292
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:00,907
Um...

293
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:03,410
Maybe we should sit down

294
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,111
and talk about this.

295
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:07,380
Can you recommend a surface

296
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,549
you haven't had coitus on?

297
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,953
That's not funny.

298
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,559
Maybe we should sit
at the table.

299
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:29,135
Well, I'm sure that, uh,

300
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:31,471
you...

301
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,473
have a lot of questions.

302
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,575
Who was he?

303
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:36,543
His name is Ron.

304
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,611
I met him at my prayer group.

305
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:41,481
How long have you been
involved with him?

306
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:42,682
A few months.

307
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:44,684
And of those few months,

308
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:48,121
how long have you been
a demented sex pervert?

309
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:53,593
That is no way
to speak to your mother.

310
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,161
Perhaps not.

311
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:57,997
But it is a way to speak
to a woman who quoted the Bible

312
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,066
to me my whole life,
and then desecrates

313
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:02,936
one of Ethan Allen's
finest sofas.

314
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,171
I will give you one opportunity,

315
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:06,306
young man, to apologize.

316
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:08,675
Or what?

317
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:09,909
Or I will send you to your room.

318
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:12,178
That's ridiculous.

319
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,947
I am a grown man.

320
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:15,782
I am a professional scientist.

321
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:18,218
And I currently occupy
the moral high ground.

322
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,252
Go to your room.

323
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:24,624
But I occupy
the moral high ground.

324
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:25,825
Go to your room.

325
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:28,862
But I'm
a professional scientist.

326
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:31,631
Go... to your room!

327
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:38,371
I'm a grown man.

328
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:42,742
Can we please get back
to the game?

329
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:43,843
I-I-In a minute.

330
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:45,311
I-I-I don't understand
why any success

331
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,313
you have in acting
is more important

332
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:49,082
than any I have in science.

333
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,117
Okay, if you do
something cool in science,

334
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,385
you might change the world.

335
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:53,520
If I become

336
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:55,221
a famous actress...

337
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:57,524
I'm not gonna tell you
why movie stars are the best.

338
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,158
They just are.

339
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,962
I'm surprised you guys never
talked about this stuff.

340
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,198
Like you and Sheldon have
everything figured out?

341
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,299
Actually,

342
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:07,267
our relationship agreement

343
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,469
covers a wide array
of scenarios,

344
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:12,038
including career changes,
financial instability,

345
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,474
intelligent dog uprising...

346
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:16,943
FYI, we plan on selling out

347
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:19,112
the human race hard.

348
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:25,018
In 20 years, who knows
what'll happen with any of us?

349
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,487
I think you and Leonard
will be together.

350
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,055
You do?
Yeah.

351
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:31,224
I think you're
the best couple I know.

352
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:32,825
Aw.
That's so sweet.

353
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,228
What the hell?!
Excuse me?

354
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,195
Ah-da-da-da-da!

355
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:38,164
Let the dead man talk.

356
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,400
So, why do you think that?

357
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:42,201
Uh, well, I feel like

358
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:45,271
you guys make each
other better.

359
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:47,106
Penny brought Leonard
out of his shell.

360
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,341
And it seems like Leonard

361
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:50,443
makes Penny think more
deeply about the world.

362
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:51,611
I don't know.

363
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,681
Together, you two kind of
make one awesome person.

364
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:56,883
Aw, Stuart.

365
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,419
Now I feel bad
for murdering you.

366
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:02,121
Oh, come on!

367
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,590
Penny did it! I win!

368
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:06,559
Suck it, jackasses!

369
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,198
(knocking on door)

370
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,867
Hey, can I come in?

371
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,803
Apparently any man
is welcome in this house.

372
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:18,938
Why not you?

373
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,375
I thought you were waiting
in the car.

374
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:24,377
That was an hour ago, Sheldon.

375
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:26,980
A Jew sits in front of a house
in Texas that long,

376
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,115
"For Sale" signs
start to go up.

377
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:35,421
I take it things didn't
go smoothly with your mom.

378
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,790
No.

379
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,927
I'm not sure how we're going
to get past this.

380
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,128
You know, I...

381
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,797
I sort of went
through something

382
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,599
like this myself.

383
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,268
Howard, we've all seen
your mother naked.

384
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,973
That woman needs to learn
how to tie a robe.

385
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:57,543
I'm talking about when
my mom started seeing someone

386
00:15:57,545 --> 00:15:59,846
a couple years
after my dad left.

387
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:02,682
I didn't know she did.

388
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:06,252
Yeah, she was dating this guy,

389
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:10,189
and I was kind of a jerk
to her about it.

390
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:12,458
What did you do?

391
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,527
Well, let's just say
it was the most vicious

392
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:17,664
bar mitzvah speech in
the history of Temple Beth El.

393
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:21,834
Anyway, she broke up with him.

394
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:23,803
And she's basically

395
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:26,039
been alone ever since.

396
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:30,677
She never said it,
but I always felt

397
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,880
I was the reason why.

398
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:34,847
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:36,315
Although,
based on your story,

400
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:40,253
you absolutely
were the reason why.

401
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:43,356
All I'm saying is
you might not want

402
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:46,726
to get in the way
of your mom's happiness.

403
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:50,563
You may have a point.

404
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:53,399
I love my mother.

405
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:57,537
Even if she fornicates
like a demonic weasel.

406
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:04,510
And the healing begins.

407
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:09,916
Hello.

408
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:10,950
Hello.

409
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,285
Are you ready to discuss

410
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:14,020
this calmly, like adults?

411
00:17:14,022 --> 00:17:16,556
I am.

412
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:32,038
Shelly, I'm sorry that
you saw what you saw.

413
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,373
I know that this
is hard for you.

414
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,709
I think what most upsets me
about it, Mother,

415
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,478
is the hypocrisy.

416
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,446
Doesn't this contradict

417
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:43,649
all the religious rules you've
been espousing your whole life?

418
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:45,151
You're right, it does,
and it's something

419
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:47,453
that I'm struggling
with these days.

420
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:49,155
Then why are you doing it?

421
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:51,991
Because I'm not
perfect, Shelly.

422
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:54,961
And that man's booty is.

423
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:03,870
Well, this is confusing for me.

424
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:06,372
But I don't want to stand
in the way of your happiness.

425
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,341
So...

426
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:11,010
I'll condemn you internally
while maintaining

427
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:13,946
an outward appearance
of acceptance.

428
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:18,518
That is very Christian of you.

429
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:22,722
Mother, if you're going
to conduct your life

430
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:25,124
in this fashion,
then I should let you know

431
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:28,294
that the world has changed
since you were a young woman.

432
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,662
You know,
it's not all sock hops,

433
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:33,466
soda jerks
and segregation anymore.

434
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:37,036
How old do you think I am?

435
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,706
My point is that you're going
to need to be careful.

436
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,041
You used to be protected

437
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:44,811
by your pre-Enlightenment
mythology,

438
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:47,513
but now you're going
to need a stronger friend

439
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:50,550
named latex.

440
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:55,755
Are you having the
sex talk with me?

441
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:57,089
Well, someone has to.

442
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:59,625
Oh, dear Lord!
Yeah, well...

443
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:02,195
No, don't look to Him.
He's mad at you right now.

444
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,763
Oh, come on, don't pout.

445
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:15,465
I'm sorry I ruined your game.

446
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,633
I'm not pouting, I'm brooding.

447
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:20,837
Which is how sexy men pout.

448
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:24,173
It actually was kind of fun.

449
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,274
You're just saying that.

450
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,410
Yeah.

451
00:19:30,014 --> 00:19:31,981
I liked the time travel element.

452
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:34,183
Thank you.
I thought it was inspired.

453
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:35,952
It was. By <i>Terminator.</i>

454
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:38,654
Well, I hope 20 years from now,

455
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:39,856
we really are all still together

456
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:40,857
and still friends.

457
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,291
Definitely.
Of course.

458
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:43,626
Well, hey, how about this?

459
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:46,129
Whether we're friends,
not friends,

460
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,797
scattered around the world,
no matter what,

461
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,932
let's all promise to meet
in front of this building

462
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,235
exactly 20 years
from tonight at 8:00 p.m.

463
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:53,903
and have dinner
like we always do.

464
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,171
PENNY:
Aw! I love it.

465
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,205
Okay?

466
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:57,273
Putting it
in my phone right now.

467
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:58,474
Yeah, me, too.

468
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:02,078
My phone doesn't
have a calendar.

469
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:08,618
It's all right, I'll just
write it on my hand.

470
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:12,955
And it's done.

471
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,290
Yup, we're all in.

472
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:16,225
All right, I'll see you guys
in 20 years.

473
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:25,986
I knew it.
