1
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:07,184
Boy, do I have to urinate.

2
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,204
If only there were a
solution to that.

3
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:15,217
Seriously. I feel like I've
got a fish tank in my pelvis.

4
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:17,781
So go to the bathroom.

5
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,201
I can't.

6
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,051
Why not?

7
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:25,975
Because I'm trying to decide between
getting an Xbox One or a PS4.

8
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:29,868
Oh, "pee." Why'd
I say that?

9
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:37,018
Forgive me for asking a stupid question,
but why are you being stupid?

10
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,465
I'm not being stupid.

11
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:41,666
I'm employing the work of
Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk,

12
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:46,010
who found that people with full
bladders make better decisions.

13
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:49,062
Why did I pee before I
decided to move in here?

14
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:51,861
- Hi!
- Hey.

15
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,727
- Oh, how'd the audition go?
- I killed it.

16
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:56,046
I was even able to cry real
tears right on the spot.

17
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:57,346
- Oh, that's great.
- I know.

18
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:58,930
Next time I get pulled over
for a speeding ticket,

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,050
here come the waterworks.

20
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:03,565
Here come the waterworks!

21
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,462
- Aren't you gonna ask?
- What is this, my first day?

32
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,365
Can I get your opinion on something
that happened at work today?

33
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,718
- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

34
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:46,323
Okay, well, I did something that will
either make me look like a lovable goof

35
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:50,197
or a horrible monster damned
to spend eternity in hell.

36
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,276
I'm sure it's lovable.

37
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,887
I'm gonna go with monster.
What do you got?

38
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:58,159
Well, there's this lady in
our office who's retiring,

39
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:00,717
and they were passing around one of
those big cards for us to sign...

40
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:01,584
Okay.

41
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:02,944
But no one told
me she was in

42
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:05,447
a horrible car accident
over the weekend

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,824
and what I was signing
was not a retirement card

44
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,151
but was actually a
"get well" card.

45
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:13,027
I'm liking my odds here.

46
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:16,449
So on the card,
in the hospital,

47
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,483
next to the woman who's
clinging to life are the words,

48
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:22,671
"Hey, Vivian. You
deserve this."

49
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:29,325
"And at least with you gone, no one will
steal my yogurt out of the fridge."

50
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:31,747
No!

51
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:37,167
- "LOL. Smiley face."
- Oh, my gosh.

52
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:40,382
"P.S. Good luck
wherever you wind up."

53
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,437
Why didn't I put
money on this?

54
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,553
Hey, that's my agent. If I got the
part, it's still the second best thing

55
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:51,213
I've heard all day. Hello?

56
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:55,263
- Am I a terrible person?
- No. No, it was a mistake.

57
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:56,987
Am I a terrible person
that it crossed my mind

58
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,239
that she might die and
never see the card?

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,012
Now I think you're
flirting with the line.

60
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,885
- Good news?
- No, I didn't get it.

61
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:06,363
I'm so sorry.

62
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:08,189
You'll get offered
something soon.

63
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:12,266
I kind of did. The part in that awful
horror movie I passed on came back around.

64
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:14,247
Apparently, it's
mine if I want it.

65
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,861
- Are you gonna take it?
- I don't know what to do.

66
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:20,108
Maybe you'll get hit
by a car and die.

67
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,063
LOL, right?

68
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:33,031
Hey. Emily, right?

69
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:34,111
Yeah...

70
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:36,791
I-I don't know if
you remember me...

71
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,570
From the dating Web site.

72
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,069
Your friend e-mailed me
because you were afraid to,

73
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,058
then you tracked me down
and acted like a lunatic?

74
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:45,572
Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali.

75
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,241
Look, uh, I just...

76
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,456
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

77
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:53,402
Okay? You were, like, the coolest
person I ever found online,

78
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:57,839
and I got really nervous
and I-I just blew it.

79
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,132
Uh, don't worry about it.

80
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:03,131
And if it makes you feel any better,
you're not the weirdest guy

81
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,398
I've met off the Internet.

82
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:05,591
Well,

83
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:08,049
give me a chance-- you
don't even know me.

84
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,136
All right,

85
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,406
here's your chance.

86
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:16,121
Wha... Really?

87
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:17,636
Thank you.

88
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:19,196
Fate has given me a
rare second chance,

89
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:22,309
and I swear to Vishnu
I'm not gonna blow it.

90
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,663
Or normal words followed
by a charming smile.

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,034
So, first there was
PlayStation-- aka PS1--

92
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:37,324
then PS2, PS3 and now PS4.
And that makes sense.

93
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,275
You'd think after Xbox,
there'd be Xbox 2.

94
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:43,328
But no, next
came Xbox 360.

95
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:48,766
Hmm? And now, after
360, comes Xbox One.

96
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,579
Why "One"?

97
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:54,439
Maybe that's how many seconds of
thought they put into naming it.

98
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,712
Can you get the
butter, please?

99
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:58,580
You know, however,
with the Xbox One,

100
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,566
I can control my entire entertainment
system using voice commands.

101
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:05,528
Up until now, I've
had to use Leonard.

102
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,412
Then get the other one.
Pass the butter.

103
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,592
Get... Hang on.

104
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:13,540
I don't feel like you're
taking this dilemma seriously.

105
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,354
Fine, Sheldon.

106
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,127
You have my undivided
attention.

107
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:22,776
Okay, now, the PS4 is more
angular and sleek-looking.

108
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,527
- No way.
- Yeah, well, it's true.

109
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,252
But the larger size of the Xbox
One may keep it from overheating.

110
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:31,652
Well, you wouldn't want your
gaming system to overheat.

111
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,899
No, see? Well, you
absolutely would not.

112
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,795
And furthermore, the Xbox One now
comes with a Kinect included.

113
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,743
- Included?!
- Yes!

114
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:43,576
Not sold separately.
Although...

115
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:46,907
the PS4 uses cool
new GDDR5 RAM,

116
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:50,061
while the Xbox One is still using
the conventional DDR3 memory.

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,408
Why would they still be using
DDR3? Are they nuts?!

118
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:56,902
See? That's
what I thought.

119
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:59,648
But then they go and throw
in an ESRAM buffer.

120
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,067
Whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

121
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,719
- Who's "they"?
- Xbox.

122
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:05,465
- You're kidding!
- No, I am not!

123
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,832
And this ESRAM buffer
should totally bridge

124
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,805
the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth
gap between the two RAM types.

125
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:13,512
This is a nightmare. How will
you ever make a decision?

126
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,674
You see? I don't know!
What should I do?

127
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:18,256
Please pass the butter!

128
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:30,611
Okay, it's not me, right?
This script is terrible.

129
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:32,366
Yeah.

130
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,954
I had higher hopes
for a movie called

131
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:39,134
<i>Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey
See, Monkey Kill.</i>

132
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,568
You know, it's still possible for
you to be good in a bad movie.

133
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,386
Okay.

134
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:51,603
"Sometimes I feel like I can control " the
killer gorilla instinct inside of me,

135
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:54,421
"but then I see these
bananas and I...

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,679
just want to eat them
and then kill people."

137
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,935
- What am I gonna do?
- Well,

138
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,882
for starters, I wouldn't
eat the bananas.

139
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,306
No...

140
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,817
- Come on! This is serious.
- Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?

141
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,706
Less than I was making at
The Cheesecake Factory.

142
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,466
What does your
agent think?

143
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,815
She's thinking of taking a job
at The Cheesecake Factory.

144
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,132
You know what, why
don't you just do it?

145
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:23,565
You'll go have fun for a few
weeks, make some money--

146
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,804
and who knows what
it might lead to?

147
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:31,302
Okay, look, here, page 58. I
oil-wrestle an orangutan in a bikini.

148
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,326
Just to clarify, which one of
you is wearing the bikini?

149
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:37,564
Both of us.

150
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,689
So it's a family film.

151
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,424
Thank you again for dinner.

152
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:46,433
You're welcome.

153
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:50,144
- Good night.
- Uh, it's date night.

154
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,928
Aren't you, uh,
forgetting something?

155
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,280
Oh, of course.

156
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:07,134
Did I mention the PS4
controllers light up?

157
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:10,905
No.

158
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:13,393
Well, they do.

159
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:19,087
And then after coffee,
we went for a walk

160
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:21,117
and she told me she always
thought people from India

161
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:22,730
were exotic and
mysterious.

162
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,829
So, with my mouth, I said,
"We're just like anybody else,"

163
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:30,269
but with my eyes, I said, "Straight
up, Red, hop on my flying carpet."

164
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,359
So, you gonna
see her again?

165
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:35,786
Yeah, we have plans
this weekend.

166
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:40,701
And if it's a clear night, I'm gonna
lay some romantic astronomy on her.

167
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,754
Okay, like what? Show me.

168
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,632
I can't do that
to Leonard.

169
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:48,063
This is some powerful
panty-dropping stuff.

170
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,757
You have my blessing.
Go for it.

171
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:54,746
Okay.

172
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,430
Penny,

173
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:03,345
two of the brightest stars in the
night sky are Altair and Vega.

174
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:07,922
And it is said they were deeply
in love but forever separated

175
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:10,763
by the celestial river
of the Milky Way.

176
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:13,278
- Oh, that's sad.
- It is. But...

177
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,933
once a year,

178
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:17,651
on the seventh day
of the seventh month,

179
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:22,072
Vega cries so hard that all the
magpies in the world fly up

180
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,765
and create a bridge with their wings
so the two lovers can be together

181
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:30,240
for a single night
of passion.

182
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:33,254
Wow.

183
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,781
Okay, that's enough.

184
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:43,980
Quick poll: PS4
or Xbox One?

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,447
- Raj.
- Uh, Xbox One.

186
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,101
- Penny.
- Huh?

187
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:49,427
- Leonard.
- PS4.

188
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,292
- Wolowitz.
- Both great.

189
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:54,201
- Bernadette.
- I like the Wii.

190
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,496
Thanks, Grandma.

191
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:02,414
- Oh, my goodness.
- What's up?

192
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,061
I just got an e-mail from
my ex-girlfriend Lucy.

193
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,898
She... misses me and
wants to get together.

194
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:12,538
Two women at the same
time? Nice job, playa!

195
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:16,085
Really?

196
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:19,956
Was it the "two women"
thing or the "playa"?

197
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:23,037
It was the "playa".

198
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,191
What am I supposed to do?

199
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:32,112
How am I supposed to choose
between Emily and Lucy?

200
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:34,043
Why do you have to choose?
Date both of them.

201
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,662
I can't date two
women at once.

202
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,395
Zero women-- that's
my sweet spot.

203
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:43,766
Unless you're sleeping with one of them,
seeing other people isn't a big deal.

204
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:46,647
But what if one of them asks me
what I was up to the night before

205
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:49,654
and I was with the other one?
Then, what, do I lie?

206
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,546
- Yes.
- Yes.

207
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:56,769
- What do you mean, yes?
- What do <i>you</i> mean, yes?

208
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:58,985
Were you seeing other women
when we started dating?

209
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,705
No. Were you
seeing other men?

210
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:02,092
No.

211
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,949
- Were you seeing other men?
- No.

212
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:12,332
Aren't you gonna ask me?

213
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:16,230
Come on, really?

214
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:21,101
Thank you so much for
letting us pick your brain.

215
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,414
Yeah, happy to help.

216
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,421
So, what's going on?

217
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:26,506
Well, I'm having an impossible time
getting my career off the ground,

218
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,771
and I got offered a role in
this crappy horror movie,

219
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,744
and I just don't know
if I should take it.

220
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:34,198
Well, I have certainly taken some
jobs that I've been embarrassed by.

221
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:37,815
I wouldn't exactly call
<i>Star Trek</i> embarrassing.

222
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,164
I wasn't.

223
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,954
Me, either.

224
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:49,611
So, what do you think, is there a
professional downside to doing it?

225
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,818
Well, it's tricky.

226
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,974
You want to take projects
that you're excited about,

227
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:57,092
but sometimes you also
have to pay the bills.

228
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,902
When you're on the set
working on something

229
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:02,357
that you just know in your heart
is bad-- not <i>Star Trek...</i>

230
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,223
Yeah, beam me up.
I love it!

231
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:12,416
Anyway, those jobs
can be soul-crushing.

232
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,189
That's what I'm afraid of.

233
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,833
Well, I was in <i>Stand By Me</i> when I was
a kid, and it was a huge success.

234
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:20,721
The terrible movies I did
came after that.

235
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,586
I mean, imagine how that feels.

236
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:23,726
Sounds rough.

237
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:26,019
I'm telling you, this
business is brutal.

238
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,335
To this day, I hate
going on auditions.

239
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:33,824
Okay, I walk in, and I can
just feel them thinking...

240
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,954
"He was such a cute kid.
What happened to him?"

241
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:44,215
And then I don't get the job,
and I can never find out why.

242
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:47,656
Honestly, I get so depressed,
there are entire weeks

243
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,524
that I can't even
get out of bed.

244
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,710
Okay, this was helpful.

245
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:01,347
Any news on your coworker
who's in the hospital?

246
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:04,367
Poor thing, she was
in surgery for 18 hours.

247
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,716
She's alive, but she's
still in critical condition.

248
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,029
Oh, no.

249
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,358
The one bit of good
news is they put her

250
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,631
in a medically induced coma
before she read the card.

251
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,479
So, you know,
silver linings.

252
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:20,571
Were you like this
when I married you?

253
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:26,241
Don't worry about it,
buddy. Okay, bye.

254
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,790
That was Wil-- he's
feeling a lot better.

255
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:32,590
Apparently, he's 12-down in
the <i>TV Guide</i> crossword puzzle.

256
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,947
Did he help you make a
decision about the movie?

257
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,007
No. Did you figure out what you're
gonna do about the two girls?

258
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,920
As a matter of fact, I did.

259
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,460
I've spent so many years living in
fear, saying no to new experiences,

260
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:48,494
but from now on, I'm gonna
say yes-- yes to love,

261
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:52,744
yes to adventure, yes to life; Whatever
it may be, the answer's going to be yes.

262
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:56,921
- He's gonna die alone, right?
- Yeah. - Yes. - Yes.

263
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,724
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

264
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:02,344
You know, I'm
proud of me, too.

265
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:05,731
I've done all my research,
I conducted an informal poll,

266
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:09,056
and I've arrived at the rock-solid
certainty I've made the right choice.

267
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:12,133
- Well, that's got to be a
good feeling. - Oh, it is.

268
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,393
- Although...
- Oh, crap.

269
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:21,034
I had the same feeling when I made my
dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.

270
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:22,594
You were just
a little kid.

271
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,440
Yeah, a little kid who
picked the wrong format

272
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:27,292
to record
<i>The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.</i>

273
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:32,620
I also was certain that HD DVD
would win out over Blu-ray.

274
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,703
- How old were you then?
- Old enough to know better.

275
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:38,243
You know, and now that
I think about it,

276
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:42,916
I stood in front of a case of
iPods and I bought a Zune.

277
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:48,640
- What's a Zune?
- Yeah, exactly.

278
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:54,088
It's an MP3 player brought
to us by the makers of Xbox.

279
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,881
What... no, what are you doing?
No, no, pick that back up.

280
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,834
You know it's good.
You did the research.

281
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:01,174
But what if I'm wrong?

282
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,786
You know what?

283
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:07,270
How about I buy it for you?
How about I buy you both?

284
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:10,716
You know I only have one slot
available in my entertainment center.

285
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,785
Then I'll buy you a new
entertainment center.

286
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,529
Well, yeah... okay, sure.

287
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,620
But which one?

288
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,144
How about this?

289
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:21,291
I've heard
that if you flip a coin,

290
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,196
it will tell you how
you actually feel.

291
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,631
Because you'll either be disappointed
or excited by the outcome.

292
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,692
Interesting.

293
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:31,558
So, heads it's PS4,
tails it's Xbox One.

294
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,578
All right, I'll try.

295
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,761
What is it?

296
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:41,546
A quarter.

297
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:48,288
Could have given it back to me.
That was a choice.

298
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:58,084
You look... you look
really pretty tonight.

299
00:15:58,106 --> 00:15:59,386
Thanks.

300
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,507
I love that jacket.

301
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,570
Thank you.
Thanks, thanks.

302
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,837
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

303
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,254
My... my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me,
and I'm seeing her Saturday...

304
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:13,395
And I'm glad you like it--
it's from J. Crew.

305
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,228
I don't understand.

306
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:19,008
My friends told me it was okay to
see more than one person at a time,

307
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:21,867
but it-it feels like
I'm being deceitful.

308
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:24,382
Are you getting back
together with her?

309
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,807
No. I-I... I have no idea.
What would you do?

310
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:32,219
Uh, usually on first dates,
I talk about music and stuff,

311
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:35,266
but I was promised
weird, so let's do this.

312
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,487
How serious were you two?

313
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:43,791
Well, to be honest, we only went on
four dates, hugged twice, kissed once,

314
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:47,743
and there was a handshake
loaded with sexual innuendo.

315
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:51,713
Wait, so...

316
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,360
a girl you never slept
with sent you an e-mail

317
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,182
and you felt so guilty about it
that you had to tell me?

318
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:58,650
Yeah.

319
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:01,204
That's kind of adorable.

320
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,699
Are you... are you sure?

321
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:04,212
Because this is the
part of the night

322
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,588
where I've said something stupid
and the girl usually leaves.

323
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,308
I'm still here.

324
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:11,793
Yeah, but now you make me
wonder what's wrong with you.

325
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,699
We just met.

326
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,746
You don't need to tell me about
other people you're seeing.

327
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,417
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,149
Because "I'm
dating two women"

329
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,598
is basically the only cool
thing I can say about myself.

330
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:39,378
On the one hand, the Xbox
One has a better camera...

331
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:43,166
but the PS4 has a
removable hard drive.

332
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,838
Thoughts?

333
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,933
I can't feel my legs.

334
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:54,602
Oh... I'm sorry, guys, but the
store closed five minutes ago.

335
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,453
But I haven't decided yet.

336
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,511
You'll have to come back tomorrow.
The registers are closed.

337
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:07,010
Let's get you some food. Y-You'll
feel better after you eat.

338
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,979
Okay.

339
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,846
What-what do you want, like,
Thai food? A... a burger?

340
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,177
I don't know!

341
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:28,256
Hey, look, a quarter!

342
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,425
- How's that feel?
- Great.

343
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,882
Not like regret at all.

344
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,322
Penny?

345
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,477
We're working together!

346
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:51,951
Awesome!
