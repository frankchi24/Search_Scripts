1
00:00:02,623 --> 00:00:04,332
So, we're about to shoot
this scene in the movie

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,335
where the killer ape DNA is
slowly taking over my body.

3
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:09,422
Okay.

4
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:12,925
But I realize they're gluing fur
everywhere, except my cleavage.

5
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:14,965
So, I asked the director
why and he says,

6
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:19,153
it's important to the story that my
boobs be the last things to turn ape.

7
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,637
It's sweet that he
thinks there's a story.

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,619
Oh, and there's not even
a bathroom on set.

9
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,041
I have to go to the gas
station across the street.

10
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,757
I mean, I was dressed
like half an ape

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,060
and still not even close to the
most disgusting person in there.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,670
Leonard, I could use
your assistance.

13
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:38,663
Sure. What's up?

14
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:40,476
Well, now that I've
given up string theory,

15
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:42,776
I'm struggling to find
my next area of focus.

16
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:45,036
So, in your
professional opinion,

17
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:48,403
which of these areas do you
think is the most promising?

18
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:52,892
Huh, well, I-I think there's some really
innovative stuff going on in dark matter.

19
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:54,291
That's helpful.

20
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:00,080
- Okay. Of these four areas...
- Sheldon!

21
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,116
- What did we say about being
a nicer friend? - Thank you.

22
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,671
Leonard, what did we say about
being a gullible weenie?

23
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,754
It is just so frustrating.

24
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:12,081
'Cause you're trying too hard. You need to
do something else. Get your mind off it.

25
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:15,673
Hey. How about we bring back
Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

26
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,680
Hey, that's good. Why'd
you guys stop doing that?

27
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:19,957
You made fun of us.
Said it was stupid.

28
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,528
Yeah. Sounds like me.

29
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:25,076
Come on, Sheldon.
What do you say?

30
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:28,849
All right. I officially reinstate
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

31
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,655
Great! What do, what
do you want to do?

32
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,404
I don't know.

33
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:34,795
What do you want to do?

34
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:37,149
I don't know. What
do you want to do?

35
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:41,104
I'm starting to remember the problem

46

Hmm...

47
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,199
what could we
do that's fun?

48
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,969
What could we do
that's different?

49
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:16,678
What could we
do that's free?

50
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,444
Got it! We order a pizza.

51
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,417
Are you kidding? That's what
you always do. Think harder.

52
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,555
You're right. You're right.

53
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,225
Got it!

54
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:32,351
We order calzones, cut them
open, eat them like pizza.

55
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:37,385
All right! All right! I'll shake the brain
bush one more time, see what falls out.

56
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:41,448
Got it! There's a live-action
role-playing group

57
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,607
that meets every Thursday
night in Griffith Park

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,508
and reenacts battles from
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

59
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:51,208
Uh, tell me more about
this calzone idea.

60
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,548
You know what? Why don't
we just ease into this.

61
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:57,563
Let-Let's go for a walk and-and-and
see if we find a new restaurant.

62
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,674
Any chance that restaurant
is near Griffith Park?

63
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,744
- No.
- All right.

64
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:09,706
Raj and Howard are
at Howard's mom's,

65
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,539
but should we call the girls
and see if they want to come?

66
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:13,914
- No. Bernadette's working late.
- Amy's sick.

67
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,592
- Aw. What's wrong with her?
- Well, she talks a lot.

68
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,225
She always wants to hold hands.

69
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:20,498
That's not what I meant.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,034
Well, if you were
referring to her illness

71
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:24,778
your question should have
been, "What ails her?"

72
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:28,376
- "What ails her?"
- Oh. Who knows?

73
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:33,930
Come on, anything can happen. We
can push him down the stairs!

74
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,388
Hey. Thanks for
coming to hang out.

75
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,395
No problem. How's
your mom feeling?

76
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:43,872
Okay, but she'd feel better
if she took her medicine.

77
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:47,282
You know, when Cinnamon won't take her
medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.

78
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:50,110
Good idea. We can wrap the pill
in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon,

79
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:52,310
and then my mom
can eat Cinnamon.

80
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:56,486
What do you feel like doing?

81
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,520
I was thinking we
could watch a DVD.

82
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:03,401
Well, my mom doesn't have
a lot to choose from.

83
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:06,593
Unless you want to watch the
video of her colonoscopy.

84
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:10,304
Spoiler alert: 20 minutes
in, they find a prune pit.

85
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:16,330
Actually, how do you feel about
watching <i>House of 1000 Corpses?</i>

86
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,492
A straight-up gore-fest?
You hate this stuff.

87
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,739
I do, but for some
reason, Emily loves it

88
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,677
and wants to watch it
with me tomorrow, so...

89
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:28,104
I thought if I start with you first,
then I could act cool about it with her.

90
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:29,632
That's actually
not a bad plan.

91
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,179
I can sit through the colonoscopy
now, but that first time I was like,

92
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:34,825
"Oh, My God, a prune pit!"

93
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,339
Uh, so... you'd watch it?

94
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,305
Sure.

95
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:44,311
You're a good friend.
I owe you one.

96
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:48,255
Howard! Help me get
out of the tub!

97
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,125
Not that one.

98
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:00,970
So, we're just randomly choosing a
restaurant without researching it online?

99
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,146
- Yep.
- Great.

100
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:05,355
You know, this is how Anything
Can Happen Thursday turns into

101
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,285
It Won't Stop
Coming Up Friday.

102
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:12,838
Hey, how about that
Asian fusion place?

103
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,321
Fusion and Asians?

104
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:17,821
I'm trying not to
think about science.

105
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,379
What the hell?

106
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:25,635
What...? She's not
working late!

107
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:27,959
And Amy doesn't look sick.

108
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:30,668
- Why would they lie to us?
- That's a good question.

109
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,246
Amy and Bernadette.

110
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,841
Amy and Bernadette.

111
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,739
Amy and Bernadette.

112
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:39,152
Why did you lie to us?!

113
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,862
Hey. Listen to this:

114
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:49,789
"Murder... cannibalism and
satanic rituals are just a few

115
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:52,757
of the thousand plus
horrors that await."

116
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:57,231
I just helped my mom out of the tub, so,
I'm one slippery horror ahead of you.

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,800
You're a good son. I don't
know how you do it.

118
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,909
Beach blankets, my friend.
It's all about beach blankets.

119
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:07,261
All right, let's get
this over with.

120
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:11,104
Ew, it's got someone's
hair on it!

121
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:13,074
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
do great with this movie.

122
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:19,673
You're not working late.
Why did you lie to me?

123
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,088
And Amy, you told
me you were sick,

124
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:25,740
but you look just as pale
and tired as always.

125
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:28,401
I'm sorry. I just
needed a break

126
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,238
from hearing you obsess about
what to do after string theory.

127
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:33,579
And we kind of just
wanted one night

128
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:37,916
where we didn't have to hear about how
miserable you are making this movie.

129
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:40,101
But none of that means
we don't love you.

130
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:43,575
I haven't been complaining
that much about the movie.

131
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:45,392
Have I?

132
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,769
I also love you.

133
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,791
You know what? Maybe I need
a break from all of you.

134
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:57,158
- Come on, Sheldon.
- Where are we going?

135
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,058
We're gonna have Anything Can
Happen Thursday, you're gonna

136
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,975
tell me all about your science
stuff and I'm gonna complain

137
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:04,297
about my movie, and we're gonna support
each other because that's what friends do.

138
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,027
Okay.

139
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:07,130
'Cause if I had
to pick now,

140
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:10,257
- I'd probably go with dark
matter because... - Shut up.

141
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,070
- What's wrong?
- I don't understand my food.

142
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:33,891
Chinese noodles with
Korean barbecue...

143
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,065
in a taco.

144
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,080
It's fusion.

145
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,813
Well, my mother would
lock her car doors

146
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,125
if she had to drive through
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

147
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,465
Think I've been complaining
too much about the movie?

148
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,907
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

149
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,314
But to be fair, when you talk,
most of what you say

150
00:07:57,334 --> 00:08:00,714
sounds like, "Wah,
wah, wah, clothes".

151
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:07,016
Hey, I don't understand why
you're not upset with Amy.

152
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:12,267
I am. So much so that I'm gonna bring her
here for dinner on our next date night.

153
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,969
Okay.

154
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:26,683
So, in the last
20 minutes,

155
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:29,941
we've seen a crazy woman
kissing a fetus in a jar.

156
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:34,973
We've seen a guy cut in
half and sewn to a fish.

157
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:40,699
And the brutal dismemberment of a
rotisserie chicken by my mother.

158
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:46,504
On the bright side, she
didn't even notice the pill.

159
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,414
Why does Emily
like this stuff?

160
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,760
Do you think there's something
psychologically wrong with her?

161
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:55,825
- What difference does it make?
- What do you mean?

162
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:57,497
Oh, come on-- she could
have a freezer full of

163
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,897
ex-boyfriend's body parts and
you'd still go out with her.

164
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:05,555
I do like that the ex-boyfriend's
out of the picture.

165
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:13,145
I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon.
How am I gonna make it up to him?

166
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:14,594
I'd tell you what
I do with Howard,

167
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:16,757
but I don't think dressing up
like a Catholic schoolgirl

168
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:19,174
is gonna work
with Sheldon.

169
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:24,996
He'd probably give
you homework.

170
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:31,648
- Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
- Of course.

171
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:33,574
And you don't feel
guilty about it?

172
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:38,075
Between Penny's gorilla movie and
Howard's gorilla mother, I had no choice.

173
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,956
Thankfully Penny and I have
a relationship based on honesty.

174
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,801
What? I don't lie to her.

175
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:49,853
Oh, we know <i>you
</i> don't lie to <i>her.</i>

176
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,220
Thank you.

177
00:09:57,235 --> 00:10:01,287
Hey, maybe the answer to your
career question is in one of these.

178
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,408
Penny, there's
only one cookie

179
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:06,142
with something in the middle
that solves life's problems,

180
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,341
and that's an Oreo.

181
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:13,845
Or a Nutter Butter,
if you're in a pinch.

182
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,137
Come on, open it. I bet
it says something great.

183
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,450
This is Asian fusion.

184
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:22,268
For all you know, there's
a tiny Chihuahua in here.

185
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
Fine, I'll go.

186
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:26,256
Hmm.

187
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:28,891
"People turn to you
for guidance and wisdom."

188
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,460
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- No, it's not.

189
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:33,871
How is that not good?

190
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,817
"Turn to you for wisdom"?

191
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:38,707
Clearly, that cookie
is mocking you.

192
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,871
You'd never hear that kind of
sass from a Nutter Butter.

193
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:47,470
Uh, since you're paying for dinner,
I'll let that slide. Open yours.

194
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,585
Have you ever
paid for a meal?

195
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:52,972
Not with money. Read.

196
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:59,226
"Your warm and fun-loving nature
delights those around you."

197
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:01,439
Oh, try again.

198
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:17,341
Let me get this straight.
So, he kills this girl's father,

199
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,228
cuts off the guy's face,
and is wearing it as a mask

200
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:23,539
while he makes
out with her.

201
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:28,789
I'm just gonna say it.
That's not okay.

202
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:35,602
Why can't I be in a relationship with
a girl who likes <i>The Sound of Music?</i>

203
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:41,545
Raj, you <i>are</i> the girl in the relationship
who likes <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

204
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,469
Hey, Penny. What's up?

205
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,759
No, Bernie's working late.

206
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,897
Really?

207
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:57,639
Thanks for telling me.

208
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,294
What?

209
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,239
I'm having sex with a
Catholic schoolgirl tonight.

210
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,780
Oh, I think I see
our next stop.

211
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,380
You can't be serious.

212
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,271
If I wanted to waste
my time on nonsense,

213
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,867
I'd follow Leonard
on Instagram.

214
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:24,209
No, come on-- tonight,
we are trying new things.

215
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:28,963
Oh! That's a lot
of incense.

216
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,653
Or someone set a
hippie on fire.

217
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,161
Yeah, honey, I'm
still stuck at work.

218
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,069
Really? Penny said that?

219
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:45,760
Okay, it's true. I'm sorry.

220
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,997
I'll see you at home.

221
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:50,414
Yeah, yeah, I'll put it on.

222
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:55,184
You and I never just hang
out like this. Why is that?

223
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:58,147
- I know, it's weird, right?
- Yeah. We should do it more often.

224
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,244
Oh, no. I mean, this
is weird right now.

225
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,985
Oh.

226
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:06,405
- Ah, it's Penny.
- Is she still mad?

227
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,652
Oh, doesn't seem like it. She got
Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.

228
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,065
A psychic?

229
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:16,631
He considers them not just mumbo
jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.

230
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:20,197
Well, Penny can be
pretty persuasive.

231
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:23,232
She's gotten me to do a lot of
things I wouldn't normally do.

232
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,737
- Because she has sex with you.
- Yeah, she does.

233
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,900
Can I confess something?

234
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:33,626
Once in a while, I get a little jealous
of how close Penny and Sheldon are.

235
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,153
Really?

236
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:36,434
I mean, not in a
romantic way.

237
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:39,684
It's just, she really has some
sort of connection with him.

238
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:43,169
Well... Well, they've known
each other a long time,

239
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:44,580
and Penny grew up
around horses,

240
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:48,891
so she knows how to approach him
without making him skittish.

241
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,540
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad they're friends.

242
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:54,240
I just wish he'd be that
comfortable around me already.

243
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,820
Well, it took him a long time to
get comfortable around me, too.

244
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,694
Really? What did you do?

245
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:03,216
Something terrible in a former life?
I don't know.

246
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:07,241
I gotta go. Penny
ratted me out.

247
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,307
FYI, she's getting you
a watch for your birthday

248
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,938
with money she took
out of your wallet.

249
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:20,130
I don't mean to be
rude or discourteous,

250
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,674
but before we begin,
I'd just like to say

251
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:28,396
there is absolutely no scientific evidence
to support clairvoyance of any kind.

252
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:34,197
Which means-- and again, no insult
intended-- but you're a fraud...

253
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,785
...your profession
is a swindle,

254
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:41,777
and, uh, your livelihood is dependent
on the gullibility of stupid people.

255
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:45,387
Again, no offense.

256
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,086
All right, Sheldon,
just ask your question.

257
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:53,860
Okay, I just did.
What was it?

258
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:56,299
Oh, for God's sake. Look, he's a
physicist who's trying to figure out

259
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,166
what his next field
of study should be.

260
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,647
For your information, I was asking
her about the next <i>Star Trek</i> movie.

261
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:06,069
Okay, I can answer that one:
I'll be bored.

262
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:08,664
All right, why don't we begin?

263
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,827
Your spirit guides
are telling me that

264
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:22,456
there's a woman in your life
you're having problems with.

265
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,434
That's an easy guess.

266
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:28,240
I'm clearly an annoying person and
have problems with both genders.

267
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:32,038
Yes, you clearly are.

268
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:35,565
But I'm seeing
a specific woman

269
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:38,449
that you're in a romantic
relationship with.

270
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,132
Oh, oh, here we go.

271
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:42,975
Does she have dark hair?

272
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:46,002
Yes! Yes! Your spirit
guides are on fire!

273
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:49,471
The majority of people
have dark hair.

274
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,849
Even you, at one time.

275
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:54,890
Does she work
in a similar field to you?

276
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:59,608
Ha! The opposite. She's a neurobiologist,
and I'm a theoretical physicist.

277
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,074
My spirit guides can
go suck an egg.

278
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:06,520
They're telling me that you have
difficulty being close with her.

279
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:09,837
Oh, he does. He <i>so</i> does.
What should he do?

280
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,137
He should give himself
to this relationship.

281
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,088
Once he does, all his other
pursuits will come into focus.

282
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:23,516
Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean,
Amy is the key to your happiness.

283
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:24,743
Exactly.

284
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:26,925
Personally and professionally.

285
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:31,055
Everything will fall into place
once you commit to her.

286
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:38,959
You know what this is?

287
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:42,817
Yeah, and I reserve this word for those
rare instances when it's truly deserved.

288
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,557
This is malarkey!

289
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:51,593
Wow, you really
struck a nerve.

290
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:54,937
I've never heard him use
the "M" word before.

291
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:04,671
Here we go:
<i>House of a 1,000 Corpses.</i>

292
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,108
Now, just so you know, I was a nanny
for three years, so if you get scared,

293
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,604
I can totally
change your diaper.

294
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:14,807
Actually, I have to
tell you something.

295
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:18,312
These kind of movies really
aren't my thing, so,

296
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,313
last night, I watched it just to see
what I was getting myself into.

297
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,221
Okay.

298
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:27,238
And I have to be honest-- I thought
it was disturbing and weird,

299
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:30,196
and it made me wonder what it
says about someone who enjoys it.

300
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:31,896
I wonder that, too.

301
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:34,466
Then, why do you
watch these things?

302
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:36,624
Can I tell you something
without you judging me?

303
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:38,569
Sure.

304
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:41,360
They kind of turn me on.

305
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,210
And play.

306
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:50,298
<i>Attention...</i>

307
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:57,358
Hello.

308
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,851
I didn't expect you
this evening.

309
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:03,809
Well, I was just feeling so bad
about lying to you the other night,

310
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,632
I wanted to make it up to you.

311
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:08,187
And how do you
propose to do that?

312
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,945
Unless you have <i>Gravity</i> on
Blu-ray under that skirt,

313
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,299
I don't know where
you're going with this.

314
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:29,735
