1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,824
Item 28: your pet
name for me.

2
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:09,136
Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

3
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:11,615
I submitted you a
notarized list.

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:15,116
I'm sorry, but "Gollum" and
"Flakey" are not acceptable.

5
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:18,107
Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob""

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:21,304
you don't like "Fester" -- you're
just impossible to please.

7
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:23,014
We'll come back to that one.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,092
This brings us to the final item in our
annual State of the Relationship Summit.

9
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:29,879
Item 29: Valentine's Day.

10
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:32,664
Ah, the worst for last. Hmm.

11
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,763
Classic Flakey.

12
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:40,042
Before you get upset, I believe
I've come up with a way for us

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,592
to celebrate the occasion
that we both can enjoy.

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,017
People usually start
a meeting with a joke,

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,298
but you go ahead--
end with one.

16
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:52,776
I propose we spend a weekend at a
bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.

17
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,112
I hate every word
in that sentence.

18
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,745
Including "in""
"at," "we" and "a""

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,593
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

20
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:04,954
For starters, a
bed-and-breakfast forces you

21
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:07,151
to eat with strangers
at your table.

22
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:10,070
One step ahead of you-- Bernadette
and Wolowitz are going with us.

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,137
Oh, very well.

24
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:12,748
What are the sleeping
arrangements?

25
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:15,392
We've only been dating
for three years.

26
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:18,131
If we were to share a
room, people might talk.

27
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:20,974
I got you your own room.

28
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:22,587
What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?

29
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,817
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel
like you're bathing inside a monster.

30
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,330
Look, I appreciate
the effort,

31
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:33,759
but I'm still unclear how this trip
is supposed to be enjoyable for me.

32
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:36,455
We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner

33
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:39,440
on a fully functioning
vintage train.

34
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:41,699
Vintage?

35
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:42,712
Be specific.

36
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,385
An Alcoa FA-4
diesel locomotive

37
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:50,316
leading a train of meticulously restored
1915 Pullman first-class coaches.

38
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,458
Wow.

39
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:55,994
I'm feeling the
urge to hug you.

40
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,359
And one... and two...

41
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,423
All right, Gollum,
we're good.

52
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,871
Are you sure you guys don't
want to come with us to Napa?

53
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,311
You could probably
still get a room.

54
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,773
No, I think we're just gonna
have a quiet weekend at home.

55
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,244
Plus, I'm not sure
it's a great idea

56
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,776
to take Penny to where
wine comes from.

57
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,931
What? It's a joke.

58
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:45,186
Oh, come on. We
bust on each other.

59
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,564
I wear dorky glasses,
you might have a problem--

60
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,239
it's all for laughs.

61
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:53,532
That would really piss me off if
I didn't have a buzz going on.

62
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:02,221
Howard, which pocket watch will you
be wearing for dinner on the train?

63
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:08,893
I'm sorry, what?

64
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,015
Oh, I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,

65
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:13,761
it will be embarrassing.

66
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:17,694
I don't own a pocket watch.

67
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:19,781
Oh, my.

68
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:24,464
Well, then my apologies for
bringing up this sore spot.

69
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,518
Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,

70
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:30,838
would you mind
watching Cinnamon?

71
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,873
You have Valentine's plans?!

72
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:36,270
Which came out sounding way
more surprised than I meant.

73
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,618
L-Let me try that again. You
have Val... See? I can't do it.

74
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:45,697
I don't have plans which is why I booked
time on the big telescope that night.

75
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:48,950
Well, an evening looking at the stars--
that's still kind of romantic.

76
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,156
Except I'll be alone.

77
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:52,634
I'm trying to put lipstick on
a pig here. Work with me.

78
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:56,616
- We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,826
Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us

80
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:00,933
to see some action, so if you
guys happen to have sex,

81
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:02,846
it's cool if she
stays in the room.

82
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,931
Hey, same goes for the
two of you with Amy.

83
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,089
What do you think, Sheldon?

84
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,847
It's magnificent.

85
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,767
This is going to be the
best Valentine's Day ever.

86
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:27,580
I'm so glad you like it.

87
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,387
I'm prepared to
say I love it,

88
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:32,269
as soon as I confirm there
are no hobos aboard.

89
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:37,373
Okay.

90
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,412
Raj, I got it.

91
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,092
Bye.

92
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,766
That was your daddy.

93
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,263
He wanted me to say that he
misses... Why am I doing this?

94
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,859
Happy Valentine's Day!

95
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:56,011
Ooh, flowers <i>and</i> chocolates?

96
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,279
Somebody's trying to get
me out of my panties.

97
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,268
Don't be surprised if you
find five chocolates missing

98
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,183
and three gross coconut
ones with a bite taken out.

99
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:08,128
It came that way
when I bought it.

100
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,339
Got you a little
something, too.

101
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,905
Aw. Jewelry.

102
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:16,799
Oh, my God. Lakers tickets?!

103
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:21,131
It gets better. Instead of
me, you can take someone

104
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:23,751
- who will actually enjoy it.
- Aw!

105
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,556
You are the best
boyfriend ever.

106
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,094
Thank you. Seriously,
please don't make me go.

107
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,484
Should we take this little
party to the bedroom?

108
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,784
Mm, don't have to-- we have
the whole place to ourselves.

109
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,293
- Oh, that's true.
- In fact, if you want,

110
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:41,848
we can do it right here
on Sheldon's spot.

111
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,537
That is the least sexy thing
anyone's ever said to me.

112
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,620
- To the bedroom!
- Yeah!

113
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,095
And for the entrée, tonight's
special is a seafood risotto.

114
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,835
- Do you have any questions?
- Uh, I do.

115
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:05,404
Uh, does this train car have the
original link-and-pin coupler

116
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,790
or the Miller Hook
and Platform?

117
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,948
I'm sorry, I meant
questions about the food.

118
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,746
Oh, of course. Um...

119
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,743
he seafood risotto being
served on a train car

120
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:19,609
with the original link-and-pin coupler
or the Miller Hook and Platform?

121
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,246
I-I think we're gonna
need a minute.

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,453
Fun fact: it's neither.

123
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:32,196
They actually use the
AAR type E coupler.

124
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,826
If you listen carefully when
the locomotive disconnects,

125
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,246
you'll hear the characteristic
click-pshht-thunk

126
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,106
of the knuckle.

127
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:44,124
Get out of town.

128
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,791
Fun fact: I'm gonna
jump off this train.

129
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:54,650
Hey, Cinnamon,

130
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:57,097
guess who just did
it human style.

131
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,409
Oh, my God!

132
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,431
It's a little late,
but I'll take it.

133
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,145
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.
That's really bad for dogs.

134
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,950
Oh, crap. What
are we gonna do?

135
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:11,792
- We gotta get her to a vet right now.
- I don't have a vet.

136
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:14,686
I have a podiatrist, an
optometrist, an allergist,

137
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:17,680
a dermatologist, a urologist.
You'd think I'd have a vet.

138
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,849
- Okay. There's one not far from
here. Come on. Let's go. - Okay.

139
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:23,556
Koothrappali was right. We
should have let her watch.

140
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:29,400
Do another one,
do another one!

141
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,379
Okay. Here's my
impression of the Amtrak

142
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,133
Acela barreling down
the Eastern Corridor.

143
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,932
It's like there's a
train in your mouth.

144
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:50,700
Oh, yeah. I've got one.
Um, the Amtrak Wolverine

145
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,694
coming into Chicago.

146
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:05,023
I've been on that train.
And I just was again.

147
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,783
Hey, see if you guys
can guess this one.

148
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:11,126
Bang! Splat! Thud.

149
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,530
How many trains
have you been on?

150
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:19,220
Tons. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

151
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:22,184
Now I just collect
disability and ride trains.

152
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,420
Wow. Your life's amazing.

153
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,606
Not always. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

154
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,766
Now I just collect
disability and ride trains.

155
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:41,736
Why do I even try?

156
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,199
I'm gonna fix this right now.

157
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:45,897
Okay. Just make it
look like an accident.

158
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:52,740
Excuse me. You are at Valentine's
dinner with your girlfriend.

159
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,119
Now get back over there
and be with her.

160
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,722
You're right. That was
insensitive of me.

161
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,110
I have to go back
to my table now.

162
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:04,504
- You should join us.
- All right.

163
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,002
Great.

164
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:10,055
Now there's two of 'em.

165
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,074
How much chocolate
did she eat?

166
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,827
- A whole box.
- Well, to be fair,

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,152
you ate a lot of it
before you gave it to me.

168
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,285
So the point is I may
have saved her life.

169
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,480
I'm sorry, is this
a joke to you?

170
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,042
No.

171
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,003
Maybe to her.

172
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,075
How big a box of
chocolate was it?

173
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:39,913
Uh, something like
this. I don't know.

174
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,430
It came free with
a full tank of gas.

175
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:45,535
Really? Do you know how much
those Lakers tickets were?

176
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,801
- Do you know how
much gas is? - Hey!

177
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,498
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

178
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,741
Oh, my God, Cinnamon,
are you okay?!

179
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:55,414
I can't believe you two!

180
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:56,991
You do whatever it takes
to save her life.

181
00:09:57,011 --> 00:10:01,057
If she needs new organs, I'll buy any
dog necessary and scrap them for parts!

182
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:05,488
- You're the owner?
- Owner, father, soul mate,

183
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,648
and if anything happens to
her, your worst nightmare!

184
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,568
Well, she's not throwing
up, which is a good sign.

185
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:16,143
So, I'm gonna take her in
back, put her on fluids

186
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,662
and give her something
to absorb the toxins.

187
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,495
Okay? Okay. Okay, thank you.

188
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,919
Oh, if she's scared, you can sing to her.
She likes Katy Perry.

189
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:26,450
Oh, but don't do "Firework""
That gets her all riled up.

190
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,681
Got it.

191
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:30,879
Should have been a dentist.

192
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,029
Okay, what was the best four-ten-four
U.S. locomotive ever built?

193
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,473
Trick question. There
never was one.

194
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:42,318
- Or was there?
- What?!

195
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:48,021
In 1944, the Pacific
Railroad built number 6131,

196
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,473
which rearranged the drivers and
cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1,

197
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:53,680
creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.

198
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:57,173
In what world is a
four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?

199
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:59,198
A world I don't
want to live in!

200
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:03,502
Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.

201
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,083
Hold on to your
conductor's hat.

202
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:07,946
You crank the second
and third axles,

203
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,326
creating a pair of
internal connecting rods,

204
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:12,636
and boom-- four-ten-four.

205
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,229
If you think about it, the Q-2 was like
the four-ten-four America never made.

206
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:18,675
I may never <i>stop</i>
thinking about it.

207
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:21,222
Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?

208
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,902
Better than you think.

209
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,946
You know, if you ask nicely, they'll
let you visit the engine room.

210
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:32,074
I never want this day to end.

211
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,491
It's feeling like
it never will.

212
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:36,891
Come on.

213
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,476
Hey, did I tell you what
happened to me at UPS?

214
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:47,170
As if Valentine's Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!

215
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:49,252
And with cheap
chocolate, no less?

216
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:50,793
It wasn't cheap.

217
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,297
It was free.

218
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,412
We're really sorry.
It was an accident.

219
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,272
Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.

220
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:59,507
Oh, no, come on.
It was a while.

221
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,880
It was a while.

222
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:06,946
Oh, is Cinnamon
gonna be okay?

223
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,073
She's responding well.

224
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:10,649
We just want to keep her a
little longer for observation.

225
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:13,146
All right. Uh, would-would it
be okay for me to see her?

226
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,423
We're usually in bed by now, and I
want her to know that I'm here.

227
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:20,256
Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.

228
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:25,064
It's okay. I sleep
with my dog, too.

229
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,927
We're not supposed to
let people in back, but

230
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,434
I think I can make
an exception.

231
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:31,287
- Thank you.
- Come on.

232
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:35,275
- By the way, I sang her
Katy Perry. - Oh, yeah?

233
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,009
And I don't care what that obnoxious
parrot back there says. I crushed it.

234
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,948
I think there's something going
on between the two of them.

235
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,538
Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't a while,

236
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:46,930
so what do you know?

237
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:55,872
You okay?

238
00:12:55,907 --> 00:13:00,129
Why? Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo with some weirdo?

239
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,304
Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.

240
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:08,065
I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.

241
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,268
Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.

242
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:13,873
To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.

243
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:16,888
I'm going to the Lego store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

244
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,749
See? It's not just Sheldon.
They're all idiots.

245
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:27,184
She's right.

246
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,839
So, your boyfriend's a fixer-upper.
Most of them are.

247
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:33,174
I mean, look at this guy. You
think he came like this?

248
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:35,712
When I met him, he was
a hot, goofy mess.

249
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:39,129
Now, he's been to space.

250
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,136
That's all me.

251
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,320
I had a little
to do with it.

252
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:49,342
Oh, sure you did. Who's
Mama's big space man?

253
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,060
I am.

254
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:01,346
They've been in there,
like, half an hour.

255
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,032
Yeah, for future
reference, that's a while.

256
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,102
- How long should we stay?
- I don't know. I'm kind of hungry.

257
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:13,980
I saw a Thai place next door.

258
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,726
Oh. Okay.

259
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:18,414
- Oh. Oh. Hey!
- How's she doing?

260
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,553
- How is everything?
- Yeah.

261
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,759
She's gonna be okay; they're
gonna let me take her home.

262
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:24,096
- Oh, good. - So I want you
to keep a close eye on her

263
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,783
for the next 24 hours.

264
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:28,127
Here are a few warning
signs to look out for,

265
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:30,839
and if you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

266
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,825
Oh. Thank you for taking such
good care of my little girl.

267
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:36,006
My pleasure.
Have a nice night.

268
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,862
Yes, thank you
for all your help.

269
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:41,365
Yeah. I'm sorry if you didn't think we
were taking it seriously. We love animals.

270
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,882
Oh, do you guys own any pets?

271
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:45,031
- No.
- Good.

272
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,069
I love you so much.

273
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:55,568
I love you, too.

274
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,998
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

275
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:08,694
You guys missed
a pretty great time.

276
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:11,931
The conductor and I have
the same pocket watch.

277
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,139
It was crazy.

278
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,430
Dare I say "loco"?

279
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,638
Oh, and, Amy, guess what?

280
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:21,778
The conductor said as
soon as he gets off work,

281
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,002
he can come back to the bed and
breakfast and play his banjo for us.

282
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:30,394
Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend
in private, like, right now.

283
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,229
There's a car with a glass roof.
Want to go look at the stars?

284
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:36,405
- Oh, that sounds so romantic.
- Oh, give it a rest!

285
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,145
Let's go.

286
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:44,966
Why are you still here?

287
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:46,450
Excuse me.

288
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,158
I think you're being
a little rude.

289
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:51,101
<i>I'm</i> being rude? You've been
rude to me this entire evening.

290
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,770
How is that possible?

291
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,678
I've hardly spoken to you
since we got on the train.

292
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:00,228
I'm detecting a little
friction between you two,

293
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,697
and I don't want
to be a third rail.

294
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:04,561
Get it?

295
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:06,795
I get it.

296
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,013
Leave!

297
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,845
- What is your problem?
- It's Valentine's Day.

298
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:17,197
We're supposed to be
having a romantic weekend.

299
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:19,490
Oh, really? Because I
remember you saying

300
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,271
that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.

301
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:25,310
Did you mean that, or were
you just trying to trick me?

302
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,570
Fine, it's true.

303
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,423
I deserve romance,

304
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:32,152
and I didn't know how
else to make it happen.

305
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:37,023
Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!

306
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,235
Oh, look, there's wine. Mmm.

307
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,469
Grape juice that burns.

308
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,647
Uh, now let's gaze into
each other's eyes, hmm?

309
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,883
- You blinked. I win.
- Sheldon...

310
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:51,482
Let's see. What's next?
Oh, kissing's romantic.

311
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,272
That was nice.

312
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,329
Good.

313
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,021
Um...

314
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:22,892
the conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,

315
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,125
he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.

316
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:29,871
Okay, have fun.

317
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:34,129
Do you want to come with me?

318
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,134
Really? I do.

319
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:42,777
Hey, guys, wait up!

320
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,805
There you go.

321
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,232
All cozy wozy.

322
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,953
Here, let's see what the doctor
says to keep an eye out for.

323
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:05,137
Hmm. "Rajesh, I was
dreading Valentine's Day.

324
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,644
Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."

325
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:13,589
Cinnamon, she-she gave
me her phone number.

326
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:17,683
If I knew it was that easy, I would have
considered poisoning you months ago.

327
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:21,914
Oh, what should I say?

328
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,774
Oh, I know. I'll point
out her name's Yvette,

329
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,376
and that she's a vet.

330
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,047
That's hysterical.

331
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:29,544
She'll love it.

332
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:33,882
- Hello.
- Oh, hey.

333
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:36,623
- You're back. How was your trip?
- It was wonderful!

334
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,012
Great. What did you do?

335
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:41,305
I made a new friend who likes
trains as much as I do,

336
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:43,598
uh, I kissed Amy on
the lips, and, uh,

337
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:46,782
the conductor played his
banjo for me. Good night.

338
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:51,198
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm gonna need more details.

339
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,673
Oh, well, my new
friend's name was Eric.

340
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:57,121
Um, Amy lips tasted like the
brownie we had for dessert.

341
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:01,024
Oh... the banjo-playing
conductor was missing a finger,

342
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:03,247
but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.

343
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:08,550
No, hang on. Hang on. Are all
those things equal to you?

344
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:10,118
Hmm.

345
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,505
It never occurred to
me to pick a favorite.

346
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:14,692
Well, give it a go.

347
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,490
I can't answer that without
collecting additional data.

348
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,625
Additional data. You dog!

349
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,045
I'm not sure how
listening to other

350
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,225
nine-fingered banjo players
makes me dog, but all right.
