1
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:05,195
I'm thinking about
growing a goatee.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,505
Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke. A
goatee is just hair on the chin.

3
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:11,540
Oh. Wait, then what is it if
you just have hair up here?

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,517
You mean a moustache?

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,439
- Moo-stache!
- He said it!

6
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:17,253
Ha-ha, very funny. Make
fun of the foreign guy.

7
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:18,996
For your information, there
are four times as many

8
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,865
Indians as there are Americans,
so the way we say it is right.

9
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:23,014
- Say what?
- Moo-stache.

10
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,907
- Moo-stache!
- He said "moo-stache".

11
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:27,411
Guys, you're
being childish.

12
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:29,521
Yeah, she's right.
You're grown men,

13
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:33,296
the kind who are perfectly capable
of growing your own moo-staches.

14
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:37,324
Hey, you were funny on
purpose-- good job.

15
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:40,781
Hi. Sorry I'm late-- I
was at an audition.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,282
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You'll get 'em next time.

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:48,497
How about instead of assuming I
failed, you ask me how it went?

18
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:51,236
- Sorry. How did it go?
- Just shut up.

19
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,094
- Here, you can have your seat.
- No, no, no, stay there.

20
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:55,584
I'm fine on the floor.

21
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:58,551
Have you guys ever thought about
getting a dining room table?

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,043
Yeah. You actually do have
room for one up there.

23
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:03,914
Oh, sure, I sit on the floor
for years, no one cares.

24
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:07,310
The pretty white girl's there ten seconds,
and suddenly we're all running to IKEA.

25
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:11,061
No one is
running anywhere.

26
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,973
We're not getting
a dining room table.

27
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:15,934
I know you don't like change,
but it's not a terrible idea.

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,601
Yeah, you guys never use that space
up there. Why not get a table?

29
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,919
Do you want the long answer
or the short answer?

30
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,324
Hey, how come <i>we</i> never
get that option?

31
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:28,217
Chaos theory suggests that
even in a deterministic system,

32
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:31,315
if the equations describing
its behavior are nonlinear,

33
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:33,573
a tiny change in the
initial conditions

34
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:36,691
can lead to a cataclysmic
and unpredictable result.

35
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:38,251
Translation?

36
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,647
Waah. I don't want a table!

47
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:14,253
Hey, Penny and I are gonna go
shop for a dining room table.

48
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,412
You want to come with us?

49
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,976
You know, I'd love to,

50
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:22,058
but, um, I'm too busy falling
back in love with Windows 98.

51
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,734
Seriously? You haven't
used this desk in years.

52
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,822
The second I want to get rid
of it, you're up here working?

53
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:33,016
I can't talk right now-- I have
several thousand updates to install.

54
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:35,897
Are you really gonna
sit here all day?

55
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:40,536
Think of me as Arthur Dent in
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,</i>

56
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:43,757
lying in front of the
bulldozers to protect his home.

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,682
If you'll recall, the Vogon
fleet blew up the Earth anyway.

58
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:49,826
It's a made-up story, Leonard-- I don't
even know why you're talking about it.

59
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:53,621
I'm putting all this stuff in storage.
We don't need any of it.

60
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:55,716
You... How can
you say that?

61
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:58,654
You show me one thing in
here we can live without.

62
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,304
Oh, hang on.

63
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,441
Check your in-box.

64
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,476
Wait. Is this
really worth it?

65
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:14,335
We've lived together for
years with nary an argument.

66
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,414
Huh?

67
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,807
But we start talking about a table, and
suddenly we're at each other's throats.

68
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,322
"Nary an argument"?

69
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:26,392
"Nary"?!

70
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:30,340
Well, that means "not
one," or "not any".

71
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:33,753
Maybe instead of a table, you
should buy a dictionary.

72
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,719
Well, I don't know if I won
that, but at least he's upset.

73
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:43,084
Check it out.

74
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,888
Magic wand TV remote!

75
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:50,306
Yeah, I can control
all sorts of stuff.

76
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,176
Did Bernadette
think it was cool?

77
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,484
Not when I said "mute" and
pointed it at her face.

78
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,285
Oh, uh, let me try.

79
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:58,827
Uh...

80
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:00,832
channelis changeroni!

81
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:05,827
This might be my second
favorite brown magic wand.

82
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:13,675
Well, that's the last
time I play with <i>that.</i>

83
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:18,787
I have to take this.

84
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,767
Hello?

85
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:22,080
Uh...

86
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,425
off.

87
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,226
And on.

88
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:27,091
And the Oprah Network.

89
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:31,214
This is so much better than
watching TV like a muggle.

90
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:35,793
Okay. Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

91
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:40,345
You're not gonna
believe this.

92
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,307
What's going on?

93
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:43,987
Oh. Wait.

94
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,170
On!

95
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,822
And off!

96
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,920
What's going on?

97
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,844
That was NASA.

98
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:59,782
They want me to go back
up to the space station.

99
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:02,322
Wow. What did
you tell them?

100
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:04,203
I told them
I'd be honored.

101
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:07,416
A second trip to space--
I'll miss you.

102
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,896
And I'm gonna
miss you, too.

103
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,058
I just want you to know, I'm happy to
look in on Bernadette while you're gone.

104
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,270
- Thank you. - And if anything
were to happen to you,

105
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,683
we will name our
firstborn son Howard.

106
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:22,104
I'm just kidding. We'll name him
Dalib, after my grandfather.

107
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,021
Ooh, this one looks nice.

108
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:30,016
No. Sheldon doesn't like
reclaimed wood.

109
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,143
Why not?

110
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,777
He's afraid the original
owners will come back.

111
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:38,085
Yeah. Well, Sheldon's not here.

112
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,715
Well, he is <i>here.</i>

113
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,600
So unless you want to dig him out
with a bone saw and a melon baller,

114
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,464
there's nothing I
can do about it.

115
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,302
All right, sweetie, you're
paying for this table,

116
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:49,764
- and it's your apartment, too.
- I know, but...

117
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,645
No buts. You got to stop
letting him boss you around.

118
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:56,739
You're right. I mean, h-he
decides what TV shows we watch,

119
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:59,328
what food we eat, who
my favorite hobbit is--

120
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,519
I wanted Frodo, but we
can't <i>both</i> have Frodo,

121
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:03,937
so guess who's stuck
with Samwise Gamgee.

122
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:07,180
See? Right there.
You're a grown man,

123
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,581
you should be able to pick
whichever hobbit you want.

124
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,357
Wish you wouldn't, but
one problem at a time.

125
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:17,744
Y-You make a lot of sense.

126
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,609
I like this table,
and I'm getting it.

127
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,703
Really? This one?

128
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:26,510
That one?

129
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,485
Damn right I
like that one.

130
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,279
- Hey.
- Good news.

131
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:37,975
Someone in this room gets
to take a ride on a rocket.

132
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,658
Fine. Can I at least
shower first?

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,134
No, not that.

134
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,318
Although you already agreed
to it, so no take-backs.

135
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,045
- What are you talking about?
- Sit down.

136
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,197
NASA called.

137
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:56,002
The telescope mount I installed
on the space station got damaged,

138
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,888
and they want me to go
back up and fix it.

139
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,492
Wow.

140
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:03,494
Well, what did you say?

141
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,942
What do you think
I...? I said yes!

142
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:07,463
Why do you look surprised?

143
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:11,231
Well, it's just, after last time, I
didn't think you'd ever want to go back.

144
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:14,521
Are you kidding? It was the
greatest experience of my life.

145
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:19,157
Really? 'Cause I kind of remember a lot of
complaining and wishing for it to be over.

146
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:22,002
I think you have
me confused

147
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:24,660
with what's gonna happen when
you get out of that shower.

148
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,464
Hey, all set. What
do you think?

149
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:34,626
There's plenty of room for
everybody, a view out the window.

150
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:37,285
My spot on the couch has
a great view of a window.

151
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,900
Sometimes I can see
space battles through it.

152
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,389
It's called a TV.

153
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:45,548
Give it a chance, Sheldon;
You might actually like it.

154
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,107
You're absolutely right.

155
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,246
Nope.

156
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,031
Well, you can't say he
didn't give it a fair shot.

157
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,781
So, when can we
get rid of it?

158
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,061
We're not.

159
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:01,976
What about the
roommate agreement?

160
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:05,037
It specifically states that
any changes in furnishing

161
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:07,078
have to be approved by the
Furnishing Committee.

162
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,412
Which only sits on
alternate years.

163
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:12,132
Yeah, and by the way,
it sits over there.

164
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:14,428
Come on, that
is ridiculous.

165
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:17,970
She's right-- a committee that
important should meet more often.

166
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:20,036
That's not what I'm saying.

167
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,710
Oh. This is the thing about
me standing up to him

168
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,938
and not letting
him run my life?

169
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,163
Yes.

170
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,767
That.

171
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:30,711
Okay. I think we've
found the problem here.

172
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,452
It's not the table at all.

173
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,935
- It's you.
- Me?

174
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,945
Well, it's always me--
take one for the team.

175
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,344
I have spent years turning
this lump of clay

176
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:42,609
into an acceptable
conduit for my will,

177
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,256
and then you came along
and reshaped him,

178
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,507
with your newfangled ideas
and your fancy genitals.

179
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:52,134
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like this?

180
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,179
"Fancy" sounds
like a compliment.

181
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,734
Okay, I have not tried
to change Leonard.

182
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:58,469
That's just what happens
in relationships.

183
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,634
Look how much
Amy's changed you.

184
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:02,484
- That's not true.
- Oh, please.

185
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:05,869
When I first met you, you were incapable
of touching another human being.

186
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:08,561
Now you're holding hands,
you're going on dates,

187
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:10,869
you even made out
with her on a train.

188
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,232
She told you?!

189
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:14,142
Of course she told me-- it's
the most interesting thing

190
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,357
that's ever happened to
her in her entire life!

191
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,425
You're too close to it, but Amy
has had a huge impact on you.

192
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,051
You're right.

193
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,672
Without realizing it, I've allowed
that woman to alter my personality.

194
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,832
Mm, Sheldon, you didn't
have a personality;

195
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:32,971
You just had some
shows you liked.

196
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:36,824
No.

197
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,597
No, I've changed.

198
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:42,394
Like the frog who's put in a pot of
water that's heated so gradually

199
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:44,697
he doesn't realize
he's boiling to death.

200
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:48,296
Or you're the frog who's been kissed by
a princess and turned into a prince.

201
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:50,554
Or you're just a
tall, annoying frog.

202
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,830
Excuse me.

203
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:54,991
I have to break up
with my girlfriend.

204
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,507
- Oh, Sheldon, wait.
- No.

205
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,782
You've opened my
eyes to the truth.

206
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:03,742
Amy has made me a more
affectionate, open-minded person.

207
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,269
And that stops now.

208
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:11,591
- Well, we should call her.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

209
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:16,352
Amy, it's Penny. Hey.
Just a little heads-up.

210
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:18,649
Leonard bought a
dining room table.

211
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:21,300
Yeah. Sheldon's
breaking up with you.

212
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:30,067
Amy? Amy?

213
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,890
Amy?

214
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,203
I'll get right
to the point.

215
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:37,551
I think we need to end
this relationship-- so...

216
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:40,492
just sign this with
your finger, and, uh,

217
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:44,411
please don't cry on my iPad--
I didn't get AppleCare.

218
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:48,079
I'm not surprised you want
to end the relationship.

219
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,471
I'm a little surprised you
didn't get AppleCare.

220
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,595
Anyway, enjoy your life.
Where do I sign?

221
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:55,767
At the bottom.

222
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:59,081
I must say, I'm relieved you're not
making more of a scene out of this.

223
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:00,794
Oh, I've already moved on.

224
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,758
Besides, this breakup has
nothing to do with me.

225
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,638
Wh... It doesn't?

226
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:05,943
Of course not.

227
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:09,379
This is just Leonard trying to take
the focus off that dreadful table

228
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,339
by sowing discord
in our relationship.

229
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:13,881
He's manipulating you
like he always does.

230
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,074
Wait-wait, now, hang on.

231
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,367
You think he manipulates me?

232
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,839
All the time.

233
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:24,709
And he knew that, as your
girlfriend, I wasn't gonna stand by

234
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,152
and let him bring a table
into your apartment.

235
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:29,184
I mean, a table? Come on!

236
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,731
It is hideous.

237
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:37,866
Well, thankfully, I won't have to see it,
'cause I won't be your girlfriend anymore.

238
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,796
Amy Farrah Fowler.

239
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,679
Why, yes, I <i>would
</i> like to take a survey.

240
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,408
Wait.

241
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,914
You were really gonna stand by me
against the dining room table?

242
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:52,464
Of course I was.

243
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,693
Yeah, wait.

244
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:58,042
How do I know that <i>you're</i> not
manipulating me right now?

245
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:03,100
I think if I were manipulating you,
you'd be smart enough to see it.

246
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:08,320
How do I know you're not saying
<i>that</i> as part of the manipulation?

247
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:12,000
I think you'd be smart
enough to see that, too.

248
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:15,964
Okay.

249
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:19,411
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard
time-- I just had to be sure.

250
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:26,298
It's pretty exciting that NASA
wants to send Howard back up.

251
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:27,934
Yeah, exciting.

252
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,003
- Can I ask you something?
- Course.

253
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:33,911
He hated that
entire experience.

254
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,093
Does it make me an awful wife if I
don't think he should do it again?

255
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,413
Not at all.

256
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:42,266
He's forgotten how miserable he was
the entire time he was up there.

257
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:45,204
It's like me in those
moments when I miss India.

258
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,705
- So you'll talk to him?
- Why me?

259
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,023
Well, I'm his wife; I don't
want to ruin it for him.

260
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:53,717
That's the dynamic-- I'm the
fun one, you're the buzzkill.

261
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,415
Since when am I
the buzzkill?

262
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:57,970
Do you think this is cool?

263
00:12:57,989 --> 00:12:59,921
- No, I think it's stupid.
- Aha!

264
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:04,150
You're right, it's great.

265
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:09,939
- Hello.
- Oh, hey.

266
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,707
- You guys didn't break up.
- No. Sorry to disappoint you,

267
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:17,060
but Amy pointed out that you we
only trying to manipulate me.

268
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,484
Which you also figured
out by yourself.

269
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,696
Which I also figured
out by myself.

270
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,777
Well, I'm glad
you're still together.

271
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:26,867
Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to
make this about our relationship.

272
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:29,776
- Which is stronger than ever.
- Which is stronger than ever.

273
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:33,308
This is about <i>you</i> trying
to change my environment,

274
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:35,278
which was perfect
the way it was.

275
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:38,156
But it got the way it
was through change.

276
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:39,972
The-the spot that
you love to sit in,

277
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,288
that no one else can sit in,
only exists because--

278
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:46,438
despite your objections--
I bought this couch.

279
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,583
Me. So explain why that change was
bad and this change was good.

280
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,553
Um...

281
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,442
You don't need to explain
yourself to him.

282
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,601
I don't need to explain
myself to you!

283
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:03,168
You're sick of his nonsense
and ready to move in with me.

284
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:05,351
Keep the table! We
don't use that space!

285
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,131
Damn it, I got cocky.

286
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,724
Hey, Bernie.
I'm home... Hello.

287
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:19,889
Hi, honey.

288
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,480
What's going on?

289
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,140
Maybe you should
have a seat.

290
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,120
Um... okay.

291
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:28,850
I know my mom's not dead;
There'd be balloons.

292
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:31,563
Um... okay. First off,

293
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,608
know that we all love
you and cherish you.

294
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,455
- Well, I wouldn't...
- Daddy.

295
00:14:37,424 --> 00:14:38,983
You're great.

296
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:43,242
<i>- Can I say something?</i>
- Oh, of course.

297
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,753
<i>Hey, Fruit Loops.</i>

298
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,557
Massimino?
Why are <i>you</i> here?

299
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,780
<i>Well, I heard you were thinking about
going back up to the space station,</i>

300
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,083
<i>and as someone who's
been there with you...</i>

301
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,568
<i>well, you know how astronauts
need to have the "right stuff"?</i>

302
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:58,900
Sure.

303
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,091
<i>The stuff you have is wrong.</i>

304
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:07,250
You don't think I did
a good job up there?

305
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:08,772
<i>You did a fine job.</i>

306
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:11,691
<i>It's just, you were scared and
miserable the whole time.</i>

307
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:14,933
I think what we're all trying
to say is, you don't seem

308
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,062
to be remembering how traumatic
the experience was for you.

309
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,413
Like how women often forget
the pain of childbirth.

310
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:23,615
Like a woman.
Great analogy.

311
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:29,310
- Fine, maybe I was a little scared.
- <i>You peed in your space suit.</i>

312
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,883
You're supposed to do that.

313
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,703
<i>Not during the fitting.</i>

314
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:38,431
Son, do I need to remind you
what you asked me to do

315
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:40,091
before you went
up last time?

316
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:43,117
Hang on. That was
just me joking around.

317
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,738
You wanted me to shoot
you in the foot.

318
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,369
Come on, how is that not a joke?
"You got to get me out of this.

319
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,353
Shoot me in the foot."

320
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:55,692
Don't forget all the other
astronauts picking on you.

321
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:59,337
And how you threw up in zero gravity,
and it floated back in your mouth.

322
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:01,874
And you threw up again.

323
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:04,053
And so on and so on.

324
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,771
<i>That was funny.</i>

325
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:12,629
Okay, so I wasn't exactly
John Glenn up there,

326
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,729
but I've changed;
I'm a different man now.

327
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:19,722
Yeah, and I'm a little insulted that
you guys don't think I can handle it.

328
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:22,530
<i>You know you're gonna have to go
through survival training again.</i>

329
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:23,486
Really?

330
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,457
You've got to get
me out of this!

331
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,523
What do you want me to do?
You're perfectly healthy.

332
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,486
Check my blood
pressure again!

333
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,004
I can get it higher;
Just give me a second.

334
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:37,517
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Ma. How are you?

335
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:40,409
<i>How I am is not dead!</i>

336
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:42,981
<i>But you wouldn't know that,
because you don't love me enough</i>

337
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,368
<i>to pick up the phone!</i>

338
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:46,037
Go, go, go!

339
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,465
<i>For all you know, I could have
slipped in the tub and drowned!</i>

340
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:52,885
<i>That's what happened
to your Aunt Ida!</i>

341
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:55,701
Wow.

342
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,984
Howard, I'm so sorry your blood
pressure was off the charts.

343
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,424
Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was
willing to fudge the results, but...

344
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,536
it just seemed so
darned dishonest.

345
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,613
But the mission wouldn't
be for at least a year.

346
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,443
Isn't that enough time to get
your blood pressure under...

347
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:20,201
Look, my blood pressure's
too high, okay? Drop it.

348
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,905
You know, my aunt changed her
diet, and in a few months, she...

349
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,654
Went to space? I don't think so.
Now, pass the soy sauce.

350
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:29,464
Hey, not the green one;
The red one.

351
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,655
Sheldon, Amy, will you
please come join us?

352
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:34,912
Yeah, it's fun up here.

353
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:37,032
So why are you
trying to ruin it?

354
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:40,731
No, thanks. We're fine.

355
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:45,002
I mean, if you people want to eat at the
table, then that's what you should do.

356
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:49,390
I like eating down here because this
is how we've always done things.

357
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:51,872
But if those days are
gone, they're gone.

358
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:54,175
It just... makes me sad.

359
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:57,095
Now I feel bad.

360
00:17:57,115 --> 00:18:00,110
Oh, don't anthropomorphize
him; He's got big eyes,

361
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:02,335
but his feelings
are not like ours.

362
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,589
No, it just seems silly for
us to sit in two groups.

363
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:11,931
Well, it's not silly if you think of that
group as being led by a big, evil baby.

364
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:19,299
Look at Amy down there.

365
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,457
Should we go?

366
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:25,045
- Yeah, let's go.
- But... Penny, this was your idea.

367
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,997
You said that I should
stand up to him.

368
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,472
Forget it, Leonard.
It's over.

369
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,516
Fine.

370
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:40,000
Rajesh?

371
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:43,553
Screw that! I sat on the floor for
seven years. I'm staying right here!

372
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:47,588
Come on, Raj, it's not
the same without you.

373
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,125
Fine.

374
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:54,471
But no more making fun
of how I say tings.

375
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:56,901
You mean "tings"
like "moo-stache"?

376
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,956
Well, isn't this nice.

377
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,605
Sometimes the baby wins.

378
