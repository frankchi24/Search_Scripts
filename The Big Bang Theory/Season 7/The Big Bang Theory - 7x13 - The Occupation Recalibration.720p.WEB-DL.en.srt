<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:03,048 --> 00:00:06,420
- This is just a minor setback.
- No, it's not, okay?

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,728
I've been out here for, like, ten years.
I have nothing to show for it.

4
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,718
Well, you have me.

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:14,821
I do have you.

6
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:23,137
Leonard Hofstadter,

7
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:25,360
will you marry me?

8
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:27,798
Um...

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,624
Did you seriously
just say, "Um..."?

10
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:36,480
- It's an outrage.
- I know.

11
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:38,891
The university-- they think
they can do whatever they want.

12
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,456
We just have to sit
there and take it.

13
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:41,609
You need to let it go, Sheldon.

14
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:44,642
You work tirelessly for someone,
and this is what you get.

15
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:48,397
Oh, my God! They're just making
you use your vacation days!

16
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:51,615
But I don't want a vacation.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,565
Okay, listen, I don't mean to
diminish what you're going through,

18
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,485
but I'm a little
distracted right now.

19
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:58,287
Oh, this again?

20
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:00,789
So, Penny proposed,
you didn't say yes,

21
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:03,125
and now you think you may
have lost her love forever.

22
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:06,852
How does this compare to me being
forced to relax for a few days?

23
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:11,067
- It doesn't!
- Thank you!

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:14,904
I'm gonna go talk to Penny.

25
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:18,113
I'm going to go inside,
put on my coziest pajamas,

26
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:21,809
curl up with a good book and wait
for this nightmare to be over.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,226
Penny.

28
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,559
Sorry.

29
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:37,828
- Hi.
- Hey.

30
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:39,417
Look, I'm sorry I
didn't text you back.

31
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,055
I just needed
some time to think.

32
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,792
- Okay.
- Here. Come in.

33
00:01:43,076 --> 00:01:45,096
Look, if you want
to break up, just say it.

34
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:46,611
- Leonard...
- No, no, no, no. I take it back.

35
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:48,794
Don't say it. Just-just
hate me, but stay with me.

36
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,416
It worked for my parents.

37
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,455
Listen, I don't want
to break up with you.

38
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:57,472
Oh. O-Okay.

39
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:00,031
Good, good.

40
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,190
So, it's cool if I cry a little?

41
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,860
- Yeah, I probably wouldn't.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,112
Look, you did the right thing
last night. I was a mess.

43
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,551
I was just frustrated because
my career is going nowhere.

44
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,499
Look, I get it,
and I want you to know

45
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,267
that I support whatever
you want to do.

46
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,097
Great, because
I've been thinking,

47
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:24,830
if I really want this acting thing to work,
I need to focus all my energy on it.

48
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:28,844
And to do that, I should quit
waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.

49
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,638
Wow!

50
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,703
- That-That's a big step.
- I know.

51
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:34,844
So, you know, before
making any rash...

52
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:37,227
- I already quit.
- And I support you!

63
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:06,819
Come on, take me
to work with you.

64
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:08,767
No. You're on vacation.

65
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,341
Please. What if there's a big
breakthrough in science today

66
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:12,730
and I'm not there to see it?

67
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,462
Do you really think there's gonna be a
breakthrough without you there to do it?

68
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,197
No. I was just tricking you.

69
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:20,203
Bye.

70
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,825
Leonard, wait!

71
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:25,738
- Take me with you.
- No!

72
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,999
- Please.
- No!

73
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:30,153
- Too bad. I'm coming with you.
- Oh, Sheldon, stay!

74
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,066
But...

75
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:32,797
I said stay!

76
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,220
I'm going to work.

77
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,497
Do not follow me.

78
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,118
Hey, Stuart.

79
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:07,092
- Hey.
- Sorry. Did I startle you?

80
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:10,806
Yes, but at this point, pretty
much any customer does.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,007
- What can I do for you? Well,
- I need a little help.

82
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,910
I accidentally destroyed one of
Howard's comic books this morning,

83
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,371
and was hoping
I could replace it.

84
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,110
Wow. What happened?

85
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,603
Batman got his ass kicked
by my curling iron.

86
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,563
Well, don't let
The Riddler know that.

87
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:30,434
It's a comic book joke.

88
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,630
Or maybe it's not.

89
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:37,903
- Do you have this one?
- Uh, well, it's-it's pretty rare.

90
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,152
Can you give me a few
days to track it down?

91
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:42,906
Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it
before Howie comes home from work.

92
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:44,139
Oh. What's the hurry?

93
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:47,217
Well, he's always saying I should be
more careful with my curling iron,

94
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:50,681
and it seems like a dangerous precedent
to let him think he can be right.

95
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:55,767
Well, I'll do what I can, but
I can't make any promises.

96
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,299
You know, I do work at a
pharmaceutical company.

97
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:01,977
If you can make this
happen today,

98
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:05,687
I can hook you up with anxiety
medication, antidepressants.

99
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:06,966
Really?

100
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,302
Do you have any of these?

101
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,439
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

102
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,880
Not so bitey without
the rest of the rat

103
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,680
to back us up now, are we?

104
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,082
Anybody home?

105
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:26,374
Hey, what brings you guys here?

106
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,587
Well, we were just
on our way to lunch

107
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,495
and wanted to see if
you'd like to join.

108
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:30,288
Why?

109
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:31,698
Because Sheldon's
not here this week,

110
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,162
and you don't think I
have any other options?

111
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:34,991
I'm just kidding.
I'll get my purse.

112
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:37,961
Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

113
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,968
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had any company.

114
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,762
That's okay. Uh, Bert,
this is Howard and Rajesh.

115
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,202
Guys, this is Bert.

116
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:45,301
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Hey.

117
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:46,650
Anyway, I wanted to show you

118
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,366
this tourmalinated quartz
that we got in the lab.

119
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:51,004
This is so pretty.

120
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,796
Bert works for the
geology department.

121
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:56,813
Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists
and Bon Jovi have in common?

122
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,884
You're both into rock?

123
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:02,705
Yeah.

124
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,443
Well, see ya.

125
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,411
Oh, you forgot your quartz.

126
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,794
Oh, it's okay. I
want you to have it.

127
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,007
Bye.

128
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:15,963
He's nice.

129
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:18,931
Yeah, he's nice
because he likes you.

130
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:20,307
What?!

131
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,872
- No, he doesn't.
- He brought you a pretty rock.

132
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:24,534
So? He does that every day...

133
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,140
Oh.

134
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:28,983
You know, if you'd
rather skip lunch

135
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,733
and hang out with your boyfriend
Bert, it's totally okay.

136
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,106
He's not my boyfriend.

137
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:35,039
Are you sure? He's tall,
pale and awkward.

138
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,711
That sounds like your type.

139
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,646
Should someone as lonely as you
really be making fun of me?

140
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:42,577
Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

141
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:47,162
What do I do? I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

142
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,581
Maybe the problem is
he thinks you're available.

143
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,425
Does he know
you're dating Sheldon?

144
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:53,729
I guess it hasn't come up.

145
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,316
There you go.

146
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,726
And does Sheldon know
you're dating Sheldon?

147
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,402
I'm sorry. Who are <i>you</i> dating?

148
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:05,290
Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

149
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,476
Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

150
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:18,051
Hello.

151
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,263
You okay?

152
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,118
I'm on vacation.
What do you think?

153
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,046
Why are you sitting
in the stairwell?

154
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,456
Leonard told me to stay.

155
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:38,079
Oh.

156
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,655
Well, good boy.

157
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:42,356
Where are you going?

158
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:43,596
Oh, I have a ton
of errands to run.

159
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,850
I need to make copies of my
headshot, send them off to agents

160
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:47,616
and sign up for a new
acting class and...

161
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,308
Well, have fun.

162
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:50,748
Okay.

163
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,641
You want to come with me?

164
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:00,006
Really?

165
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:03,057
Come on, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

166
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,801
Get in the car. Come on.

167
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,339
All right, thanks a lot.

168
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:11,876
They have one at
Capital Comics.

169
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:13,722
- Oh, that's great.
- No, it's not.

170
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,530
I hate that place.

171
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,690
Guy who owns it is a jerk.

172
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,857
He's always making me
feel bad about myself.

173
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:21,706
Oh, that's terrible.

174
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,058
What's the address?

175
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,857
You know, why don't I
just take you there?

176
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:28,524
That way, I can make sure
he doesn't rip you off.

177
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:30,525
Oh, thanks, but I don't
want you to close up.

178
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:32,032
I mean, won't you lose business?

179
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,148
Sorry. That was mean.

180
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,954
Penny really quit
The Cheesecake Factory?

181
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,699
- Yeah.
- So, what is she doing today?

182
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,697
I don't know.

183
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,317
She already thinks
I don't support this,

184
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,610
so if I call, it might look like
I'm checking up on her.

185
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:52,164
- Well, do you support this?
- Of course I do.

186
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:55,397
She's a great actress. I'm
proud she's taking this risk.

187
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,291
- That's nice.
- You bought that? Great!

188
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,081
I got to call her before
I forget how I said it.

189
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:06,938
Hey.

190
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,630
- Hi. What's up?
- Oh, how's it going?

191
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,158
You taking Hollywood by storm?

192
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,831
Actually, I'm at The
Cheesecake Factory.

193
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,308
You got your job back.
That is great news.

194
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:15,772
I didn't want to say anything,

195
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:17,314
but you are making
the right choice.

196
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,650
To plunge yourself into debt right
now would be literally insane.

197
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,878
Yeah. I'm just
returning my uniform.

198
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,736
And I support you.

199
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,415
<i>Before we begin your
guided meditation,</i>

200
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:41,633
<i>close your eyes and picture
yourself in a peaceful environment.</i>

201
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:43,231
Okay.

202
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,162
I'm inside the CERN
super collider.

203
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,478
<i>Now, take a deep, relaxing
breath in through your nose.</i>

204
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:57,238
<i>And let it out.</i>

205
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,338
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

206
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,452
<i>In.</i>

207
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,797
Let me guess.

208
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:07,414
<i>And out.</i>

209
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:11,172
What was I gonna do?
Two "ins" in a row?

210
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:18,556
- Where's my lemonade?
- I didn't get it.

211
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:21,848
A fitting swan song to
your career as a waitress

212
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,020
to forget my order
one last time.

213
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,832
Do you think quitting
my job was a mistake?

214
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,198
Do you see me drinking lemonade?

215
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,642
No. I'm serious.

216
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,380
Why do you ask?

217
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:43,909
Because Leonard
just pissed me off.

218
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,723
Am I being an idiot or not?

219
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:48,136
No, I don't think you are.

220
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:49,450
Really?

221
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:52,972
The best way to achieve a
goal is to devote 100%

222
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,976
of your time and energy to it.

223
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:57,085
When I decided I was
going to be a physicist,

224
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:00,360
I didn't take some other job
in case it didn't work out.

225
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,536
Which wasn't easy because
there was a lot of pressure

226
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,650
from Ms. Pierson for me to
be chalk monitor that year.

227
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:09,535
Thank you. I needed
to hear that.

228
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,786
Why can't Leonard understand it?

229
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:14,944
Because he's not
like us, Penny.

230
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,923
We're dreamers.

231
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,202
Yeah, I need to start cracking the
window when I leave you in the car.

232
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:31,699
Hey.

233
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,041
Hello, Bert.

234
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:34,753
So, anyway,
there's this big, uh,

235
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:37,812
rock and mineral show next
week in Santa Monica and...

236
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:41,717
Listen, um, Bert, before you
say anything else, I...

237
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:43,884
I have a boyfriend.

238
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:46,730
Oh. This is awkward.

239
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:50,130
You thought I was gonna ask you to
go with me to the mineral show.

240
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:51,945
Weren't you?

241
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,051
Yeah.

242
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,390
That's very nice of you, but...

243
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,409
I do have a boyfriend.

244
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,987
That's what you all say.

245
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,355
You just don't want
to go out with me

246
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,568
because I have
an off-putting personality.

247
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,254
No, that's not true.

248
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,475
My boyfriend has
an off-putting personality, too.

249
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,461
Like, way worse than you.

250
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,928
Don't worry.

251
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,087
I'm used to it.

252
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,136
I mean, I'm big and weird
and funny-looking

253
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:21,896
and no one ever wants
to do anything with me.

254
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,233
Don't say that.

255
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,247
It's okay.

256
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,938
I know I'm a monster.

257
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,029
No, Bert, come on.

258
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:33,492
I'd love to go to the
mineral show with you.

259
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:35,718
Sweet. It's a date.

260
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:40,179
No, it's not.

261
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:41,599
Too late!

262
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:51,123
Wow.

263
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,743
Yeah. Haven't seen this
many people in my store

264
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:59,082
since that Korean church bus
crashed through my front window.

265
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,109
Hey! Stuart!

266
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,002
Jesse.

267
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:04,884
Haven't seen you in forever.

268
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:06,491
Look how gray you've gotten.

269
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:08,854
My hair's exactly
the same color as always.

270
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:10,994
No, I was talking
about your skin.

271
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:14,421
Look, uh, my friend here
needs a comic book...

272
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,933
Ooh! And she went into
your store by mistake.

273
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,603
Good thing there was no
one there to see you.

274
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:21,631
What do you need?

275
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:25,184
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.
Right over here.

276
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:29,606
Even you, Sweatpants?

277
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,367
Free popcorn.

278
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:34,875
Can I offer you a coffee?

279
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:37,088
- Espresso? Latte?
- No, thanks.

280
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,314
How about you, Stu?
Mocha? Scone?

281
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,683
Directions to the
nearest soup kitchen?

282
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,453
- Hey.
- I'm just kidding.

283
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,682
He knows where the
soup kitchen is.

284
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,743
It's on Merton Avenue.

285
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,775
I don't think I like the way
you're treating my friend.

286
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,142
Sorry.

287
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,855
- You want the book or not?
- Not from you.

288
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:00,893
Let's go, Stuart.

289
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,860
You know something, Jesse?

290
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:08,058
You may have a
successful business

291
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:11,790
a-and the kind of pink complexion
that comes with good nutrition...

292
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,330
...but I have something
more important.

293
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:16,772
What's that?

294
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:18,631
Friendship.

295
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,417
Which I would trade in a
heartbeat for all of this.

296
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,112
The mineral and rock show?

297
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,758
That would be awful
even without Bert.

298
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,133
So what am I supposed to do now?

299
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:39,159
Prepare your uterus
for his gigantic offspring?

300
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
This isn't funny.

301
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:44,813
I'm gonna have to
tell him the truth:

302
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:47,633
that even if I didn't have a boyfriend,
I wouldn't be interested in him.

303
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,080
I've heard those
words so many times.

304
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:52,375
From Linda Nosenchuck,
Tammy Rosenworcel...

305
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,208
Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

306
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,828
...Marci Grossman,
Lisa Mazzarino...

307
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,714
- ...Megan Pincus...
- ...Tammy Cho...

308
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,054
Oh, who was that girl
from our Starbucks?

309
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,323
- Arlene Russel!
- Yes! Arlene!

310
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,560
She wrote "no way" on
both our cappuccinos.

311
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:08,658
Poor Bert.

312
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,178
That guy's got a rough
afternoon ahead of him.

313
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:14,955
Well, how would you want a girl to
tell you she wasn't interested?

314
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,144
I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me
down, look me in the eye and say,

315
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,202
"I was wrong. I love you."

316
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:25,951
And then maybe she could
touch me in a special way.

317
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:29,686
That's how you reject a guy.

318
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,732
Okay, I don't have
time for this.

319
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,038
I'm just gonna go find him
and be brutally honest.

320
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,885
- No, don't.
- He'll be so upset.

321
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:39,881
He'll probably climb up the Empire State
Building and start swatting at planes.

322
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,473
You want us to talk to him?

323
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:48,419
Really? You would do that?

324
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:50,211
Sure. We've both
been in his shoes.

325
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,709
We'll let him down with
compassion and respect.

326
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,921
Thank you.

327
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:56,419
Let's go.

328
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:01,477
- So we tell him she's a lesbian, right?
- Of course we tell him she's a lesbian.

329
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:12,315
And hold three...

330
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:14,832
two... one.

331
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:16,588
Very good.

332
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:19,740
Now let's try Warrior II.

333
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,063
And hold.

334
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:29,441
I've read that there are great
yogis who have such mastery

335
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:33,363
over their bodies they can draw
water in through their genitals.

336
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:44,865
Yeah, well, I don't think we're
gonna get to do that today.

337
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,204
Too bad.

338
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:52,100
It seems like a good way to drink a milk
shake without getting brain freeze.

339
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,227
Oh, hey.

340
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:58,519
And now we go to
Reverse Warrior.

341
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,106
How did she get you to do yoga?

342
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,732
Well, to be honest, I
thought she said "Yoda."

343
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:16,754
I'm helping him relax because,
unlike you, he supports me.

344
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:19,236
Oh, how many times
do I have to say it?

345
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,596
I support you.

346
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:22,439
Sheldon, take a break.

347
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:24,946
<i>Namaste.</i>

348
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:29,255
Okay, if you support me, what
was with that phone call?

349
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,931
Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

350
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,452
But if you care so
much what I think,

351
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:35,027
why didn't you ask me
before you did it?

352
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,602
Oh, so now I need
your permission?

353
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,129
Would you have asked me
before you quit your job?

354
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:41,673
Yes. I thought we were
in the kind of relationship

355
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,052
where we make
decisions together.

356
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,738
If I'm wrong, then
maybe we need to talk

357
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,425
about the kind of relationship
we're actually in.

358
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:47,828
Yeah, well, maybe we do.

359
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,122
I'm willing to if you guys are.

360
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:53,395
Can we please
have some privacy?

361
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,675
Y... No.

362
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:56,937
I'm as much a part of this
relationship as you two,

363
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,575
and I think it's high time we
put all our cards on the table.

364
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,185
Yeah. For example,
where is this going?

365
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:04,084
Are you two ever
getting married?

366
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:08,060
And, if so, where will we all live?
Have you thought about that?

367
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:10,277
- No.
- Penny?

368
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,879
Okay, wait. What
are we doing?

369
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:15,626
For some reason, we're planning a future
where we both live with Sheldon forever.

370
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:18,242
Good. Now we're
getting somewhere.

371
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:22,132
Look, I know you think I'm being
reckless, and you might be right,

372
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:23,551
but I need to take this shot.

373
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:24,584
Yeah, no kidding.

374
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:28,324
Despite what it says on her
résumé, she is no longer 22.

375
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:34,552
I swear, I am on your side.

376
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:37,259
You keep saying you're on my
side, but you don't act like it.

377
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:40,066
He does that to me, too.
Why do we put up with it?

378
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:45,111
Listen, I could never do
what you're doing, okay?

379
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:48,137
- I would be terrified.
- Well, it's scary for me, too.

380
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,813
I'm fine with it.

381
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:55,544
My point is, just because I couldn't
do it doesn't mean you shouldn't.

382
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:57,935
And I'm proud of you.

383
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:02,293
Okay. Thank you.

384
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:06,514
Well, to celebrate this reconciliation,
let's all share a milk shake.

385
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:09,034
Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.

386
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,041
- You're back.
- Yes, I am!

387
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,894
There's a few more things
I want to say to you.

388
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:22,095
Stuart's store is just fine, and he's
a much nicer person than you are,

389
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:25,402
and if you still have that comic,
I'd like to buy it right now!

390
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:27,706
No problem.

391
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,140
Oh, you want a latte
while you wait?

392
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:32,148
No, I don't want a latte!

393
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:34,730
I want a cappuccino
and a blueberry scone!

394
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:37,190
I only have chocolate chip.

395
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:39,810
Well, that sounds even better!

396
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,927
Thanks for coming to the
mineral and rock show with me.

397
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,391
We're sorry Amy
didn't want to go.

398
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:59,241
Really, <i>really</i> sorry.

399
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,059
Eh.

400
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:03,438
Who needs her when
I have you guys?

401
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,931
Rock show! Rock show! Rock show!

402
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,354
Rock show! Rock show!

403
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,503
Rock show!
Rock show...!
