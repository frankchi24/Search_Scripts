1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,737
How's your mom holding up?

2
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:08,726
She's doing okay, but we
just lost another nurse.

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:09,873
How many is that now?

4
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,664
Two, and I know what
you're thinking--

5
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,718
she's eating them.

6
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:18,302
She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

7
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,717
So, who's
watching her now?

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,062
A bowl full of M&M's with
a few Ambien tossed in.

9
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,494
- What up, guys?
- Hello. - Hey. -Hello.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,227
Okay. Well, now that
everyone's here,

11
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,717
Penny and I have
some big news.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,100
We're engaged!

13
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,702
And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

14
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,414
Hey! Hey!

15
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:52,057
What the hell!

16
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:55,596
You guys propose all the time.
This never happens.

17
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,317

28
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:28,846
Boy, I'm so hungry today.

29
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:30,921
I wonder why?

30
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:35,047
Because you had sex
the other night?

31
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:36,783
You know what?

32
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:39,104
That may be it.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,814
By the way, it isn't like riding a bike.
Like, I fell off a few times.

34
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:48,783
Hey, buddy.

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,209
Hello.

36
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,622
You okay?

37
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:55,902
I just got called into
President Siebert's office.

38
00:01:55,928 --> 00:02:00,842
The university won't let me switch my
field of study to inflationary cosmology.

39
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:03,825
They're forcing me to
continue with string theory.

40
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:04,838
Why?

41
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,711
He said it's why
they hired me,

42
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,048
it's-it's what my grant
was designated for,

43
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,534
and that everybody has to do
things they don't want to do.

44
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,442
He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

45
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:18,448
even though he didn't want to,
which was look at my stupid face.

46
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:23,384
That's a rude thing to say.
Out loud.

47
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,578
It's an outrage.

48
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:29,913
Honestly, I'm tempted
to leave the university.

49
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,501
You know, if you're really
serious about that,

50
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:34,099
I hear there are some
exciting opportunities

51
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:37,063
in home care for
the old and fat.

52
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:40,922
Whatever you do, just don't
make any rash decisions.

53
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:44,649
I don't know. I am
really aggravated.

54
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:47,753
When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

55
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:51,168
But that's just me.

56
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:59,209
- Oh, come on, give her a chance.
- No. Life, it is too short.

57
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,256
I know you've only been
here a day and a half,

58
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,668
but you're like
part of the family!

59
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:09,602
I don't think the service is
gonna send any more people.

60
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:15,053
Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

61
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,178
That's not helpful.

62
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:21,343
Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

63
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:25,076
that we're gonna be living
here the next few months.

64
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:28,496
But we have jobs. We can't
baby-sit her 24 hours a day.

65
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:31,431
Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

66
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:35,507
I wanted to go to
Hawaii, not Hell.

67
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:37,864
I don't know what
else we can do.

68
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:40,580
Howie, I love you,

69
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:42,409
and as your wife, your
mother is every bit

70
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:46,016
as much my problem as
she is yours, so...

71
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,840
I want a divorce.

72
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:54,334
Hello, Leonard.

73
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:55,567
Hi, Mom.

74
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:58,145
I have some exciting news.

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,687
I'm listening.

76
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:03,286
Before I tell you, will
you promise to try

77
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:07,914
and be happy for me and keep any
concerns you have to yourself?

78
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:09,490
No.

79
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:14,719
Let me save you all of
your hemming and hawing.

80
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:18,564
Sheldon already told me that
you and Penny are engaged.

81
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:22,434
I-I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

82
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:25,543
Would you <i>like</i> for you
and me to talk more?

83
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,656
You know what?
It's probably fine.

84
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:34,552
In any event, while I've
had my misgivings about...

85
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,848
Penny...

86
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:40,996
...Sheldon spoke very fondly of her,
and if she is good enough for him,

87
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,927
then she's good
enough for me.

88
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,207
I'm your son.

89
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:50,350
What about the fact that
she's good enough for me?

90
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,083
Sure.

91
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,603
Thanks, Mom.

92
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,709
Leonard, would it
make you feel better

93
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:02,646
to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

94
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,105
Yes, it would.

95
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,962
Yeah. Well, you
should work on that.

96
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:16,608
No, Mom, it's the same guy I've been
going out with for the past two years.

97
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,055
Yeah, the scientist.

98
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,403
Well, it's complicated.

99
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:24,297
I mean, he works with
lasers and atomic magnets.

100
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,327
No, I did not see it coming.

101
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,469
No, we did not set a date.

102
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:33,553
No, I'm not pregnant.

103
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,399
Yeah, this is a first
for our family.

104
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,538
All right, tell Dad I love him.
I gotta go. All right, bye.

105
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,896
- Atomic magnets?
- Shut up.

106
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:49,450
Sorry I'm late. The leaf blower broke,
so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.

107
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:52,992
- You want some wine?
- Thanks.

108
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:55,755
Little warning before you jump
into this marriage business:

109
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,135
You're not just marrying him,
you're marrying his family.

110
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:00,235
I think Leonard's
mom's okay with me.

111
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,568
It doesn't matter if
she's okay with you.

112
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:05,051
The question is: Can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

113
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,503
Hit me again.

114
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,095
So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

115
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,570
Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

116
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:21,288
at some point, I'll move in with
him, or he'll move in with me.

117
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:23,771
Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

118
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:25,217
You're not working!

119
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:28,371
How would you like a job
in home health care?

120
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:29,831
Not a chance.

121
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:31,251
- Please. I'm desperate.
- No.

122
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,107
- I'll pay you anything you want.
- Okay, then, yeah.

123
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:38,284
No! Keep your money!

124
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,155
I could've ridden a
bull longer than that.

125
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,995
What you working on?

126
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,557
I'm writing an appeal
to the Faculty Senate,

127
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,694
so that I can move on
from string theory.

128
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,437
Oh. How's it going?

129
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,758
You tell me.

130
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:01,745
"Dear Esteemed Colleagues,

131
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:04,998
"As you may know, I have requested
to change my field of study.

132
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:09,016
"My decision to do so is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

133
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,578
"At your convenience, I'd be
happy to explain it to you

134
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,249
in words you'll
understand."

135
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:18,705
It's nice that you
called them "esteemed."

136
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:21,775
You're right. I'll
take that out.

137
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:26,582
So, listen, there was something
I was hoping to float past you.

138
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,489
Mm. Now that Penny
and I are engaged,

139
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,959
I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

140
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,166
Of course.

141
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:36,195
She's spent many nights
here, and you're worried

142
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:40,537
about preserving the myth of her
virginity before the wedding.

143
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:46,144
- I'm not. - Good, because not
only has that ship sailed,

144
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:49,450
if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

145
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:54,371
Actually, this is about where
she and I are going to live.

146
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:55,678
What do you mean?

147
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,620
Well... well, we might
want to live together.

148
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:02,620
Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought, and...

149
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:06,120
I'm willing to let
Penny live with us

150
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,344
one day a week for
a trial period.

151
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,714
Now, obviously, not
when she's made cranky

152
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:16,680
by the shedding of
her uterine lining.

153
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,391
That's very sweet.

154
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:26,195
But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

155
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,672
not you.

156
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:32,860
I don't understand.

157
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,577
How could we all live
together if I'm not there?

158
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,646
Look, I-I know this is... this is
change, and that sounds scary, but...

159
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:45,845
- Where are you going to go?
- I don't know.

160
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,916
We just started to
think about this.

161
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:51,072
Maybe I'll move in with Penny, or
maybe she and I'll take this place,

162
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:55,444
- and you can move across the hall.
- Move across the hall?!

163
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,338
Did you take a marijuana?!

164
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,648
No, I did not.

165
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,259
Did you get hit on the
head with a coconut?

166
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:07,994
- No. - Well, then, I'm
all out of guesses.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,684
What? Me move across the hall-- Why
would you even suggest such a thing?

168
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:16,217
Because I love Penny, and want to
give her the life she deserves.

169
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:17,631
I see.

170
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,571
You're putting your future
bride's happiness above mine.

171
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:25,450
Well, yeah.

172
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:29,111
Wow.

173
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:38,494
How dare the university force
me to go back to string theory!

174
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:40,085
They just don't
appreciate you.

175
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:42,645
Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

176
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:44,951
to suggest that now that
he and Penny are engaged,

177
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,985
he may not want to
live with me anymore.

178
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,148
Here, I made you some
Strawberry Quik.

179
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:51,349
I have real
problems here, Amy.

180
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:53,938
I can't be mollified with a
beverage designed for children.

181
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,760
Mmm! Yummy.

182
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,248
You know, this might
work out for the best.

183
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:04,055
I mean, you're always complaining about
what a terrible roommate Leonard is.

184
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:06,538
Like how he turns up the
thermostat when you're not there.

185
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,972
Ugh! It's like walking
into the Amazon.

186
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:12,041
And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

187
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:14,905
The awful one with
birds and snakes.

188
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:18,542
You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

189
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:20,474
Four keys!

190
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:23,042
Who does he think
he is, a warden?

191
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,575
See? Maybe you'll
love living alone.

192
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:29,103
I don't know. Perhaps.

193
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:32,310
And if it turns
out you don't...

194
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:36,649
- you and I could live together.
- You and... Oh, sure.

195
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,974
And while we're at it,
why don't we get engaged, too?

196
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,090
Why don't we get a little
house, start a family?

197
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:45,259
Enjoy our sunset years together?
Do you hear yourself, woman?!

198
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,292
- Sheldon, it was just a thought.
- No. Here's a thought.

199
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:51,598
You're not moving in,
Leonard's not moving out,

200
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:53,786
everything stays
exactly the way it is.

201
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,151
Yeah, and by the way,

202
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,297
I saw you make this
Strawberry Quik with syrup,

203
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:59,627
and you're supposed
to use the powder!

204
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:01,506
It tastes the same.

205
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:04,553
No. The syrup tastes better
and I don't like it.

206
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:10,668
This is so sweet! You
never cook for me.

207
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:13,539
Well... you cook for
me all the time and...

208
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,592
Ugh.

209
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,463
If you don't like my cooking, why
haven't you ever said anything?

210
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:23,071
It's hard to talk with so
much heavy chewing to do.

211
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:26,137
Sorry. I'll get better.

212
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:28,481
I know you'll try.

213
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:32,571
So, should we talk
about setting a date?

214
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:35,093
Well, I'd like to pick one that
works with my brother's schedule.

215
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,129
Okay. And when
would that be?

216
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:40,397
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

217
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:43,995
Hi, is Sheldon here?

218
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,871
No, I thought he was with you.

219
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:48,910
He was, but he stormed off and now
he isn't answering his phone.

220
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:52,297
- What happened? - He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

221
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:53,130
Oh.

222
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,046
I also mentioned that he
and I could live together

223
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:58,755
but he was too mad at you to
realize what a great idea that is.

224
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,642
Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

225
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:06,641
I'm sure he's fine. He probably just
needs a little alone time to decompress.

226
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,739
You're probably right.

227
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,606
So, what are you
guys doing?

228
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,992
Well, Leonard cooked for me
and now we're just having

229
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:19,595
a nice dinner, you know,
as a newly engaged couple.

230
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,578
That's nice.

231
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:31,915
Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon
probably just needs a little alone time.

232
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:35,514
'Cause that's important.

233
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:40,863
Not just for
him, but for...

234
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:43,208
most anybody, really.

235
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:46,488
Don't I know it.
What is that, polenta?

236
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,294
- Amy, get out.
- Right.

237
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,599
No.

238
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:00,311
Hey, Sheldon.

239
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:01,615
What happened?

240
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:05,590
I was cooking in the back room last
night and the hot plate caught on fire.

241
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:07,909
And you couldn't
put it out?

242
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:12,390
I was across the street at the
do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.

243
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,340
So when will you reopen?

244
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:21,518
Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear
back from the insurance company.

245
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,273
So, tomorrow?

246
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,675
I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but, uh,

247
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:29,702
my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

248
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,150
<i>Your</i> life?

249
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,919
The university is making
me do string theory

250
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:37,621
and my girlfriend loves me so
much she wants to live with me.

251
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:43,762
And now, the place I need to go when
I'm sad is damp and smells funny.

252
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,344
Well, sorry I let you down.

253
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,168
No. I do not accept this.

254
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:53,451
Everything is changing and
I hate it. It stops now.

255
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:55,682
I'm helping you get
back on your feet.

256
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,380
I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

257
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,635
That'll be $2.99.

258
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:05,900
Really? It's soaking wet.

259
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,042
Fine, a dollar.

260
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:14,488
- Can you break a 20?
- No, I only have hundreds.

261
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:17,887
You know what?

262
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,671
I don't always recognize
sarcasm, but I do right now,

263
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,135
and I don't appreciate it.
I'm sorry for your loss.

264
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:27,466
But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

265
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,415
That could have killed me.

266
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:39,465
I can't catch a break.

267
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:45,416
I haven't heard from Sheldon
in a while. You think he's okay?

268
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,616
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

269
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,867
I'm gonna see where he is.

270
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:53,756
- How? - Oh, I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

271
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:54,906
You do that?

272
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,932
Not always, but ever since he
wandered off at the swap meet

273
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:00,592
chasing a balloon,
I get worried.

274
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,669
He can take care of himself.

275
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:06,305
Look, we went over stranger
danger and gave him that whistle.

276
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,780
That's weird.

277
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:11,315
- What?
- He's at the train station.

278
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:13,308
So? He loves trains.

279
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:16,446
It's dark out and he's alone, I
don't like it. Let's go get him.

280
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,744
Oh, it's sweet how you
look out for him.

281
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:21,026
- You're a good guy.
- It's not just that.

282
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:24,240
My mother would kill me if I
let something happen to him.

283
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,809
Dude, I'm so sorry.

284
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,084
Don't take this
the wrong way,

285
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,818
but did you do this for
the insurance money?

286
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:38,133
No. God, you sound like
the police, the firemen,

287
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,417
my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

288
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,393
We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

289
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,918
Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could
crash at your place for a few nights.

290
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,298
Sure, of course.

291
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,684
Oh, actually, Emily was
gonna spend the night.

292
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:53,917
You slept with her? Nice.

293
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:58,293
Well, I can't take all the credit.
She let me do it to her, but...

294
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:02,671
Uh, but I can always
call her and cancel.

295
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,025
Hang on. I know
a place you can stay

296
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:07,641
and earn some money
at the same time.

297
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,094
- Great.
- I just have to warn you,

298
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:13,660
it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

299
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,685
So what's the catch?

300
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:23,810
Sheldon.

301
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,683
You tracked my phone?

302
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:27,660
Yeah.

303
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:31,865
Boy, you chase one
balloon for three miles.

304
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,974
We were worried about you.

305
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,884
Don't be melodramatic.

306
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,726
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

307
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:45,904
Seriously? You don't even have a
change of clothes or a toothbrush.

308
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:48,892
My plan is to stop at malls
and buy what I need.

309
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,570
It's called living
off the land.

310
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:55,084
Okay, I know you're upset and
there's a lot of stuff going on,

311
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,134
but it's nothing we can't work out.
Come on, let's get you home.

312
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:02,482
No. I've reached my breaking point.
I need to leave. Now.

313
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,260
- And go where?
- It doesn't matter.

314
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,481
So a few things
don't go your way

315
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:12,473
and your best decision is to
ride the rails like a hobo?

316
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,166
I suppose it is.

317
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,163
Except I have a
credit card.

318
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:21,775
And I refuse to carry my
laptop at the end of a stick.

319
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:27,700
And I'd sooner die than
eat beans out of a can.

320
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:32,097
Come on, come home with us and tomorrow
I'll-I'll take you to Legoland.

321
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,977
Legoland is not the
solution to everything.

322
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:39,108
And it's too much of a scene
since that movie came out.

323
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,492
Then what can I do?

324
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,999
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

325
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:48,165
Everything is changing and
it's simply too much.

326
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,354
I need to get
away and think.

327
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,683
Oh, c-come on, you know
you're overreacting.

328
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:56,104
Leonard, hang on. Just...
come here for a second.

329
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,722
Maybe we need
to let him go.

330
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,249
What?! Why?

331
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:02,358
It might be good for him.

332
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:05,585
Y-You know he can't take a
trip like this by himself.

333
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:06,781
He's a grown man.

334
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:09,830
No, he <i>looks</i> like
a grown man.

335
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:15,898
You've seen <i>Freaky Friday,</i> sometimes
little kids end up in big person bodies.

336
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:19,278
Leonard, we can't
protect him forever.

337
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,209
- I know, but...
- He'll be okay.

338
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:24,101
You taught him
well, Padawan.

339
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,081
Good Lord!

340
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,160
Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

341
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,518
Seriously, let him go.

342
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:41,858
Sheldon, if you really need to do this,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

343
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,213
I do.

344
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,408
Okay.

345
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,213
Good luck.

346
00:18:52,274 --> 00:18:55,027
Be safe and call us.

347
00:18:57,392 --> 00:18:59,148
I will.

348
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:03,129
Bye, buddy.

349
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:08,728
Sheldon...

350
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,302
Yes?

351
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,927
I'm gonna miss you.

352
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:15,856
Of course you are.

353
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,749
- He just made that easier.
- Mm.

354
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:29,931
Hey!

355
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,199
What are you guys
still doing here?

356
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:36,363
I got this, go. Go home.

357
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,498
You sure?

358
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:43,970
Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills,
she's all tucked in and watching TV.

359
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,751
So, she's not too
much for you?

360
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,463
Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

361
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:53,237
Stewie, you gonna watch
<i>Wheel of Fortune</i> with me?

362
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,310
Coming, Debbie.

363
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:59,741
- You call her Debbie?
- She insisted.

364
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:04,902
So, hey, guys, thank you so much.
This job is a dream come true.

365
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,078
Was that a little weird?

366
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:17,811
Yeah. I don't know why, but
something about it feels...

367
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:20,015
unnatural.

368
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:24,199
- Okay, let's go.
- Yep.

369
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:28,693
Okay, Sheldon, thanks
for checking in.

370
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,503
Talk to you tomorrow?

371
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,177
O-Okay, bye.

372
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,861
He's okay?

373
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:36,847
Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

374
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,397
I really think this is
gonna be for the best.

375
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:40,927
Me, too.

376
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,533
And he was able to take
a sabbatical from...

377
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:45,668
How could you let him go?!

378
