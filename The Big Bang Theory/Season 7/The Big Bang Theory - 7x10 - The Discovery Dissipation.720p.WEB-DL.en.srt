<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:04,892
Sheldon, did you just

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:08,476
figure out a method for synthesizing
a new stable super-heavy element?

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,694
Did I?!

5
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:11,629
Well, that can't be right.

6
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:14,994
No one's ever done that before.
Except me because I just did it!

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,958
♪ Sheldon and his brain, yeah

8
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:19,135
♪ Sheldon and his brain, yeah! ♪

9
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:21,192
I've made a horrible mistake.

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,586
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:23,792
This table,

12
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:27,123
it's in square centimeters I
read it as square meters.

13
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,609
You know what that means?

14
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:31,337
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

15
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:36,812
Amy, I was off by a
factor of 10,000.

16
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:38,885
But the Chinese team
found the element.

17
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,823
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.
My calculations were wrong.

18
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:45,515
The greatest scientific achievement
of my life is based on a blunder.

19
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:47,074
I'm not a genius.

20
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:48,648
I'm a fraud.

21
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,892
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

22
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:53,262
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

23
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,650
that we thought was
someplace else.

24
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:57,782
Oh, great, now I'm
worse than a fraud.

25
00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:59,718
I'm practically a biologist.

26
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,460
This is <i>Science Friday.
</i> I'm Ira Flatow.

27
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,044
My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

28
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:10,055
stable super-heavy element.

29
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:11,991
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

30
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:13,855
Thank you.

31
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:16,889
Uh, the university made me come here.
I didn't want to.

32
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:20,097
Uh, big fan of the show.

33
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:26,013
So, I understand that you actually
discovered this element by mistake.

34
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:29,333
Yes.

35
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:34,590
And some people in the science community
are calling it "The Wonder Blunder."

36
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,316
Who? Give me their names.

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,080
I bet it's Wolowitz.

38
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:42,901
It's just such a fascinating story.
Your calculations are way off,

39
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:44,668
but they find
the element anyway.

40
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:49,656
It's like misreading a treasure map
and still finding the treasure.

41
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:51,749
Can we talk
about something else?

42
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:54,105
Do you know that I yodel?

43
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,858
That's interesting, but this could
be taking you down the path

44
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:00,526
toward a Nobel Prize.

45
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,514
And in chemistry, no less.

46
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:05,857
And wouldn't that be unusual?
Because you're a physicist.

47
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,607
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in chemistry.

48
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,741
Everyone laugh at
the circus freak.

49
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:15,131
You know, I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.

50
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:17,000
It is because of bullies
like you,

51
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,685
every day more and more Americans are

President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.

63
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,439
You're the one who made
me go on the radio.

64
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:56,276
I was expecting a professional
science interview,

65
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,043
not an attack by some
morning zoo shock jock.

66
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,379
Well, if the university
needs money so badly,

67
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,601
perhaps you should
start a swear jar.

68
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:09,563
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

69
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:14,409
I know you don't like it, but
every time you do an interview,

70
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,564
it raises the profile
of the university.

71
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,082
That translates to funding.

72
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:22,041
Yeah, well, I'm not just some
trained monkey dancing for coins.

73
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,705
Of course you're not. People
love trained monkeys.

74
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:31,183
How can you not be happy?
You're tall, thin and famous.

75
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,748
Oh, my God, I'm
jealous of Sheldon.

76
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,138
Look, you're gonna be doing
this stuff for a while.

77
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,532
You're just gonna have to find
a way to get used to it.

78
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,498
But none of you know
what this is like.

79
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:44,403
Being celebrated for something
you wish you never did.

80
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,494
Mmm... you clearly haven't
been with me at Mardi Gras.

81
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:53,439
Want to pause the video game
and help me clean up?

82
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:56,753
I am cleaning up. Look at the mess
the Joker made of Gotham City.

83
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:01,205
Come on, it's your friend
who's coming to stay here.

84
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,823
Raj grew up in India. Trust
me, he's seen worse.

85
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:06,330
Howie.

86
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:09,062
I promise I'll help out
the rest of the week.

87
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,527
The rest of the week? You said it
was just gonna be a night or two.

88
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,646
Yeah, but if I told you a week,
would you have said yes?

89
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,082
- No!
- Then you left me no choice.

90
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:21,085
I love Raj, but that's a
long time for a house guest.

91
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,764
I know, but they're
tenting his building.

92
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:25,386
He can't find a hotel
he likes that allows dogs.

93
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,663
- He's bringing Cinnamon?
- For a whole week!

94
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,508
The nerve of some people.

95
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:36,609
Here comes the
Embarrassment Express.

96
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,545
With stops at Fraudville...

97
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:42,084
WonderBlunderberg...

98
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,615
and Kansas City.

99
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,703
Because it's a hub.

100
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,360
Sheldon, can I come in?

101
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:51,849
- Do you have cookies?
- No.

102
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:54,007
Good. I don't deserve cookies.
Come in.

103
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:58,160
- Wil...?
- Hey, Sheldon.

104
00:04:58,184 --> 00:04:59,423
It's been a while.

105
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:00,791
Why are you here?

106
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:03,347
Amy said you were having a rough time,
and I thought maybe we could talk.

107
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:04,459
Is that okay?

108
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:05,947
Certainly.

109
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:08,289
Although... right now,
I'm having a rough time

110
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:09,977
because there's three
people in my room,

111
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:12,638
and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.

112
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,845
Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention

113
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,022
for something you wished
you never did.

114
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,118
Yeah, I know a little
something about that.

115
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,873
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

116
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,458
Your endless tweets
are not that bad.

117
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,554
I remember why
it's been a while.

118
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,453
Sheldon, I was actually talking about
when I was a kid on <i>Star Trek.</i>

119
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,958
How could you not like getting
attention for playing Wesley Crusher?

120
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:38,327
You were wonderful.

121
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:42,323
A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.

122
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,846
Who couldn't relate to that?

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,307
Well, not everybody
felt that way.

124
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:51,243
A lot of people really hated the character,
and some of them hated me because of it.

125
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:54,316
I would do interviews, and
people would be mean to me.

126
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:56,317
That just happened to me.

127
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:57,968
Next time you're stuck
for a tweet,

128
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,841
feel free to say what
a jerk Ira Flatow is.

129
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:04,602
Sheldon, the point is
Wil learned to embrace

130
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,196
that part of his life and moved
on to bigger and better things.

131
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:10,552
Yeah, I'm an author now,
I do public speaking,

132
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,964
and I have my own Web series
about board games.

133
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:14,365
Uh...

134
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:16,296
We're trying
to cheer him up, so...

135
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,175
I'm just saying
that there was a time

136
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:25,819
when I thought I would never get
out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

137
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:29,497
But now, it's just one small
part of a pretty great life,

138
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,824
and it's a part that
I'm happy is there.

139
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:34,211
I do see what you're saying.

140
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:35,598
That helps.

141
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:36,766
Good.

142
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,918
Would you two like to stay
and play trains with me?

143
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,738
- Sure.
- Okay.

144
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,205
Oh, great!

145
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,264
Now...

146
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:45,259
I work the controls.

147
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:46,685
I say "All aboard"

148
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:48,706
You sit quietly and watch.

149
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,079
Can I blow the whistle?

150
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,410
You should probably go.

151
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,736
You're gonna brush
your teeth on my couch?

152
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:07,209
No, I'm gonna brush
Cinnamon's teeth.

153
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:11,187
Why bother? She spends half
the time licking her butt.

154
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,468
And the other half licking my face.
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

155
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,689
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm so late.

156
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:22,390
- Did you already have dinner?
- No, we were waiting for you.

157
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,628
Aw, that's so sweet.

158
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:26,056
Yeah. So what do you
feel like making?

159
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,145
Howard, the poor thing
just got home from work.

160
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,779
Let me get you a glass of wine.
I'll cook dinner.

161
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:35,306
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
- Don't be silly.

162
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:37,440
Sit. You look like
you've had a long day.

163
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,930
No, she always looks like that.

164
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:45,253
Because she married an idiot.

165
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:48,736
Thank you, Raj.

166
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:53,449
Please, this is my way of thanking
you for letting me stay here.

167
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:56,513
Now, tell us all about your day.

168
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,916
Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a
meeting 'cause I was stuck in traffic.

169
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:02,205
Well, I keep telling you to put
that traffic app on your phone.

170
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:05,057
Hey, when you got home today
complaining that you felt sick

171
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:07,786
from eating too many jelly beans,
did I tell you how to fix it?

172
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,097
No.

173
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:13,907
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"
and I rubbed your belly.

174
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:20,039
I thought of you the whole time.

175
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,607
All I'm saying is there's
a time to just listen.

176
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:28,696
- Thank you. - There's also a time to
stop eating too many jelly beans.

177
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,674
And it's when you're ten.

178
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,946
Hello, President Siebert.
Thank you for taking my call.

179
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,855
I just wanted you to know
that you can now expect

180
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:43,616
enthusiastic participation from
me regarding my discovery.

181
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:46,183
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No need to thank me.

182
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:48,670
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

183
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:52,197
For your information, I
have nine friends, hmm?

184
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,928
Ten if we include you.

185
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,849
Nine it is.

186
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:04,974
Ah, it's ten. I'll
count Wolowitz.

187
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:07,607
Hello, friend Leonard.

188
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,656
- Hey, you're in a good mood.
- I'm in a great mood.

189
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:13,116
Well, you're about to be
in an even better one.

190
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:15,616
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew for sure, but...

191
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:18,714
I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab

192
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:22,069
and I disproved it. Your
element does not exist!

193
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:25,459
Yeah, but what about the Chinese
research team? They found it.

194
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:29,717
Yeah, it turns out someone added
simulated signals to the data files.

195
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,237
They faked the results.

196
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,894
- Really?
- Yes!

197
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:36,879
Do you know what that means? That means all
of this attention that you hate goes away.

198
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,090
- So no more interviews?
- No, it's all over.

199
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,067
- I can't believe it.
- Well, you're welcome.

200
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:43,774
You robbed me of my
greatest achievement!

201
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:48,526
- What?!
- I'm back down to nine friends!

202
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:52,056
Make it eight-- I'm
sick of Wolowitz, too!

203
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,815
I-I don't understand.

204
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,899
All you've done since you discovered
this stupid element was complain.

205
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,494
I was trying to make you happy!

206
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,978
By taking away my
only claim to fame?

207
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:05,173
Well, if you wanted to make me happy,
you could have told me a joke.

208
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:09,959
Or shown me a cute video of a koala and
an otter becoming unlikely friends.

209
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,103
Oh, there is no
winning with you.

210
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:15,500
And koalas and otters don't
even live near each other!

211
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,223
That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!

212
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,593
Hey! What's with
all the yelling?

213
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:23,537
Leonard disproved my element.

214
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:25,728
Now all the attention
is going to go away.

215
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:27,564
Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!

216
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:30,341
That's it! I'm down
to seven friends.

217
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,705
He's counting hobbits
and superheroes, right?

218
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,659
When I thought the element
was real, I didn't want it.

219
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,641
But now that Leonard
made it not exist,

220
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,697
I want it more than
anything in the world.

221
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:45,535
The-the element never existed. I didn't
take it away, science took it away.

222
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,570
Be mad at science.

223
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,440
Don't you dare use
science against me.

224
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:52,047
Science is my best friend!

225
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,717
Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

226
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:57,194
Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.

227
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,655
- Actually, I get what he's saying.
- Oh, yes! Nine!

228
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,319
Welcome back, buddy.

229
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:05,418
It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,

230
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,662
and then they break up with you and
then you want them more than ever.

231
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:09,672
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

232
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:12,677
But we're ganged up
on you so I agree.

233
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:17,325
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want
me to do, hide the information?

234
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,208
If I don't publish it, it's just a
matter of time before someone else does.

235
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,005
No, no, of course
you have to publish.

236
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,843
That's your responsibility
as a scientist.

237
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,289
Doing otherwise would be unethical.
You have no choice.

238
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:30,610
- Fine, I'll publish.
- Can you believe this guy?

239
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,343
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

240
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:41,650
How do you know
I didn't do them?

241
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,712
Because once, when all the knives were
dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.

242
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:49,473
Good morning, everybody.

243
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,669
I picked up coffee
while I was out.

244
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:54,569
Bernadette, here's your
soy peppermint mocha.

245
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:55,931
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

246
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,831
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry
about your presentation today.

247
00:11:58,855 --> 00:11:59,949
You're gonna be great.

248
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:02,080
Yeah, you're gonna
knock it out of the park.

249
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:04,307
What presentation
do I have today?

250
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:07,067
Just go.

251
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:12,712
He loves you.

252
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,184
What are you doing? Are you
trying to make me look bad?

253
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:18,192
- I'm just being a good house guest. - No,
you're being a better husband than I am.

254
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,189
Doing the dishes, getting coffee,
knowing about her life--

255
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:22,957
who does that?

256
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,524
Oh, come on, I brought
you one, too.

257
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,478
I don't want coffee.

258
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,402
- That's why I got you hot chocolate.
- Give me that.

259
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:33,428
Just stop showing me up.

260
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:35,157
Howard, listen to me.

261
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:36,792
You're a great husband.

262
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:38,955
Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.

263
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:42,290
But it's amazing how far
you've come given that you're

264
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:46,445
an only child raised by
an over-protective mom.

265
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,258
- Um, is this getting weird?
- Hang on.

266
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,045
So, yes.

267
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:02,831
Hey. I just wanted to let you
know that I-I posted my findings.

268
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,266
I saw.

269
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,338
And I just posted a
retraction of my paper.

270
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:10,363
Now the whole scientific
community knows I was wrong.

271
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,827
These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.

272
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:14,162
Not to me.

273
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:17,475
The only other retraction I ever
had to issue was when I was seven

274
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,354
and I conceded that my brother was
the greatest ninja in East Texas.

275
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:25,196
But that was just a ploy to get
my face out of his armpit.

276
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,323
There he is!

277
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:33,720
It's my favorite
superhero-- the Retractor!

278
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,792
Come on, don't give
him a hard time.

279
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:41,331
I'm sorry, Cooper. I retract it.

280
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:46,832
By the way, Hofstadter, nice job
disproving the Chinese team.

281
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:49,852
- It's not a big deal.
- It's a huge deal.

282
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:52,786
Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.

283
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:54,977
Have you ever considered
a career in retail?

284
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:58,185
That way you could take
things back for a living.

285
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:02,491
- Okay, Barry, that's enough.
- Oh, no, that's okay.

286
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:07,399
I can fight my own battles.
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

287
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,430
Is...?

288
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:14,072
Is that a reference to
my speech impediment?

289
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,219
That's pretty hurtful.

290
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,288
I...

291
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,442
I can't control it.

292
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,389
You're right, That
was uncalled for.

293
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:27,201
I take it back.

294
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,982
Of course you do. Because
you're the Retractor!

295
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,597
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

296
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,949
If you're here much longer, I'm
gonna have to buy bigger clothes.

297
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:43,693
Nonsense. You need a little fattening up.
You've been looking too skinny lately.

298
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:45,158
Aw.

299
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:47,560
Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?

300
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,624
What are you talking about?

301
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:51,372
Remember last week, when I asked you if
you were wearing Spanx and you weren't?

302
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:53,235
How's that different?

303
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,953
Maybe you could try being more
thoughtful, like your friend Raj.

304
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,835
Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.

305
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,348
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

306
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,993
He packed me
a lunch this morning.

307
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,622
And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get 'em".

308
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:11,335
Like I don't do enough around here.
Now I need to pack your lunch?

309
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:13,027
And by the way, why do you
need a note telling you

310
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,984
to "go get 'em"? You're a grown man!
You should know to "go get 'em"!

311
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,102
I do know to "go get 'em"

312
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,422
but sometimes it's nice to have emotional
support when I'm going and getting them!

313
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
Hey, hey, do you
hear yourselves?

314
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,701
Let's just, you know, all calm
down and take a step back.

315
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:32,003
- This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
- I don't know.

316
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:35,429
I guess I was just feeling
like I'm a lousy husband.

317
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,408
You're not a lousy husband.
You're a great husband.

318
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,699
I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.

319
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:42,795
Are you kidding?
You're the best.

320
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,516
I know what the problem is.
It's him!

321
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,684
Oh, what did I do?

322
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,554
You made us feel like we're
not trying hard enough.

323
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:54,594
Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing
our marriage till you showed up.

324
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,550
Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,

325
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,302
but I just have to say it's nice to
see the two of you on the same page.

326
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:04,167
Oh, it does feel good to have
you backing me up for once.

327
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,084
- I back you up all the time!
- That is not...

328
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:08,312
- He's doing it again!
- What is wrong with you?!

329
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,325
I can't believe
they kicked you out.

330
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,517
I can't believe they're
still married.

331
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:19,579
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.

332
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,456
I guess you're sharing
with Daddy again.

333
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:29,775
Bark once if you need
me to call PETA.

334
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,740
What's that animal doing
in our apartment?

335
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:37,185
Oh, relax, she's in her crate.
She can't get out.

336
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,021
I have two words for you:

337
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,842
<i>Jurassic Park.</i>

338
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,258
This day just keeps
getting worse and worse.

339
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,431
- You know, if it makes you feel
any better... - It probably won't.

340
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,020
You're probably right.

341
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:51,138
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

342
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,282
Why don't you and I go for
a nice walk together?

343
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:56,362
Oh, everything is just
sex with you isn't it?

344
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:00,908
Sheldon, I think you might find
the support you're looking for,

345
00:17:00,924 --> 00:17:03,954
if you realize that relationships
are a give and take.

346
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:07,169
She can only be there for you
as much as you are for her.

347
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,041
Thank you, Rajesh.

348
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,537
And, Amy, you need to be
patient with Sheldon,

349
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:15,079
instead of pressuring him to
accept intimacy on your terms.

350
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,632
You should probably go.

351
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:27,256
I'm Ira Flatow, and
this is <i>Science Friday.</i>

352
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:29,969
I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

353
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:33,007
who thought he had discovered
a new super-heavy element

354
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:36,561
only to have it disproved by my
next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

355
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,367
Welcome to <i>Science</i> Friday,
gentlemen.

356
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,471
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

357
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:44,264
Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize
for my behavior last week.

358
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,152
It's all right.

359
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:49,169
Now, isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

360
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,629
No.

361
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,327
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

362
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:57,837
Can you walk us through the process
you used to disprove his theory?

363
00:17:57,848 --> 00:18:00,321
- Well...
- I believe I can answer that.

364
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,304
He asked me.

365
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:03,612
Fine.

366
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:06,701
- As I was saying...
- You're telling it wrong. Ira...

367
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,791
to really understand the story here, you
have to start at the very beginning:

368
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,963
A small town in East Texas,

369
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:13,494
- where a young genius named...
- Sheldon...

370
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,286
That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

371
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:18,023
He was bitten by his
neighbor's dog,

372
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:20,120
leading to his first
scientific breakthrough--

373
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,541
the doggie death-ray.

374
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:27,537
Which, sadly, he couldn't build because
Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.

375
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:31,877
I mean, I'd really like to hear it from
Dr. Hofstadter, if it's okay with you.

376
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,434
What a surprise.

377
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:36,343
Did-did you invite me back
just so you could ignore me?

378
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,371
Actually, I didn't invite you.
You came in, you took a seat,

379
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:42,231
and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

380
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,621
Sheldon, this interview is
supposed to be about me.

381
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:50,061
Well, that seems like a snooze.
Even for public radio.

382
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,729
You know, if we did a shot every time
they said something embarrassing,

383
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:56,929
this would be one hell
of a drinking game.

384
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:58,565
A little early for
alcohol, isn't it?

385
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:02,208
You know, I don't just say smart
things about science. I also yodel.

386
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,199
I'll get the vodka.

387
