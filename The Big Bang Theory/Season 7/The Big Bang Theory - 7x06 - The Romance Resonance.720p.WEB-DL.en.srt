1
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:06,616
- What are you working on?
- Can't talk. In the zone.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,331
- Do you know what he's doing?
- Could be anything.

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:12,875
Last time he was like this, he figured
out electron transport in graphene.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,839
The time before that, he was
making a list of who's allowed

5
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:17,247
in his tree fort if
fe ever gets one.

6
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:20,605
Still can't believe I
didn't make the cut.

7
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:23,864
Uh, Sheldon, you want
to take a break?

8
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:25,634
- Your food's ready.
- No, no, what are you doing?

9
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,709
He's both happy and quiet.

10
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:31,086
It's like seeing a unicorn and
Bigfoot at the same time.

11
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:36,059
Sorry we're so late.
Bernadette got stuck at work.

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,395
Great news! A raccoon virus just
crossed the species barrier

13
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,651
and now can infect humans!

14
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:44,463
Why is that great news?

15
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:48,729
In the pharmaceutical business, we have
a saying: "Mo' infections, mo' money."

16
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:50,855
Wait!

17
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:53,905
Maybe you want to wash your
little raccoon hands first.

18
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:57,151
Oh, calm down. If I had
it, I'd be dead already.

19
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:02,247
- Guys, listen up.
- Can't listen, zone.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,448
Also don't care.

21
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:07,838
Next week is the anniversary of
my first date with Bernadette.

22
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,771
Really don't care.

23
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:13,354
I want to do something special, and I was
hoping you guys could be a part of it.

24
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:16,385
Aw, what horrible thing are
you trying to make up for?

25
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:19,775
Just putting something in the bank
for what horrible thing I do next.

26
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:21,092
Ah.

27
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:24,048
Look, she's gonna be back any
second, so here's the deal:

28
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:26,960
I'm writing a song, and I was hoping
we could all play it for her together.

29
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,625
- Aw... - Oh, I love that.
- That is so beautiful.

30
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:31,617
Sheldon?

31
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:34,628
When did we get to The

It's really sweet what Howard
wants to do for Bernadette.

43
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:04,973
Yeah.

44
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,567
Hey, how come you've never done anything
romantic to celebrate our first date?

45
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:11,494
Well, for starters, you've
broken up with me so many times,

46
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:14,161
which first date are
we talking about?

47
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:17,400
Ooh, somebody call
the burn ward.

48
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,214
And back to the zone.

49
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:25,448
And besides, I do romantic
things for you all the time.

50
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:27,721
Can you even name one romantic
thing you've done for me?

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,509
- I can name tons.
- Sex doesn't count.

52
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:30,753
Oh.

53
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:33,540
I know, what about
that bed-and-breakfast?

54
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:37,475
- Well, I took you there. All you
did was... - I know what I did.

55
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:41,538
I bet they had to throw
out that rocking chair.

56
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,354
You know, I can be
romantic if I want to.

57
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:46,837
It's fine.

58
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,721
And also not true.

59
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:54,085
Okay, just you wait and see. I'm
gonna romance your freakin' ass off.

60
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,538
That's beautiful. Is
that Shakespeare?

61
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,053
- Sheldon?
- Zone.

62
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:05,148
He'll figure it out when
he falls off the roof.

63
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,808
Sheldon, I know you're in the
zone, but do you want some tea?

64
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:17,727
All right, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but

65
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,484
you haven't spoken in hours and
I'm starting to get worried.

66
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:21,678
Please say something.

67
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,292
Leonard, prepare to be humbled and
weep at the glory of my genius.

68
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:29,986
Nope, it was better before.

69
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,628
Look at it.

70
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,401
I feel like my mind
just made a baby.

71
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,454
And it's beautiful.

72
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,379
It's not like human babies, which
are loud and covered in goop.

73
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:46,952
Holy crap, Sheldon, did you
just figure out a method

74
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,146
for synthesizing a new
stable super-heavy element?

75
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,839
Did I?

76
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,544
Well, that can't be right.

77
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,764
No one's ever done that before.
Except me, because I just did it!

78
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:58,799
♪ Sheldon and his brain-- yeah! ♪

83
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:11,130
So I'm almost done writing
the song for Bernadette.

84
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:12,623
Are you cool playing the cello?

85
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,204
If by "cool" you mean
"willing to," yes.

86
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,254
If by "cool" you mean "cool," clearly
you've never seen me play the cello.

87
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,738
Great. Will you
play the ukulele?

88
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,902
Of course. I'd be happy
to shred it on my ax.

89
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:29,068
Or you could just play
your tiny, ridiculous guitar.

90
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,635
Fine. I will melt her heart.

91
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:37,055
And her face!

92
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,474
Gentlemen.

93
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,852
Uh, no doubt you heard about
my little breakthrough.

94
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,093
Now, if your plan is to
hoist me on your shoulders

95
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:48,648
and carry me around the
cafeteria, please refrain.

96
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,949
I don't care for
heights, motion sickness

97
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:53,751
or the thought of your necks
touching my buttocks.

98
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,171
Seriously,
congratulations, Sheldon.

99
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:58,666
Yeah, I read your paper online.

100
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:01,485
That technique for creating
a new heavy element is inspired.

101
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,291
Oh, well, thank you.
Believe it or not,

102
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,736
I just learned
a Chinese research team

103
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:09,380
at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear
Physics ran a test on a cyclotron,

104
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,463
and the results were
extremely promising.

105
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,067
Sheldon, that's incredible.

106
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:17,559
Yeah, I know! They called it the greatest
thing since the Communist party.

107
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,463
Although I'm pretty sure that the
Communist party made them say that.

108
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:26,624
I like China. See, they know
how to keep people in line.

109
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:29,420
So, what happens next?

110
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:32,248
Oh, more testing, more
success, more fame.

111
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,255
But don't worry,

112
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:38,026
I will remain the same down-to-earth
humble Joe I've always been.

113
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:39,841
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

114
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,906
Now give me that cookie;
I discovered an element.

115
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,585
Thank you so much for coming.

116
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:48,647
You called the right person.

117
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:51,452
I believe I have the perfect romantic
evening for you to give Leonard.

118
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,776
Okay, good, 'cause I've been
really struggling with this.

119
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:57,871
As I'm sure you're aware, the quickest
way to a man's heart is through his...

120
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,511
Pants, but Leonard says
sex doesn't count.

121
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,619
Oh. You poor thing.

122
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:06,515
You have one arrow in your quiver,
and you just can't use it.

123
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:12,808
Fortunately, another pathway to a
man's heart is through his stomach.

124
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,516
I don't know if I want to cook for
him; he's kind of a picky eater.

125
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:21,482
I mean, "It's too salty. It's too dry. It's
too burnt and frozen at the same time."

126
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,778
Wait, come on, what else would
sweep you off your feet?

127
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:28,347
Well, I've always had this
fantasy that involves dancing.

128
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:33,475
The sexual chemistry between
my partner and me is electric.

129
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:35,982
But boy, oh, boy, does
my father not approve

130
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:38,890
until he sees us in the
big dance competition.

131
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:42,495
Okay, that's just the
plot for <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

132
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:48,152
What else would you love? Other than
being lifted over Patrick Swayze's head.

133
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:54,088
Oh! Oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside
his window with a boom box in the air.

134
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:58,385
That's from <i>Say Anything.</i>

135
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,754
Look, I'm a lonely guy;
I watch a lot of movies.

136
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,410
Look, Penny, if you
truly want to be romantic,

137
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,629
it needs to come from you.

138
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:10,234
I get that, but why
is this so hard?

139
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,284
Well, you've probably never
had to do this stuff

140
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,262
'cause you're young and beautiful and men
have always thrown themselves at you.

141
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:16,532
Hmm.

142
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,214
Yeah, I'm trying to be sad about that.
I can't.

143
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:26,658
Let's see, what's next?

144
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,802
Okay! Here.

145
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:32,196
This is the Magic Marker I was
using when I made the discovery.

146
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,333
I don't think the Smithsonian's
gonna want your marker.

147
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:39,368
And that's why you're not
on a list for my tree fort.

148
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:47,422
Ooh, guess who's getting an article
written about him in <i>Physics Today?</i>

149
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:52,317
I'll give you a hint. You measured the
diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.

150
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,547
- Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.
- Well, you should be.

151
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,758
My discovery is
spreading like wildfire.

152
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:02,683
Unlike my mole, which is holding
steady at the size of a navy bean.

153
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:05,330
What's next?

154
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:09,603
This is the very copy of <i>The
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</i>

155
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,032
in which I looked up the reaction
rates of mendelevium and...

156
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:17,336
- And what?
- No.

157
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,763
No, no, no, no.

158
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:21,678
What's wrong?

159
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,000
I've made a horrible mistake.

160
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,381
What are you talking about?

161
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,068
This table-- it's in
square centimeters.

162
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,916
I read it as square meters.

163
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,414
You know what that means?

164
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,911
That Americans can't
handle the metric system?

165
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:40,778
Amy, I was off by
a factor of 10,000.

166
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,067
But the Chinese team
found the element.

167
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:46,023
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.
My calculations were wrong.

168
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,171
There must be some resonance between
the elements I didn't know about.

169
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,668
So you just got lucky?

170
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,292
Sheldon Cooper
does not get lucky!

171
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,250
You and me both, brother.

172
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,514
It doesn't matter. The element was found
because of you, and that's groundbreaking.

173
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:05,430
What matters is the greatest
scientific achievement

174
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,677
of my life is
based on a blunder.

175
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,654
I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.

176
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,028
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

177
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,397
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

178
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,938
- that we thought was someplace else.
- Oh, great.

179
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:19,905
Now I'm worse than a fraud.

180
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:22,159
I'm practically a biologist.

181
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:31,314
You got to stop beating
yourself up over this.

182
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,964
I mean, you made a mistake,
but it was a happy mistake.

183
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:35,878
There's nothing happy about it.

184
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,025
I'm being given credit
that I don't deserve.

185
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,142
Oh, people get things they
don't deserve all the time.

186
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:43,394
Look at me with you.

187
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:47,058
No, Leonard, this is going to
haunt me for the rest of my life.

188
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:51,521
Every science classroom, every
periodic table, every textbook--

189
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,395
this mistake will be
staring back at me

190
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:57,960
Like that time you let
Koothrappali wax your eyebrows.

191
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:02,487
I've got to find a way
to stop this thing.

192
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:06,251
Buddy, I don't think you can. I mean,
once it's out there, it's out there.

193
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:10,004
This thing is like the science
equivalent of a sex tape.

194
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:12,985
You know, frankly,
I'd prefer a sex tape.

195
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,510
- You don't know what a sex
tape is, do you? - No.

196
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,326
Make sure you guys get
to the restaurant by 8:00.

197
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,033
Bernadette's meeting me there at 8:30
and I don't want to blow the surprise.

198
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:24,877
- We'll be there.
- Got it.

199
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,367
Now, uh, I have a
question about the song.

200
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:31,186
I was thinking at some point I
could bust out a little rap.

201
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:35,457
N-N-N-No...

202
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:41,066
Come on, come on, you
haven't even heard it yet.

203
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,843
Leonard, give me a beat.

204
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:44,514
I will not.

205
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,533
- Please?
- No, I want this to be romantic.

206
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:51,219
It will be! I don't
call anyone a ho,

207
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:55,446
and the only time I use the phrase
"my bitch," I'm referring to you.

208
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,404
There he is!

209
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,859
Stop it. Stop celebrating me!

210
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:05,402
Woo!

211
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:07,329
And no woos!

212
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,808
Oh, not you, Dr. Woo.
You're fine.

213
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:17,106
I want you all to know that you
have no reason to applaud me.

214
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:20,487
My so-called breakthrough
wasn't the result of my genius.

215
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:23,073
It was nothing more than
a boneheaded mistake.

216
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:26,817
So please refrain from praising
me for it in the future.

217
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:29,352
Wh... I don't understand.
They didn't find the element?

218
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:31,320
Oh, no, they found the element.

219
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,792
No, no, stop it!

220
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:36,908
I don't need to take this admiration
from the likes of you people!

221
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:39,878
How do I make them
stop loving me?

222
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,031
Invite them to live with us.

223
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,961
Boy, Bernadette is
gonna love this.

224
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:51,658
Yeah. It must be nice to have
someone do something so romantic.

225
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:55,726
Okay, you know what's not romantic?
Rubbing it in someone's face.

226
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:59,199
Actually, it can be, but I
told you sex doesn't count.

227
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:05,616
I'm getting worried about Bernadette.
I'm gonna call and check on her.

228
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:09,652
The National Science Foundation wants
to give me a substantial grant.

229
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:11,814
- Oh, that's a big deal.
- I know.

230
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,999
When will this nightmare end?

231
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,470
Hey, I get that you feel bad about
all the attention, but still,

232
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:20,375
what you did is amazing.
We're really proud of you.

233
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:21,670
I'm not.

234
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,919
You're not?

235
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:27,637
Sheldon, I've been thinking
about it, and you're right.

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,545
You don't deserve any credit.

237
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,410
All you did was misread
some numbers on a table.

238
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:34,447
A very easy table, too.

239
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:36,051
Honestly,

240
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:38,076
I'm embarrassed for you.

241
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:41,885
That's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

242
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,543
Damn it, everyone's
better at this than me.

243
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,099
Congratulations, Dr. Fowler.

244
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:51,157
You just made the fort.

245
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:56,469
Guys, there w-was
an accident at Bernie's lab.

246
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:57,672
Oh, my God, is she okay?

247
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:00,226
Yeah, but she's at the
hospital in quarantine.

248
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,011
- What? - Poor Bernadette.
- Oh, no.

249
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,108
I hate to pile on the bad
news, but I just got a raise.

250
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,452
Oh, my God, Bernie,
what happened?

251
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:18,929
Well, let's just say
the next time you move

252
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:22,983
a dozen vials of raccoon virus
to the fridge, make two trips.

253
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,741
- You're sure you're okay?
- Yeah, it's just a precaution.

254
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:31,437
If there was a problem, I'd be
throwing up out of my eyeballs by now.

255
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,784
- Sorry I messed up our date.
- No, don't worry about it.

256
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,728
I brought the date here.
Guys, come on in.

257
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:41,536
What's all this?

258
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,872
Well, tonight is the
anniversary of our first date,

259
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:48,617
and I wanted to celebrate it
by writing a song for you.

260
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:50,038
Howie.

261
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,379
Sheldon, get over here!

262
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:54,892
She might be contagious.

263
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:58,007
Don't you think I'm having
a rough enough day?

264
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,272

Howie, that was amazing!

313
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,149
Look, I'm shaking.

314
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,123
She's sick, I knew it. Bye!

315
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,990
I have to say, this is the best
Top Ramen you've ever made.

316
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:47,696
I discovered a
secret ingredient:

317
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,526
the flavor packet.

318
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:52,943
That sucker is well named.

319
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:56,714
All right, lover boy.

320
00:16:56,732 --> 00:17:00,425
Get ready, 'cause there is a crap
storm of romance coming your way.

321
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,542
Stop it, you're
gonna make me cry.

322
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,036
All right. You seem
pretty confident.

323
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,626
Oh, I am.

324
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,044
Maybe if you follow this trail,

325
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,599
you'll see why.

326
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:16,940
Oh, rose petals.

327
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,808
Yes.

328
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:21,475
The most beautiful and shockingly
expensive of all the flowers.

329
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:27,656
You made the bed? You really
are pulling out all the stops.

330
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:31,138
Okay, I gave this
a lot of thought,

331
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,047
and I finally found something to
show you how much I love you.

332
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:41,622
Oh, wow.

333
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:44,858
It's a first edition of
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</i>

334
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:47,488
I remember it was
your favorite book growing up.

335
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,998
This is great.

336
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:53,282
It... thank you. It's...
so much.

337
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:55,383
What?

338
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,534
- Nothing. I love it.
- No.

339
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,272
Something's going on.
What's wrong with it?

340
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:02,232
I remember you saying how great it
would be to have a first edition.

341
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,322
It's true, I-I did.
I did say that...

342
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:08,004
when we were at the used
bookstore together

343
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,702
and I saw the first
edition and I bought it.

344
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,514
Oh, my God, I am the worst!

345
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,180
No, no, it's okay.
It's really thoughtful.

346
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:19,549
No, it's not! I mean...

347
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:23,386
What's thoughtful is
everything you do.

348
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:27,082
Here, you know what?
Look at this.

349
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:30,901
Look, here's the... the
plane ticket you bought me

350
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,849
when I was too poor to go
home for the holidays. And...

351
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:36,251
the rose you left
on my windshield...

352
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,869
just because.

353
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:42,648
Here's the-the thank-you letter you wrote
me after the first time I slept with you.

354
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,076
All 11 pages of it.

355
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:51,190
Can't believe you
saved all this stuff.

356
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,589
Of course I did. It's you.

357
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,758
Come here.

358
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,083
Oh.

359
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,999
Is that a pregnancy test?

360
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,050
Oh, yeah, just the first one.
I didn't save them all.

361
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,501
I can't believe I read
this table wrong.

362
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:19,462
I blame you.

363
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:24,366
- Me? What did I do?
- You distract me.

364
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,233
I've been distracted since
the moment I met you.

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,235
- Sorry.
- Well, you should be.

366
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:34,987
Because all I can think about
is how much I want to kiss you.

367
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:40,797
And not just on the
cheek, but on the mouth.

368
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,284
Like mommies and daddies do.

369
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,852
Oh, Sheldon.

370
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:57,867
<i>Amy?</i>

371
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:01,958
Amy.

372
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:03,983
Did you hear what I said?

373
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:05,536
Can't talk, in the zone.

374
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:14,433
