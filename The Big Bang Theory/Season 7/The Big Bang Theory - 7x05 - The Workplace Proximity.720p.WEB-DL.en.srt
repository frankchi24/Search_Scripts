1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,173
Awkward silence.
Sheldon on his phone.

2
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:12,117
No touching. Somebody's
having date night.

3
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:14,741
It's actually steamier
than it looks.

4
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:17,627
Sheldon's looking up the phallic
symbolism of root vegetables

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,358
in Renaissance paintings.

6
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,554
Oh, no, I got bored with that.

7
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:25,024
I'm just browsing cuticle
scissors on Amazon.

8
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:29,369
How do you not tear off his clothes and
take him right here on this table?

9
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:32,962
If you do that, I'll scream.

10
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,035
Sheldon, I have some
exciting news to tell you.

11
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:39,206
That makes two of us.

12
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:42,485
My new cuticle scissors will be
here in one to two business days.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,849
Come on, one.

14
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:47,712
I've been invited to
consult on an experiment

15
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:49,674
at your university
for a few months.

16
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:52,381
Isn't that great? We could
have lunch together.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,979
We could carpool.

18
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:57,987
You know, riding with Leonard has
gotten a little tedious lately.

19
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:01,681
Th-The only car game he ever
wants to play is the Quiet Game.

20
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:05,054
And he's terrible at it.
I always win.

21
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,904
- So, you're okay with this?
- Well, why wouldn't I be?

22
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:14,131
Well, this project would have us working
in close proximity to one another.

23
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:18,572
And there's the vulgar adage that one
should not defecate where one eats.

24
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,712
My father used to say
that all the time.

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,956
That and, um, "Who does one have to orally
gratify to get a drink around here?"

26
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,267
But what does that have to do with
you working at the university?

27
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,903
Sheldon, "Don't defecate
where you eat,"

28
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:39,603
means don't have a romantic
relationship in the workplace.

29
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:42,077
Really?

30
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,741
Yes.

31
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,881
Huh. Yeah, I always
took it literally.

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,135
That's why I have never once moved
my bowels in this or any restaurant.

33
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,381
Hmm.

34
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,724
I'm relieved that you don't have a
problem with us working together.

35
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,053
Not as relieved as
I'm about to be.

36
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:07,053
It's a brave new
world, little lady.

47
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:38,407
Are you crazy? You don't want
your girlfriend at work with you.

48
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,059
Hell Clam.

49
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,575
Why not?

50
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,394
Hairy Fairy.

51
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:48,904
I think it could be romantic. You know,
my parents met at his place of work.

52
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:51,426
Your father's a gynecologist.

53
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:55,870
I know. What started as a pap
smear turned into a date.

54
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,309
Which turned into her working
there, which turned into marriage,

55
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:02,476
which then turned into hatred,
which continues to this day.

56
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,443
Two-Eyed Cyclops.

57
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:08,471
Would you please tell him
this isn't a good idea?

58
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:09,924
No, no, I think it'll be great.

59
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,905
Maybe next time he gets
conjunctivitis at work,

60
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,948
she can hold his head and try
to put the drops in his eyes.

61
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:17,441
Giant baby.

62
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,445
That's a Raging Ogre.

63
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,266
Yeah, I know.

64
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,651
I'm just saying, I'd never want
to work with Bernadette.

65
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,347
Can you imagine seeing
someone all day long

66
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,670
and then you're supposed to hang
out with them after work, too?

67
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,350
Hold on. We do
that all the time.

68
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:35,176
You and I work together
and play together.

69
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,504
Yeah, I know, and it drove me
into the arms of another woman.

70
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,430
Bipolar Bear.

71
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,813
Well, I appreciate your concern,

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,833
but I won't be seeing any more
of Amy than I already do.

73
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:51,152
I assume we'll deduct any
extra time we spend together

74
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,579
at work from our weekly quota.

75
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:58,267
Please let me be there
when you tell her that.

76
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:03,618
Why? So you can see the look on Amy's
face when she hears my top-notch idea?

77
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,656
Please, oh, please,
just let me be there.

78
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,852
So, Amy, what are you gonna
be working on at Caltech?

79
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:15,502
I'm leading a study to see if deficiency
of the monoamine oxidase enzyme

80
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,665
leads to paralyzing
fear in monkeys.

81
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:20,796
Oh. If they're anything like
humans, the answer's yes.

82
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,810
Wait, you've-you've done
this experiment on humans?

83
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,268
You mean like death row
inmates with nothing to lose?

84
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,556
No, that would be unethical.

85
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,382
You know, not a lot of people know
this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme

86
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,768
was discovered by a
woman, Mary Bernheim.

87
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:42,210
That's right. My phone is
just as smart as you guys.

88
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,642
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

89
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:47,341
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

90
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:49,500
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

91
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:52,159
He's never gonna
stop doing that, is he?

92
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,241
I don't mind.

93
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,599
I'm hoping to put his love of
repetition to good use someday.

94
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,016
Hi. Um...

95
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:03,990
I've reconsidered. Uh, you
can't work where I work.

96
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,555
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

97
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,810
Sheldon.

98
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,303
I-I already signed the contract.
I cashed a check.

99
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,665
Mmm...

100
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,501
you are not going to come
out of this looking good.

101
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,471
Sheldon, I don't understand. I thought
you said you were fine with it.

102
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,516
Well, I was.

103
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,374
But that was before
Howard explained to me

104
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:23,874
how awful it would be if he had to
work with his significant other.

105
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,247
He said what?

106
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:28,389
Now, don't be insulted.

107
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:32,366
He just thinks too much of you
would be mind-numbingly tedious.

108
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,152
Excuse me, I need to have
a chat with my husband.

109
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:37,830
Yeah, well, now, well...
keep it short.

110
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,884
Fr-From what I gather,
brevity is your friend.

111
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,377
So, are we good here?

112
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:47,514
No, we're not good here. I
am working on this project.

113
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,404
Yeah, and you can't tell her
what she can and cannot do.

114
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:54,159
Last week, you told Leonard he couldn't
wear his Wookiee jacket out in public.

115
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:55,874
That's different.

116
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:59,044
I'm not going to the mall with
someone dressed dumb space bear.

117
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,371
Sheldon, you don't have to worry
about me bothering you.

118
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:06,767
I'll be in a different building. And we
don't even have to have lunch together.

119
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:08,699
- Really?
- Yes.

120
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,542
Before all things,
I'm a scientist.

121
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,631
I'm just there to do my work
and, with a little luck,

122
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,301
scare the living crap
out of some monkeys.

123
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:18,002
Hmm.

124
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,441
You sure your mothlike personality won't be
drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?

125
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,697
More and more sure.

126
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,477
Well, then, you
have my permission.

127
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:35,274
- I didn't ask for your permission.
- Too late. No backsies.

128
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:40,207
No, no, listen to me.
Sheldon misunderstood.

129
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,107
What I meant was, if
we worked together,

130
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,141
there'd be too much of me for
you, not the other way around.

131
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,700
Howard, if you're going
to lie to your wife,

132
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:51,717
don't start the sentence with
"Sheldon misunderstood."

133
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:53,956
That's a dead giveaway.

134
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,775
- Well?
- Okay, fine.

135
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:58,229
I did say that, and
I think it's true.

136
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:02,279
I think if we worked together and lived
together, we'd get sick of each other.

137
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,899
Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the
part about him getting sick of you.

138
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:06,813
For the love of God, why?!

139
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,874
What exactly do you
think you'd get sick of?

140
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:17,744
His only options here are to fake a
heart attack or have a real one.

141
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:21,110
It-it's nothing
in particular. I...

142
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:23,676
Is it my voice? Am I too bossy?

143
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,883
What...?

144
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,242
My arm is feeling numb.

145
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:31,274
Nailed it.

146
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:35,414
That's the wrong arm for
a heart attack, doofus.

147
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:40,589
My point is, I'm sure
there are things about me

148
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:44,294
that would drive you crazy if you
had to deal with them all day long.

149
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,434
Like looking me in the
eye and lying to me?

150
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:47,988
Oh, well, come on, I just...

151
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:51,049
Where am I supposed to
look when I lie to you?

152
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:55,297
- Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
- Oh, Bernie...

153
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,964
If it makes you feel any
better, Amy and I are fine.

154
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,795
I mean, really good.

155
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:16,067
So, boys, how was
the pajama party?

156
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,102
You guys jump on the bed and
sing into hair brushes?

157
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:24,348
It wasn't a pajama party. It was just a
couple of bros hanging out, giggling,

158
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:27,126
eating cookie dough and
watching <i>Princess Bride.</i>

159
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,763
Please, stop talking.

160
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,740
As you wish.

161
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,765
I mean, you know, Sheldon,
none of this would've happened

162
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,455
if I hadn't tried to help you.

163
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:46,084
Uh, it also wouldn't have happened
if, in the early universe,

164
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,254
hydrogen was a little more
common or a little less common.

165
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,780
This is fun. Your turn.

166
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:54,606
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Amy.

167
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:55,943
Hello.

168
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:57,754
That was kind of icy.

169
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,155
You two okay?

170
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,169
Oh, we're fine.

171
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:04,030
As Howard advised, she's merely
respecting our professional boundaries.

172
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:04,893
Smart.

173
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:09,238
Take relationship advice from a man who
spent last night braiding Raj's hair.

174
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,226
Yeah, you make a good point.

175
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,372
It would appear I was
worried for nothing.

176
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:20,233
Look at her, desperately wishing she
was over here at the cool table.

177
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:26,462
Don't worry, little moth.
The flame will come to you.

178
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:32,135
Oh, uh... on the off chance that
Bernadette doesn't call back

179
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,584
and apologize, how do you feel about
Mexican food for dinner tonight?

180
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:37,652
I-I don't know.
Sounds kind of heavy.

181
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,882
That's 'cause you always
fill up on chips.

182
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,271
And this is Dr. Gunderson
from Stockholm.

183
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,798
Ah, Sweden.

184
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:49,384
Yeah, home of my favorite Muppet
and, uh, second favorite meatball.

185
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:57,565
Okay, the Nordic reputation for
lack of humor is well-founded.

186
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:01,363
Boy, is his name Gunderson
or No-Funderson?

187
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,920
Where are we going
with this, Dr. Cooper?

188
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,645
Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend.
You call me Sheldon.

189
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:12,168
That's right,
I am in a boy-girl relationship

190
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:14,366
with this cute
little lump of wool.

191
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:17,729
- Sheldon...
- It's a physical relationship, too.

192
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:21,101
Hand-holding, hugging...
even on hot days.

193
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:23,342
Ow.

194
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:26,934
Okay, here's a new one.
Apparently now we kick each other

195
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:28,796
in the shin under the table.

196
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:32,601
How do you like it
when I do it to you?

197
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,780
Not so much, huh?

198
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:48,032
Test subject D7,

199
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:50,808
aka Betsy, fear response study.

200
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:54,740
Image number one: Frenchman on
bicycle carrying baguettes.

201
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,410
No visible reaction.

202
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,102
Image number two: sousaphone.

203
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:06,985
Still no reaction.

204
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,032
Okay.

205
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:09,441
Let's kick things up a notch.

206
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:12,342
Image number three: crocodile
with a mouthful of monkeys.

207
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,144
Okay, now we're talking.

208
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,266
Dr. Fowler?

209
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:23,383
What do you want, Sheldon?

210
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:25,308
Well, I'm done with work, so...

211
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,570
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

212
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,278
Sorry. Uh...

213
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:33,805
- Better?
- Oh, baguettes.

214
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,798
Yes, I like baguettes.

215
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:38,138
What exactly are you doing?

216
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,805
Determining baseline fear levels
in capuchin monkeys

217
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,091
by measuring their response
to visual stimuli.

218
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,061
So, goofing off.

219
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:49,957
As I was saying, I'm done
with work and Leonard's not.

220
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,649
So good news, you get
to take me home.

221
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,669
Play your cards right,
I'll let you drive me

222
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,476
past the lot where the
buses park at night.

223
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,043
I can't leave now, Sheldon.
I'm very busy.

224
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,681
Besides, why would I
want to do you a favor

225
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:04,708
after the way you treated
me in the cafeteria?

226
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,554
Image number four:
boa constrictor.

227
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:14,313
What on earth
are you talking about?

228
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,494
My behavior in the
cafeteria was delightful.

229
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,605
Maybe your friend
Gunderson needs

230
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:23,434
to head over to IKEA and
assemble a sense of humor.

231
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:28,565
You embarrassed me in front of my
colleagues on my first day here.

232
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:31,447
Image number five:
kitten in a teacup.

233
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:33,822
Oh.

234
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:40,208
- Oh... embarrassed you?
- You know what?

235
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,715
I don't have time for this.
Find another way home.

236
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,455
I'm starting to get the sense
that you're angry with me.

237
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,867
- Really? What tipped you off?
- Couple things, actually.

238
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,370
Your tone of voice,
your body language...

239
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:51,579
- Get out.
- Well, now, that.

240
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:55,561
Image number six:
woman giving birth.

241
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,523
It's 9:00. Where you been?

242
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,713
Oh, I had to take the bus home.

243
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:12,494
Fell asleep and missed my stop.

244
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,631
Oh, no.

245
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:18,337
Did you know that Los Angeles
has a Little Sri Lanka?

246
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:23,193
- I did not.
- Well, I do... now.

247
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,795
They're a lovely people.

248
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,390
Although terrifying when you
wake up face-to-face with them.

249
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,629
If you're hungry, I brought home
some mutton and coconut milk.

250
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,701
Why'd you get that?
You hate lamb.

251
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,142
I was asking for directions.

252
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:41,308
Apparently, there was
a communication problem.

253
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,239
I thought Amy was gonna
drive you home.

254
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:48,120
Yeah, I thought so, too, but
she's acting very strangely.

255
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:51,389
I was discussing it with a Sri
Lankan fellow on the bus,

256
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:56,462
and he hypothesized that a tiger may
have recently run across her shadow.

257
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:00,844
Although he may have just been
trying to drum up business

258
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,892
for his brother-in-law's
witch doctor practice.

259
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:09,223
Okay, Sheldon, what happened
between you and Amy?

260
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:13,085
Well, can you believe she
said I embarrassed her?

261
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:14,690
Yeah.

262
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,867
But you didn't
even hear the details.

263
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,149
Sheldon...

264
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,918
I've known you a long time,

265
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:28,475
and I'm going to tell you this with
all the love I can possibly muster.

266
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:31,823
Amy's right. You're wrong.

267
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:35,222
- But you don't even know...
- Doesn't matter.

268
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,999
- But, now, but in my defense...
- Doesn't matter.

269
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,806
You're not listening
to my side of it.

270
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:42,496
Okay, fine, Sheldon.
What is your side?

271
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,668
- Well...
- Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.

272
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:54,173
Shrimp was spicy.

273
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,758
- You want a TUMS?
- You got the tropical fruit kind?

274
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,464
No, if I buy those, I just
go through them like candy.

275
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:03,447
Tell me about it. One time, I swear
I pooped out a stick of chalk.

276
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:07,266
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

277
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,971
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

278
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,875
I may have overreacted.

279
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:17,928
Yeah, well, I didn't handle
it so great, either.

280
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,274
It's just sometimes I feel
like you enjoy spending time

281
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,026
with your friends
more than with me.

282
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:24,142
- That's not true.
- It's not?

283
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:25,858
You spend all day
together at work,

284
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:27,807
and then you all hang out
at night playing games,

285
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,468
going to the comic book store.

286
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,125
Last week, you two got
a couples massage.

287
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:38,002
So, when you said you wouldn't want
to spend that much time with me,

288
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,070
it really hurt my feelings.

289
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:44,544
Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that.
I'm so sorry.

290
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:46,982
Starting tomorrow, I am
turning over a new leaf.

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,842
Time with you is my
number one priority.

292
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,240
Why tomorrow?

293
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:59,533
Well, we're real close to finishing
off the new Batman game.

294
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:03,589
It is awesome.

295
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,638
Uh, you should probably
go after her.

296
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,646
- Should I go after you?
- No!

297
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:16,430
Thanks for getting
me in trouble.

298
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:21,154
Amy.

299
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:22,598
Amy.

300
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,470
Amy.

301
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:29,274
Sheldon, what are you
doing here so late?

302
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:33,985
I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking
about what happened earlier between us.

303
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,142
Also, I had one
heck of a bus nap.

304
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:42,634
Oh, speaking of which, do you want
some mutton and coconut milk?

305
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:43,929
No.

306
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,178
Well, I cannot give
this stuff away.

307
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,360
What do you want?

308
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,918
Amy, this isn't easy to say.

309
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,323
All relationships are difficult,

310
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:01,953
but even more so when you're in
one with a person who struggles

311
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:04,366
with everyday
social interactions.

312
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:05,418
And frankly...

313
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:09,630
who can strike some people
as being kind of a weirdo.

314
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,806
Sheldon...

315
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,685
you're not a weirdo.

316
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,504
I wasn't speaking about me.

317
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:22,510
I mean, honestly, there's no
telling what will set you off.

318
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:25,287
You know, introducing
myself as your boyfriend.

319
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,849
Giving you the opportunity
to drive me home.

320
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:33,237
Breaking the ice with your colleagues using
ethnic humor, the funniest kind of humor.

321
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,173
What's your point?

322
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:38,868
My point is, we're a couple.

323
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,172
And...

324
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,542
I like you for who you are.

325
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,899
Quirks and all.

326
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:49,850
- I like you, too.
- Well, I should hope so.

327
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:54,966
I don't see anyone else banging on this
door to put up with your nonsense.

328
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,178
Not even a good-bye?

329
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:05,296
You see, that's the kind of thing
that makes people think you're weird.

330
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,802
Poor kid.

331
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,825
She just doesn't see it.

332
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,814
I'm not apologizing to Howard.
He can come beg me on his knees.

333
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,695
Sheldon, too. If I see him at work,
I'm just going to ignore him.

334
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:23,363
All right, don't worry.
I talked to Leonard.

335
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:26,294
He is gonna sit the guys
down and set them straight.

336
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,434
Laser's warmed up.

337
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,050
Pull!
