1
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:04,790
<i>Advantage left-side competitor.</i>

2
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:08,770
Wow, you're really
good at this.

3
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:11,720
Well, I have an extremely
low center of gravity.

4
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,539
I'm like a pyramid.

5
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:21,724
- How you doing over there?
- Oh, I hope it's just a sprain.

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,498
I cannot walk into that E.R.
with another video game injury.

7
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,973
Hey, Sheldon, you
want to play next?

8
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:32,933
Oh, I would, but
I'm on my way out.

9
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,467
- Where?
- Texas.

10
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,461
Right now? Why?

11
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,227
- Is someone sick?
- Yes.

12
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,830
My sister's uterus
came down with a baby.

13
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:46,595
Oh, she's pregnant?
That's great.

14
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:48,509
You're gone an uncle--
Uncle Sheldon.

15
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,642
No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.

16
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,449
How come you never said
she was pregnant?

17
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,707
Well, I never told you about
my brother's kidney stone.

18
00:00:56,734 --> 00:01:00,078
You want to hear about everything that
comes out of my family's genitals?

19
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:03,685
Well, congrats, and it's nice you're
gonna be there for your sister.

20
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:06,562
Yes. I'm filling in for her
husband who's recovering

21
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:08,945
from a horrible
motorcycle accident.

22
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:10,904
Lucky duck.

23
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:13,235
Wow, so, how long
will you be gone?

24
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,577
Well, she's due tomorrow.

25
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:19,728
Although it did take her six years
to finish high school, so who knows?

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,236
Can I give you a
ride to the airport?

27
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:24,510
Oh, no, thank you, I don't
want to be an inconvenience.

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,213
Chop-chop, Leonard. We

All right, here's the deal.

40
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:59,169
Sheldon is gone, so the tree
decorating rules are out the window.

41
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:04,497
Yeah, which means we don't have to use his
ridiculous ornament-spacing template.

42
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,600
And I'm happy to report its kickstarter
campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.

43
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,875
Ah.

44
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:14,578
Wait, so <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Star Trek
</i> characters can go on the same branch?

45
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,804
I know, it's crazy. Welcome
to the Thunderdome, people!

46
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,553
I've never done this before.
It's kind of fun.

47
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,902
Yeah, if your mom could see her
little Bar Mitzvah boy right now,

48
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:28,386
- she'd have a heart attack.
- Good idea, I'll take a picture.

49
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,693
Honey, I'm a little strapped
for cash this year,

50
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:38,060
so for Christmas I was
thinking of giving you...

51
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:39,865
this.

52
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,288
- I love it.
- Okay.

53
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:45,481
But it is what you
got me last year.

54
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,392
- Yeah.
- And last night.

55
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:52,370
- Hello.
- Hi, Stuart.

56
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,886
Oh, good, I'm glad you guys
didn't wait for me to start.

57
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:58,931
Although you said 7:00 and
it's-it's 7:00, but that's fine.

58
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:03,928
Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

59
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:07,780
Hi, Sheldon. Everybody's
here, say hi.

60
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:09,441
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

61
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,834
- Howdy.
- Hi.

62
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,448
Hello.

63
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:18,317
<i>The second I go out of town you
throw a Christmas party without me?</i>

64
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:19,923
Yeah, kind of.

65
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,923
<i>That's so thoughtful.
You guys are the best.</i>

66
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,911
Hey, how's your sister?

67
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:28,014
<i>She went into labor an hour ago.</i>

68
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:30,209
That's wonderful.
So you're at the hospital?

69
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,794
<i>No, she chose to
have a home birth...</i>

70
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:37,531
<i>because she wants to live in the Stone
Age and a cave wasn't available.</i>

71
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,567
You know, many people believe
that home births are better

72
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:44,328
because the mother is in a
warm, comfortable environment

73
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:46,541
where she can be
nurtured by loved ones.

74
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:50,941
<i>And turn the bedroom floor into
an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.</i>

75
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,561
<i>Shelly, come on!</i>

76
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:58,560
<i>Your sister's fully dilated and
she wants a nice family picture</i>

77
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,269
before there's blood everywhere!

78
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:03,248
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

79
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:06,678
<i>I picked the wrong day to
wear my good robot T-shirt.</i>

80
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:12,239
If you were having Sheldon's baby would
you really want him in the room?

81
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,624
Yeah, if he's in the room
when they're making the baby,

82
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:16,759
I'll give you ten dollars.

83
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:21,037
Hey, I brought over <i>It's a Wonderful
Life</i> if you guys want to watch it later.

84
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:23,283
- Oh, I love that movie.
- I've never seen it.

85
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,383
- Me neither.
- It's great.

86
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,348
It's Christmastime and Jimmy
Stewart's really depressed

87
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:30,231
and he's gonna jump off a
bridge and kill himself...

88
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:32,567
Don't need to see it. Living it.

89
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,110
But then he gets to see what the world
would be like if he'd never been born.

90
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:40,133
Hey, you ever imagine what that
would be like? Not being born?

91
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:41,989
What do you think?

92
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,567
What do you think?

93
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,696
What do you think?

94
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,974
You make jokes about Sheldon,
but if it weren't for him,

95
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,889
I don't think any of us would be
sitting in this room right now.

96
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:58,327
Really? Sheldon not being here is
the main reason I'm in this room.

97
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:01,352
It's true.

98
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:03,133
None of you would know me.

99
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,662
You wouldn't know Bernadette.

100
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,960
- You wouldn't be dating Penny.
- You don't know that.

101
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:10,038
I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory
for years. I could have picked her up.

102
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,436
Oh, you weren't joking.

103
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:17,997
No.

104
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,505
Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly
how that would have gone down.

105
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:26,309
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

106
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:29,248
I'm gonna squirt chocolate
milk out of my nipples.

107
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:34,506
Sorry, I thought we're saying
things that are never gonna happen.

108
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,840
Maybe this time
he's going to do it.

109
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:39,103
Hope you're thirsty,
here it comes.

110
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,721
Watch me.

111
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:46,066
Hey, you guys ready to order
or you need a few minutes?

112
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:49,370
- I, uh, ah, um, I...
- A few minutes it is.

113
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:53,269
You didn't ask her out, but
that was a lot of sounds.

114
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:58,957
- You guys are making me nervous.
- Fine, then go talk to her on your own.

115
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:00,999
I will.

116
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:10,110
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

117
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:13,443
Hi, uh, um, I'm Leonard?

118
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:15,965
Really? You don't sound so sure.

119
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:19,424
No, I am he.

120
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:23,472
Uh, any-anyway, um,

121
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:28,207
there's been something I've wanted
to ask you for a long time. Um...

122
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,704
- What's that?
- Eh, uh, well,

123
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,195
I was wondering--
if you're not too busy--

124
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:36,440
um, uh, if, if you'd
be interested in...

125
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,455
...telling me where
the restroom is?

126
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,387
I think you're too late.

127
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,031
Come on, I would not
have peed my pants.

128
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,806
- She nailed it.
- Sounds about right.

129
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:56,513
But, you forget, I did
ask you out in real life.

130
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:58,939
Which couldn't have happened if you
didn't live across the hall from her,

131
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,806
which couldn't have
happened without Sheldon.

132
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:03,516
Same goes with you guys. If
Leonard wasn't with Penny,

133
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,190
she never would have set you up.

134
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:08,387
Doesn't matter. Bernadette still would've
been working at The Cheesecake Factory,

135
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:11,789
and I still would've been
working this beefcake factory.

136
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,276
- You would've been all over me.
- Well...

137
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,348
- Hey, Penny, can I take that table?
- Sure, why?

138
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:24,470
The one in the
turtleneck is cute.

139
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,954
Open wide, here comes
the happy train.

140
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:34,159
Mm-hmm, chug-a
chug-a, yum, yum.

141
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,177
Oh.

142
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:39,595
Hang on.

143
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,609
You got a... you got
a little something.

144
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,653
Never mind.

145
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:53,940
Oh, man, that is so us.

146
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,503
You know, maybe you and
I wouldn't be together,

147
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,248
but you wouldn't have
done so great yourself.

148
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:05,403
- Why? - Because I know exactly the kind
of guy you would've ended up with.

149
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,456
Hey, babe.

150
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,456
Hey. Did you remember
to pay the rent?

151
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:14,468
Better. I used the money
to buy these magic beans.

152
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:19,129
Hey, he may be an idiot, but at
least he didn't pee himself.

153
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:22,490
Oh, hold on.

154
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:26,190
Aw, babe, I peed myself.

155
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,208
Me, too.

156
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,367
The end.

157
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:46,721
Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?

158
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,863
<i>No, it's not.</i>

159
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,301
<i>I've seen things.</i>

160
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,342
<i>Lady things.</i>

161
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,102
Listen to me.

162
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,373
That is not the way
they usually look.

163
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,369
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

164
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:07,988
<i>This is no way to
make new humans.</i>

165
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:10,316
<i>People coming out of people.</i>

166
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,356
<i>It's some kind
of dirty magic show.</i>

167
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:19,568
<i>Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get
back in this room right now.</i>

168
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,731
<i>And bring a mop.</i>

169
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:23,360
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

170
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:24,985
<i>A mop.</i>

171
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,834
<i>I have two PhDs yet somehow I'm the
janitor of my sister's birth canal.</i>

172
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:38,582
Hey, Sheldon sent
us all an e-mail.

173
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,728
- "Happy holidays from Texas."
- Aw.

174
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:42,212
And there's pictures.

175
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:45,205
Aah! Don't open them.
Do <i>not</i> open them.

176
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:48,768
Oh, come on. Childbirth is
a natural, beautiful...

177
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,116
Oh, it's like someone
sawed a cow in half.

178
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:58,215
My father's a gynecologist,
I think I can handle it.

179
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:01,160
And, now, I'm gay.

180
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:07,066
You know, I was thinking. Without
Sheldon, most of us would have never met,

181
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:09,459
but Penny would still
live across from him.

182
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:12,069
And with Leonard out
of the picture,

183
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,059
we all know what
that would mean.

184
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:15,598
We do?

185
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,578
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hello.

186
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:25,264
Doing laundry?

187
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:31,478
Of course I'm doing laundry.

188
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:35,689
Saturday night is laundry night,
and I'm in a laundry room, so...

189
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,609
I believe your inference
is justified.

190
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,292
Oh, my inference is justified.

191
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:43,081
Sheldon, you are so funny.

192
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,069
Anyway, I need to
do my laundry, too,

193
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:51,116
because these clothes
are so dirty.

194
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,672
Almost as dirty as the dirty
girl who's wearing them.

195
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,817
Okay, that's enough.

196
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,381
- Disagree.
- Keep going. - More.

197
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:06,014
So, what do you think?

198
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:10,591
A tad asymmetrical, but nothing
to be concerned about.

199
00:11:12,592 --> 00:11:14,789
Please, Sheldon. I need you.

200
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:17,107
To... what?

201
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:19,844
To take me.

202
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,945
I'm not taking you anywhere
till you put on a shirt.

203
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,158
Come on, Sheldon.
You and me right here.

204
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:30,613
Penny, for the thousandth time,

205
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:33,277
I'm saving myself
for someone special.

206
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:39,903
Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist
with hair the color of mud.

207
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:44,045
I think I know how
to change your mind.

208
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,754
- That's enough.
- Ew...

209
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,153
I was okay with it.

210
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,936
How's it going, Sheldon?

211
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,670
<i>Actually, much better.</i>

212
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,606
Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?

213
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,699
<i>I don't know. I just got back.</i>

214
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:02,805
Where'd you go?

215
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:05,549
<i>My mother asked me
to get some towels.</i>

216
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:09,998
<i>I took advantage of the vague request
and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.</i>

217
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:16,410
<i>Excuse me! I'm on the phone!</i>

218
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:19,705
<i>So rude.</i>

219
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:25,878
Here's another one. Penny,
if it weren't for Sheldon,

220
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:30,644
you never would have met
comic book legend Stan Lee.

221
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,108
Great.

222
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:39,230
At least Leonard, Howard and I
would have always been friends.

223
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:41,503
Hey, how come you three never
got an apartment together?

224
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:46,266
We talked about it, but Howard was in a
pretty serious relationship with his mom.

225
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,550
I lived with her to save money.

226
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:51,877
Yeah, you didn't have to buy groceries
'cause you were breast-feeding.

227
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:58,299
Aw, so I guess if it weren't for me,
you'd still be living with her, huh?

228
00:12:58,323 --> 00:12:59,573
Not exactly.

229
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,518
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

230
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:04,793
Well, things would be
a little different.

231
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:09,487
Howard, where's my lunch?!
I'm starving!

232
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:13,881
I know you're starving. The
neighbors know you're starving.

233
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:17,045
There's starving people in
Africa who know you're starving!

234
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,970
That's it?! There's
not enough food!

235
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:25,754
Well, you cleaned out Earth!
I don't know what else to do!

236
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,542
How is this any different?

237
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,396
You didn't let me finish.

238
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,741
Here you go, Mother.

239
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:37,224
You're a good boy, Howard!

240
00:13:37,268 --> 00:13:41,053
Such a good boy!

241
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:48,122
Wait-- did she die
or did you kill her?

242
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,151
Eh, tomato, tomahto. The
important thing is she's dead.

243
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:58,714
Hey, so how come you two
didn't move in together?

244
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:00,349
This guy wanted a
place of his own

245
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,684
because he was sure he was
gonna be a ladies' man.

246
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,717
Yeah, I was wrong.

247
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,653
But I do think you and I
would have had a great time.

248
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:12,646
Come on, Leonard, dinner.

249
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,602
Coming.

250
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:24,637
<i>Hang on.</i>

251
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,543
Why would I be fat?

252
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,853
You'd have no girlfriend
to see you naked,

253
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:32,388
you'd try to fill
the void with food,

254
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,402
and I'm an enabler who
once deep-fried a pancake.

255
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,779
Why can't you be fat, too?

256
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,261
What do you want
to do for dessert?

257
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:47,797
I think there's still half
a cake from breakfast.

258
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:51,558
No, there's not.

259
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,413
Hey, guys.

260
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,718
- Stuart.
- Stuart.

261
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:03,844
What are you doing?

262
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:05,548
I...

263
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:09,333
just wanted to be
in anyone's story.

264
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,491
Yeah, but why are you fat?

265
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,494
'Cause Leonard was fat.

266
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,257
Amy, what about you?

267
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,682
What do you think you'd be doing
if you never met Sheldon?

268
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
It's hard to say,

269
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,316
my life would be so...
different.

270
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:31,503
You can say "better."
Sheldon can't hear you.

271
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,396
I don't know.

272
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:39,472
♪ Happy birthday to me

273
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:44,207
♪ Happy birthday to me ♪

274
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:50,153
♪ There's tears
in the frosting ♪

275
00:15:56,505 --> 00:16:00,987
♪ Happy birthday to me.

276
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:11,850
I'll stop now.

277
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:16,828
How's it going, Sheldon?

278
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:20,116
<i>That's it. The baby's here.</i>

279
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,212
It's a boy.

280
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,248
- Congrats.
- Aw. - Yay.

281
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:25,260
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

282
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:27,468
<i>I wasn't sure I was
gonna to make it.</i>

283
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,760
<i>But my mother gave
me some ice chips,</i>

284
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,573
<i>my sister told me to breathe.</i>

285
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,756
<i>And I just thought
to myself, "Sheldon,</i>

286
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,884
<i>"if you can make it through
the Green Lantern movie,</i>

287
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,057
<i>you can make it through this."</i>

288
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,912
Well, good for you, buddy. We'll
let you get back in there.

289
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:48,094
<i>Oh no, no, I'm not going back in there.
That baby is so irritating.</i>

290
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:51,412
<i>He has literally been
crying his entire life.</i>

291
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:56,103
Aw, he's already taking
after Uncle Shelly.

292
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:59,154
Come on, Sheldon, you should go.

293
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:00,544
<i>Why?</i>

294
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:04,395
Well, you always complain that you never
had an intelligent role model growing up,

295
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,769
and now you can be
one for your nephew.

296
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,636
Ugh, all right, I'll go.

297
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:15,896
<i>But from what I've seen, his attention
span is as limited as his bladder control.</i>

298
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:19,795
You actually got him to do it.

299
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,041
Yeah, you keep saying how much
Sheldon has affected all of us, but

300
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,578
you've clearly had
an impact on him.

301
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,119
If that were true, I wouldn't
still be living alone.

302
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:31,703
Well, not exactly alone. I do
have a 50 pound sack of rice

303
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,032
with one of Sheldon's
T-shirts on it.

304
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,708
I'm telling you, Sheldon cares
for you more than you think.

305
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,915
I wish I could believe you.

306
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:45,940
I also wish there wasn't a
mouse living in Rice Sheldon.

307
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,436
Hang on, I'm gonna give you a
little early Christmas present.

308
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:54,288
I'm gonna show you something,

309
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:57,336
but if you ever told Sheldon he'd
probably never speak to me again.

310
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,706
So, if you want to
tell him, that's fine.

311
00:18:01,273 --> 00:18:02,725
Look.

312
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,174
I don't understand.

313
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,419
He made you his screensaver.

314
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,396
Oh.

315
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:13,847
Wow.

316
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,692
I had no idea.

317
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,309
He is so into me.

318
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,868
Wait, wait, where'd I go?

319
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:27,708
Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing,
Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man...

320
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,829
but, look, you're in the mix.

321
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:33,869
I <i>am</i> in the mix. And
I'm the hottest one.

322
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,602
Who's that?

323
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:38,828
- Oh, Madame Curie.
- That's fine, she's dead.

324
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,234
You okay?

325
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,458
Just really glad you're back.

326
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:57,943
Me, too.

327
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,002
I got a lot of TV
to catch up on.

328
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:09,720
I missed you.

329
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,239
To quote Han Solo, "I know""

330
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,787
Did you miss me?

331
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:21,636
I would've preferred to
have you there with me.

332
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:23,240
Oh.

333
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:25,045
Or instead of me.

334
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:31,303
- Did you hold the baby?
- I did.

335
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:32,875
And?

336
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:35,277
How did it make you feel?

337
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:37,708
Looking into the
blank, innocent eyes

338
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:41,585
of a creature that couldn't begin to
comprehend anything I was saying?

339
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:44,912
Basically just another
day at the office.

340
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,938
I'm gonna do it. I'm
gonna ask her out.

341
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:02,501
Yeah, and chocolate milk is
gonna squirt out of my nipples.

342
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,323
Put up or shut up. You
make it, I'll drink it.

343
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,275
You guys need anything else?

344
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,155
Uh, your phone number and
one more cheesecake.

345
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:19,689
I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend.

346
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:22,475
In fact, there he is now.

347
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:34,242
- Ready to go, sweetheart?
- Not until I get my kiss.

348
00:20:55,874 --> 00:21:00,874
