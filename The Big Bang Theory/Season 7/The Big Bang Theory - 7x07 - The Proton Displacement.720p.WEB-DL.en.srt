1
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:10,019
I've never seen him
this happy before.

2
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:13,874
That's because you've never seen him
on "Restock the Medicine Cabinet Day."

3
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:17,802
Look! A new topical
antihistamine with lidocaine.

4
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,057
Wow!

5
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:21,899
I can't wait until I get a rash.

6
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,410
Oh, Gas-X has a new
ultra strength.

7
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:29,345
I guess they really
do read their mail.

8
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:33,197
Hey, isn't that
Professor Proton?

9
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,824
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:41,101
Look at him, just
standing in line

11
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:44,461
like he wasn't moderately
famous 30 years ago.

12
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:48,147
- Let's go say hello.
- Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

13
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:50,952
I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

14
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,492
He thinks there's a difference.

15
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:56,026
Arthur?

16
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:57,485
Arthur, it's me--

17
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,842
Sheldon Cooper.

18
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:02,296
You may not remember because
of your advanced age.

19
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,054
Trust me, I... I remember.

20
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:08,168
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

21
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:10,897
Amy, this is television
legend Arthur Jeffries.

22
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:14,486
His science show inspired
millions of children.

23
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,385
Hold-Hold-Hold on.

24
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,644
You... You have a girlfriend?

25
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,835
Yes, and I've heard
so much about you.

26
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,587
Hey look-- we're wearing
the same orthopedic shoes.

27
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,754
I can't believe I dress
like a celebrity.

28
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,719
O-Okay, I get it now.

29
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:38,242
Dr. Jeffries, hello again.
Leonard Hofstadter.

30
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:41,734
Oh, oh, right, I remember
your-your girlfriend.

31
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:46,448
Is-Is she... is she here?

32
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,192
No, she's not.

33
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,105
So, what prescription
are you getting filled?

34
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:54,276
- Sheldon. - No. Wait, I want
to guess. Don't tell me.

35
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:57,121
I wasn't going to tell you.

36
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:59,938
- Sheldon, come on.
- No, no, no. I'm really good at this.

37
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:05,590
All right, give me a hint. Does it involve
difficulty initiating a stream of anything?

38
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:11,374
Well, given my age, that's
more than just a lucky guess.

39
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:13,576
Hey, Sheldon, let's go
mock the people

40
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:16,162
buying homeopathic medicine--
you love that.

41
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:19,135
But I'm hanging out with my
friend, and we're having fun.

42
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:21,416
Look how happy he is.

53
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:53,502
Oh, Bernie's having a girls' night
on Friday at our place.

54
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:54,941
You want to do something?

55
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,463
- Actually, I'm busy.
- Doing what?

56
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,788
There's a new sports bar
over on Colorado Ave...

57
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,376
- You're going to girls' night.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,262
You know they're making
jewelry right?

59
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,560
You think <i>they
</i> came up with that?

60
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,100
They were going to drink
beer and play darts.

61
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:15,532
- What's up?
- Not his testosterone levels.

62
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,927
Excuse me. I happen to be very
comfortable with my masculinity.

63
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:22,642
How is that possible?

64
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:30,016
Hey, I got an email
from Professor Proton.

65
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,307
Goody!
What's it say?

66
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:34,303
He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

67
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:36,913
and wants to know if
I'd take a look at it.

68
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,604
That's strange.

69
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:41,457
That he would come to you
for that and not me.

70
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:44,909
Oh, I got two emails from him.

71
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,865
"Do you have Leonard's
email address?"

72
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,681
And...

73
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,284
"Never mind, I found it."

74
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,233
I can't believe he
picked you over me.

75
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,649
You don't want to read a
paper by some old has-been

76
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,905
who hasn't done any real
science in decades.

77
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:06,787
Yeah, it's nothing
to cry about.

78
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:09,339
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

79
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,785
It's true, you'd rust.

80
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,704
And to think I
idolized that man.

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,121
And why?

82
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,492
At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.

83
00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:27,395
Is it really worth
getting upset about?

84
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:29,267
They say don't meet your heroes.

85
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:32,298
Don't peek behind that curtain
of fame and celebrity,

86
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,016
because if you do, you'll see
them as they really are--

87
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:37,632
degenerate carnival folk.

88
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,380
Come on, he's a retired
kids show host.

89
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:42,605
That's even worse.

90
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:47,356
Using the sweet candy of science
to trick children into loving him.

91
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:50,064
Pervert.

92
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:56,147
Have you ever thought about why Arthur
didn't want you to read his paper?

93
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,479
Yes, I have.

94
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:58,869
And my only conclusion

95
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,982
is the prescription he was picking up
the other day was for cuckoo pills.

96
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:07,369
Maybe he found you,
um, a bit much.

97
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:10,328
That's kind of a stretch.

98
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:13,487
Look, when it comes to social skills,
I've mastered the big three.

99
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,825
There's the coy smile.

100
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,484
There's the friendly chuckle.

101
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:24,639
There's the vocalization
of sympathy.

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,426
Aw...

103
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:30,283
That last one's tricky,
I'm still working on it.

104
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:35,950
From what I saw the other day, I
could understand why he and...

105
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:39,085
some people might find you...

106
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,427
What?

107
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,546
Doesn't matter.

108
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,236
No, go ahead, say it.

109
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:49,716
I know what it is.

110
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:51,115
I've heard it my whole life.

111
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,659
The word's "annoying".
Go ahead, say it.

112
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,675
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

113
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:58,073
- Sheldon...
- Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

114
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,907
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

115
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,245
I'm annoying.
I'm annoying.

116
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,515
I'm annoying. Yeah, now, uh...
Now where are you going?

117
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:06,976
Look, you know you want
to say it-- say it.

118
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,801
Say I'm annoying.
Go ahead, say it.

119
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:13,474
Say it. Say it. Amy, say it.

120
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,368
Well, she can't stand
it when I'm right.

121
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,521
This is fun.

122
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,362
I'm going to feel like such
a vixen wearing jewelry

123
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:26,562
that doesn't have a list
of medications I'm allergic to.

124
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:28,791
Penny, how's it
going over there?

125
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:31,549
Good-- I'm just having
little trouble with the glue.

126
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:36,983
How do you not know how to use glue?
Did you ditch pre-school?

127
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:40,879
Yeah, but only because I was
dating a second grader.

128
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,724
Hello, everyone.

129
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:47,050
Okay, let me have it.

130
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,957
Let's hear all the
"Raj is a girl" jokes.

131
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,348
Nope. Bernadette told me it
isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

132
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:54,089
Thank you.

133
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:56,802
So I won't be making fun of
you, or the things you like,

134
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:59,901
or the fact that you
just want to have fun.

135
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:06,181
Howie, stop. Come on,
look at what I'm making.

136
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,667
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

137
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:11,957
- I'm making a bracelet.
- Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

138
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:18,203
You know, instead of beads and glue,
you guys can use my soldering iron.

139
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,936
You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

140
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:23,470
Oh, I think we're doing
just fine, thank you.

141
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,181
- Actually, I'd kind of like to try that.
- Me, too.

142
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,837
Be right back.

143
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:31,121
When did I have pistachios?

144
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,093
Arthur.

145
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:39,817
Arthur.

146
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,469
Arthur.

147
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,550
Door knocker.

148
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,717
That's TV money.

149
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,853
Sheldon, what are
you doing here?

150
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:54,264
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

151
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,775
Of course you woke
me, it's 7:30.

152
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,713
Well, I would
have been here sooner,

153
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:05,074
but for some reason your home isn't
on this map of Hollywood stars.

154
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,791
What do you want, Sheldon?

155
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:13,139
It's been pointed out by my girlfriend
that I may have been annoying to you.

156
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,328
She sounds like a keeper.

157
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:19,370
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

158
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:20,879
I am truly sorry.

159
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:23,036
All right, apology accepted.
Have a nice night.

160
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:26,085
No, no, now that...
we've cleared the air,

161
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,511
I wanted to discuss another
matter with you.

162
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:31,300
Sheldon, in a couple
hours, I have to get up,

163
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,586
pee and then wander
around the house.

164
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,215
Well, then, I'll make
this quick. Um,

165
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,699
I want to talk about the
paper you sent Leonard.

166
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:49,502
Now, I know he said it's promising
and he's going to collaborate on it,

167
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:53,465
but now that you and I are friends
again, I am at your disposal.

168
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,759
Amd frankly, lending
my name and reputation

169
00:08:55,784 --> 00:09:00,116
to it will help, because a lot of people
think that you're a washed-up has-been.

170
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,687
Or dead.

171
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:06,022
I should be so lucky.

172
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,448
So, uh, what do you say?

173
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,344
You know, if it's all the same with
you, I think I'll stick with Leonard.

174
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,182
It's because I'm
annoying, right?

175
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,065
I know it is.
Say it.

176
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,817
Say it.
Say I'm annoying.

177
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,241
- Good night.
- Say it.

178
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:24,002
Arthur, say it. Say I'm annoying.
Say it. Say it.

179
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,255
I'm annoying.
Say it.

180
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,991
You're annoying!

181
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,338
Wow, that really hurt.

182
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,501
If you would have told me
when I was a kid

183
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,557
that someday I would be doing
science next to Professor Proton,

184
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,545
I would not have believed you.

185
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:49,259
If someone had told me that people
would still call me Professor Proton

186
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,319
when I was 83 years old,

187
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:54,188
I never would have quit smoking.

188
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:59,249
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries,
I'm just excited.

189
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:02,435
This nano vacuum tube idea of
yours is really interesting.

190
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,276
Hello, Leonard. Oh,
hello, Arthur.

191
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:07,880
What an odd coincidence
that you're both here.

192
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,334
Why is it odd?

193
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:12,311
Because as it just so happens,
I'm also spending the day

194
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:15,336
with a beloved children's
television science personality.

195
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:17,913
Isn't that right,
new friend and colleague,

196
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:20,066
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

197
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,287
Sorry, I replaced you
with a newer model.

198
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:31,355
Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It's
an honor to meet you.

199
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:33,606
My show never would have
happened without yours.

200
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,624
That's what I told my lawyers.

201
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:42,462
Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got
you involved in this nonsense.

202
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:44,718
He said I'd be
speaking to a class.

203
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:47,522
No, I said you were
teaching someone a lesson.

204
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,978
Now let's go.

205
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:51,701
What are you guys working on?

206
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,901
Oh, uh, we're making
nano vacuum tubes.

207
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,297
Oh...

208
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:56,553
That's interesting.

209
00:10:56,588 --> 00:11:00,231
Haven't you stolen enough from me?
Back off, bow tie!

210
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,313
Hey, guys...

211
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,238
What do you think?

212
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:10,989
Wow, Penny, good job.

213
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:14,197
Thanks. Target, $4.99.
I'm getting a drink.

214
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:16,812
What are you working on?

215
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,690
Oh, I'm making a
necklace for my mom.

216
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:19,629
That's sweet.

217
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,909
Yeah, she and my dad are going
through a bit of a rough patch,

218
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:24,461
so I wanted to do something to let
her know I was thinking about her.

219
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:25,998
What's going on with them?

220
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,373
They're just having a little
trouble communicating.

221
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,679
My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice

222
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:32,826
makes him want to tear his ears
off and sew them over his eyes

223
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:34,736
so he never has to
look at her again.

224
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,794
- Hi. - Hey, guys.
- Hello.

225
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:42,640
Look who's here to put the
"Jew" in "Jewelry Night"!

226
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,912
Oh, sure, so it's fine
when you say it.

227
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:49,916
Sorry we're late.

228
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:53,913
I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up
some even cooler tools for us to use.

229
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:55,220
I didn't know you
were coming again.

230
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,689
Well, last week was a blast.

231
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:59,679
Plus, I thought you might
like having a guy here.

232
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,059
It was not funny.

233
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:07,501
So, what tools did you bring?

234
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,300
Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.

235
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:13,026
Here's some silver, a crucible and
an acetylene torch to melt it down.

236
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:15,051
Ooh, that looks like fun.

237
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:18,969
Maybe you should master glue
before you move on to fire.

238
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,232
Okay, who's up first?

239
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:24,490
Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet
for your mom to go with the necklace?

240
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:25,678
No, thanks.

241
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,556
I was gonna make a
necklace for my mom,

242
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,153
but unfortunately, she
doesn't have a neck.

243
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:35,255
She's just chins
and fat and feet.

244
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,065
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

245
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,542
Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.

246
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,346
This is so exciting, I-I feel...

247
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:48,943
like I'm 75 again.

248
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,559
Oh, God.

249
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:55,715
What... what is it?

250
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:59,296
Sheldon just sent me a picture of
him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

251
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:05,414
- Can-can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

252
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:08,328
W-Why do you put
up with Sheldon?

253
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:12,044
Oh, uh, you know,
because we're friends.

254
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,314
Why?

255
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:20,150
- Wow, you ask really hard questions.
- Yeah.

256
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:23,036
Look, I-I know
he can be aggravating,

257
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,796
but what you have to remember is
that he's not doing it on purpose.

258
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,488
It's just how he is.

259
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:32,022
But he's also loyal and trustworthy
and we have fun together...

260
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,415
You... you know you're
describing a dog.

261
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:38,980
He did bite me once.

262
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:43,962
But in his defense, I came up behind
him while he was eating, so...

263
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:46,791
Yeah, they-they hate that.

264
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,922
You know what, Sheldon is the smartest
person I have ever met. And...

265
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:56,006
he's a little broken
and he needs me.

266
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,913
I guess I need him, too.

267
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:01,010
Why-why is that?

268
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:03,032
Boy, you will not let
this go, will you?

269
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,469
Oh, geez.

270
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,621
- Another photo from Sheldon?
- No, I have to go pick him up.

271
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:12,969
Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.

272
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:17,412
He probably stole
his wallet, too.

273
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,264
You know, if you guys
are interested,

274
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:25,582
there's a technique where
I can take a lock of your hair,

275
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,346
refine it into carbon dust,

276
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,741
and use the hydraulic press at work
to turn it into a tiny little diamond

277
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,078
with your DNA in it.

278
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:35,366
- Oh, that's amazing!
- Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

279
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,592
That came right off
my mom's back.

280
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:40,737
He's kidding.

281
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:43,293
If that were true, it'd
be so much bigger.

282
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,559
"My name is Howard. I can
make your hair into diamonds.

283
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:50,692
My mom is morbidly obese.
Everybody love me."

284
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:54,121
Whoa, where is that coming from?

285
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,864
I'll tell you where
it's coming from.

286
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,079
All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night

287
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,153
and now you're here
ruining it for everyone.

288
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:03,318
Raj, cool it... he's gonna
make us hair diamonds.

289
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:08,177
How am I ruining anything? I'm just
trying to help you make better jewelry.

290
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,921
But this isn't
about the jewelry.

291
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:13,768
This is about me having a place where
I can open up about my feelings.

292
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:16,751
Since when can't you
open up with me?

293
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:20,152
There are just some things that I feel
more comfortable sharing with the girls,

294
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,854
because they won't
make fun of me

295
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:26,103
or and call me names, or ask me if
my "Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

296
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:32,270
Buddy, I was just
joking around.

297
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:34,444
Yeah, well, sometimes
your jokes hurt.

298
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,700
Well, you're right.

299
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:40,257
I didn't realize I was
making you feel that way.

300
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:43,418
It was very brave
of you to tell me.

301
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,277
Thank you.

302
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,892
It wasn't easy.

303
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:52,353
They're gonna have sex before
Sheldon and I do, I know it.

304
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,853
- Arthur.
- Hi, Sheldon.

305
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:01,909
I'm surprised to see you here.

306
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:03,324
Yeah, me, too.

307
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:08,442
Somewhere around the third floor,
I began to see a white light.

308
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:13,745
- I'll get Leonard.
- No, no, no, I'm...

309
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,155
I'm here... I'm here to see you.

310
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,549
If you're hoping to get in touch
with Bill Nye, I can't help you.

311
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,731
I've been informed that he's now
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

312
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:29,796
No, I'm... I-I was thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,

313
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,718
I'd like to get your
opinion about my-my paper.

314
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:35,319
Thank you.

315
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:36,684
It would be an honor.

316
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,239
Oh. Uh, great.

317
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:39,974
Well, actually,
I don't need that.

318
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,566
I hacked into your e-mail
account and read it.

319
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:45,314
And...

320
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,639
what did you think?

321
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,983
Well, first,
I think the fact that

322
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,712
you use your birthday as a
password is embarrassing.

323
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,093
Mmm. Thank you.

324
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,296
Second, um...

325
00:16:59,462 --> 00:17:02,013
I thought your
paper was inspired.

326
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,656
Oh, well, that... that
means a lot to me.

327
00:17:05,977 --> 00:17:07,452
Can I invite you in for tea?

328
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,169
Uh, no, no. I-I really...

329
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:10,748
I have... I have to run.

330
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:12,427
Hey, Arthur.
How are you?

331
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,919
Well, I guess one
cup wouldn't hurt.

332
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,468
Oh, hey, buddy, what's up?

333
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,991
Well, I was feeling bad about
how I acted the other night so

334
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,734
I made you a little something.

335
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:32,273
- You didn't have to do that.
- Well, it was fun.

336
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:34,995
I used some of the jewelry
techniques you taught us.

337
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,924
It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

338
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,062
Wow, this is so cool,

339
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:45,490
- Thanks.
- Oh gets better.

340
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:50,213
Wow!

341
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:52,584
And that's not even
the best part. See?

342
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,869
I have one, too.

343
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:58,215
Check it out.

344
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:02,181
You can wear yours and we can have
little sword fights whenever we want.

345
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:20,492
Yeah, and my eighth favorite episode of
<i>Professor Proton</i> was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

346
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,807
You said, "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,
oh, what a blast-off it is."

347
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,694
Remember? Remember that?
Remember?

348
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:32,320
He can't help it. He can't.
He really can't.

349
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,561
Oh! Wait here.

350
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,760
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,
we can build that rocket,

351
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:38,203
and we can shoot it
at Bill Nye's house.

352
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:42,091
As long as I'm not
within 500 feet of it.

353
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:48,338
So, you, uh...

354
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:50,427
you have... you have any...

355
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,115
single grandmothers?

356
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:56,786
Sorry, they're both married.

357
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,306
- Good.
- Mmm.

358
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,287
H-Happily?

359
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:13,738
