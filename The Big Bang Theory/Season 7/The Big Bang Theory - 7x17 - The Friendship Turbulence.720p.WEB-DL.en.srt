1
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,459
Raj, your tag's
sticking out.

2
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:08,608
Thank you. That was the closest I've
come to sex in, like, two years.

3
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:12,481
Now I feel a little gross.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,469
You're only making it
seem more real for me.

5
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:18,505
Hey, that's my wife.

6
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:21,161
If anyone's gonna make her feel
gross about sex, it's me.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,079
Can we please talk about something
other than my depressing love life?

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,455
How about Penny's
depressing acting career?

9
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:31,523
Hey. I mean, it's
been a little tough,

10
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:35,189
but Penny's following her dreams, and
in my book, that is not depressing.

11
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,667
Aw... Thank you.

12
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:39,419
Is that book called
<i>Lies I Tell to Get Sex?</i>

13
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,193
Is that a real book? I would
totally read that book.

14
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,389
Can I borrow it
when you're done?

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,238
Well, I'll have you guys know I turned
down a part in a movie last week.

16
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,383
- Why would you do that?
- Because it was crap.

17
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:59,551
It's a sequel to that awful
killer gorilla movie I was in.

18
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:01,240
<i>Serial Ape-ist?</i>

19
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:04,295
I thought you
died in that.

20
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,214
She does.
42 minutes in.

21
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,607
While showering topless,

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,495
16 minutes after brief side butt during a
pillow fight with her sorority sisters.

23
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,632
I have an eidetic memory. I
don't know what his problem is.

24
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,821
Okay, well, there are no
shower scenes in this one.

25
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,491
They just try to clone me
from my corpse,

26
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:23,586
but my DNA gets mixed
with the ape's DNA

27
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:26,645
and I end up running around with
giant gorilla hands and feet.

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,873
Am I missing something, or isn't
that the part she was born to play?

39
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:02,437
So are you really not
gonna do this movie?

40
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,517
Well, I don't think it's the kind
of part that's good for my career.

41
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:09,803
Well, but don't a lot of famous actors
get their start doing bad movies?

42
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:12,304
Okay, I don't think Meryl
Streep ever had to say...

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,970
"Must keep gorilla hands
from killing again!"

44
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:21,960
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.

45
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,426
I-I don't know anything
about show business,

46
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,009
so if you think it's reasonable
to turn down paid work

47
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:32,343
and just burn through your savings,
I'm sure you know what you're doing.

48
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,959
I think we're gonna go.

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,807
Are you sure?

50
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:44,542
We were making fun
of failed careers.

51
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,971
We didn't get to tap the
juicy vein that is Howard's.

52
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:51,017
Hey, I work at the same
university you do.

53
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:53,520
Yes, and Hawkeye's
in the Avengers,

54
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,683
but no one ever says,
"Help, Hawkeye!"

55
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,404
Can I ask you something?

56
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:02,236
Why do you constantly feel the
need to put down my husband?

57
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:03,975
Oh, I'm sure he does
it out of love.

58
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:07,964
The same way my boyfriend makes me
feel terrible about my life choices.

59
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,490
I think we're gonna go.

60
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,663
No, no, no. This
is not a fight.

61
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,654
I-I was just excited that
someone offered you a part

62
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:21,255
and a little surprised that you'd rather
sit at home and do nothing than take it.

63
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,239
Now it's a fight.

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,815
Well, with
that sorted out,

65
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:31,962
I'm happy to answer your
question, Bernadette.

66
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,642
Howard started it.

67
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,031
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.

68
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,740
I wasn't referring
to this evening.

69
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,992
Ten years ago, upon
first seeing me,

70
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:43,986
your husband claimed that I looked
like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman.

71
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:49,298
And he called me
C-3P-wee Herman.

72
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,383
Still funny.

73
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,057
That was ten years ago.

74
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:01,666
Nine years, 11 months
and three weeks ago,

75
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:04,809
he followed that up by replacing
the slides for my lecture

76
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,813
with photographs of nude
fat women bending over.

77
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,049
Really?

78
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,831
The lecture was on cosmic
gas clouds. That's funny!

79
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,669
I was there. It was funny.

80
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:26,129
In any event, that began
a decade-long progression

81
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:30,231
of insults, pranks and unwanted
magazine subscriptions.

82
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,848
To this day, I still get a monthly
copy of <i>Granny on Granny.</i>

83
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:38,782
Which, other than its surprisingly
fun puzzle page, is complete filth.

84
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:45,368
Thanks for walking
me to my car.

85
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:47,091
Actually, it's
for both of us.

86
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,620
Last night, I watched
<i>West Side Story,</i>

87
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,048
and I'm a little freaked
out by street gangs.

88
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:55,833
Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.

89
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,117
I don't appreciate
your sarcasm,

90
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,063
but we've still got two blocks
to go, so I'll put up with it.

91
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:06,503
Whatever happened with
your online dating?

92
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,282
No one was writing me back, so
I stopped checking my profile.

93
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:12,884
Before I met Sheldon, I was
ready to give up, too.

94
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:16,533
Once, I even dropped in on my OB/GYN
just to get some human contact.

95
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:21,166
It has been a while since I
got my prostate checked.

96
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:25,678
Then I met Sheldon and
look at where we are now.

97
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,868
What? You've kissed, like,
once in three years.

98
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,582
That's true. Do
whatever you want.

99
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:36,227
Hey.

100
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:37,702
Hello.

101
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:44,497
Listen, I was thinking you and I could
probably try to be better friends.

102
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:45,967
Really?

103
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:49,112
I was thinking what we
have now is a bit much.

104
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,547
Seriously, I was talking to
Bernadette last night and...

105
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,859
she made some
great points.

106
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:02,010
You and I have known
each other a long time,

107
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,583
and I didn't hear the rest
'cause she took her bra off.

108
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:10,782
Very well.

109
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,139
How do you propose
we move forward?

110
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:17,371
Uh, for starters, we could
stop insulting each other.

111
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,958
That's a great idea.

112
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,926
And in the spirit of
our new arrangement,

113
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,234
I will mask my surprise
that you came up with it.

114
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:33,426
Anyway, I got invited to do a little
talk at NASA in Houston this weekend.

115
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,062
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.

116
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,548
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom,

117
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:40,868
and I'll show you around
the space center.

118
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:43,933
I have one question.

119
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:46,204
Is this a prank...

120
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:49,825
where we land in Houston and
you've made up wanted posters

121
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:52,741
that have my face with a
mustache and a Spanish name

122
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:56,055
and then I get arrested and
deported to South America?

123
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:58,603
No.

124
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,987
I'm glad because I would not
have seen that coming.

125
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,630
Amy, I could
use some help.

126
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,023
Oh. Let me guess.
There's an...

127
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:12,662
undergrad in a leather jacket snapping
his fingers by the water fountain.

128
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:16,596
I thought about what
you said last night,

129
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,643
and I went back
on the dating Web site

130
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:21,037
and I was looking
at this girl's profile.

131
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,333
She's amazing.

132
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,720
Oh, she's cute.

133
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,640
And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.

134
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,315
And judging by her lack of Adam's apple,
she's been female her entire life.

135
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:35,690
I like that in a woman.

136
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,529
Great, so what do
you need me for?

137
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:40,311
Well, I was up all night
trying to write to her,

138
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:42,424
but I wanted to run
it by you first.

139
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,101
All right.

140
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:47,050
"Emily,

141
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,530
your face is like a precious
dew-kissed flower..."

142
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,004
Wow.

143
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:54,647
I know. Powerful
stuff, huh?

144
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:59,014
No. You're supposed to
be yourself, not all...

145
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:01,274
desperate and creepy.

146
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,596
Okay, I'm getting some
mixed messages here.

147
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:08,831
Just say something normal
like, "I saw your profile.

148
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:12,504
"Looks like we have a lot in common;
Let's get a cup of coffee sometime."

149
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:17,239
Yes. "Where I can be jealous of
the cup touching your ruby lips."

150
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,038
Or you just write it for me.

151
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:24,273
- I'm not gonna pretend to be you.
- I don't want you to pretend to be me.

152
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,387
You can be like my,
uh, online wingman.

153
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,310
Like if we met her at a bar
and you talked me up.

154
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:31,317
Well, what would
I say to her?

155
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,283
Just tell her what
I'm really like.

156
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,579
And, if you think
it'll help,

157
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,960
that you saw me changing once
and my package reminded you

158
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,525
of the muscular
tail of a jaguar.

159
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,288
Use your own words.

160
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:55,186
Thanks again for taking
me to the pharmacy.

161
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,341
Oh, it's no problem.
Is everything okay?

162
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:01,518
Oh, I'm fine. It's just some, uh,
stomach medication for my trip.

163
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,172
There's the remote
yet distinct possibility

164
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:06,690
that I may end up
in South America.

165
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:12,933
Remember the old days when I would've
said something dumb like "Why?"

166
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,949
Uh, that doesn't
sound good.

167
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:24,538
Remember the old days when I used to point
out that your check engine light was on?

168
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:26,923
Yes.

169
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:29,226
Well, get ready to stroll down memory
lane: Penny, your check engine...

170
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,740
Yeah, I know it's
on, Sheldon!

171
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:35,244
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I
cannot afford this right now.

172
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:37,755
Maybe it's just something minor.

173
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:48,584
Ooh, good news, the
light just went out.

174
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,258
Are we playing
individual or teams?

175
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,112
Teams are fun.

176
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,865
Oh, in that case, I'd like to be
partnered with my good friend Howard.

177
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,499
But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.

178
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:09,569
The kind who finish
each others...

179
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:15,094
- I really don't think we do tha...
- ...do that! See?

180
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:20,047
- Oh, hi. - Oh, how'd
it go at the mechanic?

181
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,552
Not great. Can I talk
to you for a sec?

182
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,017
Yeah, sure.

183
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:27,049
Maybe I can go with
you guys to Houston?

184
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:30,435
- Isn't it a little late to get plane tick...
- ...plane tickets? Yeah.

185
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,345
- Will you please sto...
- ...stop that? Okay.

186
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,941
I don't know what to do. My car
threw a rod and it's totaled.

187
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,706
I can't afford a new
one, I have no job,

188
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,115
and now I can't
drive to auditions.

189
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,808
I'm so sorry.

190
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:45,838
I know it's
a sensitive subject,

191
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,967
but can you reconsider
that part in the movie?

192
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,378
I did. I called them.
The part's gone.

193
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:52,227
They gave it to
someone else.

194
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,463
Now that girl's gonna get
discovered and become famous

195
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:56,635
and go on <i>Letterman</i> and talk
about how she got her big break

196
00:10:56,641 --> 00:11:01,418
on a cheap monkey movie all because some
dumb girl thought it was beneath her.

197
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,997
At least they talked
about you on <i>Letterman.</i>

198
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:09,357
Come on, I can drive you
wherever you need to go.

199
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,392
How? Unlike me,
you have a job.

200
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,634
- I'm just gonna have to go back
to being a waitress... - Oh.

201
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,627
...like I will be for
the rest of my life.

202
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:20,635
Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.

203
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:22,606
I'm sorry, is the fact
that my life's falling apart

204
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,640
interfering with
your board game?

205
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,817
It is.

206
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,851
You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.

207
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,180
Hey, you busy?

208
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,398
No. What's up?

209
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,713
Have you heard
back from Emily?

210
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,073
- I have.
- Great! And?

211
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,918
And I'm afraid she doesn't
think you're right for her.

212
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,550
I give you one
simple thing to do--

213
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:57,148
contact a complete stranger and make her
fall in love with me-- and you blow it!

214
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,365
I told her what a
good guy you are, but

215
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:04,975
she thought it was a bad sign that
you didn't write to her yourself.

216
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:09,033
She thought it made you
seem too shy and passive.

217
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,156
I'm not too shy and passive. You write
her back and tell her I said that.

218
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,569
You know, when you
have a second.

219
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:20,181
Look, I'll see if I can change
her mind tomorrow night.

220
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,728
What's happening
tomorrow night?

221
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,426
I'm meeting her for coffee.

222
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,040
What?!

223
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:28,129
Well, we just... we e-mailed back and
forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.

224
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:30,536
- I find a girl I like, and
you're stealing her?! - No.

225
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:32,683
We just ended up having
a lot in common.

226
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,551
We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer,
we're both hardcore into quilting.

227
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:44,286
Your words fall like acid rain on
the wounded petals of my heart.

228
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:50,497
That's Sheldon. He says
he'll be down in a minute.

229
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:52,368
What are you doing?

230
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:55,002
Oh, he's not coming out
until he sees proof

231
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:57,485
you don't have an air
freshener in your car.

232
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,738
This is gonna be a
long weekend for you.

233
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:03,648
You're the reason
I'm doing it!

234
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,563
I said to stop
insulting each other.

235
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,726
I didn't tell you to take him
on a romantic getaway.

236
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:11,652
How do I know
what you said?

237
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,763
Damn you and your
noise-cancelling breasts.

238
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,814
- Hello.
- Hi. - Hey, buddy.

239
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,541
You excited for Texas?

240
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,383
Oh, very much so.

241
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:27,694
It's not every day you get to
tour NASA with a real astronaut.

242
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,679
Who's the real astronaut?

243
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:36,424
- Buzz Aldrin.
- Oh. Yay!

244
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,492
Howard?

245
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:52,949
Howard?

246
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,728
Howard?

247
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,763
What now?

248
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,176
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- You just went to the bathroom.

249
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:04,875
I didn't use it because
it didn't seem safe.

250
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:08,803
Despite all my e-mails, the
toilet didn't have a seatbelt.

251
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:13,910
- Well, it still doesn't.
- I realize that,

252
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:17,638
but safety concerns went out
the window two apple juices ago.

253
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,269
Fine.

254
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:25,601
- Why are you getting annoyed?
- I'm trying to be a better friend,

255
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,519
but you constantly say
and do irritating things.

256
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,625
- Like when?
- When?!

257
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:35,189
How about in the car? I'm an
astronaut, and you know it.

258
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:38,328
You just don't like admitting
it, because you're jealous.

259
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,115
Well,

260
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,340
truth be told, as a child, I
did dream of going to space.

261
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,573
Those astronauts
were my heroes.

262
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:50,033
And...

263
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:52,949
when you got to go,
it was hard for me.

264
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:56,949
Thank you.

265
00:14:56,955 --> 00:15:00,109
Because it made me realize they'll
just send anyone up there.

266
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,519
- Aren't you going to let me out?
- No.

267
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,572
But I still need to
use the bathroom.

268
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:08,770
Here you go. Be creative.

269
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:14,770
What's the matter? Scared
of a little turbulence?

270
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,214
No, turbulence is
just the equalization

271
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:21,112
of diurnal temperature
variations in the atmosphere.

272
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:22,539
I'm not scared at all.

273
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:25,783
Oh, apple juice,
stay where you are.

274
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:28,685
Oh, this is nothing.

275
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,823
I experienced way worse when I
was plummeting back to Earth,

276
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:34,800
apparently not being
a real astronaut.

277
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,139
Okay, that was a big one.

278
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,111
I take it back. I'm
scared of turbulence!

279
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,252
I'm gonna need
that bag back.

280
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:49,262
You sure you want
to do this?

281
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,418
Yeah. Why wouldn't I want
to get my old job back?

282
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:52,967
It'll be fun to
see everyone.

283
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,746
I haven't talked to them since I said, "I
quit. See you at the Oscars, bitches."

284
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:00,505
Come on, let's just
get this over with.

285
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,907
"Let's get this over with."

286
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,206
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake
Factory, or are we having sex?

287
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,512
I'm just... I'm trying
to lighten the mood.

288
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:10,343
- I know. Thank you.
- Sorry.

289
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:13,628
- It's just so humiliating.
- So humiliating?

290
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,145
Am I driving you to
the Cheesecake Factory...?

291
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,659
I'm sorry. I'll-I'll stop.
I'll stop.

292
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:22,840
Come on, don't look so sad. You
never know what's gonna happen.

293
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,361
Maybe tonight
will be great.

294
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,833
Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me
feel better, and I love you for that,

295
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,665
but it's making me feel worse,
and I kind of hate you.

296
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,792
This isn't your car.

297
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:36,690
I know. I thought
we'd take yours.

298
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,009
I don't understand.

299
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,032
It's nothing fancy, but
it'll get you to auditions,

300
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,921
and at least for now, you don't
have to go back to waitressing.

301
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,708
I don't know what to say.

302
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:54,584
Don't say anything.

303
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:56,373
Oh, my God.

304
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:00,327
I mean, you could say, "Thank
you." I did just buy you a car.

305
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:03,642
Mmm.

306
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,387
Look, I admit that it's odd that
Rajesh didn't write to you himself,

307
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,738
but if you get to know him, you'll
see he's just a sweet, regular guy.

308
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:16,972
As a counterpoint, here he is,
uninvited and visibly sweaty.

309
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:19,256
- Hello, Emily.
- Hello.

310
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:23,332
Amy told me you were concerned that
I might be too passive and shy.

311
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:25,019
Let me ask you something.

312
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:28,963
Would a passive guy barge in here
to look you in the eye and say,

313
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:31,833
"Hey, dew-kissed
flower, what's up?"

314
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:39,237
No, but a weird guy with
no boundaries might.

315
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:40,926
Uh, okay, that's
a separate issue.

316
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:43,895
Let's put a pin in that and just
focus on the passive thing.

317
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:44,875
I'm leaving.

318
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,314
Are we still going to go to
that Chaucer reading Friday?

319
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,610
You know, I think I'm
just gonna go by myself.

320
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:55,189
Not my best first date.

321
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:59,379
Yeah, but not my
worst, either.

322
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:05,991
I'm sorry for every mean thing
I ever did or said to you!

323
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,899
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!

324
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,493
If you weren't my friend,
there'd be a hole in my life!

325
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:13,994
Thank you, Sheldon.

326
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,455
Kind of like when
<i>Firefly</i> was cancelled.

327
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:19,658
But not as big.

328
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:30,209
<i>The captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.</i>

329
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,879
<i>You're now free to
move about the cabin.</i>

330
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,768
- It's over.
- Yeah.

331
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:42,515
Should we stop
holding hands now?

332
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:46,311
- In a minute.
- Okay, good.
