1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,871
Gentlemen, <i>Star Wars</i> day
is rapidly approaching.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,738
We should finalize our plans.

3
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:10,520
What? That's a real thing?

4
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,584
What is it, <i>Star
Wars</i> Christmas?

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,658
No. Don't be ridiculous.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,632
That's Wookiee Life Day.

7
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:20,429
So, when is it?

8
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,834
Uh, well, it's not
May the fifth...

9
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:25,796
and it's not May
the third...

10
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:32,566
It's May the fourth.

11
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,533
Get it?

12
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:38,755
May the fourth
be with you?

13
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,024
"May the force be with you."
Get it?

14
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:44,815
Oh, no. This face wasn't
because I didn't get it.

25
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:14,538
Come in.

26
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:18,363
Hey, you got a second?

27
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:20,590
Yes. Actually, I'm
glad you're here.

28
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:23,415
I-I'm working on the
<i>Star Wars</i> Day schedule.

29
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:30,158
Now, I have a window built in after
<i>Phantom Menace,</i> for complaining, but...

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,791
...I'm worried an hour
won't be enough time.

31
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:40,484
Sheldon, I-I've got
some bad news.

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,803
What is it

33
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:47,077
I just read online that
Arthur Jeffries passed away.

34
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:51,076
Professor Proton is dead?

35
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,138
Sorry, buddy.

36
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:05,805
What are you doing?

37
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,627
Comforting you?

38
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,387
Y-Your heart might be
in the right place,

39
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:14,616
but your head, chest and
arms certainly aren't.

40
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,910
Anyway, the-the
funeral's on Sunday.

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,930
But, that's <i>Star Wars</i> Day.

42
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:23,258
Yeah... um...

43
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:27,938
of all the things about this that are
sad, that might not be number one.

44
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:32,869
You okay? I know he
meant a lot to you.

45
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:34,613
I'm fine.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,576
Okay.

47
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:42,227
Yet he cried when they
changed the Raisin Bran box.

48
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:47,430
This, uh, this is something
interesting boys and girls.

49
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:51,128
After an owl eats, he spits
up part of his meal,

50
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:55,057
that he can't digest, in
the form of a pellet.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,220
Is-Isn't that a hoot?

52
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:08,327
We'll be right back after
I fire my writers.

53
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,106
Oh, shut up.

54
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,563
Watching your old friend?

55
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:16,298
Hmm. Yes.

56
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:19,449
Look at him, Amy.
It's such a shame.

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,233
Struck down in the
prime of my life.

58
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:26,915
Do you want me to go to
the funeral with you?

59
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,930
Oh, I'm not going
to the funeral.

60
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,266
Why not?

61
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:33,631
All those people
blowing their noses.

62
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:36,827
You can't tell the sick
from the sad. Mm.

63
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:40,646
I'll be at home celebrating
<i>Star Wars</i> Day, as planned.

64
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:43,501
Are you sure you don't
want to go say good-bye?

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,876
Amy, mourning the inevitable
is a complete waste of time.

66
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:54,125
And watching a bunch of goofy space movies
you've seen hundreds of times isn't?

67
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:58,394
If we were in a physical relationship,
you just lost sex tonight.

68
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,580
Hey, guys.

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,718
Hey, Penny. Happy
<i>Star Wars</i> Day.

70
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,517
Okay.

71
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:10,767
Can I make you breakfast?

72
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:15,188
Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar
is open for business.

73
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,687
No, thanks. Leonard and I are
just going to the funeral.

74
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:21,627
You sure. Not even coffee?
We have R2-Decaf.

75
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,348
Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

76
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:27,849
And if you're not
in the mood for coffee,

77
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:30,828
I can always make you
a Chai Tea-3PO.

78
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,909
Oh, I get it-- like C-3PO.

79
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:36,987
What happened to me?

80
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:39,717
Hey, uh, Sheldon,
you want anything?

81
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,638
Uh, no, thank you.

82
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,151
You're being so quiet.

83
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:46,007
Are you upset or are
you just rebooting?

84
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,750
I'm fine.

85
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:51,343
Sweetie, are you sure you don't want
to come with us to the funeral?

86
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:53,082
Oh, I appreciate
the offer,

87
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:56,765
but Arthur is gone and there's
nothing I can do about it.

88
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:59,295
When Darth Vader
struck down Obi-Wan,

89
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:02,000
did Luke cry like a baby
and go to his funeral?

90
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:05,481
No. He blew up the Death Star.
Why do I know this?!

91
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,007
Arthur Jeffries
was a scientist.

92
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:13,045
I'm sure he didn't care about silly
superstitions like funerals.

93
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:16,806
You know, if he were here, I think
he'd say, "Enjoy <i>Star Wars</i> Day."

94
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,276
He was 84; He'd say,
"Where's my pudding?"

95
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,373
Before you go, at least
let me pack you some

96
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:27,223
Attack of the Scones
for the road.

97
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:30,189
Oh, like <i>Attack</i>
<i>of the Clones.</i>

98
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,392
We are leaving right now.

99
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:38,381
Arthur passing away was harder on
Sheldon than he's ready to admit.

100
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,136
Really hoping
this will cheer him up.

101
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:41,570
Me, too.

102
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:45,264
Although, it might've been thoughtless
of us to bake a Death Star cake.

103
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,306
No, it combines two of
Sheldon's favorite things:

104
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:53,394
Chocolate chips and the ability to destroy
a planet at the push of a button.

105
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:57,128
Well, anyway, it'll be a
nice surprise for the boys.

106
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,131
And Howie doesn't think I
take his interests seriously,

107
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,567
so hopefully this will keep
him fooled for a while.

108
00:06:02,582 --> 00:06:06,129
Okay, let's get the fondant
and start decorating.

109
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:07,307
This is pretty cool.

110
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:10,050
You don't see too
many spherical cakes.

111
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:15,691
I wonder why that is.

112
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,791
- I have a confession to make.
- Hmm?

113
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:25,946
I've never been
to a funeral before.

114
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:26,780
Really?

115
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,594
I just never knew
anyone that died.

116
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,176
I had a pet pig
when I was a kid.

117
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:35,359
I mean, when he died, we didn't
have a funeral, we had a barbecue.

118
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:41,853
Yeah, we won't be
eating Arthur tonight.

119
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,302
I didn't know him very well,
but I still really liked him.

120
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:51,083
It's weird that he's...
just gone.

121
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,409
I know.

122
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:54,936
I feel like I want to cry.

123
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,766
Oh... that's-that's fine.
Go ahead.

124
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,073
- I can't do it with you
staring at me. - Sorry.

125
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,159
No, I'm dry.

126
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,484
You're a big crybaby--
you start, I'll join in.

127
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,142
I am not a crybaby.

128
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,051
<i>Toy Story 3?</i>

129
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,467
The toys were holding
hands in a furnace!

130
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:30,610
Look, A-Arthur
lived a full life.

131
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,897
And he inspired a
lot of people.

132
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,019
Sure, he-he was my
childhood hero, but...

133
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,279
the fact that I got to work with
him, side by side, before he...

134
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:44,979
died was...

135
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,488
it was... it was a gift.

136
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,483
It was a gift.

137
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,935
Thank you for being the emotional
one in this relationship.

138
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,876
- I got your back.
- Yeah.

139
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,532
Okay, here we go.

140
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:07,592
<i>Episode I--</i>
<i>The Phantom Menace.</i>

141
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,232
Let's get this over with.

142
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,876
Since we all agree <i>Episode I</i> isn't our
favorite, maybe we just skip it this time.

143
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:16,917
Yeah, Howard, I think you of all people
should avoid espousing the principle

144
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:20,731
that if something is not our favorite
we should just get rid of it.

145
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:27,227
You know, I heard this way of watching
the movies called the Machete Order,

146
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:31,026
where you watch <i>Episodes IV
</i> and <i>V,</i> then skip <i>Episode I,</i>

147
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,875
watch <i>II</i> and <i>III</i> as a flashback,
and then finish with <i>VI.</i>

148
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,841
Okay, so you'd lose
most of Jar Jar,

149
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,870
all the trade route talk, and
the boring senate hearings,

150
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:43,710
which are like watching
C-SPAN with monsters.

151
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,917
Get rid of the
trade route part?

152
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:49,690
Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor
Valorum kicked out of office?

153
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,554
- Eh. - How would he get
himself elected? How?

154
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:57,247
Can we get through one holiday without
you saying something ridiculous?

155
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,560
It was just a suggestion.

156
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,670
Well, you know what else
was just a suggestion?

157
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,622
"Why don't we change
the Raisin Bran box?"

158
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,629
Hmm? And you know
who got hurt by that?

159
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:08,420
Every single person
who eats breakfast!

160
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:12,697
Wow.

161
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:16,633
I think he's taking this Professor
Proton thing pretty hard.

162
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:19,065
Should we try
to console him?

163
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:24,202
Or... should we respect his
privacy in this moment of grief?

164
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:26,991
By staying here and
watching the movie.

165
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,737
That's what good
friends would do!

166
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:40,545
Well, at least without Sheldon here,
we got to start with <i>Episode IV.</i>

167
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,315
Mm, true.

168
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,822
- I do feel guilty about him.
- Me, too.

169
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:48,829
- Maybe we should see
how he's doing. - Yeah.

170
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,609
- But after the cantina scene.
Obviously.

171
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,412
Look at Arthur...

172
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:03,339
cracking up at a
joke I told him.

173
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:09,228
I'll never hear
that laugh again.

174
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,466
You never heard
it <i>that</i> time.

175
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:16,802
Arthur!

176
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:20,652
- I thought you were dead.
- I am.

177
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:23,312
Oh, it-it's fantastic.

178
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:31,049
I mean, this is the longest that I've
gone without running into a men's room

179
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:33,497
in-in years.

180
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,512
Why are you here?

181
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:39,068
I-I don't know. I was...

182
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:43,118
I was hoping I was going
to haunt my ex-wife.

183
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,343
I know why.

184
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:51,998
You've come to me because
you're my Obi-Wan.

185
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:57,522
I'm-I'm not... I'm not
familiar with that. Is...

186
00:10:57,534 --> 00:11:01,397
is-is that an...
an Internet?

187
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:07,961
Wow. Uh, you're dead, so I'm
going to let that slide.

188
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:12,629
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a
character from <i>Star Wars.</i>

189
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:18,838
After his physical demise, he comes to Luke
Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.

190
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,487
- Well, that... that clears that up.
- Yeah.

191
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:27,691
You must be here
to give me advice.

192
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:36,275
Well, this... this is weird.

193
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:39,247
Most-most of my
robes open in...

194
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,248
in the back.

195
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,203
Those are your Jedi robes.

196
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,465
Oh, wait. What...?

197
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:51,752
What-what... what is this?

198
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:55,680
Oh! Be careful
with that!

199
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,334
Whoa!

200
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:07,118
Whoa!

201
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,717
Oh, neato.

202
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:18,829
I'm, uh... I'm going
to need a Band-Aid.

203
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,499
So...

204
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,479
what did you think
of your first funeral?

205
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,678
Well, I don't want to be a jerk,
but it was kind of a bummer.

206
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:34,266
Yeah, well, when I die, you
can rent a bounce house.

207
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:36,908
You think about dying?

208
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:40,915
Mm. Well, I think more about
if I'd have any regrets.

209
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:45,220
- What would you regret? - Mm, you
know, that I didn't travel more,

210
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:48,069
take more risks, learn
another language.

211
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,013
You know Klingon.

212
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,929
- That's true.
- No, I meant that as a regret.

213
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,289
I just thought of one more.

214
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:02,036
What's that?

215
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:05,902
I regret not saying "yes" when
you asked me to marry you.

216
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,003
Well, it just wasn't
the right time.

217
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:10,843
Yeah.

218
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:14,331
And this is also not the
right time. Do not propose.

219
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,850
- What? - I know that face.
That's your propose face.

220
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,680
I was not gonna propose.
It's already two to one.

221
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:22,557
What's two to one?

222
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,351
I proposed twice, you
proposed once. Two to one.

223
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:25,944
Oh, my... It's
not a contest.

224
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,409
I don't know what
you're upset about.

225
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:30,300
- I'm the one who's losing.
- Okay.

226
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,099
Fine. Would you feel better if I propose
so you could turn me down again?

227
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,613
Yeah, I think I would.

228
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,629
Okay. Leonard,
will you marry me?

229
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,926
Hmm.

230
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:44,009
No, don't you dare. You reject
me right now and tie things up.

231
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:49,518
It's just such a big decision. I
don't want to have any regrets.

232
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:56,440
Did you ever watch Professor
Proton when you were a kid?

233
00:13:56,466 --> 00:14:00,013
No. My dad controlled the TV, so
unless someone was a Texas Ranger,

234
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:02,669
Jake or the Fatman,
we didn't see it.

235
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:06,092
I never watched him, either,
but he seems to be the reason

236
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:08,345
that Sheldon got
interested in science.

237
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:11,843
Not me. I got into science 'cause I was
always the smallest kid in school,

238
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:13,778
so I thought if I
became a scientist,

239
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:17,171
I could invent a formula
that made me taller.

240
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:18,511
That's cute.

241
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:21,244
Yeah, I thought it was working for
a while, but then I found out

242
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,638
my brother was just lowering the
pencil marks on the door frame.

243
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,773
How about you?

244
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,247
Oh, I guess it must have been back
when I was in the Girl Sprouts.

245
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:34,393
Girl <i>Sprouts?</i>

246
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,038
My mom made it up as an
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

247
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:42,338
She didn't want me selling cookies on
some street corner "like a whore."

248
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,404
How did that get
you into science?

249
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:52,871
Oh, I went to the library and took out a
book on biology to see what whores did.

250
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:59,117
On the one hand,
if I say yes...

251
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,787
This isn't funny anymore.

252
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,630
Just say no so we're done with this.
Will you marry me or not?

253
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:08,623
Ooh, interesting. Did you just
propose to me again?

254
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,250
- No.
- Really?

255
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:13,013
Because I just heard,
"Will you marry me?"

256
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:15,490
That's two
proposals, one day.

257
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,470
Sounds like someone wants
to spend the rest of her life

258
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,302
telling people how to spell
the name Hofstadter.

259
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,218
You know what? Fine.
Do whatever you want.

260
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,550
Hey.

261
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,150
Penny, don't get upset.

262
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:31,741
Here.

263
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:36,046
I love you, but, no, I
will not marry you.

264
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,533
Thank you.

265
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:40,745
Now, about that second proposal.
On the one hand...

266
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,068
Where... where... where are we?

267
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:58,767
This is the swampland
of Dagobah.

268
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:02,689
It's where Luke was trained
in the ways of the Jedi.

269
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,456
Oh. Too bad. I thought
it was Florida.

270
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,994
When Obi-Wan came to
Luke on this very spot,

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,122
he gave him all sorts
of helpful advice.

272
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,811
So, um...

273
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:25,271
what do you got for me?

274
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,896
Um...

275
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,827
always...

276
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,443
get... get a prenup.

277
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,563
That's it?

278
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,533
I thought there'd be more
of a reason why you're here.

279
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:43,866
Well,

280
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,778
why-why do <i>you
</i> think I'm here?

281
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,220
I suppose it has something to
do with your recent passing.

282
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,078
Is-is this the...

283
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:55,536
the first time you've lost, you
know, someone close to you?

284
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,642
Oh, no. No.

285
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:01,625
I've already had to say
good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.

286
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:08,286
Yeah, I've-I've outlived a
few of my doctors, too.

287
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:13,295
Of course, my grandfather
died when I was five.

288
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:16,280
My father died
when I was 14.

289
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,090
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

290
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:21,515
And now you're gone, too.

291
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:26,104
It's like all the men I've
looked up to have gone away.

292
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,951
Well, you know, it's...
it's okay to...

293
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,772
to be sad about them.
Just...

294
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,443
just make sure, you
know, you appreciate

295
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,341
those who... who are
still there for you.

296
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,272
But I do appreciate them.

297
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:47,621
Well, then,

298
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,540
what am I doing
in a swamp...

299
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:57,156
...dressed like Friar Tuck?

300
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:06,031
Appreciate them, Sheldon.

301
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,826
Hey, buddy.

302
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,846
Heard you're having a rough day.
You all right?

303
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,387
I'm okay.

304
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:18,069
How was the funeral?

305
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,610
It was nice, you know.

306
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:24,125
A lot of people showed up,

307
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:27,054
told some great
stories about him.

308
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:30,554
Did you know that Arthur's
son is a high school sci...?

309
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:49,678
Hey, the guys are about to start <i>Jedi.
</i> You want to go watch?

310
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:51,374
I do.

311
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,464
After I make them go back and
watch one through five first.

312
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,271
Sheldon, that-that'll
take us all night.

313
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,191
That's true.

314
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,698
Oh, it's a good
thing I had a nap.

315
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:16,143
Boy, some of the physical comedy with
Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,347
At least they toned him
down in the second one.

317
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:23,546
Yeah, he is pretty stupid.

318
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:29,134
Hey, we can say it.
You can't.

319
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:31,898
Hey, guys.

320
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,463
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day!

321
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:35,558
Wow!

322
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,439
- A Death Star cake!
- Yeah.

323
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,219
We were hoping it
might cheer you up.

324
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,940
And even though it meant
we had to miss the movies,

325
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
we could still be
part of the fun.

326
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:44,751
Well, you didn't miss anything.
We just started over.

327
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,868
Son of a bitch.

328
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:05,358
You're back.

329
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,507
Yeah, apparently, um,

330
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:10,675
I'm here whenever...
when-whenever you need me.

331
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,398
That's nice.

332
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:15,623
May-Maybe for you.

333
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:20,228
Why do I need you now?

334
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:22,536
Well, as near as
I could tell,

335
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,894
you-you fell asleep
watching <i>Star Wars,</i> and now

336
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:30,061
you're-you're dreaming
you're watching <i>Star Wars.</i>

337
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:31,874
So?

338
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:34,720
I mean, don't-don't you
see a problem there?

339
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,913
I mean, how-how
you're spending

340
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:39,554
your limited time on Earth?

341
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:42,406
Not at all.

342
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:45,396
Okay, good luck to you.

343
