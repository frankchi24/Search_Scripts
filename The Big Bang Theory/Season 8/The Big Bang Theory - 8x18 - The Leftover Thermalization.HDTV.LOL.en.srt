1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:04,088
Two one six four two zero

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:06,059
one nine eight nine.

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,836
And that, little lady,
is pi to a thousand places.

4
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:11,868
I'd say I'm sorry I asked,

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,137
except I didn't.

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,572
Oh, look, it's the
<i>Scientific American</i>

7
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:19,384
that covered the paper
Leonard and I wrote.

8
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,354
Oh, let me see.

9
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:23,989
I have mixed feelings
about doing interviews.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,159
I like the part where I talk.

11
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:29,833
I do not like the part
where the other man talks.

12
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:34,107
Sheldon, this article doesn't
mention Leonard at all.

13
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,876
Well, that
can't be right.

14
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:38,948
It only refers to
“Dr. Cooper and his team.”

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,845
Did you even talk about him?

16
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:43,420
All I did was answer a few
questions about the theory.

17
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:45,588
And then expressed my gratitude
that<i> Scientific American</i>

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,052
doesn't include any of those
smelly perfume cards.

19
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:51,691
Poor Leonard.

20
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,026
Why? The theory
he came up with

21
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:55,690
just got mentioned in
<i>Scientific American.</i>

22
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,058
He ought to be thrilled.

23
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,499
He might not be.

24
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:00,530
Oh, maybe you're right.

25
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:02,865
He is kind of a lump.

26
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:04,000
Think about it.

27
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:05,937
How would you feel
if you were referred to

28
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,642
as part of Leonard's team?

29
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:09,908
Oh, I'd be incensed.

30
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,413
So you see what
I'm getting at?

31
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:14,984
Squeaky wheel
gets the grease?

32
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:16,386
No.

33
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:18,290
Grass is always greener?

34
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,995
Try again.

35
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,659
Well, I don't know--
we're all Groot?

36
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,764
Just tell me.

37
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,836
Leonard is as much
a part of this paper

38
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:27,900
as you are,
and he was overlooked.

39
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:29,869
He's going to feel bad.

40
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:32,141
But it wasn't my fault.

41
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,676
I didn't exclude him.

42
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:35,276
And I didn't write the article.

43
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:38,348
Remember that time you didn't
get picked to pull the sword out

44
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,579
of the stone at Disneyland and
they let that other kid do it?

45
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:43,788
Oh, that kid!

46
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:50,033
Poor Leonard.

47
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:51,833
Exactly.

48
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:54,265
For the record,
that kid was a terrible choice.

49
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,034
If you cry when you drop
your churro,

50
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:58,611
you do not have what it takes
to rule England.

60
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:32,267
Thanks for helping us sort
through all my mom's stuff.

61
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,908
Of course.

62
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,173
I know what it's like

63
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:37,844
having to go through
a loved one's possessions.

64
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:40,485
My uncle was
a worshipper of Krishna.

65
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:43,086
But after he died,
you know what we found?

66
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:46,285
A statue of Shiva.

67
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,292
It may not be
Crips and Bloods, okay?

68
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,554
But in India, it's a thing.

69
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:55,888
Well, it'll be good
that you're there.

70
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,160
Howard's been having
trouble deciding

71
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,096
what to keep
and what to let go.

72
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:00,559
Well, it's hard.

73
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:03,797
A lot of Ma's stuff
brings back fond memories.

74
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,227
Is that why you couldn't
get rid of

75
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:08,030
her drawer
full of ketchup packets?

76
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:11,194
Yes. It reminds me of us
eating out and her saying,

77
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:14,230
“Quick, nobody's looking,
fill your pockets with ketchup”"

78
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:23,528
Leonard?

79
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,631
Have you ever noticed that

80
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:30,365
only my name is
on the cable bill?

81
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,869
Yeah.

82
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:35,574
Good, good.

83
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,477
And your name is
on the electric bill

84
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,373
and mine isn't.

85
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,676
And I'm okay with that.

86
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,148
Actually, your name is
on the electric bill.

87
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,083
Oh, right.

88
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:49,984
This is a disaster.

89
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:53,416
I don't even know what you're
talking about and I agree.

90
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:57,122
Okay, I have
to tell you something,

91
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,131
but you're not going to like it.

92
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,532
What's going on?

93
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,997
An article was just published

94
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:06,006
in<i> Scientific American</i>
about our theory.

95
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:07,607
Did they hate it?

96
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,679
No. No, they loved it.

97
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,278
They, uh, couldn't say enough
nice things about it.

98
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,845
So what's the problem?

99
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,318
You know how the<i> PennySaver</i>
only has my name...

100
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,583
Sheldon!

101
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:23,255
They didn't mention you
in the article.

102
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:24,654
Only me.

103
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,461
Really?

104
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:27,589
I know.

105
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:29,798
It's not fair.

106
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,706
Let the anger
go, buddy.

107
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,138
You just...

108
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,843
you relax all
your muscles.

109
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,578
Except for your pubococcygeus
and anal sphincter.

110
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,146
Let's keep those tight.

111
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:47,417
Uh, that-that's not necessary.

112
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,015
It is-- they're what hold back
the urine and the feces.

113
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:52,951
Look, maybe-maybe
you shouldn't read it.

114
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,887
It'll only make you feel worse.

115
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,423
“Cooper and his team”?

116
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:59,897
You should know
I had nothing to do with that.

117
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,962
Uh...

118
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:04,634
at least they're talking
about the theory.

119
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,865
I mean, that's what's important.

120
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:09,337
You know, you're right.

121
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,409
Yeah. You know, it's like
when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

122
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,178
created Spider-Man.

123
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,011
Stan Lee may get all the credit,

124
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:18,988
but Steve Ditko knows
he was just as important.

125
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,883
Even though Stan Lee gets
to be in all the Marvel movies.

126
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,521
And-and he's far richer.

127
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,719
And he's a household name,
you know?

128
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,023
Whereas, you know,
you say Ditko,

129
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,694
and that sounds like
a company that makes Dits.

130
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,998
That's not helping.

131
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,366
Well, I'd give more examples,

132
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:41,839
but, well, everyone in
your position's so forgettable.

133
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,606
Stuart, we're here.

134
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,478
It's nice of you to let him keep
staying at your mom's house.

135
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,078
Yeah, well, I tried putting him
out on the curb,

136
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,949
but nobody took him.

137
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,549
Hey.

138
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:58,548
Just so you know,
the power's out.

139
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,747
What happened?

140
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:02,050
I called,
they said a transformer blew.

141
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,122
It's the whole block.

142
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:04,354
Should be fixed by tomorrow.

143
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:06,184
Wait, when did it go out?

144
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:07,656
In the middle of the night.

145
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,361
Oh, my God.

146
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,730
Howie, what's wrong?

147
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,239
It's all defrosting.

148
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,904
It's okay. It's just food.

149
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:21,683
It's not just food.

150
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,747
This is the last food
my mother ever made.

151
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:27,083
This is her
last brisket.

152
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,755
This is her
last meatloaf.

153
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:30,219
This is her last...

154
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,824
I have no idea
what this is, but...

155
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:37,695
it's the last one.

156
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,295
Everything okay?

157
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:40,495
No.

158
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,495
All Ma's food is
gonna be ruined.

159
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,903
Well, why don't we take it home
and put it in our freezer?

160
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,534
You don't want
to do that.

161
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,502
Refreezing not only
removes moisture,

162
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,805
but it creates ice crystals
in the fibers of the meat

163
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,708
that can compromise
its taste and texture.

164
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,443
What? I saw a teachable moment.

165
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:59,875
I dropped some culinary science.

166
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,747
What should we do?

167
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:06,083
I'll tell you exactly
what we're gonna do.

168
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:07,924
We're gonna eat it.

169
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,820
There's, like, 20 pounds
of food in there.

170
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:10,924
All you said

171
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,493
was I had to get rid of things.

172
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:15,495
You didn't say they couldn't
pass through my colon first.

173
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:18,767
Howie...

174
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:20,400
Okay.

175
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:22,872
Then how about this?

176
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:25,042
Let's invite everyone
over to dinner.

177
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,050
It'll be like Ma's feeding us
one last time.

178
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:31,954
I love that.

179
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:35,586
Me, too.

180
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,586
Oh, look,
we've got enough ketchup

181
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,922
to cover every ounce of it.

182
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:46,064
I mean, who even reads
<i>Scientific American?</i>

183
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,934
It's kind of
a big deal.

184
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,332
If it's such a big deal,
how come the biggest celebrity

185
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:56,066
they could get for the cover
is a molecule?

186
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,802
Can we please just
stop talking about it?

187
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,674
I'm sorry.
What can I do?

188
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:03,842
Nothing, I'm fine.

189
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:06,146
No, no.
I'm gonna cheer you up.

190
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,780
Here we go.

191
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,052
What are we doing?

192
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:12,852
I am taking you shopping.
Oh.

193
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:16,524
My baby is sad, and I'm gonna
make him happy again.

194
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:18,388
Look, I know shopping
cheers you up,

195
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,395
but it's just not
really my thing.

196
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:22,060
Well, what about
this helicopter

197
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,731
you control with an iPad?

198
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:26,634
Does it have
a camera in it?

199
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:30,032
It does have
a camera in it.

200
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:32,798
Baby's listening.

201
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,565
Leonard?

202
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,499
- Leonard?
- Leonard?

203
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,602
What?

204
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,873
I spoke to the reporter
at the magazine.

205
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,273
What happened?
Did you tell him it was my idea?

206
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,305
I did.

207
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,145
Thank you. What did he say?

208
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:49,977
He said they made
the editorial decision

209
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:52,017
to only cite the lead scientist.

210
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,521
Why did he think
you're the lead scientist?

211
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:56,417
It was my idea!

212
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,655
You know,
for an extra four bucks,

213
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:59,590
I can have this thing
here tomorrow.

214
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:01,758
Well, I know it
was your idea,

215
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,926
but the reporter said he's been
following my work for a while,

216
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:06,926
and the only reason they even
mentioned it in the magazine

217
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,198
is 'cause my name is on it.

218
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,030
You know what? I did it.
What's four bucks?

219
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:12,965
If you're trying
to make me feel better,

220
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,436
it's not working.

221
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,171
Well... then what if I told you

222
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,475
that I added your name
to the cable bill?

223
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,676
No.
Oh.

224
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:26,181
That's just as well.
They had me on hold

225
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:28,211
for 20 minutes and I hung up.
I...

226
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:32,022
- Leonard?
- Leonard?

227
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:33,821
Leonard?

228
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,597
Also, Wolowitz invited us all
to dinner, so...

229
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:43,333
I'm ready whenever you are.

230
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:54,156
All he had was an idea.

231
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,891
Well, that is an important part.

232
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:57,156
Oh, please!

233
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,093
I have ideas all day long.

234
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:02,932
Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins
are allowed to pet people.

235
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:08,697
A new clothing size between
medium and large called Marge.

236
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:12,430
Snow White retold from
the point of view of Sneezy.

237
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:14,500
Why won't Doc
prescribe him something?

238
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:16,971
We finally find out.

239
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,003
But Leonard's idea was good.

240
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:24,104
Fine. Then Grumpy--
what's he so grumpy about?

241
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,842
Maybe his girlfriend
won't take his side.

242
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,948
I'm the one
who thought of it!

243
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,018
Well, didn't he do
a lot of the work?

244
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,154
But now he's happy
to let people think

245
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,889
he's responsible for everything.

246
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:41,120
And that's why you get
an iPad helicopter!

247
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:46,129
Is it my fault I have a much
bigger reputation than he does?

248
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,328
It's not your fault.

249
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,231
Is it my fault
that my name came first

250
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,894
on the paper alphabetically?

251
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,102
Not your fault.

252
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:53,933
Is it my fault
that when the reporter cited me

253
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,035
as the lead scientist
I didn't correct him?

254
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:58,801
Hey, look at that pretty bird.

255
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,072
He always needs
all the attention.

256
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,239
He's such a baby.

257
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,806
I know, I know.

258
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:07,406
I swear, he is never ever
playing with my helicopter.

259
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,245
Okay, I'll start heating
some of this stuff up.

260
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,517
Thanks.

261
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,014
Oh, man.

262
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:20,883
This is the boutonniere
from my high school prom...

263
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:25,615
...a piece of cake
from my Bar Mitzvah.

264
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,151
Did she throw
anything away?

265
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,319
No.

266
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,724
If I find my foreskin,
I'm gonna kill myself.

267
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:36,822
Okay, so we've got, um,

268
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:39,723
three briskets, four
meatloafs, one lasagna...

269
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,522
No, that's noodle kugel.

270
00:11:41,524 --> 00:11:43,654
One Jewish lasagna...

271
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:47,725
...two pound cakes that are
about eight pounds each,

272
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,860
and one giant container
of matzah ball soup.

273
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:55,228
Ma always kept it on hand,

274
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,027
in case I got sick.

275
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:02,834
She thought she could cure
anything with her cooking.

276
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:05,937
Even the time
I got food poisoning.

277
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,779
From her cooking.

278
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,444
You okay?

279
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,451
Yeah, I'm okay.

280
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,987
Let's get started.

281
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,649
You got it.

282
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,623
I'm never
gonna talk to her again.

283
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,584
Should we tell
everyone not to come?

284
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:40,683
No. I want to do this.

285
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:43,754
Okay. Well, I'll keep
it together if you can.

286
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:46,018
Okay.

287
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:49,458
I'm not making any promises!

288
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,227
Glad you guys
could make it.

289
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,194
Of course.

290
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:56,698
Wow, it looks really
pretty in here.

291
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,234
Yeah, turns out half a dozen
menorahs really sets a mood.

292
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:03,568
So, Stuart,
have you thought about

293
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,441
what you'd do
if Howard sells the house?

294
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,576
And there goes the mood.

295
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,639
Hi. Hello.

296
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,573
Oh, and a special
hello to Leonard,

297
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:15,306
who needs to be
mentioned by name.

298
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,944
Subtle.

299
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,440
But you got it, right?

300
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,246
Hey, guys.

301
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:22,676
Hey.
Hi. Hello.

302
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,947
I just want
everyone to know,

303
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:27,084
uh, tonight's not
a sad occasion.

304
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:28,980
Yeah, we just want to have
the kind of dinner

305
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,651
that we've all had here
so many times before.

306
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:33,418
Good food, good friends, and
sometime around midnight,

307
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,149
heartburn that makes
you pray for death.

308
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:39,155
Do you need any help
in the kitchen?

309
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:41,753
No, we got it. You guys
make yourselves comfortable.

310
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:46,320
All right, hey, you two, we're
here for Howard right now, okay?

311
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:48,361
Yes, so please
behave yourselves.

312
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:50,257
Fine.
Of course.

313
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,860
So I heard you two, uh,
wrote a paper together.

314
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,227
How's that going?

315
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:03,033
This food is amazing.

316
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:05,666
Mm, and not
a vegetable in sight.

317
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:06,906
That's not true.

318
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,505
We've got tomatoes right here.

319
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:14,282
All these bright people sitting
around a table by candlelight.

320
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:17,577
Feels like we could be an
18th century French salon.

321
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,017
Indeed.

322
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,123
Penny, a salon is a gathering

323
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,258
where intellectuals
entertained each other

324
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,625
with sparkling conversations
about issues of the day.

325
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:28,960
Oh, so it's like<i> The View.</i>

326
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:35,801
Sheldon,<i> The View</i> is a daytime
talk show hosted by women.

327
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,908
Oh, I'm aware.

328
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,508
It features Whoopi Goldberg.

329
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,412
She played Guinan on
<i>Star Trek: Next Gen.</i>

330
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,814
Penny,<i> Next Gen</i>
refers to<i> Star Trek...</i>

331
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:46,119
Shut up.

332
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:51,092
I would like to
propose a salon topic.

333
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:52,524
Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

334
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,736
The lead in<i> The Hunger</i>
<i>Games</i> is a woman.

335
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:57,074
Marvel has made
“Tor” a female.

336
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,843
Wait, who's Tor?

337
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:03,013
You know, Tor,
the God of “Tunder.”

338
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,685
As I was saying,
is this a sign

339
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:09,959
that our society is
approaching gender equality?

340
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:13,463
Certainly a lot more women
are reading comic books now.

341
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:14,559
It's true.

342
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:18,631
At the store, I had to put
a seat on the toilet.

343
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,064
We won't know
if there's equality

344
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:21,903
until female Thor has a baby

345
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:25,335
and the Avengers are cool with
her pumping breast milk at work.

346
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,173
I wonder if only a baby
who is worthy

347
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,173
can suckle at the bosom of Thor.

348
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,213
Okay, new salon topic.

349
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:35,045
Salons-- dumb thing
from a long time ago

350
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:38,285
or interesting thing made dumb
by talking about superheroes?

351
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,453
Discuss.

352
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,220
I don't believe it matters
what the topic is.

353
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,451
What's crucial for a salon

354
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:46,955
is that we conduct
the discussion

355
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:49,355
in an elevated
and insightful way.

356
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,260
It's all about the execution.

357
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:54,929
Of course you'd focus on that
rather than the inspiration.

358
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,497
Uh, new salon topic.

359
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:59,567
What's more important,
an idea or its execution?

360
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,063
Oh, that's fun.

361
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,703
Yeah, good for you, Leonard.

362
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,303
That's a lovely little notion.

363
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:05,503
Kind of like,

364
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,038
“I wish I could talk
to my uncle in Chicago.”

365
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,140
Yeah, now stand back
while I invent the telephone.

366
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:13,139
“Hello? Oh, hold on.”

367
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,339
Leonard, it's your uncle.

368
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,748
He says you just got burned.

369
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,885
Sheldon.

370
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,350
You guys.
No, it's okay.

371
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:22,717
We're all adults trying to have
an intelligent discussion.

372
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:23,853
At least I am.

373
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,221
Howard, what
do you think?

374
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:29,958
Well, I guess, as an engineer,
I lean towards execution.

375
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,029
I spend my days

376
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,293
trying to take

377
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,998
ideas and make them real.

378
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,269
Well said, old chap.

379
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,967
I thought eloquence had died;
here it stands before us.

380
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:40,944
Starting today, it'll go:
Gettysburg Address,

381
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,744
“I have a dream”
and what you just said.

382
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:45,080
Oh, now he's a genius?

383
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:47,582
All you ever do is make fun
of him and engineering.

384
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:50,678
Leonard, please.
His mother just died.

385
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,581
You're being ridiculous.

386
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,716
Yeah, so are you.

387
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:55,348
Guys, if I wanted to hear
people be bitchy,

388
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,652
I'd go to my real salon.

389
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:59,452
Leonard, lots of people
could've had that idea,

390
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:00,725
but very few people could've

391
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,494
worked out the math
the way I did.

392
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,927
Lots of people
also didn't have that idea,

393
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,906
like everyone in the entire
world except for me.

394
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,771
Oh, well,
apparently Leonard thinks

395
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:11,707
he's better than everyone
in the whole world,

396
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:12,811
including those

397
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:14,147
fighting for our freedom.

398
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:15,612
Yeah, well,
I don't know about you,

399
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:17,380
but I support our boys overseas.

400
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,423
And girls.

401
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:23,257
Hey, you already ruined Thor;
give it a rest.

402
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:25,760
So I'm just supposed to be okay

403
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:27,831
with you hogging
all the credit?!

404
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,630
I didn't hog anything.

405
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,028
Unlike you and that weird
lasagna with raisins in it.

406
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,268
You want some of this?

407
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,730
- I'll give you some.
- Hey!

408
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,665
Sheldon, Leonard,
living room, right now!

409
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:47,343
She said my name first;
that must kill you.

410
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:49,510
I don't know
what you think you're doing,

411
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:51,877
but this is a very difficult
time for my husband!

412
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,677
We're eating the last food
his mother ever made,

413
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,149
and you were gonna throw it
at each other like children?!

414
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,382
Whatever it is you're
fighting about, put it aside,

415
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:01,591
go back in there
and be a good friend to Howard

416
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:04,456
or there's no dessert
for either of you!

417
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,962
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

418
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,402
And don't think...

419
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:14,707
You guys ever notice sometimes
Bernadette sounds like my mom?

420
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,811
I don't hear it.
No, not at all.

421
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:36,522
I don't think I've eaten
that much in my entire life.

422
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:39,787
It's why my people wandered
the desert for 40 years.

423
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,523
Took that long to walk it off.

424
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,256
You see, Penny, the Israelites
were in the desert...

425
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,663
Shut up!

426
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,696
So glad you two
are done fighting.

427
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:56,303
Right now, I'm just trying
to burp without throwing up.

428
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:57,367
Hang on.

429
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,341
<i>Physics Today</i>
mentioned the paper.

430
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:01,436
What'd they say?

431
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,835
Who cares?
Did they mention Leonard?

432
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:04,938
They did.

433
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,568
Yay.

434
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,011
Good news, I found more Tums.

435
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:11,793
Yay!

436
