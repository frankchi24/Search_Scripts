1
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:04,875
I just read about
an experiment designed

2
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:06,209
to see if you could
make two people fall

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:08,145
in love in a matter of hours.

4
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:09,713
That doesn't sound right.

5
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:11,982
My research has shown that
it takes three to five years

6
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,584
of shameless begging.

7
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:17,621
Honey, neither of us comes off
good in that story.

8
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:18,956
Yeah, I-I...

9
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,158
I saw that article
you're talking about.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,193
Uh, the participants
ask each other a series

11
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:25,829
of questions designed
to promote intimacy.

12
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:27,197
And then they finish it off
by staring

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,999
into each other's eyes
for four minutes.

14
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,434
Oh, that's nonsense.

15
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:32,569
I proclaimed my
love for you.

16
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,171
And the last time I
looked into your eyes

17
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:37,174
was when you thought
you had conjunctivitis.

18
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:39,443
Other than the fact
that I had it,

19
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,244
that was a magical night.

20
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:45,148
Raj, would you ever try an
experiment like that with Emily?

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,484
What? I don't need
science to win her heart.

22
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:50,387
I have my family's
wealth for that.

23
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:52,723
I'm telling you, you can't
create love in a few hours.

24
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,424
Right?
Oh, careful.

25
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:57,194
You're poking at the whole
foundation of<i> The Bachelor.</i>

26
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,562
Yeah, but

27
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:00,464
we don't have to debate this.

28
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,732
We're scientists.

29
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,867
We can conduct our own research.

30
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,802
Yeah, I propose that we imprison

31
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,104
two street people.
No.

32
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,673
And...

33
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,008
You didn't even let me finish.

34
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,909
Forget it!
Oh!

35
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:15,245
So, you can experiment
on all the apes you want.

36
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:17,848
But I want to manipulate
the emotions of two captive

37
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,817
human beings, suddenly
I'm the monster.

38
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,486
Why don't you

39
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,454
just do the test?

40
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:27,591
In the interest of science,
I'd be willing to.

41
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,192
What? You're okay with
an experiment where you have

42
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:32,562
to answer awkward questions
about your innermost feelings?

43
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:33,830
Yes.

44
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:35,966
Please, can I do it
with him? Please?!

45
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:39,636
I've been listening
to Sheldon's feelings on things

46
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:42,172
for ten years.
Tag, you're it.

47
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:44,841
Yeah, but what
if the experiment works?

48
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,610
I'm not gonna fall
in love with Sheldon.

49
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:47,677
That's what I said.

50
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,246
Before I knew it,
he pontificated his way

51
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:51,281
right into my heart.

52
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:54,017
Uh, fun fact--
"pontificate"

53
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,119
comes from the Latin
word "pontifex,"

54
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,388
which means "bridge
builder" or "Pope."

55
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:02,993

66
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,895
Just out of curiosity, Penny,

67
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:39,129
if this experiment does
make us fall in love,

68
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,431
would you drive me
to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin

69
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,301
for Gary Con?

70
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,103
It's the only convention
celebrating

71
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:49,472
the life and work of Gary Gygax,

72
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:52,675
the co-creator
of<i> Dungeons and Dragons.</i>

73
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,377
You know what?

74
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,145
I can honestly say
if we fall in love,

75
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,147
not only will I drive you there,
I will buy you

76
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:00,349
all the dragon T-shirts
you want.

77
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,453
Okay, babe, let's do this.

78
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:09,625
You guys are
really being calm

79
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:11,761
about Penny and Sheldon
doing this thing.

80
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:12,895
If it were me,

81
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:14,263
I-I'd be a little nervous.

82
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:15,398
Why?
Well,

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,599
even if the study's nonsense,

84
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,235
I-I don't believe
in tempting fate.

85
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:21,304
Same reason I wouldn't
use a Ouija board,

86
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:23,906
or pick a fight
with an Asian guy.

87
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:27,009
He probably doesn't know karate,
but... why risk it?

88
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,345
I think we're safe.

89
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:30,580
Well, that's what the bullies

90
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:31,881
at Bruce Lee's
high school thought.

91
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:33,015
And then, bam!

92
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,984
Karate.

93
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:36,719
Well,
are we just gonna

94
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,721
sit here while they do
the experiment?

95
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:40,256
The two of us could do it.

96
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:41,924
Yeah, sure, that might be fun.

97
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:42,892
What's the first question?

98
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:44,260
Hang on.

99
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:45,494
Okay.

100
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:49,232
"Given the choice
of anyone in the world,

101
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:52,602
whom would you want
as a dinner guest?"

102
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:53,936
Hmm.

103
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,606
I can honestly say Penny.

104
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,408
Oh... then I choose a janitor.

105
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,944
'Cause I'm about to throw up.

106
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:04,547
I'm in love.

107
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,183
Let's do something else.

108
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:09,418
Ooh, uh, Emily
gets off work soon.

109
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,187
Why don't the four of us go out?

110
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,221
Okay.
Sounds good.

111
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,522
Should we call
Howard and Bernadette?

112
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:15,057
I don't know what time
their plane gets in,

113
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,993
but let me, let me
shoot them a text.

114
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,195
Did he say anything
about the funeral?

115
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:22,732
Not much, but he seemed to
be in a pretty good place.

116
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:24,066
Are you kidding me?!

117
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,902
You lost my mother's ashes?!

118
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:29,205
No, I-I'm just saying
that sometimes

119
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,740
bags are misrouted.

120
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:32,675
All right, fine.
Where did you misroute

121
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,477
the only woman
who ever loved me?

122
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,613
The first... well,
first, I meant first.

123
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:40,116
I just need some information.

124
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:42,084
Uh, what's the flight number?

125
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:43,352
816.

126
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:44,987
I really did mean first.

127
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,390
Just drop it.

128
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,924
And can you describe the bag?

129
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:50,259
Um, well,

130
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,327
it's, uh, black.

131
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,628
There's a red ribbon
tied to the handle...

132
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,097
The world's greatest mom
is in the shoe compartment!

133
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,234
You ready to begin?

134
00:04:58,236 --> 00:04:59,769
Yup. Be right there.

135
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:01,404
I assume you don't want wine.

136
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:03,439
Correct. You're not
supposed to drink alcohol

137
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,941
when operating heavy machinery.

138
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:07,843
What heavy machinery?

139
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:13,182
Let's just start.

140
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,418
Well, as a Texas gentleman,

141
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,453
I'm inclined to
say ladies first.

142
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:20,356
Although, I'm concerned that
level of politeness and charm

143
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:23,793
might make you fall in love with
me before the test even begins.

144
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,761
Perhaps we should flip a coin.

145
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,563
Or if you're familiar
with the rules

146
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:28,964
of Rock, Paper, Scissors...

147
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,232
Question one.

148
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:32,201
"Given the choice

149
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:33,769
"of anyone in the world,
whom would you want

150
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:35,438
as a dinner guest?"

151
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,772
Hmm.

152
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:38,007
Living or dead?

153
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,942
Just says "anyone in the world."

154
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:41,210
I guess that means living.

155
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,311
Ah, that's just as well.

156
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:44,313
As much as I'd love
to meet Euclid--

157
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:46,048
inventor of the
geometric proof--

158
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,650
he probably wore
sandals and I cannot

159
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:50,052
look at toes during dinner.

160
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,322
Oh, I know!

161
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,057
The person I'd most
like to have dinner with

162
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,427
is myself.

163
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,895
You sure that's your choice?

164
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:02,031
'Cause I've had that dinner.

165
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,466
Well, I haven't.

166
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:05,368
And while they say
never meet your heroes,

167
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,303
I just don't see how
I could disappoint.

168
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,538
Who would you choose?

169
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,741
Robert Downey, Jr.
You...

170
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:12,908
Oh!

171
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,911
I didn't think of Iron Man.

172
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,048
You know, maybe after
myself and I have dinner,

173
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,417
we can meet you two for dessert.

174
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:26,088
So, what do you
guys want to do?

175
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,124
Well, we're the ones
tagging along, you pick.

176
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,191
Ooh!

177
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:31,193
Have you ever been
to an escape room?

178
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,795
Mm-mm, what's that?
Um...

179
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,296
it's kind of like
interactive theater,

180
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,698
except you have
to solve puzzles

181
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,466
in a certain amount
of time to get out.

182
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:38,734
There's one downtown
where they

183
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,302
trap you in a room
with a zombie.

184
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:42,304
Oh!

185
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:44,607
So, kind of like what's
happening with Penny right now.

186
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:49,712
"What would constitute

187
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:52,248
a perfect day for you?"

188
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,983
Uh, well...

189
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:57,453
I'd probably sleep in,
do a little yoga,

190
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,455
then lie on the beach while

191
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:02,191
cute cabana boys
brought me drinks and...

192
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:04,293
probably get a massage
and then cap off the night

193
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,295
with some dancing.

194
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:08,564
That's it?
Yeah, why?

195
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:10,433
You didn't mention Leonard.

196
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,904
He's there.

197
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:17,339
I don't think so.

198
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:18,607
Leonard can't stand

199
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:22,111
yoga, the beach,
massages or dancing.

200
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,179
Yeah, well,
he brought a book, okay?

201
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,414
What's yours?
Yeah...

202
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,417
Uh, I wake up.

203
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,587
Uh, I enjoy some French
toast with butter and syrup.

204
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,657
Uh, then a wormhole opens,

205
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,160
and whisks me millions of years

206
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:40,796
into the future where
my towering intellect

207
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:44,300
is used to save the last
remnants of mankind

208
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:46,802
from a predatory alien race.

209
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,240
Interesting,
you didn't mention Amy.

210
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,911
Who do you think made the French
toast with butter and syrup?

211
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:58,547
You're about to enter the lab

212
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,916
of the late Dr. David Saltzberg.

213
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,751
While conducting studies
on slowing

214
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,621
the aging process, there was
a catastrophic accident

215
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,456
and he died.

216
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:10,860
Or did he?

217
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,229
Ladies?

218
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,930
Are you being polite or scared?

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,100
Yup.

220
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,605
Ah, what a room!

221
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,874
Oh-oh!
Oh!

222
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:28,444
This is cool.

223
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:29,845
So, how do we start?

224
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,248
We have to look for the clues
hidden around the room.

225
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,716
Uh, wasn't there
supposed to be a zombie?

226
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,219
Ooh!

227
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,222
Okay, let's hope
one of the clues

228
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,558
is written on a pair
of clean underwear.

229
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:46,328
Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz?

230
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,565
As far as I can tell,
your bag arrived in Los Angeles.

231
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,166
So, where is it?

232
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,868
I don't know, perhaps somebody

233
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,803
took it off the carousel
by mistake?

234
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:58,040
So, some stranger has my mom?

235
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,842
Is that what you're telling me?

236
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:03,612
My poor mother can be anywhere
in Los Angeles right now?

237
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,215
I-I wish I was telling you that.

238
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:07,650
Um...

239
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:08,817
but the passenger
could've gotten

240
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,719
on an international flight.

241
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,788
Oh, okay, great!

242
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,357
So, your entire job is
to find lost luggage,

243
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,892
and you've narrowed
down the location

244
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:20,162
of my mother to
the planet Earth!

245
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:21,497
I'm sorry!

246
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:23,933
W-Would 500
frequent-flyer miles help?

247
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,335
That could get you
to Sacramento.

248
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,307
"If you could
wake up tomorrow

249
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:34,643
"having gained any
one quality or ability,

250
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,111
what would it be?"

251
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:38,614
Well, not to steal
from the Bible,

252
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:42,384
but turning water into wine
sounds pretty good.

253
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:48,424
I don't think you're
taking this seriously.

254
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,092
Come on, I'm just having
some fun with you.

255
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:51,226
I believe

256
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:53,329
what you're doing is using humor

257
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,397
to avoid vulnerability.

258
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,566
Fine.

259
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,202
Honestly...

260
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:03,038
if I could have one quality...

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,809
I wish I could be
as smart as you guys.

262
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:10,145
Ha! Keep dreaming.

263
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,747
Sheldon!

264
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:12,815
I'm sorry.

265
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,617
That was me having
fun with you.

266
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:16,185
Look.

267
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,354
You may not be as...

268
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,657
academically inclined as are we.

269
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,826
Yes, that's how you say it.

270
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:25,761
But...

271
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:29,598
You possess an
intelligence I envy.

272
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,034
Which leads me to my answer.

273
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:33,769
I would choose the ability

274
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:36,338
to read people's minds.

275
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,575
Well, I can't read
people's minds.

276
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:41,043
Actually, that's not true.

277
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,378
I can read men's minds.

278
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,847
But only 'cause it's
usually the one thing.

279
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:49,251
When are we going
to get robot eyes?

280
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:52,955
You're all alike.

281
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:55,324
Well, what I meant was...

282
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:57,693
I often misinterpret

283
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:59,395
how others are feeling.

284
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,331
Like, I can't always tell
if someone is only joking

285
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,333
or laughing at me.

286
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,769
You know, like, uh, if they're
mad at something I've done

287
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,737
or just in a bad mood.

288
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,639
It-it's incredibly stressful.

289
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,509
Really? You always
seem so confident.

290
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:14,743
Well, I'm not.

291
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:16,578
And if I could read
people's minds,

292
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,815
life would be so much simpler.

293
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:22,751
Well, now I wish I had

294
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,554
the ability to make
that stuff easier for you.

295
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:28,757
Thank you.

296
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,396
Wow, I just felt this wave

297
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:37,966
of affection for you.

298
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:41,637
You sure it's not
too much Bible juice?

299
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,308
And the wave is gone.

300
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:55,445
Brains!

301
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:59,015
Keep it down!
We're working here.

302
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,450
Okay, we've got
the cipher decoded!

303
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,651
How's it going
with the globe?

304
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,619
We used the coordinates
to locate the cities.

305
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,188
I'm putting the city names
in the grid now.

306
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,956
I'm sure that'll give us
the code to the safe.

307
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,624
Solve puzzle too fast!

308
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,226
Slow down!

309
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:11,828
Yup! Got the code.

310
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,463
Just saying...

311
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:16,632
no refund for finish early!

312
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,572
Sure you don't want to go home?

313
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:25,141
When the bag's returned,
they'll deliver it to us.

314
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:28,111
No, I'm not leaving without her.

315
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,279
All right, we'll wait.

316
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,818
I could've driven her.

317
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,487
What?

318
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,757
The day she left for Florida.

319
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,726
She asked me to drive her
to the airport.

320
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,964
I-I was too busy.

321
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,665
And...

322
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,369
I made her take a cab.

323
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:57,707
I was too busy.

324
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,543
There's no way
you could've known.

325
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,347
Be right back.

326
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:09,118
Excuse me?

327
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
Yes?

328
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,856
You better find
my husband's mother

329
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,224
'cause one way or another,

330
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:18,694
we're walking out of this
airport with a dead woman!

331
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:25,368
Which book are we looking for?
Uh...

332
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,136
<i>Origin of Species.</i>

333
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,338
Here it is.

334
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,373
There's a black light.

335
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,675
Oh, hang on.

336
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,578
Oh, okay.

337
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,113
Uh, "Brothers and sisters

338
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,781
"I have none,
but this man's father

339
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:42,151
is my father's son.
Who am I looking at?"

340
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,023
Yeah, yeah, we get it--
you want brains. Calm down.

341
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,991
Well, if I don't have a brother,

342
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,561
my father's son is me.

343
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,096
And if I'm this man's father,
then he's my son.

344
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:55,398
The answer's "son."

345
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,632
Ooh! There's a picture
of the sun over there.

346
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,234
I bet the key's behind it.

347
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:01,037
Could be somewhere else!

348
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,405
Oh, got the key!

349
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,140
So, that's the key to the door?

350
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,274
That's it?

351
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:08,411
We spent $200
on six minutes of fun?

352
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,746
It's like when you bought that
remote-controlled helicopter,

353
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:13,516
and it just... flew away.

354
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:18,154
Sorry, guys. Really thought
the puzzles would be better.

355
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:21,524
Well, to be fair, we do all
have advanced degrees.

356
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:25,394
Remember that
before you post on Yelp!

357
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,433
"If you were to die this evening
with no opportunity

358
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,968
"to communicate with anyone,

359
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,904
what would you most regret
not having told someone?"

360
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,673
So, it would be today?

361
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,675
Huh.

362
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,677
Well, I suppose there's
something satisfying

363
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,480
about dying on my birthday.

364
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:46,816
Today's your birthday?

365
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:47,950
Yes.

366
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,986
Well, that's
always been a secret!

367
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,954
Not even Amy knows!

368
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:55,825
Well, I don't enjoy presents.

369
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:57,293
And the thought of people

370
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,729
jumping out and yelling
"Surprise!" fills me

371
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,797
with more dread than the words

372
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,834
"George Lucas Director's Cut."

373
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,169
So, why did you finally tell me?

374
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:10,006
The point of the experiment is

375
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:12,308
to be completely honest
with each other.

376
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,278
Well, thank you
for sharing it with me.

377
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,113
I won't tell anyone.

378
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,015
Thank you.

379
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,149
That is so funny.

380
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,418
I never would have
pegged you for a Pisces.

381
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,521
You're making it difficult
to love you right now.

382
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,259
Great news!
Your bag was returned.

383
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,028
Oh, thank God!

384
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,729
It's okay, she's here!

385
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:34,830
Ma's here.

386
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,365
Okay, thank you so much.

387
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,000
Ma?

388
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:39,802
I'm sorry I didn't

389
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,405
take you to the airport.
I just want you to know

390
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:45,308
that I'll never forgive myself
for being so selfish.

391
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,809
And I promise

392
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,644
to keep you close

393
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:51,747
for the rest of my life.

394
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:55,518
Oh, no. That thing's gonna
end up in my bedroom.

395
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,256
That's it! We're done
with the questions.

396
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:01,791
All that's left to do is

397
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,758
stare into each other's eyes

398
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,226
for four minutes
without talking.

399
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,062
Okay. Wait, hang on!

400
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,631
Bladder check.

401
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,634
We're good to go.

402
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,869
You ready?

403
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:14,937
Yes.

404
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,106
And begin.

405
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,224
This is kind of creepy.

406
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,059
We're not supposed to
talk during this part.

407
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,795
Sorry.

408
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:48,504
This is kind of creepy.

409
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:50,272
Do you want to stop?

410
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:52,174
I know you have trouble
with eye contact.

411
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,578
Well, you have a brown fleck

412
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,813
in your right iris that looks

413
00:16:57,815 --> 00:17:01,350
like a Formula One race car.

414
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:05,388
So... I'm just
concentrating on that.

415
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,958
Plus, it's easier around people
that I'm comfortable with.

416
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,628
Aw, sweetie,
I'm comfortable around you, too.

417
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,398
Of course you are,
I'm warm and soothing.

418
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,969
I'm like a human bowl
of tomato soup.

419
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,005
I meant more like
a little brother.

420
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,041
Oh.

421
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:28,110
Well, I suppose I do think
of you as a sister.

422
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,615
And sometimes, a mother.

423
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,717
It's getting creepy again.

424
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:43,959
What?

425
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,961
Just thinking about the day

426
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:47,329
I met you and Leonard.

427
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,098
It was a Monday afternoon.

428
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,368
You joined us for Indian food.

429
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,703
Can you believe
it's been eight years?

430
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,807
Yeah, and you're
still eating our food.

431
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,578
I... can't remember a time

432
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,314
you guys weren't in my life.

433
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,983
I remember it perfectly.

434
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,554
But I have an eidetic memory.

435
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,090
If you're interested,
I also remember

436
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,026
how much you owe us
for the food.

437
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,199
That's it.

438
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,467
That wasn't so bad.

439
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,668
No, it wasn't.

440
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,336
Uh, now let's tabulate

441
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,637
the results of the experiment.

442
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,339
Okay.

443
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:34,343
I think it's safe to say that
you're not in love with me

444
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,245
and I'm not in love with you.

445
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,881
And psychology has once again

446
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:42,718
proved itself the doofus
of the sciences.

447
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,087
Well, maybe.

448
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,022
But I'm still glad we did it.

449
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:49,558
I do feel closer to you.

450
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,528
And I, you.

451
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,664
And yes, that's
how you say that.

452
00:18:57,401 --> 00:19:00,803
Yeah, so, given our
newfound intimacy,

453
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,371
I'd say we have

454
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,873
some hard choices to make.

455
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,974
Like what?

456
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:08,344
Gary Con--
do we fly or drive?

457
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:09,745
Do we wear costumes?

458
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,947
And if so...

459
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:14,884
who gets to be Gary?

460
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:26,151
Thank you for walking me home.

461
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:28,687
I just want to make sure
you get there safe.

462
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:33,553
Well, this is me.

463
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,756
It's been a very
interesting evening.

464
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,391
It really has.

465
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,095
Surprise!
Aah!

466
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:48,433
And after I let you be Gary!
