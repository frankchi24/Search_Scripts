1
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:10,298
Can you believe it's been
five years since our first date?

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,733
I know.

3
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:17,905
Do you think I should start
watching<i> The Flash</i> TV show?

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,611
That's what
you're thinking about?

5
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:25,513
Well, one of the things.

6
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:28,983
Are any of them me?

7
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:29,985
Yes.

8
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,586
I thought, “I can't decide

9
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:33,621
“if I should watch
<i>The Flash</i> TV show.

10
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,690
I know, I'll ask Amy.”

11
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:39,026
Anyway...

12
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,096
What are you doing?

13
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:45,132
You're right, you did
kind of kill the mood.

14
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,301
I didn't kill anything.

15
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:50,304
You did, talking about
your stupid TV show.

16
00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:51,939
Excuse me.

17
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:55,042
Starting to watch a television
show that might run for years

18
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:56,511
isn't a decision
to take lightly.

19
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:58,112
I'm wrestling with

20
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:59,981
a big commitment issue here.

21
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:01,315
Really?

22
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:05,086
That's the commitment issue
you're wrestling with?

23
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,320
Sheldon,

24
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:08,089
do you understand the irony

25
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,525
of your fixation on a man
with super speed,

26
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:13,261
while after five years
all I can get out of you

27
00:01:13,263 --> 00:01:15,997
is a distracted make-out session
on a couch?

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,867
Irony's not really
my strong suit.

29
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,703
But I have been getting better
with sarcasm,

30
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:25,006
if you want to give that a try.

31
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,675
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

32
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:31,412

Original Air Date on May 7,

42
00:01:56,435 --> 00:02:02,235
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

43
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:03,832
I don't want to rush you,

44
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,767
but I'm closing
a little early tonight.

45
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,440
Ooh. Hot date?

46
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,975
Uh, no. I overheard
Bernadette tell Howard

47
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,443
she was making him a meat loaf,

48
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:14,045
and you don't have
to not ask me twice.

49
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,817
If I stick a lightbulb on this,
wouldn't it make a great lamp

50
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,186
for my bedroom?

51
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,955
You're kidding, right?

52
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,924
Oh. Is this freaking you out?

53
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:28,927
I guess I'm just more
of a Pottery Barn,

54
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,962
Crate and Barrel kind of guy.

55
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:34,799
Maybe Pier 1
if I really want to cut loose.

56
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,469
All right. Never mind.

57
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,504
No, no, no.
Hey, you should totally get it.

58
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:40,972
In fact, I'll buy it for you.

59
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:42,407
Sold!

60
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:46,277
Raj, you don't have to do that.

61
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,246
Too late!
No returns!

62
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,385
That was really intense.

63
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:56,187
Well, now we know, next time
we go to the farmers' market,

64
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,392
the order is petting zoo first,
then buy vegetables.

65
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,729
Hey.

66
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,399
Oh, good. You're here.
I need your assistance.

67
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:10,168
Can it wait until I put
a Band-Aid on a goat bite?

68
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,271
What happened?
Oh.

69
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,907
Your buddy got mugged
by some baby farm animals.

70
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,777
Been there.
Mmm.

71
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,678
So what do you need help with?

72
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,815
Amy's mad at me,
and I'm not clear why.

73
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,151
Okay. Were you talking
before she got upset?

74
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:27,886
Yes.
That's probably it.

75
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:30,855
What'd you say to her?

76
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:32,750
Well, I just asked her
if I should start watching

77
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,517
the new<i> Flash</i> TV series.

78
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,019
And that made her angry?

79
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,921
Baffling, right? We were necking

80
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:40,824
like a couple of hooligans
under the school bleachers.

81
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:43,393
I stopped so I could ask
the question.

82
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:48,131
Next thing I know, good-bye,
kissy face. Hello, yelly face.

83
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,266
Well, Sheldon, when
you're kissing a girl,

84
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,735
she expects the
attention to be on her.

85
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:54,237
It was. I asked her

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,040
if<i> she</i> thought
I should watch<i> The Flash.</i>

87
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:00,243
Yeah. I'm tapping out.
Leonard?

88
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,579
I'm gonna guess that your main
concern is the time commitment

89
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:05,014
of watching an entire season
of a new show.

90
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:06,282
Oh, no, not just a season.

91
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:08,351
If I'm in,
I'm in for the whole run,

92
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,154
even if the quality declines.

93
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,957
I get it.
<i>Smallville</i> almost wrecked you.

94
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,659
Yeah. Exactly.

95
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:17,927
You know, I waited ten years

96
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:20,430
to see a guy
everyone knows can fly, fly.

97
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:22,832
Wait, what is wrong
with you two?

98
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:25,335
He was talking about television
during their date night.

99
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:28,404
Oh, not just date night--
our fifth anniversary.

100
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:30,206
Okay, see, that's even dumber
than you wondering

101
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,910
if being bitten by a goat would
give you the powers of a goat.

102
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:38,214
If that happens,
don't make me wait ten years

103
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:40,483
to watch you eat a tin can.

104
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:45,788
You guys ever notice that Emily
has a bit of a twisted side?

105
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,757
You mean
'cause she has weird tattoos?

106
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,860
No, because she wants to have
sex with me in a graveyard.

107
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:55,732
One more time?

108
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,600
She and I were supposed to watch

109
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:59,636
the new<i> Avengers</i> movie tonight,
but it was sold out.

110
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,804
So I said,
“What else do you want to do?”

111
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:03,439
She said,
“Let's go to a cemetery

112
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,909
and do it on somebody's grave.”

113
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:10,480
Like, a random person
or somebody she knew?

114
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:13,349
What difference
does it make?

115
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:14,884
Well, if it's

116
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:16,686
her father's grave
and they didn't get along,

117
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:19,122
then you know
she holds a grudge.

118
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:22,792
The only issue is that everybody
has their own thing.

119
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:24,460
And as long
as it's two consenting adults,

120
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:26,329
I guess
I don't see the harm in it.

121
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:27,897
Well, what if it's
one consenting adult

122
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,532
and one adult who
pretends to consent

123
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:31,401
because he's afraid
of being alone?

124
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:34,771
Well, then I guess
bring a blanket.

125
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,773
The grass gets damp at night.

126
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,276
I don't know, guys.

127
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:42,245
Maybe this relationship
isn't for me.

128
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:44,414
Maybe I should break up
with her.

129
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,316
Right. You're gonna
break up with a girl

130
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:48,918
who has sex with you.
Can you believe this guy?

131
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,056
I think if Raj wants to break up
with a girl, he can do it.

132
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:54,824
How are you saying that
with a straight face?

133
00:05:54,826 --> 00:05:57,060
I don't know.

134
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,096
You guys are being jerks.

135
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:02,265
Buddy, other than Jenny Craig,

136
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:05,001
you've never broken up
with a girl in your life.

137
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:06,202
You're one
to talk.

138
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:07,437
You've been complaining
about Stuart

139
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,705
living here for the past year.

140
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,340
I don't see you showing him
the door.

141
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:11,641
That's not the
same thing.

142
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:12,976
Emily's a person.

143
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,711
Stuart's more like
an infestation,

144
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,179
something you spray for.

145
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,948
Baloney, okay?
You two are

146
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,784
as afraid of hurting
someone's feelings as I am.

147
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:24,320
That's not true. We were just
laughing right in your face.

148
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,492
Thanks for cooking.
Mmm. My pleasure.

149
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:32,595
That carrot was delicious.
Yeah.

150
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:35,164
I wish I'd fought harder
for the rest of 'em.

151
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,937
Still haven't heard
from her?

152
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,473
No, and I'm confused.

153
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,541
It's been nearly 24 hours.

154
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:49,379
Amy should have figured out
she's wrong by now.

155
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,081
Hey, I don't think she's wrong

156
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,317
about you going too slow
in the relationship.

157
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,651
Too slow?

158
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:56,786
Yeah, you've been
going out

159
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:58,721
for years.
You haven't even slept together.

160
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:02,025
That's right.
It's called foreplay.

161
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,228
And I could make the case

162
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,897
that you two aren't moving
forward in your relationship.

163
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,998
Uh,

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,867
hello.

165
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,403
Hello.

166
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,276
No. Sheldon,
we're getting married.

167
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:22,678
But you've been engaged
for over a year now,

168
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,213
and you don't even have
a wedding date.

169
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:26,315
Well, we will. We're
just not in a rush.

170
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,384
Okay.

171
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,988
We're gonna set a date.

172
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,624
Okay. If you say so.

173
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,392
Yeah, it's just, things are good right now.
Really good.

174
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,628
I'm focusing on my job.
And we've been busy with our paper.

175
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,682
So busy.

176
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:40,864
Yeah, we'll pick a date
when we pick a date.

177
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:41,931
Yeah.

178
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:45,034
Okay.

179
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:47,170
You know, I can see
why Amy's mad at you.

180
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,771
Yeah, shut up,
Sheldon!

181
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:53,476
Did you eat
all my yogurt?

182
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:55,611
You mean the one that
makes ladies do the thing

183
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:57,080
that ladies pretend
they don't do

184
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:59,882
even though they do?

185
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:03,753
You know...

186
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:06,322
which yogurt I mean.

187
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:09,225
I didn't touch it.
Must have been Stuart.

188
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,094
Maybe Raj is right.

189
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:13,429
Maybe it's time we tell him
he needs to move out.

190
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,364
We should have done
it months ago.

191
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:16,966
I know, but his store
was reopening,

192
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:19,469
and then there were the
holidays, and then he was sick.

193
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,937
Yeah, right.

194
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,172
Sick. He didn't have jaundice.

195
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,541
He just looks like that.

196
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:33,216
All right.
Tonight's the night.

197
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:34,383
Agreed.

198
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,919
When he gets home, I'm
dropping the hammer.

199
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,855
Ooh, I like
when you take charge.

200
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:41,290
Oh, I'm not taking charge--
you're the hammer.

201
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,932
So...

202
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:52,301
why haven't we
picked a date?

203
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:53,336
You know why.

204
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:54,837
Well, of course I know why.

205
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,672
But just for fun... why?

206
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:00,610
Not in a rush, busy with work...

207
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:03,179
Things are good right now.
Really good.

208
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,781
You still want
to get married, right?

209
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:08,050
Oh, my God. Yes.
Why would you even ask that?

210
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:09,919
I don't know.
Because we don't have a date?

211
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:12,221
Well, you want a date,
pick a date.

212
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:13,422
It's not just the date.

213
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:14,824
We haven't talked
about anything.

214
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:16,726
Big wedding, small wedding,
indoor, outdoor...

215
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:21,898
Outdoor? Oh.
I can RSVP no right now.

216
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,133
Okay, indoor it is.
Big or small?

217
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:25,935
Is your dad paying for it?
I doubt it.

218
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:28,504
Okay, two friends each.

219
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:31,374
All right, well,
I want it in a church.

220
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,608
Fine. I want black-tie.

221
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,677
Fine.
I want to release butterflies.

222
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,180
Seriously? Airborne worms?

223
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,449
Okay. Well, then it's settled:

224
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:43,186
small indoor church wedding,
black-tie, no butterflies.

225
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,620
Sounds perfect.
Great.

226
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,157
You still
didn't pick a date.

227
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,126
Stay out of it!
Shut up!

228
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,969
Mmm. It's a beautiful night.

229
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,674
Oh, yes, we've
got the moon

230
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,409
and the trees and...

231
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,411
Elizabeth McNulty,

232
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:10,714
who apparently died
when she was the same age I am.

233
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:15,019
Makes you feel
alive, doesn't it?

234
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,822
So does enjoying a meal
at a well-lit restaurant,

235
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:20,424
but here we are.

236
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,227
You aren't scared, are you?

237
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:25,863
Of ghosts, no.

238
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,432
Of you, little bit.

239
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:33,070
I'm sorry I've
upset you.

240
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:35,172
I shouldn't have asked
so many questions.

241
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,373
No, it's okay.

242
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,908
Yeah, maybe it's good
you got us

243
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,810
talking about this stuff.

244
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:41,478
Well, look at that--

245
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,583
even when I'm causing problems,
I make the world a better place.

246
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:48,819
Hey, next, why don't we tackle
your penchant for whining

247
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:51,856
and Penny's love
of the ol' glug-glug?

248
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,027
Uh, Sheldon, I think
we're good for now.

249
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,362
Ah, well... very well.

250
00:10:58,364 --> 00:11:00,731
So does this mean you'll
finally pick a wedding date?

251
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,700
Here we go again.

252
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:05,502
Why is everyone so concerned
with us setting a date?

253
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:06,904
We're committed to
each other. We're happy.

254
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,406
A ceremony isn't gonna
change anything.

255
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:12,042
So you're never getting married?

256
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,612
It's his whining, isn't it?

257
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:17,514
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

258
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:22,887
It's amusing
that he doesn't hear it.

259
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:27,057
Look, all she's saying
is we are in love

260
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,459
so it doesn't matter
if we get married

261
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:31,795
tomorrow or a year from now
or 50 years from now.

262
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:34,431
Ew, 50?
We'll be old and gross.

263
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:37,134
Yeah, but we'll be old
and gross together.

264
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,569
My aunt and uncle

265
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:40,871
were married 63 years.

266
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:44,008
Towards the end, it was
like watching cheese melt.

267
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,755
Um... I'm
free tonight.

268
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,029
Are you saying
you want to get married?

269
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,865
Vegas isn't
that far away.

270
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,167
I'm in. Let's do it.

271
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:19,743
After all these years.

272
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,479
I'm really happy
for the two of you.

273
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:23,747
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

274
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,950
Now get out of my spot.

275
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:32,122
Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.

276
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,124
So remember,

277
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,859
the key is to be firm.

278
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:36,994
Show no weakness.

279
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:39,496
Right.
Good luck.

280
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:42,066
Howard Joel Wolowitz,
you get back here.

281
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:45,936
Never should have
told you my middle name.

282
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:49,373
Hey, guys.
Hey, you got a minute?

283
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,343
Sure. Uh, let me just put
this stuff in the fridge.

284
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:54,645
I felt bad for finishing
your yogurt, so I bought more.

285
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,880
And, Howard, your favorite
fruit is in season.

286
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,649
Crunch Berries.

287
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:02,286
Don't let that sway you.

288
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:05,689
It's hard not to. They taste so
much better than real berries.

289
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:09,193
What's up?

290
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:11,795
So... we need to talk.

291
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,867
You okay?

292
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:19,370
I think we should talk.

293
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:22,439
Is everything okay?

294
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:26,176
Well... you've been
living here a while now.

295
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,545
I know.
I may sell comic books at work,

296
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,180
but the real superheroes

297
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,982
are sitting
right in front of me.

298
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:37,187
Yeah...

299
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:40,491
His middle name is David. Go.

300
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:44,194
Look, I care about you a lot,

301
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:47,064
but we are very
different people.

302
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,199
Are you breaking up with me?

303
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,169
No, no, I'm just
pointing out that

304
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:55,439
you're dark on the inside
and I'm dark on the outside.

305
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:59,643
So, anyway,
what I'm trying to say is...

306
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:03,981
You need to take that?

307
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:05,282
It's just my dad,
probably calling

308
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,584
to wish me a happy birthday.

309
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:09,686
I'll call him back.

310
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:11,688
You were saying?

311
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,326
Look, Raj, be honest with me.

312
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,228
If you want to end things,
just do it.

313
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,097
Don't expect me
to do it for you.

314
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:25,803
End things? I'm trying to
tell you that I love you.

315
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:33,944
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

316
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,487
Wow, there's
a Denny's in Vegas

317
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:44,855
you can actually
get married in.

318
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:47,357
Doesn't sound very romantic.

319
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,760
Yeah, but we could get
heart-shaped pancakes.

320
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:52,229
I'm sure we'll find
a decent chapel.

321
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:54,064
Yeah.

322
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:57,034
This is crazy!
I know!

323
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,869
You think people
are gonna be mad?

324
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:01,538
Maybe. But this isn't
about them; it's about us.

325
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,641
It is.
It is about us.

326
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,276
And you know what
the best part is?

327
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:07,744
We took our time.

328
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:10,514
I mean, we met, we were friends
for a couple years,

329
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:13,917
then we got together,
and then we got untogether,

330
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,652
then we worked out
all our problems,

331
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:18,055
and now we know
everything about each other,

332
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:21,992
we can just go forward with
no surprises and no regrets.

333
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,261
Right.
No surprises.

334
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:28,132
And no regrets.

335
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,204
Uh,

336
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,407
well, there-there's
one thing

337
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,510
I feel I should tell you.

338
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:40,544
What?

339
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:43,147
You know, so we
can go into this

340
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:45,449
with no secrets
between us.

341
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:46,650
What?

342
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,356
Remember, uh,
a couple years back

343
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:55,292
when I was on that research ship
in the North Sea?

344
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:56,894
Yeah.
Okay, well,

345
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,196
there-there was a
lot of drinking

346
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,331
and craziness going on...
No, you told me.

347
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,033
Okay, um...

348
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:07,337
Well, there was this girl.

349
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:10,641
What did you do?
Nothing...

350
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:12,142
really.

351
00:16:12,144 --> 00:16:13,744
It was just kissing.

352
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:15,779
And then what?
And then nothing.

353
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:18,348
I stopped it.

354
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,219
But it still bothers me, and...

355
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,956
I wanted you to know.

356
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:31,495
All right.

357
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,532
Did you ever do anything
like this since we've been...?

358
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:38,068
Nope, never.
Oh, that's too bad.

359
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:42,339
You know, can I ask you a question?
Hmm?

360
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:43,740
Why are you
telling me this now?

361
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:47,077
Well, like I said,
we're about to get married,

362
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:49,646
and I-I want a clean slate.

363
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:50,914
No secrets.

364
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,282
Really?
Be-Because to me,

365
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:54,017
it seems like
we're about to get married

366
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,319
and you're trying
to sabotage it.

367
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:56,768
W-Would you rather
I didn't tell you?

368
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,477
No, I don't want there
to be secrets between us.

369
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,714
See, now I'm confused.

370
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,215
I mean, what-what
am I supposed to do?

371
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,951
Uh, keep your mouth
off other women.

372
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:06,253
I can do that.

373
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:07,855
Uh, uh, f-from now on,

374
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:10,691
this mouth--
you and food, that's it.

375
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,229
Okay.

376
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,331
Yeah?

377
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:21,702
Look, I'm not happy
this happened,

378
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:23,571
but I think
I can get past it.

379
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,573
I mean, we weren't
engaged at the time,

380
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,041
and it was just kissing.

381
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:28,309
Right.

382
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,778
Just kissing.

383
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,780
It wasn't even very good.

384
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,615
She was a smoker.
I'd just been seasick...

385
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,116
Okay, that's enough.
Stop talking.

386
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:43,390
So...

387
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:46,360
we're still
getting married?

388
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:48,028
Yes.

389
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,265
Because we love each other.

390
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,967
Yes.

391
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:56,237
And it's the happiest day
of our lives.

392
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,705
Don't push it.

393
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:10,972
Hello.

394
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,140
Hello.

395
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:14,742
Listen, I've been
thinking a lot

396
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:16,077
about relationships

397
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,347
and how difficult they can be,
and I think...

398
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,582
I've been thinking
about them, too, Sheldon.

399
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:26,154
Being your girlfriend
is so challenging.

400
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:27,555
Emotionally,

401
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,657
physically.

402
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:33,194
I've been incredibly patient
for years.

403
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,730
Strongly disagree.

404
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:37,498
Go on.

405
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,868
Okay, well...

406
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,939
this isn't easy to say,
because I love you,

407
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:46,674
but...

408
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:50,445
I need some time
to take a step back

409
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:53,581
and reevaluate our situation.

410
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,718
Oh.

411
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,954
I hope you understand.

412
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,058
Okay.

413
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:07,495
Bye, Sheldon.

414
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,915
Well, Gollum...

415
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:33,054
...you're an expert on rings.

416
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,789
What do I do with this one?
