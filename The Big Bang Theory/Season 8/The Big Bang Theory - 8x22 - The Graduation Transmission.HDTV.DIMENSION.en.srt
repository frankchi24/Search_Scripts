1
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:03,919
It's, like,
the best one they make,

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,954
I just can't get it to work.
I'll figure it out.

3
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:09,391
It streams HD video straight
to your phone while it's flying.

4
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:10,792
Nice.

5
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:13,095
Where were you
when I was single?

6
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:18,433
Okay, we should leave in
about an hour. You all packed?

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,769
Uh, yeah, I just need to throw
in a few last minute things--

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,071
you know, makeup,
underwear, clothes.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,641
If your bathroom floor

10
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:27,643
counts as a carry-on,
you're packed.

11
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,145
Leonard,
have you ever given

12
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,680
a high school
commencement speech before?

13
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:33,382
Nope. It's pretty exciting.

14
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:35,784
Aren't you afraid
of being blinded?

15
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,519
How would I be blinded?

16
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,187
At the end of the ceremony,

17
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,923
all the students throw
those pointy hats in the air.

18
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:44,459
It's all pomp and circumstance

19
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,029
until someone loses an eye.

20
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,664
I'll take my chances.

21
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,865
Fine.

22
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,133
I wonder if they make

23
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,368
"I told you so"
cards in braille.

24
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:56,938
Look, the problem
with commencement speeches

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,907
is that they're boring.

26
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,143
Ooh, do you own
a T-shirt cannon?

27
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,012
Why would he own
a T-shirt cannon?

28
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:06,114
I don't know. Why do I own one?

29
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,483
I think it's really nice

30
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,018
that you're sharing
this experience with Penny.

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,520
Mm, I thought
it'd be fun

32
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:13,388
to show her my old
stomping grounds.

33
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,858
I even know the exact spot
where they used to stomp me.

34
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,094
Well, now you
get to go back

35
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,462
as a successful
scientist.

36
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:22,464
With a beautiful girl
on your arm.

37
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,334
And a pointy hat sticking
out of your eyeball.

48
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:56,701
How'd you get
ready so fast?

49
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,034
Oh, I pack light.

50
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,703
Once, I got through
an entire spring break

51
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,905
with nothing
but a long T-shirt and a belt.

52
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:04,841
Why did you need a belt?

53
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:07,778
It's called an
evening look.

54
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,980
I've never been to
New Jersey before.

55
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:11,882
It gets a bad rap from shows

56
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:14,050
like <i>Jersey Shore</i>
and <i>Real Housewives.</i>

57
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,685
So it's not
really like that?

58
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,854
No, it's like that.

59
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,624
Well, I'm excited
to show you around.

60
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,726
You think we'll have time
to visit your mom over there?

61
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,796
Yes. We'll also have time to put
my junk in a garlic press,

62
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:28,165
but I'm not
doing that either.

63
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:32,436
Uh-oh.

64
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,171
I just got an alert.

65
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:35,372
Our flight's
been canceled.

66
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:36,406
What?

67
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,841
Yeah, looks like
there's a big storm

68
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:39,376
all up the East Coast.

69
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,278
Well, can we get
on another airline?

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,646
I don't think so.

71
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:43,947
So, that's it?

72
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:44,949
We're not going?

73
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,217
I guess not.

74
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,251
Well, that sucks.

75
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:49,352
Yeah.

76
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:50,620
I worked hard on
that speech, too.

77
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:52,823
Oh. You could tell it to me.

78
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:54,458
Oh, thank you,
but I'm okay.

79
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,859
Are you sure?

80
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,494
I could pretend I'm a
high school cheerleader

81
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,830
who can't control herself
around esteemed alumni.

82
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,934
Greetings, distinguished
cheerleaders.

83
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:06,203
Ooh!

84
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,840
Okay, the WiFi extender
is on, the camera's on,

85
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:11,174
they're both on
the same network;

86
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:12,509
we should be
getting an image.

87
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:14,911
All I see is a black screen.

88
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:16,546
And my own reflection.

89
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,082
I look sad.

90
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,986
Maybe we should
recalibrate it.

91
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:24,688
All right.
Step one:

92
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,723
rapidly flip
the calibration switch

93
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,758
from the fully up
to the fully down positions

94
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,427
for at least ten times.

95
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:33,330
It actually says "at least"?

96
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,965
Yeah.

97
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,533
Why would they say "at least"?

98
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:37,968
Is it ten toggles?

99
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,903
Is it 100 toggles? You know?

100
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,771
Is it 1,000 toggles?

101
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,573
10,000 toggles?
100,000 toggles?

102
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:46,076
Sheldon!

103
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,979
You see where
I'm going with this.

104
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:51,081
Just flip the switch

105
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,217
until the lights on the drone
change to solid yellow.

106
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,419
All right,
that seems simple enough.

107
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:59,489
Initiating calibration sequence.

108
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:01,558
One, two, three, four,

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,328
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

110
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:11,301
Well, I suppose ten
is technically "at least ten."

111
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:16,072
But they're still getting
at least one angry letter.

112
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,744
Now I rotate
it horizontally

113
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:24,781
on its center axis until
the lights turn green.

114
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:26,950
Initiating rotation sequence.

115
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,922
Don't look at me, initiate.

116
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,459
Oh...
What does red and yellow mean?

117
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:38,094
It means the
calibration failed.

118
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,529
We have to start over.

119
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,463
Oh. Very well.

120
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:43,567
Reinitiating
calibration sequence.

121
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,302
One, two, three, four,

122
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:48,738
five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

123
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,944
...eleven.

124
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:58,648
It's a good thing
I didn't send that letter.

125
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,190
Mm. Hello, Daddy. What's up?

126
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,626
Not much, just wanted to see
how my son's doing.

127
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:11,561
Very well, thank you.

128
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,663
Are you still dating
that dermatologist?

129
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,366
If you could feel
how soft my skin is,

130
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:19,035
you wouldn't have to ask.

131
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:22,172
Oh, and there's something else
I wanted to ask you.

132
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:26,409
Why did you spend a month's rent
on a toy helicopter?!

133
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,180
Oh, you're where that bill goes.

134
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:33,316
I'm tired of indulging
your foolish lifestyle.

135
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:34,884
It's time you learned
responsibility.

136
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,453
And the only way
to teach you that

137
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,921
is to cut off your allowance.

138
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,723
No, Daddy, no!

139
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,992
There are lots of other ways
to teach me responsibility.

140
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:43,660
I know, you can give me an egg

141
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:46,363
and make me take care of it
for a week!

142
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,665
No, my mind is made up.

143
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,966
Starting now,
you're on your own.

144
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,837
But, Daddy,
I-I miss my family so much,

145
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,106
and with you and Mummy
getting a divorce,

146
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:57,907
I feel sad and empty.

147
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,476
Buying a little toy

148
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:02,212
every now and then
helps me fill that void.

149
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:04,447
So while I can't
hug you every day,

150
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,116
flying that helicopter...

151
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:07,283
I'm cutting you off.

152
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:11,454
Just to be clear,
financially or mid-sentence?

153
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,759
No red and yellow,

154
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:17,227
no red and yellow.

155
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:18,995
Yay!
It's green!

156
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,463
We did it!

157
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,898
Oh!

158
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,236
God, if it's this much fun to
rotate, imagine when we fly it.

159
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:29,039
Okay, now all I have to do
is rotate it vertically

160
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,275
until the lights turn off.

161
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:34,110
Oh, no!
Oh!

162
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:37,213
All right,
playtime's over.

163
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:38,948
Let's open
this baby up.

164
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,217
Won't that void the warranty?

165
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,355
Sheldon, I have a master's
degree in engineering.

166
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:48,992
I wipe my bottom
with warranties.

167
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,828
Except for AppleCare.

168
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,798
That pays for itself
in the long run.

169
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,001
Hi.

170
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,235
Hey, where'd you go?

171
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:02,305
I got you a little something
to cheer you up.

172
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:03,273
Really?

173
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,908
Sex last night,
pancakes this morning--

174
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,677
Am I dying?

175
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,346
Just open it.

176
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,514
A cap and gown?

177
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,116
Why do I need a cap and gown?

178
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:16,152
Because you are giving
your commencement speech.

179
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,153
What are you talking about?

180
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,521
I called your old high school

181
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,958
and convinced them to let you
give your speech over Skype.

182
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,992
Really?

183
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:23,994
That's amazing!

184
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,096
And you gave me the robes
to give it in.

185
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:27,297
Thank you.

186
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:28,231
Yeah, now about those--

187
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,766
uh, they came from
a costume shop,

188
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,268
and all they had left
was sexy graduate,

189
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,336
so they...

190
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:36,139
might be a little short.

191
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:39,008
Short and sexy,
that's my wheelhouse.

192
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,810
Yeah!

193
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,789
Boy, oh, boy,
that's a lot of pieces.

194
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,691
You know
what they all do, right?

195
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,860
Yes, of course.

196
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,128
What about this one?

197
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,930
Well, I...
how familiar are you

198
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:03,366
with miniaturized
integrated logic circuits?

199
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:04,501
Not very.

200
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:05,668
That right there
is a miniaturized

201
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,870
integrated logic circuit.

202
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,075
So, can you
get it working?

203
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:14,744
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

204
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,147
I've built components
for the space station.

205
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,850
I thought the zero-gravity
toilet didn't work.

206
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:22,552
It worked fine,

207
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:25,355
it just wasn't designed
for Russian cosmonauts

208
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:28,024
and their potato-based diet.

209
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:29,692
Hey, guys.

210
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,127
Hey.
Hello.

211
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,096
I have to return the helicopter.
My father...

212
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:36,332
What did you do?!

213
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:38,701
Well, don't worry.

214
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,069
He went to MIT.

215
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,871
He can solve any problem,

216
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:45,308
as long as it doesn't originate
in a Russian man's colon.

217
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,617
I don't freaking
believe this!

218
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,985
Relax, it'll be fine.

219
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,620
No, you have to put
this back together

220
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,455
right now,
so I can return it!

221
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,124
You can't return it.

222
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,127
Howard wiped his bottom
with the warranty.

223
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,962
What?!

224
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,697
I think metaphorically.

225
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,133
But he was in the bathroom
for a while.

226
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:15,770
Howard, my father cut me off.

227
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,438
I have to get my money back
for this!

228
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,739
Calm down.

229
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:19,974
Okay.

230
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,709
Okay, you're right.

231
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,611
It's time for me to step up

232
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,580
and take responsibility
for my life.

233
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,982
Be a man.

234
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:33,321
Hello, Mummy.

235
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,689
Hello, Rajesh.

236
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,624
What a nice surprise.

237
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,925
Well, I've been
thinking about you.

238
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,060
How are you doing?

239
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,661
Are you happy, Mummy?

240
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:43,297
Such a sweet boy for asking.

241
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,368
Can't believe you come from
the poison seed of your father.

242
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,837
Well, I like to think
I take mostly after you.

243
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,272
Anyway,
speaking of Daddy,

244
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:53,608
I had a very strange
conversation with him.

245
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,943
He said he couldn't afford
to send me money anymore

246
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,179
because of
his active social life.

247
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,817
What does that mean,
"active social life"?

248
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,185
Well, let's not talk about him

249
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,487
or whatever shenanigans
he may or may not be up to.

250
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:07,588
Let's talk about you.

251
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,925
Rajesh, is your father
seeing someone?

252
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,426
All I know, Mummy, is that

253
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,596
he's a single wealthy doctor,
and now, for some reason,

254
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,866
there's no money
for your little boy.

255
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,204
Well, however much money
your father was giving you,

256
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,338
I'll give you more.

257
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,273
Thank you, Mummy, I love you!

258
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,442
Helicopters for everybody!

259
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,214
What's taking so long?

260
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,682
I don't think
this is gonna work.

261
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,050
Just let me see.

262
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,191
Sweetie, you know
you're supposed to wear clothes

263
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:45,860
underneath a graduation gown.

264
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:47,895
A: surprised you know that.

265
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:52,199
B: I wanted to look like
a sexy graduate for you.

266
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,167
Oh.

267
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,301
Well, you do.

268
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,736
Oh. Thank you.

269
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,505
Yeah.

270
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,241
You're gonna be on Skype;
they're not gonna see your legs.

271
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,143
Well, I'm gonna go put on
some pants just in case.

272
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,879
But I have to say,
this is very freeing.

273
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:10,084
Add a belt and I'll take you
someplace nice.

274
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,086
Oh.

275
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,287
Done and done.

276
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,996
Okay, I think
I've narrowed it down

277
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:25,032
to a faulty pin on
the onboard communication chip.

278
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,668
Very impressive.

279
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,770
You know, when you're
done with that,

280
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,606
can you look at this?

281
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,210
It doesn't make smoke anymore.

282
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,279
One toy at a time.

283
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,814
Mm. Sorry.

284
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,182
Ah, maybe it's for the best.

285
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:43,217
I hear locomotive smoke

286
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:47,321
is the second leading cause of
death among train aficionados.

287
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,589
What's the first one?

288
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,825
Suicide.

289
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:52,259
Wrong.

290
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,594
Obesity.

291
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,832
I have the tool you wanted.

292
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,200
Thank you.

293
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:01,102
You guys don't have
to go to the trouble.

294
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,303
I'm back in the money now;

295
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,604
I can just buy
another helicopter.

296
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,872
It's not about the money.

297
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,240
It's about solving a problem.

298
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,808
It's why I became an engineer.

299
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,144
It's what I like to do,
it's what I'm trained to do.

300
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,113
It's who I am.

301
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:15,082
Oh, look at you--
the little engineer that could.

302
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,619
Why don't you just
call tech support?

303
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,388
Hey! Whoa!
Not cool!

304
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,556
What?

305
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:24,125
There's two kinds of
people in this world:

306
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,559
those who call
tech support

307
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:29,063
and those who make fun of the
people who call tech support.

308
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,698
I call tech support
all the time.

309
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,066
Ha-ha!
You call tech support!

310
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,734
What a baby!

311
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:37,738
And now, for our
commencement address,

312
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,207
one of our
most distinguished alumni,

313
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:45,312
noted Caltech physicist
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

314
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:51,285
Members of the faculty,
students,

315
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,121
I'm excited to speak
to you today.

316
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,389
I can't help but remember

317
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,525
the last time
I was in this auditorium.

318
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,059
Two guys from the lacrosse team

319
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:02,329
played keep-away
with my asthma inhaler.

320
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,966
But enough about
my ten-year reunion.

321
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,469
I'd also like
to take a moment

322
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,437
to thank
my beautiful fiancée

323
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,039
for to helping make
this speech possible,

324
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,008
even though weather
nearly prevented it.

325
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,477
Oh. Hello.

326
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,345
I-I didn't know
he was gonna point it at me,

327
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,415
so... don't do drugs
and stay in school.

328
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,216
They're graduating.

329
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,617
Okay, bye!

330
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,355
All right, the power
supply is reconnected.

331
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:29,757
I think we're
back in business.

332
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,493
Let's just run a few tests
before we take it outside.

333
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,195
Sheldon, we got WiFi?
Check.

334
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,362
GPS?
Check.

335
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,064
Battery charged?
Check.

336
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,501
Four hours of our lives gone?
Check.

337
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:41,869
All right.

338
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:43,037
All systems go.

339
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,039
In five...

340
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,841
...four, three, two, one.

341
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,582
That's what my
train used to do.

342
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,621
Ready to call
tech support?

343
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:03,190
Give me the number.

344
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,491
Probably wind up

345
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:07,194
talking to some foreign guy

346
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:11,332
who's reading from
the same manual I have.

347
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,274
It's my father, you jerks.

348
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,679
Hello, Daddy.

349
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:26,914
What did you say to your mother?

350
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:27,916
Nothing.

351
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,850
I was just calling to check in,

352
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,185
make sure she's doing okay.

353
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,486
Well, after talking to you,

354
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,856
she seems to think
I'm some sort of playboy.

355
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,191
Really?

356
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,094
I don't know where
she'd get an idea like that.

357
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,696
You know Mummy
and her crazy imagination.

358
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,966
I'm so lucky I take after you.

359
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,603
You think you take after me?

360
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,971
Well, I try to.

361
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,640
I certainly wouldn't
be a scientist

362
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,477
if you hadn't been
my role model.

363
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,347
Who wants to go to Vegas
in a real helicopter?!

364
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,886
It was L. Frank Baum who said,

365
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:11,025
"No thief, however skillful,
can rob one of knowledge,

366
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:16,230
and that is why knowledge is
the best and safest treasure."

367
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,433
Wow, I'm boring myself.

368
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,837
Sorry, I can't see
any of your faces right now,

369
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,739
but I bet they look like this.

370
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:34,248
Uh, you know,
I-I wrote an entire speech

371
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,617
to say how high school
prepares you

372
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:39,687
and what a wonderful
place it is,

373
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,989
but I hated it.

374
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,591
Maybe high school's great
if you look like this...

375
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:51,498
...but I didn't even feel like
I existed at that school.

376
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,101
And now that I think about it,

377
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,670
I bet a lot of you
feel the same way.

378
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:00,207
So, for the remainder
of my speech,

379
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,510
this is for the invisible kids.

380
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:06,814
Uh, maybe you never fit in.

381
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,283
Or maybe you're
the smallest kid in the school,

382
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,485
or the heaviest or the weirdest.

383
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:12,686
Maybe you're graduating

384
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,955
and you still haven't had
your first kiss.

385
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,991
By the way, 19;

386
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:20,427
and Geraldine Coco,
wherever you are, thank you.

387
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,198
Maybe you don't have
any friends.

388
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,034
And guess what? That's okay.

389
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,303
While all the popular kids
are off doing--

390
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,238
whatever, I don't know
what they were doing

391
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,539
'cause I was never there...

392
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,075
I'll-I'll tell you later.

393
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,911
My point is,

394
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,014
while you're spending
all this time on your own,

395
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:44,018
building computers
or practicing your cello,

396
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,888
what you're really doing
is becoming interesting.

397
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,991
And when people finally
do notice you,

398
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:54,061
they're gonna find someone
a lot cooler than they thought.

399
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:56,630
And for those of you
who were popular in high school,

400
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:59,967
it's over, sorry.

401
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,836
Thank you and congratulations.

402
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,643
Your call is important to us.

403
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,979
All our technicians are busy
helping other customers.

404
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:13,247
Please stay on the line

405
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,315
and someone will be
with you shortly.

406
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,194
What happened to me?

407
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:32,266
When did I become
an old man

408
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,835
baffled by modern
technology?

409
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,004
Next thing you know,

410
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,972
I'll be hitching my pants
up to my armpits

411
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,008
and complaining about

412
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,044
the awful music
the kids are listening to.

413
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:47,214
It <i>is</i> awful, isn't it?

414
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,383
Listen to that noise.

415
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,221
Hang on, hang on.

416
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,889
It's working!
I did it!

417
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:56,824
How'd you do that?

418
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,059
No idea, but
I did it!

419
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,230
Maybe you shouldn't be
flying it inside.

420
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:04,298
Well, I'm not flying it!

421
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,599
Then who is?
I don't know!

422
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,168
Must be getting a WiFi signal
from somewhere else!

423
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,707
Initiate landing sequence!
Initiate landing sequence!

424
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,578
Hey, the camera's working!

425
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,645
Oh, look, it's me.

426
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,587
Yes, it's a robot uprising!
Call the police!

427
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,035
So you really think
they liked it?

428
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,503
Oh, sweetie, it was
the best speech I...

429
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,075
Don't worry,
everyone in here is safe.
