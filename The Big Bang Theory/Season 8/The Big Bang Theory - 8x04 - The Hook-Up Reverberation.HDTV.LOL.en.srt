1
00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:04,493
Have you guys heard
about this research team

2
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:07,696
that's trying to transgenically
manipulate chicken DNA

3
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:10,032
to create some sort
of chicken dinosaur?

4
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:13,035
Oh, I think that
sounds wonderful.

5
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,040
What? You're afraid
of both dinosaurs and chickens.

6
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:19,042
Yes, but tell me

7
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:21,243
a dinosaur
chicken salad sandwich

8
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:22,945
wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

9
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:27,650
Hey, guys.
Hey. Hello.

10
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,185
We still on for
tomorrow night?

11
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:31,253
Yeah. I'm excited
to finally meet your girlfriend.

12
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:33,389
Yeah, oh, and
speaking of which.

13
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,158
According to a recent study
out of Oxford University,

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,426
when someone takes on

15
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:39,261
a new romantic
partner,

16
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:42,131
that person loses one
or two close friends.

17
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,900
Since when do you read
social science?

18
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:47,870
I go to the bathroom
like everybody else.

19
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,238
Why would I lose friends

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,140
just because I
started dating someone?

21
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:53,175
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone
when you met Amy.

22
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:56,378
Yeah, well, no, the study
refers to<i> romantic</i> partners.

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,615
Not the way I would
categorize the two of us.

24
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:01,217
You guys kiss and hold hands.

25
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,652
I've seen him do it.
It's not romantic.

26
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:05,854
Look, I'm not the kind of guy

27
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,657
who drops his friends just
because he's in a relationship.

28
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,326
What happens
if she doesn't like us?

29
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:11,694
Well, hey,
you're my dear friends.

30
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,063
You'll get a Christmas card
for a couple of years,

31
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,631
and then you're dead to me.

42
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:50,035
So, Howard, is Stuart still
living with your mom?

43
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:51,836
I don't want
to talk about it.

44
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:54,239
But he's going to.
My mom got him cable!

45
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,374
In my whole life,

46
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:58,143
growing up
in that house-- no cable.

47
00:01:58,145 --> 00:01:59,578
Do you know how many HBOs

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,580
that leech had my mother
get him? Seven.

49
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,915
Seven HBOs. Seven!

50
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:07,662
Long story short,
they have seven HBOs.

51
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:08,963
Hey, guys.

52
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:10,865
Hey.
Hello. Hey.

53
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,900
Emily, you know almost everybody here.
Hi.

54
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:14,702
This is Leonard,
this is Penny.

55
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:16,037
Oh, it's so nice
to meet you.

56
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,772
Nice to finally meet you, too.
Hi.

57
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:18,906
Hello.

58
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,375
Well, Raj,
you were not lying about her.

59
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:24,178
I told you
she exists.

60
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,213
Hey, I hear you're
a dermatologist.

61
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:29,216
Uh, yeah, I'm a resident
at Huntington Hospital.

62
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,752
Oh, I like their
emergency room.

63
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:34,622
Yeah, even if it turns out
you don't have Dengue fever,

64
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,024
they still let you
take a lollipop.

65
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:39,760
You know, Penny
just started training

66
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,495
to be a pharmaceutical
sales rep.

67
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:43,664
Maybe she can practice
on you some time.

68
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,367
Oh, it would be great
to practice on a real doctor.

69
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,536
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

70
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:52,239
I have some odd
freckles on my buttocks.

71
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:57,712
Can I make an appointment
for you to look at them?

72
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:00,181
Um... okay, I guess.

73
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:03,017
I'm with him three
years, nothing.

74
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,420
She's with two minutes, and
he's taking his pants off.

75
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:13,494
Last night was fun.
What did you think of Emily?

76
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,829
I don't know.

77
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,998
I kind of got the sense
she didn't like me.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,766
Did she<i> say</i> she didn't like you?

79
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:19,900
Of course not. No one ever says

80
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:21,435
they don't like you
straight to your face.

81
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:25,306
We have led different lives.

82
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,543
You guys just met.
Why would she feel that way?

83
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,012
It's just this
vibe I got.

84
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:32,994
I'm sure you're worried
about nothing.

85
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,415
Yeah.
You're probably right.

86
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:35,783
I used to think
my high school P.E. teacher

87
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,018
didn't like me,
but it turned out,

88
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,186
she liked me a little too much.

89
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:40,454
Really?
Yeah.

90
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:41,689
It was fine.

91
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,557
We went to a Melissa Etheridge
concert, I got an A,

92
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,226
it all worked out.

93
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,562
When you go to Emily's office to
practice, you'll see. It's fine.

94
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:50,264
Yeah, I hope you're right.

95
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,233
You really went your entire life

96
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:55,870
without anyone saying
“I hate you” to your face?

97
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:57,438
Yeah.

98
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,442
I'd say it now,
but look at those cheekbones.

99
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,184
I miss
Stuart's place.

100
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:13,854
All this loud music
and exposed brick.

101
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:16,123
What, is this
a comic book store,

102
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,627
or a rave at the third
little pig's house?

103
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,897
Yup, I wish
Stuart would reopen.

104
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,899
I hate this place, too.

105
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,701
Okay, him I believe

106
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:29,870
because he's an 80-year-old man
in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

107
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:31,639
But you're just upset

108
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:35,042
about Stuart and your mom
and all their HBOs.

109
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:38,546
Yes, I am. You know, I can't
even watch<i> Game of Thrones</i> now

110
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,214
without thinking
of mother saying,

111
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:43,384
“Stuart, which one is Thrones?”

112
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220
You know, he might not reopen.

113
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:49,056
He didn't get a lot of money
from the insurance company.

114
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,716
Oh, boy, if there is one thing
that gets my goat,

115
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:55,019
those dad-gum
insurance companies.

116
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,622
Why? Because they won't
get off your lawn?

117
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:05,563
Oh, is Stuart trying to get a
loan, or-or find investors?

118
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:07,598
All I know is,
he's got my mother

119
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,668
buying four-ply toilet paper.
I mean, four-ply.

120
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,104
If his butt is so delicate,

121
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,473
why doesn't he just use
an angora rabbit?

122
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:19,543
For starters,
they shed and bite.

123
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,179
Hey,

124
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,648
here's a thought.

125
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,150
Why don't we put up the rest
of the money that Stuart needs?

126
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,788
So, we'd be, like, owners
of a comic book store?

127
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,191
It's kind of a
dream come true.

128
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:35,693
That does sound fun.

129
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,228
Ooh, maybe we could come up

130
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,730
with a business plan
to compete with this place.

131
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,599
I'll give you a plan right now.

132
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:44,101
Step one:
open comic book store.

133
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,569
Step two: start rumor

134
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,873
this comic book store
gives you genital warts.

135
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,679
Step three: buy a big bag
to put the money in.

136
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,050
It's not that bad.

137
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:06,424
Hey.
Hi.

138
00:06:06,426 --> 00:06:09,298
Thank you so much for letting me
practice my sales pitch on you.

139
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,299
I really appreciate it.

140
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,120
Sure.

141
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:12,272
Um, I brought coffee.

142
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,806
I wasn't sure what you like,
so I got

143
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,042
a regular, a cappuccino
and a Chai tea.

144
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:19,178
Since you like Raj, I thought
you might be into that.

145
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,481
Thanks. If we could get started.
I'm a little busy.

146
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,251
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me
just get out my materials.

147
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,752
Leonard gave me this briefcase.

148
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,421
He used to carry it
around in high school.

149
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:31,757
You can still see the dent
where they whacked him with it.

150
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,028
Okay, I would like
to talk to you

151
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,297
about our new
birth control pill, Femevra.

152
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,632
Great.

153
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,667
So, Femevra's
triphasic design

154
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,803
provides balanced
hormonal exposure.

155
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:45,638
All right.

156
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,407
It has also been shown to cause

157
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,444
significantly fewer side effects
than other oral contraceptives.

158
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:54,313
Although it can cause acne,
which, if you ask me, kind of

159
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:57,083
increases its effectiveness
as a contraceptive.

160
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,655
Funny.

161
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,959
Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off
on the wrong foot?

162
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,828
Because since the other
night, I kind of feel like

163
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,363
you might have a problem
with me.

164
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:11,731
No, it's fine.

165
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:14,300
Are you sure,
because it doesn't seem fine?

166
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:16,535
Okay.

167
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,337
If you really want
to talk about this,

168
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,639
I do have a problem.

169
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,907
Oh, my God.
Tell me-- what did I do?

170
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,275
Look, it's nothing. It's just...

171
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,911
Raj told me that a while ago,
you two hooked up.

172
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:30,182
What?! Oh, why
would he say that?

173
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,684
Did it not happen?

174
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:34,453
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a hook-up.

175
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,554
Did you kiss?

176
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,523
Yeah.

177
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,525
Were you naked?

178
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,926
Yeah.

179
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,728
So, it<i> was</i> a hook-up.

180
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,697
No.

181
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,899
Yeah.

182
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:52,672
So, what are some ways we
could set our comic book store

183
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:54,340
apart from the
competition?

184
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,075
Oh, kids buy comic books.
It would be great

185
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:58,177
to figure out a way
to get more kids in the store.

186
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,179
You know, when I was a
kid, I loved going there,

187
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,181
but I could
never get a ride.

188
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:06,185
Ooh, what if we got a van and
drove around and picked kids up?

189
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,391
Nice.

190
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,829
You mean,
like at parks and schools?

191
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,366
Toy stores,
puppet shows.

192
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:24,503
Hold on. So, your idea is
to get a van

193
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,940
and cruise the streets looking
for kids to pick up?

194
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,844
Yes.

195
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,716
And are you gonna use candy
to lure them in?

196
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:40,119
We are now!

197
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,390
You told Emily
we hooked up?!

198
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:47,760
Um, well, in my defense,
I tell everybody.

199
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,161
Why would you say that?!

200
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:51,464
We were having a conversation
about past lovers.

201
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:52,598
We weren't lovers! Come on.

202
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,866
Everyone knows
we didn't sleep together.

203
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,167
We got drunk
and fooled around.

204
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,936
Why couldn't you just
leave me out of it?

205
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,070
Well, we were being honest.

206
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,839
You would leave me
out of the conversation

207
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,707
with the next guy
if you dump Leonard?

208
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,877
Why say it?
Yes!

209
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,246
Well, I would never
leave you off my list,

210
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,881
and not just

211
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,182
because, without you,

212
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,618
we're playing fast and loose
with the word “list.”

213
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,653
Well, good job.
Now she hates me.

214
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,822
Oh.

215
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,091
Great.

216
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,594
On the bright side,
that Oxford study was right.

217
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:23,662
One friend down.

218
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:28,934
I wonder who you're going
to lose next.

219
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,337
You, okay? It's you.
You're-you're next!

220
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:36,108
No. You're crazy about me.

221
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,681
I feel pretty....oh so pretty.

222
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,043
I don't know what Emily's
so upset about anyway.

223
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,979
Even if I had slept with him,
so what? Everyone has a past.

224
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,449
Almost everyone has a past.

225
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,884
Come on, look
how pretty you are.

226
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,986
I'm sure this isn't
the first girl to hate you.

227
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,589
It's not.

228
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,225
And I'm sure
you can turn it around.

229
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,527
How? You can't force someone
to like you.

230
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,595
What if you just

231
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:07,263
hang around and act
like her friend

232
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:09,832
until you wear her down?
I mean, next thing you know,

233
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,189
you're in her home,
you're eating her food,

234
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:12,284
drinking her wine.

235
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:16,806
No, that won't work.

236
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,142
You're right. Cheers.

237
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,410
Oh, I know.

238
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,378
Why don't you use
your sales training

239
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,614
to go back down there
and sell<i> yourself?</i>

240
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,015
What?
Yeah.

241
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,584
But instead of selling a drug,

242
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,385
you'd be selling Penny--
it's cute.

243
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,420
It's stupid.

244
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,622
Well, maybe people
would like you more

245
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,391
if you didn't crap
all over their ideas.

246
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,994
I'm gonna go with
Penny on this one.

247
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:41,631
Then again, why wouldn't I?
I mean, we go way back.

248
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,667
Oh, my God.
I didn't used to like you.

249
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,870
Shh. Amy's here now.

250
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,209
You know, the more
I think about it,

251
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,846
the more intrigued I am
about having our own store.

252
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,848
We'll get to see
all the new stuff

253
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,483
before it hits the shelves.

254
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,385
And we'll get to have
fun interactions

255
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:03,553
with our customers.

256
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:07,190
“This isn't a library--
buy it or get out.”

257
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:10,159
You say things like that
all the time.

258
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,428
Yes, but as a store owner,
I'll finally have a good comeback

259
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,897
to, “You don't work here--
shut up.”

260
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,568
Uh, do you know how Penny
told Raj he should have

261
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,403
left her off his list?
Yeah.

262
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,905
Well, do you think when she
and I had that conversation,

263
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,407
she left people off<i> her</i> list?

264
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,742
I'm sure she did.

265
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:27,777
Why?

266
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,512
Because if she hadn't,

267
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:33,216
she'd still be wading
through the list.

268
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:34,917
Will you stay out of this?

269
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,587
If only Penny
had said that once in a while.

270
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:41,190
Hey, what difference
does it make?

271
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,026
You're the one
she wants to marry.

272
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:44,761
That's true.
Yeah, and I'm not sure

273
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,730
that complete honesty
is always the best thing

274
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:49,565
for a relationship.

275
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,602
Yeah, he's right.
Once, in a moment of candor,

276
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,438
I told Amy
that her hair reminded me

277
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,608
of a duck caught
in an oil spill. Well...

278
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,476
she stormed out.

279
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:03,146
Which was sad, because
we were playing Scrabble,

280
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:07,550
and I had all the letters
to spell “persimmon.”

281
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,056
Why are you even part
of this conversation?

282
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:14,924
You don't know
anything about women.

283
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:17,627
I know that if I had
a wife or a fiancée,

284
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,696
I'd ask her first
before I invested money

285
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,531
in a comic book store.

286
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,266
He's right.

287
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,334
Yeah, well,

288
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:25,601
of course I am.

289
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,036
I was also right about her hair.

290
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,105
It did everything but quack.

291
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,510
There's something
I wanted to run past you.

292
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:36,679
What's up?
Mm, the guys and I

293
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:39,449
were thinking about investing
in Stuart's comic book store.

294
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,984
Is that okay?
Why are you asking me?

295
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:43,820
Well, you know,
we're engaged,

296
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:46,322
and it's kind of
a big deal financially.

297
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:48,624
It seems like something
we should talk about.

298
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:49,892
Oh.

299
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,328
Well, would you consider
mounds of credit card debt

300
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,864
kind of a big deal
financially?

301
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,868
Yeah.

302
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,470
Huh.

303
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,742
Mm. So, me and the guys
were talking about

304
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,710
this great
investment opportunity...

305
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,712
Nope.

306
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:12,448
But you didn't hear what it was.

307
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,218
I know.

308
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,987
Oh, come on.

309
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:19,455
Fine. What is it?

310
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,557
It's to help reopen
the comic book store.

311
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,326
Nope.

312
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,428
Well, hear me out.

313
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,630
Howard, you know
we're saving up for a house.

314
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,966
I know, but all the guys
are doing it.

315
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:32,869
We're splitting it four ways, so
it's really not that much money.

316
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:35,638
It just seems
like a risky investment.

317
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,341
I get that. I...

318
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,844
Okay, look...

319
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:48,217
The reason this is important
is...

320
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,955
...before my dad left
me and my mom...

321
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,659
he used to... take me
to the comic book store.

322
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:01,097
It was one of the few things
we did together.

323
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,866
Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

324
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:07,270
Well, I don't...
like to talk about it.

325
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:09,972
Oh, baby.

326
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,443
That story's made
up, isn't it?

327
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,214
That's how much buying
a comic book store means to me.

328
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,886
I'd like your honest
opinion on something.

329
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,121
Of course.

330
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,589
Now, before I start,

331
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:30,593
I need you to know that
I'm very excited about this,

332
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,695
and anything you say

333
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:34,764
that isn't
enthusiastically supportive

334
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:38,468
will throw our entire
relationship into question.

335
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:42,305
So...

336
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,074
keep an open mind.

337
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,177
I'm feeling a little backed
into a corner, Sheldon.

338
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,213
Perfect. Now...

339
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,950
...I'm considering investing

340
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:56,652
in Stuart's comic book store.

341
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,988
Interesting.

342
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,826
Can you see how
a grown man,

343
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,428
an accomplished scientist,

344
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,964
who invests in a store

345
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:09,832
that sells picture books

346
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,236
about flying men in
colorful underwear...

347
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:16,672
...might be wasting
both his financial

348
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,741
and intellectual
resources?

349
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,583
No.

350
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,754
Then I think it's
a terrific idea.

351
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,623
Great.

352
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,760
Wait till you hear
about our van.

353
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey. Thanks for inviting us over.
Hey.

354
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,434
Oh, thank you
for coming.

355
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:47,970
Uh, listen, Penny,
before you start,

356
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,939
I just want to apologize
for being so rude

357
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,274
the other day
in my office.

358
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:52,742
No, no. No need to apologize.

359
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,443
Excuse me,
can I say something?

360
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:56,579
I just love both you guys,

361
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,548
and I want you
to get along.

362
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,150
And when I say “love”"
I meant as a friend.

363
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,887
And, uh, way
too soon, right?

364
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:07,890
Okay, sit down.
Listen, Emily,

365
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:09,458
what happened
between me and Raj

366
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,960
was a long time ago.
It was,

367
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:12,328
and I may have
made it seem

368
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,030
like a bigger deal
than I should have.

369
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,498
Yeah, and Leonard and I
are engaged now,

370
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,900
and I'm just hoping we can put
this whole thing behind us.

371
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,368
Mm. I'd like that, too.

372
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,537
Yeah, I thought
I'd be okay with it,

373
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,773
but then I saw
how pretty you are.

374
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,308
Oh, that's so sweet.

375
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,443
I mean, look at you--
you are gorgeous.

376
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,180
It's true--
you're both gorgeous.

377
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,883
Kind of says something about
the man who could bed you both.

378
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:44,660
You get why I've been alone
most of my adult life.

379
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:50,066
So, what brings you by?
Well,

380
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:52,835
I don't need a reason--
it's my house.

381
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,171
Technically,
it's your mom's house, but...

382
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:58,174
we certainly want you
to feel welcome.

383
00:16:58,176 --> 00:17:00,943
I'm always welcome.

384
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:03,713
Mm, just... try and call first.

385
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:06,983
Okay, let's get
down to business.

386
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,352
Howie was thinking about
putting up some money

387
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:12,321
to help you reopen the store,
but before that happens,

388
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,390
I have a few questions.
Oh.

389
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:15,758
I appreciate the offer,

390
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,894
but actually your mother
already gave me the money.

391
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,865
What?

392
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,001
Yeah. I told her
it was too much,

393
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,170
but she said she was happy
to help out her<i> bubala.</i>

394
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,707
Excuse me.

395
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,011
Ma, you are canceling
that check,

396
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,780
and Stuart is not your<i> bubala;</i>
I'm your<i> bubala.</i>

397
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:41,050
You can't have more
than one<i> bubala!</i>

398
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,785
I don't know
who he's talking to.

399
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,254
She's at Target,
buying me shirts.

400
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,793
I'm so glad we
could work this all out.

401
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:53,429
Yeah, me, too.
You know, we should have dinner

402
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:54,797
one night with you and Leonard.

403
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,998
Oh, we would love that.

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,732
Great!

405
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,036
Okay, good night, guys.
All right, night.

406
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,038
Bye.

407
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,607
I hate her.
I hate her.

408
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,105
I'm really disappointed
we're not gonna have

409
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:16,807
our own comic book store.
I know.

410
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,575
I was looking forward to it.
It would've been

411
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:20,877
so nice to have a place
that was ours,

412
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:23,847
where we could just sit
and read comics in peace.

413
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,315
With comfy seats.

414
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:26,683
And snacks.

415
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,785
Well, I guess
it was too good to be true.

416
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,320
Yeah.
