1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:03,941
<i>So, tell me about your day--</i>
<i>how's it going</i>

2
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:05,175
with the particle detector?

3
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,478
Wow! You remember that?

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,146
Yeah, I listen
to what you say.

5
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:10,681
You're building
a particle detector

6
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:12,516
using superfluid helium.

7
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:14,518
You know, when you
talk like that,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,021
I want to take you
right here on this table.

9
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:19,023
And you know
from past experience

10
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:20,925
this table cannot support
both our weight.

11
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:24,361
So, how's
the detector going?

12
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:26,697
Well, it's tricky working
with superfluids.

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:27,932
Whatever container
you put them in,

14
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,333
they kind of
creep up the sides

15
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:30,834
and crawl out
all on their own.

16
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:33,237
Kind of like
Sheldon's ant farm.

17
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,906
Exactly, except you don't have
a lunatic running around,

18
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:39,310
yelling, "I fed you sugar water,
why are you biting me?"

19
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:43,013
Come on, this is boring-- you
really want to talk about this?

20
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:43,948
No, I do.

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,316
I-I didn't write
"superfluid helium"

22
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:47,117
on this napkin for nothing.

23
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:49,253
Okay, well...

24
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:50,621
This is cool.

25
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:52,957
Uh, there's a thing called
"superfluid vacuum theory",

26
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,959
where empty space is
imagined as a superfluid

27
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,527
with all of
its qualities--

28
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,796
viscosity, density,
surface tension...

29
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,233
Hey, if you're pausing
for dramatic effect,

30
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:05,569
I'd keep it moving.

31
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,071
No, no.

32
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,509
People don't talk
about surface tension.

33
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,879
If you imagine our
three-space as the surface

34
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,582
of an N-dimensional
superfluid bubble...

35
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:21,685
This... is exciting.

36
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:22,920
This is really exciting.

37
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:24,054
I have to go
find Sheldon.

38
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:27,124
Okay, well,
if you find him,

39
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,359
use the kitchen island--

40
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,294
that coffee table will not
support both of you.

41
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:36,066
Which means a spherical
multidimensional superfluid

42
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:38,435
shows the same negative-energy
density as space-time.

43
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:41,238
So what do you think? What do
you think? So what do you think?

44
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,410
Hmm...

45
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:48,012
What? Is it wrong?

46
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:49,513
Have you seen it somewhere else?

47
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,018
Hmm...

48
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,120
I know this isn't my area,

49
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:58,288
and I could never
do the math like you can,

50
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,024
but could this be something...?

51
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,026
Well...

52
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,930
You could have set Newton's
gravitational constant to one.

53
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:09,299
And, ugh, the whole thing reeks
of blueberry.

54
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,202
You know I can't stand
these scented markers.

55
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:15,506
No one told you to taste them.

56
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,475
Come on, is-is this
good or not?

57
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:21,578
It's good.

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,347
Really?
I like it.

59
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,748
I think you're on to something.

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,050
You do? You're not
messing with me?

61
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:27,151
Not at all.

62
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:29,553
In fact,
I have got something

63
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:30,921
for just such
an occasion.

64
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,022
I was starting to think

65
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,124
I might never get a chance
to give it to you.

66
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,826
Good job.

67
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,067
You're giving me a sticker?

68
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,968
Not just a sticker.

69
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,572
That is a sticker of a kitty
saying, "Me-wow!"

70
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,743
I'm not a preschooler.

71
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,478
Fine, I'll take it back.

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,780
I earned this!

83
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:29,949
You're still awake?

84
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,585
For a man whose
last observation was

85
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,153
our universe may be the surface

86
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,455
of a multidimensional
supercooled liquid,

87
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:39,792
"you're still awake" seems
like quite the sophomore slump.

88
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:43,095
You worked out
all the math.

89
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,865
Oh, I did more
than work out all the math.

90
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,301
I wrote a paper.

91
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,370
You wrote a paper
on my idea?

92
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,407
I wrote a paper
on <i>our</i> idea.

93
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,476
When did my idea
become our idea?

94
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:59,478
When I mixed it with
Sheldony goodness

95
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,848
and cooked it in the
Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

96
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,886
This is good.

97
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,487
Our idea is really good.

98
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,724
Well, the lightbulb in this
oven is ridiculously bright.

99
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:16,162
You know, if no one's
thought of this, yet,

100
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,463
this could be a big deal.

101
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,931
Only way we'll
know for sure is

102
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,300
if we post it online to
the pre-print server.

103
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,870
I have it ready to go, but I
wasn't gonna do it without you.

104
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:29,108
Wow, it's all
happening so fast.

105
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:31,644
Should we just sleep on it?

106
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,313
We could, but we
always run the risk

107
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,315
of someone else beating
us to the punch.

108
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,718
You're sure it's good?

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,420
My name is right on
there with yours.

110
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:44,957
That is a surefire
mark of quality.

111
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,594
That might as well say
"Directed by Joss Whedon".

112
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,366
Okay, partner, let's do it.

113
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:57,803
Come on.

114
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,739
Click the
mouse with me.

115
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,511
One...

116
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,013
two...

117
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,247
three...

118
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:09,849
Click.

119
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,320
Well, we did it.

120
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,355
Yes, we did,
my friend.

121
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,490
Is your tongue blue?

122
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:20,393
I don't want to
talk about it.

123
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,295
Okay, movie night--
what do you want to watch?

124
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,297
Whatever happened
to that ape movie you were in?

125
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,432
Oh, God.

126
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:27,566
Probably nothing.

127
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,502
I think I saw the director
twirling a sign

128
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,637
outside the Verizon store.

129
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,005
Search for it.

130
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,040
Wha... no.

131
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,007
No! Why?

132
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,308
'Cause it would be
fun to watch.

133
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,877
It would be humiliating.

134
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,446
Well, now we have
two reasons.

135
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,215
They have it.

136
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,183
Please,
can we watch it?

137
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,317
Please?

138
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,720
Fine, but I'm telling you--
it's terrible.

139
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,122
Have you even seen it?
No.

140
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:51,657
Well, maybe it turned out
better than you think.

141
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:54,727
Bananas,
get your fresh bananas.

142
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,563
It really didn't.

143
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:05,971
Sheldon, this is
superfluid helium.

144
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,339
Put this in
your mouth,

145
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,241
your tongue will
freeze and break off.

146
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:13,813
Does it smell like blueberries?

147
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:14,815
No.

148
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,882
Then we're probably okay.

149
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:18,818
Hey, your paper
got mentioned

150
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,319
on the <i>Quantum Diaries</i>
physics blog.

151
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,554
Really?

152
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:23,222
Wh-What'd they say?

153
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:24,890
Uh, it's basically
a summary of the theory,

154
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,592
but there's a bunch of positive
comments on the message board.

155
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,928
Let me see,
let me see.

156
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,298
One calls it "insightful
and innovative".

157
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,133
We're insightful
and innovative.

158
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,669
Ooh, nice to meet you,
Mr. Insightful.

159
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:38,771
Oh, the pleasure is mine,
Mr. Innovative.

160
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:42,408
Uh, another one says,
"The concept shows

161
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,410
some real out-of-the-box
thinking".

162
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:46,979
Do you hear that,
Mr. Out-Of-The?

163
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:50,182
I do, indeed,
Mr. Box-Thinking.

164
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:51,484
How are you today,

165
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:54,353
Mr. Can-You-Believe-
These-Jack-Asses?

166
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:56,655
Just dandy, Mr....

167
00:06:56,657 --> 00:07:00,292
I-Wish-I-Was-
Better-At-Improv.

168
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,461
Read another one.
Okay, okay. Uh...

169
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,997
"The analogy
between space-time

170
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,267

171
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:12,104
"I wish this blog would

174
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:18,644
Who wrote that?

175
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,945
It's anonymous,

176
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:22,782
and user name
"General Relativity."

177
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:25,317
Well... I'm responding to it.

178
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,019
Uh, don't lower yourself
to their level.

179
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,454
Look, I am simply

180
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,990
going to defend our work,
scientist to scientist.

181
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,525
And failing that,

182

a string

183
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,263
of both human
and non-human lovers.

184
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:40,466
Sheldon, my name's
on that paper, too.

185
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,034
There's no upside to doing this.

186
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:43,435
He just left another comment.

187
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:45,304
What does it say?

188
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:48,507
"Upon review, I've

195
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,490
Can I respond now?

196
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:06,125
Do it.

197
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,495
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

198
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:13,065
I'm about to show this guy
just how horny I can be.

199
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:19,705
Somebody else do it.

200
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,876
Doctor, please help me.

201
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,713
I think I might be turning
into a killer gorilla.

202
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,516
Why do you think you're turning
into a killer gorilla

203
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,218
and not just a regular gorilla?

204
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,821
Because regular gorillas
are vegetarians,

205
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,123
and I just bit the fingers
off your receptionist!

206
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,628
Okay, we've seen plenty.
No!

207
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,729
Give me the remote.

208
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,298
Careful. She'll bite
your fingers off.

209
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,400
Okay, well, I've been
poking around the internet,

210
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,437
and I think I found something
we'll enjoy watching even more.

211
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,471
What is it?

212
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,572
Oh, just a video

213
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,541
of Bernadette
in a beauty pageant.

214
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:56,642
What?!

215
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,244
Okay, I learned my lesson.

216
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,479
Making fun of people is wrong!

217
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,815
I haven't learned
my lesson.

218
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,017
Play it! Play it!

219
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,193
Hi. I'm Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski

220
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:17,730
from Yorba Linda, California.

221
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:23,002
You look like
a talking cupcake!

222
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:24,403
And you should pick me

223
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:27,439
for Miss California Quiznos
1999, because I want to...

224
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,642
Tell you what I want,
what I really really want

225
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:31,510
I'll tell you what I want,
what I really really want

226
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,679
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna

227
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:38,851
Really, really, really be
Miss California Quiznos 1999!

228
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,857
Play it again!
Play it again!

229
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,560
Did he respond yet?

230
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:58,719
Hmm. No, not yet.

231
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,052
Well,

232
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:01,721
maybe we shouldn't have sunk
to his level.

233
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:03,422
It wasn't that bad.

234
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:05,091
Read it back one more time.

235
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:10,129
"My good sir, we are neither
crackpots nor wannabes.

236
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:13,032
"In fact, we are
experts in our fields.

237
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,334
"And while you hide
behind your anonymity,

238
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:17,370
"we stand behind our paper.

00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:19,772
And later tonight, your mother".

240
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:25,244
And you don't think
that's too rough?

241
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,847
We're just <i>standing</i> behind her.

242
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:30,916
It's not like we're gonna say
"boo" and scare her.

243
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:36,355
How could you not tell us
you were in beauty pageants?

244
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:38,157
'Cause it's
embarrassing.

245
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,760
It is; it truly is.

246
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:43,429
Yeah, well...

247
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:46,132
Amy writes <i>Little House</i>
<i>on the Prairie</i> fan fiction

248
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:48,668
about herself
and posts it on the Internet.

249
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:53,205
No!

250
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:56,409
Why? What did I do?!

251
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,644
Sorry, I had to get
the spotlight off me,

252
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:01,414
and tearing down other women
is part of my pageant training.

253
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,116
Okay. We are
reading that right now.

254
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:05,184
No, please don't.

255
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,353
We got embarrassed
tonight. Come on.

256
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,521
But it's personal.

257
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:10,222
Why? Is it about you
and Sheldon?

258
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:11,957
No.

259
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,760
Oh, my God, it's
about her and Sheldon.

260
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:16,462
It's not about me and Sheldon.

261
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:20,466
It's about a young woman
in the 1800s named Amelia...

262
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,835
and the time-traveling physicist
named Cooper

263
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:24,937
she falls in love with.

264
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,939
Please show us?
Please?

265
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,108
No.
You know I'm gonna read it either way.

266
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,010
Good luck finding it.

267
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:34,113
Amelia and...

268
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:35,781
the time-trav...

269
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:38,351
Found it!

270
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:40,453
"It was just past dawn
on the prairie,

271
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:41,954
"and like every morning,

272
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,856
"Amelia prepared
to do her chores.

273
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,859
Except something about
<i>this</i> morning felt different."

274
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,327
Why?

275
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:53,199
<i>Why</i> did it
feel different?

276
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:57,269
"Maybe it was the first whisper
of winter in the air,

277
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:59,638
"or maybe it was
the unconscious handsome man

"with porcelain skin
and curious clothing

00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:10,683
and her body to new feelings."

283
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:20,192
You know, there was a time when
I was alone and had no friends.

284
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:22,495
I'm starting to miss that.

285
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,599
He still hasn't responded.

286
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:28,234
What's taking him so long?

287
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:30,369
Do you really <i>want</i>
him to write back?

288
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,571
Yeah, I do.
No matter how he responds,

289
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:36,842
I am going to destroy him
with a picture of a bored cat

290
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:39,612
saying, "Oh, <i>really?"</i>

291
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,818
Me-wow.

292
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,021
What are you doing?

293
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,924
I've, uh, created some
other user accounts

294
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:54,827
so I can post positive
comments about their paper.

295
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:57,696
"This wee li'l bairn
of a theory

297
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,868
No. You have to read it
how Dr. Angus McDoogal

298
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,438
of the University
of Edinburgh would.

299

"This wee li'l bairn of a theory

301
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:14,079
He wrote back!

302
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:18,050

"Engineers"!

00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:37,136
Do you know
how insulting that is?

309
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,971
Yes.

310
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:41,707
Guys, this person's
just going out of their way

311
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,542
to get a rise out of you.

312
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:45,811
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.
Yeah, well,

313
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:47,746
all the other comments
said really nice things.

314
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,515
Focus on those.
Yeah.

Dr. Dmitri Plancovik

See? Better
with the accent.

00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:03,596
And...

321
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:04,864
send.

322
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,332
What did you write?

323
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,733
I'm done hiding from bullies.

324
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,635
I'm taking this
into the real world.

325
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:11,871
What does that mean?
I told him we'll meet him

326
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,739
face-to-face anytime, anywhere.

327
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,774
Are you crazy?
You don't know who this person is.

328
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:16,842
Delete that!
Come on, Sheldon!

329
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:17,977
Oh, okay,

330
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:20,179
okay, calm down.

331
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:23,816
It's him!

332
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:26,118
He's trying to video chat.

333
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:33,325
Perhaps I shouldn't have
taken this into the real world.

334
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:35,461
Oh, <i>really?</i>

335
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:40,065
"'Time travel?
I don't understand,'

336
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,067
"said Amelia.
Cooper stared at her.

337
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:46,205
'Which rd don't you
understand, time or travel?'"

338
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:50,075
Wow, even in your fantasies
Sheldon's kind of exhausting.

339
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,112
He's like that
in the beginning,

340
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:54,513
so she can change him.

341
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:56,115
It's called good writing.

342
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:59,118
And wishful thinking.

343
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,619
"It stung Amelia

344
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,388
"when he spoke to her this way.

345
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,822
"In her little
one-room schoolhouse,

346
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:05,591
"she was always
the smartest student,

347
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:07,259
"regularly besting the boys
in her class,

348
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:09,528
"but this was no boy
in front of her--

349
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,763
"this was a man.

350
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,665
Here we go.

351
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,166
"Cooper told Amelia

352
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:15,834
"about all the strange
and incredible things

353
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,336
"the future would hold,
like computers

354
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:18,871
"and living past 30.

355
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:21,006
"He asked her
if she had any questions.

356
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,608
"All she longed to ask was

357
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,944
"if his heart was beating
as fast as hers,

358
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:26,111
"but she was too afraid

359
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:27,479
to hear the answer."

360
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,881
Oh, Amelia.

361
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:30,916
"So instead she asked if,
in the future,

362
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:34,520
Montana ever became a state."

363
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:41,527
In the 1800s
that was considered flirting.

364
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:45,965
I'm so sick of people
being mean on the Internet.

365
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,500
Well, I think the anonymity
makes everyone feel like

366
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:51,403
they can say things
they'd never say to your face.

367
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:53,172
Interesting.

368
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:55,207
I can't think of a single thing

369
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,010
I wouldn't say
to someone's face.

370
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:01,480
Never noticed that about you.

371
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:05,951
You know what? A-At least
you guys <i>did</i> something.

372
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:08,020
You know, you-you had a theory,

373
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,388
you wrote a paper,

374
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,290
you made
an actual contribution.

375
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:15,027
All guys like this do is just
stand on other people's work.

376
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:18,397
He's right.

377
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,667
I say we call this person back.

378
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:24,203
We've got no reason to hide.

379
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,840
All right, do it.
Call him.

380
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:30,576
Let's find out what this loser's
ever accomplished.

381
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:36,315
Click it with me.

382
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:38,884
One, two, three...

383
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,352
Click.
click.

384
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:44,923
Well, hello there.

385
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:47,493
Professor Hawking?

386
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:51,363
Oh, brother, you should see
the look on your faces.

387
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,601
You really
didn't like our paper?

388
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:58,303
I like your paper very much.

389
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,539
The premise is intriguing.

390
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,976
Then why are you
attacking us?

391
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,745
If you were sitting in a chair
for 40 years,

392
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:08,781
you'd get bored, too.

393
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,917
Anyway,

394
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,285
got to go.

395
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:17,289
I promised to help the neighbor
kid with his math homework.

396
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:20,092
Ciao.

397
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:25,764
Stephen Hawking
liked our paper.

398
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:29,902
Said the premise
is intriguing.

399
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:31,804
Good to see you again,

400
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:34,973
Mr. Stephen-Hawking-
Liked-Our-Paper.

401
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:40,379
And you as well,
Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.

402
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:44,316
How do you do, Mr. I'll-
Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?

403
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:48,754
Yeah, you keep
setting me up for failure.

404
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:52,558
"With a heavy heart,

405
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,827
"Amelia stood before
the newly repaired time machine.

406
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:57,362
She regretted giving Cooper
the part he needed."

407
00:17:57,364 --> 00:18:01,133
Because <i>she</i> wanted <i>him</i>
to give <i>her</i> the part <i>she</i> needed.

408
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,303
Okay, that's enough.
What?

409
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:07,005
No! I really want to know
what happens-- and Bernadette

410
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:10,008
really, really, really wants
to know what happens.

411
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:13,278
You're just making fun of me.

412
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,013
I was just kidding.
I'm sorry.

413
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:16,682
And the story's
really good!

414
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,450
No, it is!
Does he stay?

415
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:22,454
Do they kiss?
Does she find out about Montana?

416
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:24,389
Please?

417
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,991
Fine.

418
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,429
"As Cooper prepared to depart,

419
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:33,031
"tears filled Amelia's eyes.

420
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:36,735
"He took her hand in his
and said, 'I can't stay,

421
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:38,771
"but I will never forget you.'

422
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,774
"He brushed his fingers
against her cheek,

423
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:44,409
"then quickly stepped
into the machine.

424
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:46,678
"'Please don't go,'
she whispered.

425
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,680
"But it was too late.

426
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:50,749
"The engine hummed to life.

427
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,851
But they didn't even kiss.

428
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:54,520
"She turned away,

429
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:56,221
"wiping her eyes.

430
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,790
"She couldn't bear to watch

"her one chance at true love
disappear forever.

432
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:04,396
"Then... she felt a strong
hand on her shoulder

433
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:05,697
"spin her around.

434
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,099
"It was Cooper.

435
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:10,669
Yes!

436
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:13,005
"'What about the future?'
asked Amelia.

437
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:17,109
"He looked deeply into her eyes
and whispered,

438
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:19,545
"'There is no future
without you.'

439
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:21,814
"He pulled her in close.

440
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:24,650
"She began to
tremble all over.

441
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:27,019
She felt his warm breath..."

442
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,687
You will not believe
what Stephen Hawking just said.

443
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:30,556
- Get out!
- Not now!

444
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:48,063
Is the water warm enough?

445
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,868
Given the fact that you took
the time to build a wood fire,

446
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,270
draw the water from
the well and heat it,

447
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:56,205
it would be rude
to complain.

448
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,811
But since you asked,
it's a little nippy.

449
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:03,813
I can fix that.

450
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:13,289
I couldn't help but notice
your unusual undergarments.

451
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,458
They're not undergarments.

452
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,460
They're Underoos.

453
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,297
Where I come from,
they're known as

454
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,933
"underwear that's fun to wear."

455
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:28,538
And what's the significance
of the spider?

456
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,240
Oh, that represents
Spider-Man.

457
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:34,477
He does whatever
a spider can.

458
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,549
There's a lot of rhyming
in the future, isn't there?

459
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,217
<i>You're right.</i>

460
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,553
This is even weirder
than I thought.

461
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:45,721
You want me to
stop reading?

462
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:47,356
Are you kidding?
No, no.

463
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:52,028
"As he stood for
Amelia to dry him..."

464
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:59,001
So, tell me, Cooper...

465
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:03,739
are the ways of physical love
different in the future?

466
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:05,208
Yeah, okay, I'm good.
