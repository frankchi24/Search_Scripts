00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:06,448
Hello. I'm Dr.
Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,319
And welcome to Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun with Flags,

3
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:13,555
the Final Episode
Flagtacular.

4
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:18,626
I knew it was coming.
Still scary.

5
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:21,429
Now, I'm sure you're thinking,
"The final episode?

6
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:24,833
Who will stand between
us and flag ignorance""

7
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:27,135
I know I was thinking that.

8
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:30,772
Is this a show on flags
or mind reading?

9
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:34,576
But the truth is I can no longer
balance a full-time career,

10
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:37,345
a popular Internet show,
and a girlfriend.

11
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:42,183
And he really does have one,
you jerks on the comment board.

12
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:48,990
So as they say, all good
things must come to an end.

13
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:51,326
233 if we
include the one

14
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:54,696
somebody forgot
to press record on.

15
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:56,664
You said
you weren't gonna bring that up.

16
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,346
And you
said you pressed record.

17
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,737
Anyway, please
sit back, relax,

18
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,007
and join us as we
take our final lap...

19
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:10,011
...as indicated by the
waving of this racing flag.

20
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:12,847
And, of course, white flags
can also represent surrender,

21
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,750
the Stewards of Gondor, and
the Japanese Minamoto clan,

22
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:18,286
but I'm sure you remember that,
from episode sixty-two.

23
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:22,657
"White Flags: Who's
Wavin' 'Em and Why?"

24
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:24,192
That was a good one.

25
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:25,493
It was so good.

36
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,075
You know, I thought cleaning out
a dead professor's office

37
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,409
was gonna just be boring,

38
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,745
but then I found his dentures

39
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,948
and realized it's also gross.

40
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:10,753
Doesn't Professor Abbott's
family want any of this stuff?

41
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,854
I don't think he had a family.

42
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:13,422
That's rough.
I know.

43
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,057
You can spend your whole life
working,

44
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:18,294
and at the end all that's left
are some papers in a box.

45
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:21,263
Makes you think.

46
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:24,033
Oh, well.

47
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,369
Hey. Hey, we're supposed to
look through all this stuff

48
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:28,304
before we throw it away
in case it's important.

49
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:31,240
I-I did.
It's all outdated or disproved.

50
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:34,343
I don't know. This old pen
kind of proves gravity.

51
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:37,613
When I tilt it, her bathing
suit falls right off.

52
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,748
Oh,

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,750
my dad used to have
a pen like that.

54
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:44,153
I dated it
all through sixth grade.

55
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:45,187
It still feels weird

56
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:47,490
just throwing away his work
like this.

57
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,591
Don't feel bad.
Someday,

58
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:51,360
someone will be throwing out
your work, too.

59
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:55,898
That someone was Sheldon,
and the day was yesterday.

60
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,168
Hey, look at this.

61
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,405
"Dear Roger, to be opened
upon your first great discovery.

62
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,473
Love, Mom."

63
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,275
Wow, look at the date.

64
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:09,645
He saved this 50 years
and never got to open it.

65
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,081
That's intense.

66
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,017
Poor Roger Abbott.

67
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,622
Roger Abbott sounds
just like Roger Rabbit.

68
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:23,592
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott,
Roger Abbott.

69
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:27,196
Oh, my God, Leonard, I know
he's dead, but try it. It's fun!

70
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:29,632
Roger Abbott,
Roger Abbott...

71
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:33,135
Penny!

72
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:35,838
Oh, my rookie of the year.

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,474
Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want
to hire me

74
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:40,709
and now's a little hug machine.
 Oh,

75
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,311
look at you. Brand-new

76
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:44,613
and already
the third best sales rep.

77
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,382
Aw. Yes.
Why don't you come over to my table.

78
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,384
I'll be right there.
Bernadette's just parking the car.

79
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:51,387
Oh, good.

80
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,056
Bernadette. Cute, sweet...

81
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:55,991
vicious little Bernadette.

82
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:58,194
Come on. She's not that bad.

83
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,528
Oh, yeah?

84
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,764
At the company picnic
she yelled at me and my grandson

85
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,933
for losing
the three-legged race.

86
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:09,104
I mean, he still calls her "that
mean kid with the big boobies."

87
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:11,574
I know she can be
a little intense, but, I swear,

88
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:14,009
she is so sweet
once you get past all the...

89
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:15,177
Hey, what are you
talking about?

90
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,579
Oh. We were just talking

91
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,747
about how much we love working
with you. Isn't that right?

92
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:20,950
Dan?

93
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,322
Over the years here
at Fun With Flags,

94
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:29,859
we've had an opportunity to
learn, laugh, wonder...

95
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,729
And, yes, even shed
a tear or two.

96
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,399
Like when you do a two-hour
Fourth of July spectacular

97
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,369
and it doesn't
get recorded.

98
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:43,405
How many times do I have
to say I'm sorry?

99
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:46,375
How about 4,000.

100
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:49,445
One for every domino I set up
to make that American flag.

101
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:53,782
Please enjoy
these highlights.

102
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:58,487
Crikey! What flag
do we have today?

103
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:04,159
Australia, mate!

104
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:11,901
And now it's time for the speed
round of Flag or Not a Flag.

105
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:14,703
Flag.
Flag.

106
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,739
Not a flag.
Flag.

107
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,408
I am crushing this.

108
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:27,516
Say, Betsy Ross,
what you working on?

109
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:31,120
I have no idea.

110
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,590
Because the story of me
sewing the first American flag

111
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:37,626
is unsupported
poppycock.

112
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,462
Then who did sew it, hmm?

113
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,197
Don't ask me.

114
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,634
I'm just a simple seamstress
whose descendants are...

115
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,038
out to make a quick buck!

116
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,379
Fancy a dip, my dear?

117
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:59,014
I do.

118
00:06:01,018 --> 00:06:03,752
Wait, that purple
flag indicates

119
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:06,422
that marine pests, such
as jellyfish, are present.

120
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:09,758
Wow, that flag
is a lifesaver.

121
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,094
No.

122
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,296
This is.

123
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,967
Stop looking at my legs.

124
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:21,370
Not a flag.
Flag.

125
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,672
Flag.
Not a flag.

126
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,374
Flag.

127
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:28,210
Crap.

128
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,846
When stuff
like this gets me down,

129
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,181
you know what I like to do?

130
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,217
Sing "Hakuna Matata"
like an eight-year-old girl?

131
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,052
Wrong, smarty-pants.

132
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:40,756
It's "Everything Is Awesome"
from <i>The Lego Movie.</i>

133
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:43,626
Look at these notebooks.

134
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:45,661
They're full of pages and pages
of data.

135
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,396
He clearly spent years on this.

136
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:50,232
Mmm. Oh, it's just columns
of random numbers. Toss it.

137
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:53,135
Well, but what if this was a
potential breakthrough for him?

138
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:54,803
What if...
what if this is the thing

139
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,473
that would've finally let him
open that bottle of champagne?

140
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,808
Maybe he didn't know what
to pair champagne with.

141
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,679
Strawberries, caviar, oysters.
All good choices.

142
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,415
Yeah, that look right there

143
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:09,818
is why people eat before
they come to your parties.

144
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,854
This has to mean something.

145
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:15,991
Well, there's no discernible
pattern that I can see,

146
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:18,360
but it shouldn't be too hard
to run the numbers and check.

147
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,996
Well, maybe we can get
some time on the supercomputer.

148
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,898
Sure. We could try
multiple regressions

149
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,401
with varying physical and
experimental constants.

150
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,003
Oh, we could run
a pattern-matching algorithm

151
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:30,139
against well-known
unsolved physics problems.

152
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,608
Ooh, it might be
a substitution cipher.

153
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,576
We could start
with basic cryptanalysis.

154
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:38,280
Or we could talk to this guy
he used to share an office with.

155
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:42,685
Oh, let's do that.

156
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:45,220
Because you don't know how
to do cryptanalysis, do you?

157
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,723
I'm not even sure if
it's the right word.

158
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,465
So,

159
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,101
Dan, you have a grandson.
How old is he?

160
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,502
- Seven.
- Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,438
I remember him from the picnic.

162
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:06,408
He was the one crying
like a wuss the whole time.

163
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,779
I heard he was being picked on
by a mean kid.

164
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,181
Just builds character.

165
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:14,183
Like my dad said,
"Nobody likes a crybaby

166
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,652
except their mommies
and Democrats."

167
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:18,887
I need another drink.

168
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:22,758
What's his problem?
Oh.

169
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,593
I don't know.
Maybe he didn't like the fact

170
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,395
that you called his grandson
a wuss.

171
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:29,598
Well, I didn't think you were
supposed to say "sissy" anymore.

172
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,135
Okay, look, I know
what a good person you are,

173
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,572
but sometimes people think you
might come off a little harsh.

174
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,639
What?

175
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:40,242
I'm, like, the sweetest person
I know.

176
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:45,347
Look at me. I should be
in a tree baking cookies.

177
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,316
Yes, but once in a while,

178
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,619
people think
you're a little mean.

179
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,854
Oh, yeah?

180
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,622
You one of those people?

181
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:56,325
No. No, no, no.

182
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,294
I-I think the cookie thing.

183
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:04,833
Action.

184
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,468
Welcome back.

185
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,204
Our guest today
is a returning fan favorite.

186
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:11,573
He puts the reading
in your rainbow,

187
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,108
the Geordi in your La Forge,

188
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,043
and the Kunta in your Kinte,

189
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,246
Mr. LeVar Burton.

190
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:24,219
Thank you, Sheldon.
Now, remember our deal...

191
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:28,657
You do this, I delete
your contact information.

192
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:29,792
While...

193
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,860
While you watch me do it.

194
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,896
Great. Happy to be back.

195
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:35,497
Well, since you're here,

196
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:37,966
I'd like to get your
opinion on something.

197
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,035
In honor of Black
History Month,

198
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,070
I portrayed George
Washington Carver

199
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:46,675
in a loving tribute that my
roommate called "wildly racist""

200
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:48,744
What do you think?

201
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,979
Hi. My name is George.

202
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,148
Oh, hell, no!

203
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,686
You heard him, Leonard.

204
00:09:57,688 --> 00:09:59,855
No, it's not racist.

205
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,278
Are we sure this is the place?

206
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,347
The doorman said this
is the right building.

207
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,282
I think if you're pulling up
your pants,

208
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,651
you're not a doorman.

209
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,086
Who is it?

210
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:21,221
Uh, I'm looking
for a Professor Sharpe?

211
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:24,157
Hold on.

212
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,726
Can I help you?
Hi.

213
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,928
We're from the university. We're
trying to get some information

214
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,196
about Professor Abbott.

215
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:30,631
We were cleaning
out his office

216
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,366
and found these books
full of numbers.

217
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,001
Any chance you
know what it is?

218
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:35,802
Yes, he was always working on this.
Oh.

219
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:37,204
I was thinking
it might be

220
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:39,206
some sort of interstellar
coordinate system,

221
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,041
maybe an updated version
of Hubble's law.

222
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:42,442
I keep seeing the
number 90 repeating.

223
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:44,444
That could be the angle
of perturbation

224
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:46,413
of a distant galaxy.

225
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:49,216
It's the number
of calories in a yogurt.

226
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,318
That's his food diary.

227
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,753
Really?

228
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,621
Yeah, he wrote down
everything he ever ate.

229
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:56,823
He was convinced that calorie
restriction was the key

230
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,225
to living forever.

231
00:10:58,227 --> 00:10:59,893
Does it work?

232
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:01,328
Seriously?

233
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,231
Well, he could have been hit
by a bus. You don't know.

234
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,434
Sorry it's not more interesting.

235
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,536
On the bright side,
you didn't have to listen

236
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,272
to his stomach growl
for 35 years.

237
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,541
So, was there anything
that Professor Abbott worked on

238
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:17,511
during his life that came close
to an accomplishment?

239
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:20,981
To be honest, his research
never amounted to anything.

240
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,050
Oh.
You were his colleague.

241
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,051
How did your research turn out?

242
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,086
Great. Hey, this is
the apartment you get

243
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:28,288
when you win a Nobel.

244
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:31,358
Well, you could be very frugal.

245
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,760
I'm getting a little tired
of everybody's sarcasm.

246
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,266
I'm not a bully.

247
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:41,368
I mean, maybe I come
off a little strong,

248
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,370
but that's only because my
dad raised me to be tough

249
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:44,938
and not to take
crap from anybody.

250
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,241
No. That's fine, but there's
a difference between being tough

251
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:51,611
and telling your friend her new
pants look like a saggy diaper.

252
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,782
I did say that, didn't I?

253
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,084
Yeah, you did.

254
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,020
I felt so self-conscious,
I had to return them.

255
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:02,989
Where? To Babies R Us?

256
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:05,659
You're doing it again!

257
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:07,027
Okay, sorry.
Can we just go?

258
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,495
I feel like
everybody hates me.

259
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:10,497
Oh, come on,
they don't hate you, all right?

260
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:11,631
They're just
a little intimidated.

261
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:13,200
All you need to do
is show everyone

262
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:14,367
how sweet you really are.

263
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,369
I think I'd rather go.
No, come on.

264
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:18,004
You are not going anywhere,
all right?

265
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:20,340
I am here for you, and we are
gonna fix this together.

266
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:21,742
Thank you.

267
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,677
Even though your dress is ugly.

268
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:28,882
Well, my little Flag-keteers,

269
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:32,886
it looks like the last episode
of Fun with Flags is at an end.

270
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,788
If I could,

271
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,892
I would run each and every one
of you viewers up a flagpole

272
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:41,795
and salute you.

273
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:44,297
And if you touched the ground,
burn you.

274
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,300
I'd like to take a moment

275
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:49,469
to personally thank
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

276
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,471
who you may
or may not know

277
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:55,842
is the first woman to co-host
a flag or banner-related

278
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:58,678
Internet info-tainment show.

279
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,148
Take that, glass ceiling.

280
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:06,820
And if I may get serious
for a moment,

281
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:10,791
hosting this show has been...

282
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,993
one crazy ride.

283
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:16,730
With all its ups and downs,

284
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,599
I wouldn't give it up
for the world.

285
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,236
Except for now,
when I'm giving it up.

286
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,842
Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

287
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:33,246
I'd like to share with you all
one last use for a white flag.

288
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:37,250
It's good for times like this.

289
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:42,088
Good night.

290
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,290
Cut.

291
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:47,694
Sheldon...

292
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,863
that was beautiful.

293
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:51,031
If you didn't press record...

294
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,200
I pressed it!

295
00:13:57,238 --> 00:14:00,340
Well, that's it.

296
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:03,043
That's the end of Roger Abbott.

297
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,914
And we still don't know
who framed him.

298
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,052
I still keep thinking

299
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:14,654
about how an entire life can
seemingly amount to nothing.

300
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:17,390
I guess the
sad truth is,

301
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:20,961
not everyone will
accomplish something great.

302
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:22,462
Some of us

303
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:24,431
may just have to find meaning

304
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:28,034
in the little moments
that make up life.

305
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:31,137
That's a nice way
of looking at it.

306
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,106
Yeah for you, not for me.

307
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:35,175
I went to space. I'm covered.

308
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,446
You know what?

309
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:42,649
This bottle was meant
to celebrate an achievement.

310
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:44,017
Let's make a pact.

311
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,319
When one of us gets their
first big breakthrough,

312
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,955
we'll celebrate by opening
this bottle of champagne

313
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:50,957
and toasting
Professor Abbott.

314
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,158
I love that.

315
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,226
Yeah, me, too.

316
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:55,028
Then, of course,

317
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,796
rubbing our success
in Sheldon's face.

318
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:59,132
Oh, well, that's the best part.
Oh, yeah.

319
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,803
Dan, could I talk
to you for a minute?

320
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:08,975
Sure, go ahead.

321
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,744
Just want you to know
I didn't mean

322
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,012
to be rude about your grandson.

323
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,680
No, it's okay.

324
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,548
No, it's not.

325
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,117
Penny told me
that everyone's scared of me.

326
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,386
What? What?

327
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:21,288
Why would she say that?

328
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,956
You know she drinks, right?

329
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,891
What?

330
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:27,294
No, she's right,
and I just want you to know

331
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:29,696
that from now on, I'm gonna be
much more sensitive.

332
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,731
I don't want anyone walking
on eggshells around me.

333
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,267
Oh, well, okay, then, uh,

334
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,202
one thing
I've been meaning to tell you

335
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:39,005
is that the company is gonna
stop paying for our coffee.

336
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,907
No problem. When
does that start?

337
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,043
Five months ago.

338
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:44,311
What?!
Yeah.

339
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:46,012
Who's been paying
for my coffee?

340
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,014
All of us.

341
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,715
Yeah. It comes
from the swear jar

342
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:50,483
we put money in when you curse.

343
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,422
What else don't I know about?

344
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:58,258
Uh, well, you know
your private bathroom?

345
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,915
Yeah?

346
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:00,695
That was supposed to
be for the whole floor.

347
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,829
- You're kidding.
- No, no.

348
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,298
It's okay. It only really
affected Wheelchair Kathy,

349
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,667
and she's back
in the hospital now,

350
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,669
so it all worked out.

351
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,872
I feel so bad.
Yeah.

352
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:14,140
Well, then, maybe

353
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:16,042
you shouldn't have named her
"Wheelchair Kathy."

354
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,012
Oh, my God!

355
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:22,482
I thought everybody liked me,
but I'm just a monster.

356
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:26,353
But a cute one, like that, uh,
eyeball guy in <i>Monsters, Inc.</i>

357
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:29,022
No, I'm the worst.

358
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:30,690
I'm a terrible person.

359
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:33,159
Come on, don't cry.
It's okay.

360
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,394
It's not okay.

361
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:37,063
How can I even work here anymore?
Oh.

362
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,698
- Because this company needs you.
- It's fine.

363
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,433
We don't mind paying
for the coffee.

364
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,836
I can't let you do that.

365
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:44,471
Maybe we could get you

366
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:46,706
an espresso machine
for your office.

367
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,742
I guess that would be all right.

368
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,744
All right.

369
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:53,146
See? You don't have

370
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:54,714
to be mean
to get what you want.

371
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,750
You're right.

372
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:59,619
Now where did we land
on my bathroom?

373
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,759
Hey.

374
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:06,960
Hello.

375
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:08,294
How come you're up so late?

376
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:10,196
I posted the last episode

377
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,232
of Fun with Flags hours ago,

378
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:15,001
and not a single person
cared enough to comment.

379
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:19,139
All that effort for nothing.

380
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,107
Mm. I know how you feel.

381
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,843
I spent the day throwing out
a man's entire career,

382
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,678
and all that's left is
an old bottle of champagne

383
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,048
and a naked lady pen
that Raj took

384
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,650
when he thought
no one was looking.

385
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:33,486
It's not the same thing.

386
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:36,156
I don't think you know
how I feel at all.

387
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:38,625
Sad?

388
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:41,795
Hmm. You do get me.

389
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,833
Someone left a comment.

390
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:48,101
Yeah. What did they say?

391
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,103
"Too bad your show is done.

392
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:52,105
I kind of liked it."

393
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,307
Leonard, did you hear that?

394
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,644
Oh, the people are heartbroken!

395
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:02,048
I can't take this away
from the world!

396
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,984
Fun with Flags is back!

397
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:06,986
Congratulations.

398
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:08,855
Let's celebrate!

399
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:13,059
Sheldon,

400
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:14,761
that wasn't for you!

401
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,296
Oh, no, I'm not going
to drink it.

402
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:17,797
I just wanted to hear the pop.

403
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:22,335
Yeah, I knew it was coming.
Still scary.

404
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:36,239
LeVar Burton?

405
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,041
LeVar Burton!

406
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:39,642
LeVar Burton!

407
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:43,179
Ugh. What are you doing here?

408
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:44,514
You told me not to call,

409
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,950
and I didn't know how else
to give you the good news.

410
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:50,653
Fun with Flags is back, and
you can be in the next episode.

411
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:52,055
Wil Wheaton said, get a gate.

412
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:53,527
I don't know why
I didn't get a gate.

413
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:54,658
You...

414
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,395
At least listen
to the premise.

415
00:18:57,398 --> 00:18:58,964
Since you were born
in Germany,

416
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,900
I thought we could talk
about German flags.

417
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:04,944
How do you feel about
dressing up like a swastika?

418
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:11,444
