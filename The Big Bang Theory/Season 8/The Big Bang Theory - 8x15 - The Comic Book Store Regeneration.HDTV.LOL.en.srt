1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,384
I've invented a science joke,
would you like to hear it?

2
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:07,564
Sure.

3
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:11,166
How many Edisons does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

4
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:12,835
How many?

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,837
Who cares?
He stole the idea

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,172
and doesn't deserve
his own joke.

7
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:18,741
Is that really true?

8
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:21,410
Of course, that's how you know
it's a good joke.

9
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,046
It not only entertains,
it informs.

10
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,082
Hey, sorry
to interrupt.

11
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:28,417
Uh, Barry,

12
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,620
uh, how many Edisons does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

13
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:34,022
Did you know Edison didn't
actually invent the light bulb?

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,595
What do you want,
Barry?

15
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:42,598
Just wanted to drop this off
as a little thank you for Amy.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,932
What's this for?

17
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:45,734
Your idea really
helped me out.

18
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:48,370
My light-cone quantization
paper's online already.

19
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:50,873
The response
has been amazing.

20
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,307
Well, that's
fascinating.

21
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:53,776
I can't wait to read it.

22
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:55,110
Oh, no, me as well.

23
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:59,214
Uh, please e-mail it
to Sheldon@Bazinga.biz.

24
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:00,549
Why "dot-biz"?

25
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,084
Because I just gave
you the business.

26
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:05,254
And also Bazinga.com
was taken.

27
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:08,924
Anyway, thanks again.

28
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:10,592
Cooper, suck eggs.

29
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:15,330
Since when do you help out
Barry Kripke?

30
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:17,833
Well, I'd been thinking about
a cellular automata approach

31
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,334
to neuronal connectivity,

32
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:21,170
and I thought it might have
some interesting applications

33
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,738
to string theory--
it's not a big deal.

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,640
Oh, really?

35
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:27,309
When I was doing string theory
and hit a dead end,

36
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,077
why didn't you try to help me?

37
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,080
I did-- you said the only
math biologists know is

38
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,249
if you have three frogs
and one hops away,

39
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,485
that leaves two frogs.

40
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:39,755
That's pretty funny,
that does sound like me.

41
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:40,923
But that doesn't mean

42
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,891
that you should be
standing on street corners

43
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:46,128
handing out your math
to whatever guy comes along.

44
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:49,164
Sheldon, we're all scientists.

45
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,833
I helped out
a fellow colleague.

46
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,167
You're being petty.

47
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,769
I'm being petty?

48
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,105
You know Barry and I
have a professional rivalry.

49
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,208
You heard him--
he told me to suck eggs.

50
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,210
If we were friends,
he would have suggested

51
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,611
I suck something
more pleasant.

52
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,482
Why are you laughing?

53
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:08,984
Did you learn

64
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:40,955
Okay, Ma.

65
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,623
Say hi to Aunt Gladys.

66
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,891
Yeah, I love you,
too.

67
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:44,893
Bye.

68
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,727
Your mom having fun in Florida?

69
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:48,062
Mmm, she loves it.

70
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:50,064
She finally found a place
where everyone talks about

71
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,465
how sweaty they are.

72
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,502
Anyway, she wants us
to go to the house

73
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:57,605
and check in on Stuart
because he might be "lonely."

74
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,273
She's just being nice.

75
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:01,509
Well, I'm her son, how come
she doesn't send someone

76
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,177
to check on me if I'm lonely?

77
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,179
Because you have a wife.

78
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,318
Yeah, well, sometimes
you work late.

79
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,288
I know you don't like
Stuart being in the house,

80
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,790
but the store's
about to reopen,

81
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,158
I'm sure he'll get
back on his feet.

82
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,693
That would be great.

83
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,095
I'd love for things between me
and Mom to get back to normal.

84
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:24,732
Well, normal's a
strong word, but sure.

85
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,338
Hey.
Hello.

86
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,873
You okay?

87
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,209
If I was okay,
I would've said "hello"

88
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,944
and not the much more
ominous "hello."

89
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:39,647
What's going on?

90
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,115
I'm mad at Amy.

91
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:45,052
Did she leave pit stains
in your favorite crop top, too?

92
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:47,722
No.

93
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:51,225
She helped Barry Kripke make
an advancement in string theory.

94
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,360
Oh, that sounds
like a good thing.

95
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:56,230
Well, it would be,
except that I left string theory

96
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,165
because I decided
it was a dead end.

97
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,334
Yeah, and then she went
behind my back

98
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,203
to help someone else
prove me wrong.

99
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:03,804
My rival, no less.

100
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,718
I'm sorry you had to see that.

101
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,088
I'm sorry I didn't have
a camera.

102
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,090
Why would she
do this to me?

103
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,760
Well, I'm sure she didn't
upset you on purpose.

104
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,261
Besides, aren't you
the one who says

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,864
there's nothing more important
than the advancement of science?

106
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,366
No, I said there's
nothing more important

107
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,702
than <i>me</i> advancing science.

108
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,670
All right, well, if I'm
understanding this right,

109
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:39,006
and all she did was help
out another scientist,

110
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,675
I'm thinking you might
have to let this one go.

111
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:43,677
Ugh, "let it go."

112
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:46,046
I have heard that
my whole life.

113
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:48,215
Every time something upsets me
somebody says, "let it go,"

114
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,717
you know,
like it's my fault,

115
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:51,719
and it's not okay
to feel the way I feel.

116
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,120
I don't know
what to tell you.

117
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,555
I mean, why don't
you talk to her?

118
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:56,557
Is that all you have?

119
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,493
Shopworn tidbits like
"talk to her" and "let it go"?

120
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:01,362
Gee, Penny,
life's giving me lemons.

121
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:02,696
What should I do?

122
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:05,032
Well, you could shove
them somewhere.

123
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:09,737
Okay, now you're
getting creative.

124
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,773
Thanks again
for your help.

125
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,108
No problem.
Our pleasure.

126
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,576
The place really
looks great.

127
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:18,045
Yeah, you should have
burned it down years ago.

128
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:21,415
I keep telling you
I didn't burn it down.

129
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,083
We know, we know--
because burning something down

130
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,920
for the insurance money
is a "crime."

131
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:30,157
Stuart, this place
looks amazing.

132
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,125
Thanks.

133
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:33,394
You really did
a nice job.

134
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,729
And thank you
for putting up with me

135
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:37,398
staying at your mom's
through all this.

136
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I-I couldn't have done it
otherwise.

137
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:42,403
I appreciate that,
and I'm glad you were able to...

138
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,606
Is that my mother's furniture?

139
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:50,244
Yeah, she said
I could use it.

140
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,612
Doesn't it look
great?

141
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:54,748
Not as great as it looks in
the den where it belongs.

142
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,450
Howie.

143
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:59,553
Why don't you just clean out
the whole room?

144
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,889
Take the string art clown
I made her in third grade

145
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:03,490
and the ribbon I got
in swim class

146
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,925
for putting my face
in the water.

147
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,260
What is your problem?

148
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:07,595
She said it was okay.

149
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:10,197
Well, I'm her son,
and I say it's not okay.

150
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,567
Some son-- looks like you spent
ten minutes on that clown art.

151
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,972
Well, maybe I should've gone
to a fancy art school like you.

152
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,607
Then I could run
a failed comic shop

153
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:20,908
and mooch off
some guy's mother.

154
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:23,844
Why don't we leave
so you can cool off?

155
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,846
I think that's
a good idea.

156
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,114
Take him out
of my store.

157
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:28,215
Your store?!

158
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,217
My mother gave you
the money to reopen.

159
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,819
I'm not going anywhere.

160
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,520
Why don't we go get
the food for the party.

161
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:34,622
Thank you.

162
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,624
Smart-- looks like
we're being helpful.

163
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,292
Mmm, when really
we're just exiting

164
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,960
an uncomfortable
situation.

165
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:45,866
Kripke, you know, of all
the people-- Barry Kripke.

166
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,035
I'm so... Are you folding
it like a crazy person

167
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,703
to get me to
do it for you?!

168
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,006
No.

169
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,876
Oh, give me that.

170
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,817
Just out of curiosity,

171
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,487
if I were to let something go,

172
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,888
how would I do that?

173
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,858
I don't know-- just think
about something else.

174
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:14,328
Can I think
about the spiny anteater?

175
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,496
Sure.

176
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:18,165
The spiny anteater...

177
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,168
never went behind my back
and worked with Barry Kripke.

178
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:25,539
That didn't help at all.

179
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,509
You know, some people
try visualization.

180
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,010
How does that work?

181
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,847
Okay,

182
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:36,884
imagine your problems
are a pen.

183
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:39,753
Okay.

184
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:42,323
Now imagine
you're holding that pen.

185
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:48,963
Okay.

186
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:52,199
Now open your hand
and let it go.

187
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:54,268
But I just got this pen.

188
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:58,238
It's got my initials on it
and everything.

189
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,907
Look.

190
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,445
Sheldon, this isn't
that hard.

191
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:09,283
I may have a better way
that you can teach me.

192
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,718
How?

193
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,388
What if I told you
that over the past few months

194
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,391
Amy has secretly been giving you
little puzzles

195
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:20,394
to test your intelligence
against chimpanzees in her lab?

196
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,098
What? She didn't
give me any puzzles.

197
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,233
Are you sure?

198
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:32,573
Boy, I just can't seem to get
these scissors back together.

199
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:34,375
Can you do it?

200
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,177
Darn it.

201
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,579
There's something
in my eye,

202
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:42,249
and I need to sort
these coins by size.

203
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,584
Can you help?

204
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,025
Penny?

205
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:53,027
I really want to
eat this banana,

206
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,030
but it's stuck inside
this bamboo puzzle box.

207
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,169
Son of a bitch!

208
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:03,570
Okay, that's great.

209
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:05,406
Now, let it go.

210
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,718
I can't believe you were
testing me against a chimp!

211
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,387
Well, excuse me,
Amy was testing you.

212
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:22,656
I was rooting for you.

213
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:27,227
Good job on that banana box,
by the way.

214
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:29,997
Why would she
even do this?

215
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,999
She's been conducting
an experiment on apes

216
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,901
where they're given
various puzzles to solve.

217
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:36,570
I was surprised
at the complexity of the puzzles

218
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,906
and thought some humans wouldn't
be able to solve them.

219
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:42,276
That's when Amy said,
"Want to make this interesting?"

220
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:44,812
"Make this interesting"?

221
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:46,413
You bet money on me?

222
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,748
No, no.

223
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,417
We designed an experiment
involving you.

224
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:52,853
See? Now, isn't that
interesting?

225
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,189
It's not interesting.

226
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:57,057
It's incredibly insulting.

227
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,393
Okay,
maybe this will help--

228
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,795
imagine you're holding a pen.

229
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:06,333
Before you go too far,
not a special pen

230
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:07,835
with your initials
engraved on it--

231
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,403
that'll make the next part
really hard.

232
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:10,405
Oh...

233
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,406
That's it.

234
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:12,407
Get out!

235
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:14,408
I don't understand
why you're mad at me.

236
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,076
You should be mad
at Amy.

237
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,045
Like I was
this afternoon.

238
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:19,713
Hey, look at that--
I let it go.

239
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:21,148
Get out!

240
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,219
Penny?
What?

241
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:28,188
I think I left
my pen in there.

242
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,460
I understand
why you're upset,

243
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:35,929
but he worked really hard
to get the store ready.

244
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:38,399
And it's just furniture.

245
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,234
It's my mom's furniture.

246
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,236
It belongs in the house
I grew up in--

247
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:43,737
next to that pile of <i>TV Guides</i>

248
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:46,740
and in plain view of what,
for a ten-year-old, was

249
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,409
a quality piece
of string art!

250
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,314
Howie, if the store succeeds,
Stuart has a source of income,

251
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:56,650
and he can move out
of your mother's house.

252
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,585
Seems like some old furniture
is a reasonable price

253
00:10:58,587 --> 00:10:59,653
to pay for that.

254
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,423
That is a good point.

255
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:04,058
But I didn't marry you
for good points.

256
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,492
I married you
to blindly support me

257
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:07,461
no matter how ridiculous
I'm being!

258
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:11,632
This is why I had
to rewrite our wedding vows.

259
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:19,339
Hi, we're here to pick up
an order for Comic Center.

260
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:20,808
Sure, let me go check on that.

261
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,779
Dude, I-I think
that's Nathan Fillion.

262
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:28,916
Oh yeah,
look at that.

263
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,351
And he's picking
the tomatoes out of his salad

264
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,353
just like I do.

265
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:35,389
I always did feel
a connection with him.

266
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,159
Oh, I have got
an idea.

267
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:42,096
We're not selling
his tomatoes on eBay.

268
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:46,100
No, if we got Captain Reynolds
from <i>Firefly</i>

269
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:48,435
to do a signing
at Stuart's store,

270
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:49,870
that would be
amazing.

271
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:51,205
That would be great.

272
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,973
So should we go
talk to him?

273
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:54,374
I don't know.

274
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,044
I mean, if he's not nice,
it's gonna make it hard for me

275
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:59,213
to watch him in anything again.
What?!

276
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:02,216
The-the guy who plays
Jon Snow was a jerk.

277
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,684
We still watch
Game of Thrones.

278
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:06,286
He was a jerk because
you rear-ended him.

279
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:08,989
I was distracted.

280
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,991
It's weird seeing a member
of the Night's Watch

281
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,526
with a kayak strapped
to his car.

282
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:15,229
Come on.

283
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,136
Hi,
excuse me, s-s...

284
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:23,470
I-I don't mean
to bother you,

285
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:25,806
but we're just really
big fans of <i>Firefly.</i>

286
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:27,374
A-And <i>Dr. Horrible.</i>

287
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:29,309
Oh, uh, I think
you made a mistake.

288
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,644
I'm not an actor.

289
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,980
Don't say that.

290
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:34,481
I mean, you're not
Dame Judi Dench,

291
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,150
but you're
pretty great.

292
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,555
Oh, yeah, I get it--
you think I'm Nathan Fillion,

293
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,056
but I'm not.

294
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:45,492
So if you don't mind, I would
just love to eat my lunch.

295
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:47,861
Come on.

296
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:49,696
Sorry to bother you.

297
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,698
Don't know why
he's so grumpy.

298
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,034
I got mistaken for that guy
in <i>Life of Pi</i> once,

299
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:56,403
and I'm still
floating.

300
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,909
Sheldon, it's me.

301
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:02,911
Oh, hey.

302
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,745
D-Did you see that?

303
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:08,315
I-I figured out how to open
the door all by myself.

304
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:13,787
Maybe I'll fling some feces
around my cage to celebrate.

305
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,291
What are you talking about?

306
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,560
I know you've been giving me
secret puzzle tests.

307
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,231
Sheldon, open
the door.

308
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:25,899
I can't.

309
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:28,902
I'm naked.

310
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:30,904
I just saw you.

311
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,207
Hang on.

312
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,776
Open the door now.

313
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,444
- Oh, hey.
- Pull up your pants!

314
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:41,949
It's not a big deal.

315
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:45,152
I run tests like this on
undergrads all the time.

316
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,820
If you fill out some
paperwork at the university,

317
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:49,122
I can get you $5.

318
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:50,791
I don't want $5.

319
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,359
I want my dignity.

320
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:55,395
So what are we talking,
like, ten bucks?

321
00:13:57,865 --> 00:13:59,433
Thank you.
Thanks.

322
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:03,503
Sorry again.
No problem.

323
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:06,673
A-Are you sure
you're not him?

324
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:07,841
Uh, you can tell us.

325
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:10,444
We're scientists,
not crazy fanboys.

326
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,981
All right, fine.

327
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,449
I'm him.

328
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,785
And you're eating
alone at a deli.

329
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,988
I don't buy it--
you're not him.

330
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,157
I just wanted
to eat my lunch in peace.

331
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,325
But I really am him.

332
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,427
And thank you very much
for being a fan.

333
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,962
If you want, uh,
let's take a picture.

334
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:30,297
That would be great.

335
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:31,431
Great.
Yeah, thank you.

336
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,766
You bet.

337
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:38,839
Wait, hang on.

338
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:41,208
If you're really
Nathan Fillion,

339
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,244
what's the line from <i>Firefly</i>
<i>about your bonnet?</i>

340
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,981
"I swear by my pretty floral
bonnet, I will end you."

341
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:51,785
That's it,
that's the line.

342
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,787
Although...

343
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,490
I knew the line--
doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.

344
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,893
Do you want the picture or not?

345
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,729
I want a picture
with Nathan Fillion.

346
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:06,066
How about a picture with a guy
who looks like Nathan Fillion

347
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:09,303
but a little more annoyed
than Nathan Fillion usually is?

348
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:12,939
What do you think?

349
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,642
Eh, it's good enough
for Facebook.

350
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:25,218
I can't believe
they did that.

351
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
I know-- it's so insulting.

352
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,889
At one point,
they had me figure out

353
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,858
how to get a banana
out of a puzzle box.

354
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,861
Wait, Sheldon gave me
a banana in a box.

355
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:37,064
He was testing me, too.

356
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,066
Unbelievable.

357
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,901
And how could a chimp
even solve that?

358
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:42,402
That was impossible.

359
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,771
Really? You couldn't get it out?

360
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:49,710
Thank you.

361
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,712
Wow, the
store looks great.

362
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,714
So you guys were
testing us both?

363
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:54,748
What is the
matter with you?

364
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,249
Eh, what's
the matter with them is

365
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:57,851
they think they're so smart
they don't care

366
00:15:57,853 --> 00:15:59,519
if they hurt
other people's feelings.

367
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,188
Sounds like us.
That's not true.

368
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:06,526
I still don't understand
why you're upset.

369
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:09,529
You solved every puzzle faster
than all of the chimps.

370
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,199
Well, except Barnabas,
but he was on Adderall.

371
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:16,203
I'm sorry, but it's
making me crazy.

372
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,538
Can you please
just let it go?

373
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,507
Oh, I can help
you with that.

374
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:24,311
Imagine you're holding
an ordinary pen.

375
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:29,383
While your favorite pen is
safe and secure in your pocket.

376
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,787
Hold that thought.

377
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:34,789
Hello?

378
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,057
How can I make this up
to you?

379
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,726
The answer's
in this puzzle box.

380
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,895
Let's see
if you can open it.

381
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,734
You could have at least warned
him about the furniture.

382
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:49,803
That's what I said
when we moved it.

383
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,304
You helped him?!

384
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:54,307
No, Stuart picked out those
throw pillows all on his own.

385
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:00,514
Hey, you okay?

386
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:01,948
Uh, no.

387
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,116
What's wrong?

388
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:05,118
Um...

389
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,621
my mom died.

390
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,723
What?

391
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,058
Uh...

392
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,061
that was my aunt.

393
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:18,064
Ma took a nap.

394
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,399
She never woke up.

395
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:22,436
Oh, my God, Howie.

396
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,807
I'm so sorry.

397
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,409
What can we do?

398
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:34,114
I don't know.

399
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,320
May I say something?

400
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:41,655
Not right
now, Sheldon.

401
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:42,989
But I think it would
be comforting.

402
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,925
Buddy...
No, it's okay.

403
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:46,827
What?

404
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:50,530
When I lost my own father,

405
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,732
I didn't have any friends
to help me through it.

406
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,635
You do.

407
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:04,211
I really thought
he was gonna say, "Let it go."

408
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,694
Okay, thanks, Bernadette.

409
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,362
Travel safe.

410
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,032
Okay, bye.

411
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,534
They booked a flight.

412
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,769
They're heading
to the airport now.

413
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,571
How's Howard holding up?

414
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,905
He's hanging in there.

415
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,540
How are you doing, Stuart?

416
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:33,910
Still can't believe she's gone.

417
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,880
I mean, that woman took me in.

418
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,616
If it wasn't for her,
I-I would have been homeless.

419
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,618
One of us would
have taken you in.

420
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,920
Yeah, I don't recall any offers.

421
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,391
But, you know, uh, I-I'm glad
it worked out the way it did

422
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:52,462
because I got to know
this wonderful person.

423
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,131
Yeah.

424
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,032
Mrs. Wolowitz was
pretty special.

425
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,301
When I first moved to America,

426
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,837
Howard was my only friend.

427
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,074
She made me feel
so welcome in her home.

428
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,077
Which says a lot,
because, those first few years,

429
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,746
she thought I was the gardener.

430
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,549
Whenever I saw her,

431
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,552
she'd say I was too skinny
and try and feed me.

432
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,089
She did that to me, too.

433
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,458
Don't take this away from me.

434
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,095
I didn't care
for her yelling.

435
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,098
But now that I'm not going
to hear it again,

436
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,666
I'm sad.

437
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,668
If you want,
I can yell at you later.

438
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,805
It won't be as good.

439
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,243
Let's have a toast.

440
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,014
To Mrs. Wolowitz.

441
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,859
A loving mother...

442
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,864
...to all of us.

443
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,733
We'll miss you.

444
