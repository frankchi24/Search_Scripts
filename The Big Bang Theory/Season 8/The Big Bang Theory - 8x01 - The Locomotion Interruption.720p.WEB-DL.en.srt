00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,900
Previously on <i>The Big Bang Theory...</i>

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,870
We were worried about you.

4
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:07,315
Don't be melodramatic.

5
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:10,239
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

6
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:15,050
So a few things don't go your
way and your best decision

7
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:17,623
is to ride the
rails like a hobo?

8
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:20,473
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,839
Everything is changing,
and it's simply too much.

10
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:25,824
I need to get
away and think.

11
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:27,950
Sheldon...

12
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:29,441
Yes?

13
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,253
I'm gonna miss you.

14
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,159
Of course you are.

15
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:36,850
You just made that easier.

16
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:43,455
Excuse me.

17
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:51,152
Is it at all possible that
you're knitting a pair of pants?

18
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:55,044
Oh, well, no, you're
understandably terrified.

19
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:57,127
But, you know, allow
me to explain.

20
00:00:57,134 --> 00:01:02,002
45 days ago, um, I embarked on
a railroad journey of healing

21
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:05,068
because my university was
making me do string theory,

22
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,252
and my favorite comic
book store burned down,

23
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:09,299
and when my roommate
got engaged,

24
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:11,575
my girlfriend wanted
to move in with me,

25
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,436
which was no doubt a
ploy just to see my...

26
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:17,125
well, excuse my language,
but my bathing suit parts.

27
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:22,666
Uh, sir, may I
use your phone?

28
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,647
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, well,

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,402
I understand that I'm half naked, but
there is a reasonable explanation.

30
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:32,840
While I slept in my sleeper car,
all my possessions were stolen.

31
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,354
Now, typically,
I wear pajamas,

32
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:39,351
but I recently adopted
a hobo lifestyle

33
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:42,850
and pajamas are the
sleep-pants of the Man.

34
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:47,828
I'll have you know, Mahatma
Gandhi wore no pants

35
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:50,071
and a nation rallied
behind him!

36
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:53,153
My good man... Now,
before you walk away...

37
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:54,833
I know that I may
appear deranged,

38
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,863
but I am, in fact, a
world-renowned physicist.

39
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:02,495
Ask me the difference between a
boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask!

40
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:06,814
Bosons have integer spin,

41
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,987
fermions have
half-integer spin!

42
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,479
My legs are getting cold!
Why won't anybody help me?

53
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:43,358
- Morning.
- Hi. Want to do yoga with me?

54
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,382
Um, let me just have
some coffee first,

55
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:49,233
and then I'll have the strength to tell
you how much I won't be doing that.

56
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:53,755
Hello?

57
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,488
Hello, Leonard.

58
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,699
Hey, buddy. Good to
hear your voice.

59
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,194
Uh, I'm in Kingman, Arizona, and,
uh, I need you to come pick me up.

60
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,955
I'd love to. I'm just about
to do yoga with Penny.

61
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:12,862
Leonard, I'm at the police station.
I was robbed.

62
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:16,448
Th-They took my phone, my
wallet, my iPad, everything.

63
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,159
Oh, my God, are you okay?

64
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,760
No, I'm not okay. I-I'm
wearing borrowed pants,

65
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:23,801
I-I don't have I.D.,

66
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:27,371
and one of the officers here won't
stop calling me Chicken Legs.

67
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,943
Okay. Uh, I'll-I'll come get you.
What's the address?

68
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:33,512
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh. He got all of his stuff stolen.

69
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,731
Oh...

70
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,124
Okay...

71
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:38,513
Sheldon, hang tight.

72
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,982
Hey, do you want me
to bring anything?

73
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:42,177
Oh, yes, please.
A pair of pants.

74
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:45,020
And my toothbrush.
Yeah, and my mail.

75
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,737
And a really good comeback
for Chicken Legs,

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,752
because “I know you are, but what
am I?” was met with stony silence.

77
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:54,304
I'll be there as
soon as I can.

78
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:56,870
Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine,
he's just a little rattled.

79
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,016
- Oh... - Feel like driving
to Arizona with me?

80
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:01,219
- No, I can't, I have that
job interview. - Oh, right.

81
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,391
Besides, I don't need six hours
of “Your hair is different.

82
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:04,413
“Why did you
change your hair?

83
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:07,119
I'm holding my breath until
your hair grows back.”

84
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:09,943
All right, fine.

85
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:13,599
Hey, can you think of a reason I
shouldn't invite Amy to come with me?

86
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:16,397
- Nope.
- Come on, you didn't even try.

87
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,225
Thanks for the lift.

88
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:24,255
- What's wrong with your car?
- I'm having my windows untinted.

89
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:26,717
Why?

90
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,447
Got a hot girlfriend now. I
want the haters to know.

91
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,068
What are you talking about? No
one's paying attention to you.

92
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,425
Wow.

93
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,802
How's that Hater-Ade
taste, bro?

94
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:39,615
Hey, this isn't
the way to work.

95
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,776
I just want to pop in and
make sure Ma's okay.

96
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,627
I thought Stuart was
looking after her.

97
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,729
He was, but now that her
cast is off, he moved out.

98
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,994
And honestly, I'm kind of glad.
It was getting a little weird.

99
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,134
How so?

100
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,088
I don't know, they're...

101
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,648
chummy.

102
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:57,852
Like us?

103
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:02,022
No, not like us. Creepy chummy,
like you and your dog.

104
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:05,773
She feeds him out
of her own mouth?

105
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,129
I mean, he calls her Debbie,
she calls him Stewie

106
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:13,351
and they're all giggly
around each other.

107
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,777
And believe me, when food goes in
that mouth, it does not come out.

108
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:21,644
So are you worried because
he's replacing you as a son

109
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,683
or are you worried because
he's becoming her lover?

110
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:28,829
First of all, no one can replace me
as a son. I'm her little matzo ball.

111
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,450
And secondly, my mother is well
past having any kind of sex life.

112
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:36,488
Okay, okay.

113
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:39,901
Although many older women
lead vibrant, active...

114
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,788
I said well past it!

115
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:47,595
Excuse me, Officer
Hernandez?

116
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:50,345
Any leads on the person
who stole my belongings?

117
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,806
- Not yet.
- Well, perhaps I can help.

118
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:57,592
Sherlock Holmes always says when
you eliminate the impossible,

119
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,224
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.

120
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:03,820
Now, have-have you
tried doing that?

121
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,229
Nope.

122
00:06:07,252 --> 00:06:09,431
Well, maybe you should.

123
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,695
Th-Th-There's lots of books
called “Sherlock Holmes”

124
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:15,520
and there's no books called
“Officer Hernandez.”

125
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:26,673
Thanks again for coming. Six hours
was gonna be a long drive by myself.

126
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,216
My pleasure.

127
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:30,688
And I'm not angry at
all that my boyfriend

128
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,989
was in trouble and called you
instead of me. I love that!

129
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,836
Yeah, time's gonna fly by.

130
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:44,021
I haven't been on a job
interview in years.

131
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:46,145
- I'm really nervous.
- Don't be.

132
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,254
You are built for
pharmaceutical sales.

133
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:50,616
You're cute, you're
flirty and...

134
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,398
Started that like there
were gonna be three things.

135
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:58,031
I don't have any
experience in sales.

136
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:00,213
Unless you count the bikini car
wash I did in high school.

137
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,991
But you already made me
take that off my résumé.

138
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,308
This job is a lot like
being a waitress,

139
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:09,561
except instead of pushing the fish
tacos 'cause they're about to go bad,

140
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,140
you're just pushing
our antidepressants

141
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:14,126
before the FDA finds out they
may cause rectal bleeding.

142
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:17,898
They do?

143
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:19,941
Maybe.

144
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,819
But like our lawyers say,
the world is full of things

145
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,222
that can cause a
rectum to bleed.

146
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,552
Anyway, I talked
you up to Dan.

147
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,005
He's the guy who'll
be interviewing you.

148
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:33,145
Oh, I really appreciate this. I
just hope I'm not in over my head.

149
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,989
You'll be fine.
Just be yourself.

150
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,396
I wish I felt
more confident.

151
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,246
Penny, I wouldn't have
put you up for this job

152
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,457
if I didn't think you
could handle it.

153
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,738
Oh, thank you, but
maybe I should cancel.

154
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,527
It's too late to cancel.
You're going.

155
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,004
But I don't know anything
about pharmaceuticals.

156
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:49,535
Oh, I understand. You want to do
something you're already good at.

157
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,278
I know. Why don't I
get you a job at

158
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:54,894
the Sitting Around All Day
Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?

159
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,621
They're comfortable.

160
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,439
Ma, I hope you're decent.
Raj is here!

161
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,962
You just started seeing
naked women again,

162
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:10,916
and I don't want you to be confused
about where the boobs should be.

163
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,493
Oh, hey, guys. What
are you doing here?

164
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:19,098
Uh... w-what are you doing here?
I thought you moved out.

165
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:21,013
Oh, yeah, I was going to,

166
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,115
and then Debbie and I got to talking
over dinner the other night.

167
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,051
I didn't have anyplace to go,
she likes having me around,

168
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:29,857
so we both said, “Why
leave?” at the same time.

169
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,216
It was precious.

170
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,113
It's not that precious.

171
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:40,733
I'd like to back you up, but it
sounds like it was pretty precious.

172
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:47,632
Stewie, I can't
find my glasses!

173
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,818
Be right there, Deb Deb!

174
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,931
They're probably
on her head.

175
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,127
Or in her neck. Listen.

176
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:02,033
You staying here seems like something
she would've talked to me about.

177
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:05,222
Well, maybe if you called your
mother more often, you'd know.

178
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,957
It wouldn't kill you
to pick up the phone.

179
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,251
Any word on my
stolen items?

180
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,237
We're doing
everything we can.

181
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:35,582
You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to
use cocaine to sharpen his focus.

182
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:40,910
But I'm sure those Cool Ranch
Doritos are doing the trick.

183
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:45,697
- Sheldon.
- Leonard!

184
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,945
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

185
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:50,862
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine.

186
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:52,659
Why did you come?

187
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,495
What do you mean,
why did I come?

188
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,157
You're my boyfriend. I haven't
seen you in over a month.

189
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,157
I just drove six hours
to help you out.

190
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:03,259
Don't you have anything to say
besides, “Why did you come?”

191
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:05,467
I do, but...

192
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:09,545
I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud
in front of these police officers.

193
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,031
Fine. Whisper it.

194
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:19,096
Shotgun.

195
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:31,276
So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip.
Where'd you go?

196
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:32,882
Where didn't I go?

197
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:38,366
I went to New York, Chicago,
Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.

198
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:39,655
How were they?

199
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,975
Oh, I have no idea.

200
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:43,025
I never left the
train station.

201
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:48,739
Hang on. You traveled across the entire
country and never left a train station?

202
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:49,989
Why would I?

203
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,014
That's where all the
cool trains are.

204
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,871
I'm sorry, so you
never went outside?

205
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,025
Or had a single
piece of fruit.

206
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:03,106
So...

207
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:07,610
why do you think you'd make a
good pharmaceutical sales rep?

208
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,528
- Well, I'm a people person.
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:12,612
People like me. Some of my
favorite people are people.

210
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,349
I feel like I'm saying
“people” a lot.

211
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:18,024
People, people, people, PE...
Okay, I'm done.

212
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,508
You sure?

213
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,320
People. Yes.

214
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,377
Good!

215
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:28,164
So, how do you feel your previous
job experience has prepared you

216
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,861
for a career like this?

217
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:33,001
Uh, well, as a waitress, sales
was a big part of my job.

218
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:35,873
I mean, believe me, I convinced
a lot of very large customers,

219
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:38,549
who should not be eating cheesecake,
to have more cheesecake.

220
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:42,876
I mean, one of those chubsters
even had an insulin pump!

221
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,527
Uh-huh!

222
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:48,404
I have an insulin pump.

223
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,025
People.

224
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,595
It's weird, right?

225
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:00,845
A grown man in his 30s
living with my mother.

226
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:04,356
That is weird. I thought
he was, like, 45.

227
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,118
Come on, you don't think
it's a little odd?

228
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:11,016
I don't know! I mean, she's lonely.
He needs a place to stay.

229
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,020
I doubt there's any funny
business going on.

230
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,644
And even if there was, who cares?
They're both adults.

231
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:19,332
“Who cares”?! You wouldn't
care if I slept with your mom?

232
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,188
You know what? You're my best friend,
and she's in a bad marriage.

233
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:23,886
I give you my blessing.

234
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:30,177
This is stupid. I'm just gonna call
my mother and be honest with her.

235
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:32,702
'Cause that's what
little matzo balls do.

236
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,783
<i>This is Debbie!</i>

237
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,314
<i>And this is Stuart!</i>

238
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,181
<i>Just kidding!</i>

239
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,810
<i>Leave a message!</i>

240
00:12:49,913 --> 00:12:52,218
This is the part
where you talk.

241
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:58,806
All right, let's say a physician was
prescribing one of our competitor's drugs.

242
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,580
How would you convince
them to switch to ours?

243
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:07,741
Um...

244
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:12,378
any chance his car needs to be
washed by a girl in a bikini?

245
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,916
No...

246
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,288
Okay, I'm really sorry
for wasting your time.

247
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:21,092
Don't worry about it.
Thanks for stopping by.

248
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,162
Okay, thanks.

249
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,575
Um, I'm sor... Listen,
could you do me a favor

250
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,934
and not tell Bernadette how
badly I blew this interview?

251
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:33,054
She'll get upset. And
honestly I'm a...

252
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,928
a little terrified of her.

253
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,149
Wait, wait. You're
scared of Bernadette?

254
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:41,197
Yeah, kind of.

255
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:43,586
I thought it was just me!

256
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:49,982
E-Everyone thinks she's so nice
with that squeaky little voice.

257
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,392
I know, but she's
kind of a bully!

258
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,392
She is! I-I didn't
even want to meet you,

259
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,473
but, uh, I was too
scared to say no to her.

260
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:01,486
Me, too!

261
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,367
Yeah, yeah! One-one
time, I had...

262
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:04,272
Oh!

263
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,749
I had to tell her we were cutting
the-the research funding

264
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:08,335
for one of the drugs
she was developing.

265
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,960
What happened?

266
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,264
I couldn't do it! She's
still working on it!

267
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:19,385
Oh! We're not gonna tell
her about this, right?

268
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,032
Oh, my God, no! No, no...

269
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,675
At the hot dog stand in the
Denver train station...

270
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:26,952
Heinz ketchup.

271
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,905
At the hot dog stand in the
Salt Lake City train station...

272
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,208
Heinz ketchup.

273
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:34,620
At the hot dog stand in the
Indianapolis train station...

274
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:38,722
I don't care.

275
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:42,302
Wrong! Hunt's!

276
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:47,620
Hey, Amy! What do you say? You ready
to move on to the mustard round?

277
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,216
Have you not noticed that
I've been sitting back here

278
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:53,209
quietly stewing for
the past two hours?

279
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:56,472
I just thought you
were bad at the game.

280
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,694
I'm mad at you!

281
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,682
How could you just go away like
that without even saying good-bye,

282
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:05,635
and then call Leonard
for help instead of me?

283
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:09,413
Amy?

284
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:13,591
May I please have a moment of
privacy to speak with my roommate?

285
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,206
We're in a moving car!

286
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:22,014
What do you expect me to do?
Stick my fingers in my ears?

287
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:25,469
Well, I was thinking put your head out
the window like a dog, but that'll work.

288
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:28,585
Please? This'll be quick.

289
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,302
Leonard?

290
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:38,267
As soon as we get home, I
want to have coitus with Amy.

291
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,756
Okay, she can't hear.

292
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:53,797
The reason I called
you is because

293
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:57,291
I didn't want Amy to know I
couldn't make it on my own.

294
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,338
What's the big deal?

295
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,135
Oh, of course it's
no big deal to you.

296
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:06,509
You idolize me, and nothing could ever
knock me off that pedestal you put me on.

297
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:10,606
Well, yeah, it's true.
You-you are a god to me.

298
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:13,437
Can I stop now?

299
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,383
Just tell her.

300
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:20,261
I called Leonard
because...

301
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:24,814
I failed. And I didn't want
you to think less of me.

302
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,235
You were worried
about that?

303
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,196
Yes.

304
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,505
Sheldon...

305
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:39,740
it's okay with me that
you're not perfect.

306
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,150
Can I have one more
moment with Leonard?

307
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:48,816
Sure.

308
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,100
Amy just hurt my feelings. I
want to break up with her.

309
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:07,491
Now, I never thought I'd say this, but
I'm kind of excited to see Sheldon.

310
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,170
I never thought I'd say this,
but Penny got a job today.

311
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:13,728
She did?

312
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:18,137
Well, the only reason she got it is 'cause
the guy who interviewed her loves me.

313
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,462
What do you want?

314
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:32,038
I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might
not be okay with me staying at your mom's.

315
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,942
You're right, I'm not.
I think it's weird.

316
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,903
- Howie?
- It is. He's a grown man.

317
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,809
He's just gonna live
there rent-free?

318
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,171
How is that gonna motivate him to
get off his butt and get a job?

319
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,460
I mean, do you
even have a plan?

320
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:47,154
Hey, you're not
my father, okay?

321
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:49,326
And besides, your mother
and I were talking...

322
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:52,160
“Your mother and I”?
You're not my father!

323
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:54,535
- I didn't say I was your father!
- Well, I didn't say I was your father!

324
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,434
Okay, calm down. You're not his
father, he's not your father!

325
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:59,522
Nobody's anybody's father.

326
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,245
I-I'm sorry you don't like my
life choices, but it's my life!

327
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,604
Well, it's my house,
it's my rules!

328
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,948
Oh-oh! Okay, Dad!

329
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,246
If I mow the lawn, can
I have my allowance?

330
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:12,488
Hey, don't you take that
sarcastic tone with him!

331
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:15,051
- I don't have to listen to you!
- Don't talk to her like that!

332
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:18,475
That is my mother... Wife!
My wife! I said my wife!

333
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,857
You know what? This isn't
getting us anywhere.

334
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:24,860
When you're ready to apologize,
you know where to find me.

335
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,659
Well, yeah, in my house!

336
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,364
That's right, sucka!

337
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,536
I wish I'd never
gone on that trip.

338
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,934
I feel no better now
than when I left.

339
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:38,614
But you still
accomplished something.

340
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:42,730
Yeah. If you had told anyone that you
were going away on a train by yourself

341
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:45,441
across the country, do you know
what they would have said?

342
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:47,325
- That I couldn't do it?
- Exactly.

343
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,529
Right after they
said, “Yay!”

344
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:52,956
But you did do it.

345
00:18:52,995 --> 00:18:56,901
So what if it didn't all go your way?
That's what makes it an adventure.

346
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:59,305
That's a good point.

347
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:02,170
Yeah, I'm a lot like
Gandalf the Grey.

348
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:07,873
He fought the Balrog and emerged
stronger than ever as Gandalf the White.

349
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:12,866
I was robbed of my phone and pants,
and I, too, came back stronger.

350
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:16,569
And whiter, too, 'cause I wasn't
in direct sunlight for six weeks.

351
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:20,716
See? This trip was
good for you.

352
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,395
Indeed.

353
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:25,372
I was the world's
smartest caterpillar.

354
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,111
And then after pupating in
our nation's railway system,

355
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:33,626
I've burst forth as the
world's smartest butterfly.

356
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,110
Butterfly could've gotten
himself home from Arizona.

357
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:41,789
Yeah, I feel renewed.

358
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:45,277
I'm ready to deal with any
changes that come my way.

359
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:47,445
- Hey!
- Hey!

360
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:48,538
Look who's back!

361
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:50,352
Your hair is different.
You changed your hair.

362
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,430
I can't take this.
I'm out.

363
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,780
Would you like to see
pictures from my trip?

364
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:01,194
I thought your
phone got stolen.

365
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:04,975
Yeah, it did, but luckily all my
photos got backed up to the Cloud.

366
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,485
And you thought they all
had a silver lining.

367
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:09,726
Here... day one.

368
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:12,520
Uh, this was the seat
I was going to sit in

369
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,433
but didn't because there
were cracker crumbs on it.

370
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:19,446
As it was first class,
I suspect Ritz.

371
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:23,106
This is the
train bathroom.

372
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:28,027
This is the Imodium I took so I would
never have to use the train bathroom.

373
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:32,572
I cannot believe you traveled the entire
country and never left the train station.

374
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:37,267
I know. You know, I almost died in a
fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put.

375
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:41,068
FYI... that's when the
Imodium gave out.
