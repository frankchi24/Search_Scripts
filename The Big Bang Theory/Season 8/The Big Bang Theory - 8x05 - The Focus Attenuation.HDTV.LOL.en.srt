00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,814
Hey, I read
that someone invented a way

3
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:08,233
to convert your footsteps
into electromagnetic energy

4
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:10,152
so you can charge
your cell phone while walking.

5
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:12,404
We had that idea years ago.

6
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:14,272
How come we never
did anything with it?

7
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:16,775
Probably because we left the
diagram of it in the restaurant,

8
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:19,211
and none of us
wanted to walk back.

9
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:23,081
I know the real reason you never
made progress with that idea.

10
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,533
You thought of it

11
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:26,585
September 22, 2007.

12
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:28,954
Two days later, Penny moved in,

13
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:31,123
and so much blood rushed
to your genitals,

14
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,041
your brain became a ghost town.

15
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:36,745
That's not what happened.

16
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:38,463
I remember it distinctly

17
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,766
because I had just
composed my annual poem

18
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,719
commemorating the anniversary
of Dr. Seuss's death.

19
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:44,970
No one wants
to hear it.

20
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:46,471
Why, die.

21
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:48,023
Why did he die?

22
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,358
Old, told.

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,309
I was told he was old.

24
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:54,613
Penny is not the reason
I didn't pursue that idea.

25
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:56,732
Oh, really?
Since meeting her,

26
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,900
what have been
your greatest accomplishments?

27
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:00,035
Easy.

28
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,037
Sleeping with Penny.

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,823
Getting Penny to go back out
with him after she dumped him.

30
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:07,159
Tricking Penny
into getting engaged.

31
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:10,328
And a few weeks ago,
he almost did a pull-up.

32
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:14,483
I think
someone owes me an apology.

33
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,835
Well, don't feel bad.

34
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:18,970
I think we've all
been distracted

35
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:20,789
since the girls
entered our lives.

36
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,591
You admit Amy's a distraction?

37
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:25,177
Oh, very much so.
Listen to this.

38
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,179
This is from two days ago.

39
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,848
“Hi. Hope you're having
a good day.”

40
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,384
Who has time
for this constant sexting?

41
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:36,688
Well, maybe
we <i>have</i> lost our focus.

42
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,325
It wouldn't kill us to get
together and brainstorm ideas.

43
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:42,861
Ooh, we could have one
of those retreats.

44
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:44,246
Like our own science retreat.

45
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,498
My cousin has a cabin
out in the woods.

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,867
I'm not going to a
cabin in the woods.

47
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,120
Did you see the movie
<i>Cabin in the Woods?</i>

48
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,422
Then we'll go to a hotel.

49
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:56,591
A hotel?
Did you see <i>The Shining?</i>

50
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:58,510
We could go up

51
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,762
to Big Bear
and get a house on the lake.

52
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,381
Did you see
<i>The Lake House?</i>

53
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:05,717
Nothing bad happens
in <i>The Lake House.</i>

54
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,087
Yeah, well, no,
not to them. To me.

55
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:10,222
Time traveling mailbox.

56
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:11,440
The only time that traveled

57
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:14,142
was an hour and half
of my life down the toilet.

58
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,944
Fine. Then we'll just stay here
and do it.

59
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:17,646
Well, you didn't suggest
a beach house.

60
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:18,997
You would go to a beach house?

61
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,366
Well, good Lord, no...

72
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,275
Hey.
Hey.

73
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:54,910
So, the guys and
I are talking

74
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:57,112
about having kind of a
science retreat this weekend.

75
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:58,364
I just wanted to
know if that's okay.

76
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,332
You and I had talked about
going to brunch on Sunday...

77
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,784
Want to go to Vegas
this weekend?

78
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:02,918
Of course I do.

79
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,086
Bernadette?

80
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:05,421
Girl's weekend.
Vegas. You in?

81
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:07,006
Hell, yeah!
Yes!

82
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,124
I'll check flights.
I'll check hotels.

83
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,543
I'll check my underpants.
I'm so excited, I think I peed.

84
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,471
They seem okay with it.

85
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,193
Hey.

86
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,112
Hey.
Hey. I didn't think you'd make it.

87
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:31,613
Why not?
Well, 'cause you have

88
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:33,148
a steady girlfriend now,
and we assumed

89
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,368
you'd have to stay home to lower
the food down to her in the pit.

90
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:44,159
For your information,
Emily is working tonight.

91
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:46,445
Yeah, one would assume,
on getting out of the pit.

92
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,132
Okay, let's focus.

93
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,051
The girls are gone,
we have 48 hours.

94
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,386
There are no distractions.
Let's change the world.

95
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,972
Thinking caps on.
Here we go.

96
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,474
Ooh, this is exciting.
We're innovating.

97
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,476
I feel like
we're in the Facebook movie.

98
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,094
Oh. I never saw that.

99
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,896
- Yeah. Really?
- Oh.

100
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:06,014
It's wonderful, and I swear
I'm not saying that

101
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,183
because Justin Timberlake
is in it.

102
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:11,153
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

103
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:12,521
We should watch it.

104
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,740
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

105
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:16,992
Guys...

106
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,327
in 30 seconds, we went from

107
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,712
“Let's change the world”
to “Let's watch TV.”

108
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,316
I'm sorry. Is that a “no”?

109
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:25,667
Okay. No.

110
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:26,919
Leonard's right.
We're here to focus.

111
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,004
Didn't we used
to have a list of all our ideas?

112
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:30,706
I-I think I still have it.

113
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,391
I did not get a clear answer.

114
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:34,510
I'm gonna set this down now.

115
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,096
Ah, here it is.

116
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:38,764
Whoa.

117
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,549
I haven't looked
at these in years.

118
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:42,217
“Robot girlfriend.”

119
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,520
Mm, that was mine.

120
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:47,890
“Robot prostitute.”

121
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:50,442
Also mine.

122
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:51,710
Wait. I'm confused.

123
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:53,662
Why would you need
both a robot girlfriend

124
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,230
and a robot prostitute?

125
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:56,899
There's just some things
you don't do

126
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,517
with your robot girlfriend.

127
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:02,404
Boy, when you met Bernadette,

128
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:05,157
the field of robotics
really took a hit.

129
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,292
Okay, let's just skip

130
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:09,912
all the inventions
you can have sex with.

131
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:17,886
All right, no... here we go:

132
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:19,721
“Ergonomic heated seat cushion”"

133
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,256
No, it vibrates.
Keep going.

134
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,728
You know, let's just come up
with something new.

135
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,063
You know,

136
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:30,265
a number of significant
innovations have been inspired

137
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,767
by science fiction.

138
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,436
The-the geosynchronous satellite
from Arthur C. Clarke.

139
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:37,606
The Motorola flip phone...
that came from <i>Star Trek.</i>

140
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,942
Yeah, and I've long suspected
that the idea

141
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:42,044
of an African-American president
was stolen

142
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:44,796
from the movie <i>Deep Impact.</i>

143
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:47,416
Hey,

144
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:49,935
the future they show
in <i>Back to the Future II</i>

145
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:51,670
is only a year away.

146
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:54,206
A lot of the things in that
movie haven't been invented yet.

147
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,424
How cool would that be

148
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:56,959
if we could make
one of those a reality?

149
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:59,044
If we could figure out
the scientific basis

150
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,295
for Marty's hover board,

151
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:02,731
that would have
universal application.

152
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,967
Well, it's-it's possible
at absolute zero,

153
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:06,118
but we would
have to remove

154
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,803
the temperature restrictions.

155
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,087
Oh, I have an idea.

156
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,355
I think I have the same one.

157
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:12,491
We got to watch
<i>Back to the Future II!</i>

158
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,528
I'll make the popcorn.

159
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,532
So, where should
we go first?

160
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:21,667
Ooh.

161
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,318
There's a cover band
in the lounge.

162
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,387
Nah.
But they play Barry Manilow.

163
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,341
No.
But they're called “Fairly Manilow”"

164
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:31,627
Oh. Okay.

165
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,161
Great!
No!

166
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,131
Well, what do you want
to do?

167
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,466
Well, we're in Vegas.

168
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:39,818
I want to go downstairs,
get a bucket of margaritas,

169
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,004
dance until I vomit
all over a roulette wheel

170
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:43,522
and watch it go everywhere.

171
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,341
What if we don't want to vomit?

172
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:49,261
Oh, you will. That's why
they give you the bucket.

173
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,097
Uh-oh.
What?

174
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,599
It's my boss.

175
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,684
They moved my field ride
up to Monday.

176
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:56,818
What does that mean?

177
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,937
It means instead
of having a week to study,

178
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:00,188
I only have two days.

179
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,323
That sucks.

180
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:02,975
Can you start
in the morning?

181
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,026
Uh, it's kind of a lot.

182
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:05,694
You know,
let me do a little tonight,

183
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:07,362
and I'll catch up
with you guys later.

184
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:09,698
You sure?
Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

185
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,502
So, um, now that
Penny's not coming...

186
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,754
We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.
Okay.

187
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,280
Hold on. Pause.

188
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:27,466
Something doesn't make sense.
Look...

189
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:31,687
In 2015, Biff steals
the sports almanac

190
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,639
and takes the time machine

191
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:37,476
back to 1955, to give it
to his younger self.

192
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:40,646
But as soon as he does that,
he changes the future,

193
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:42,981
so the 2015 he
returns to would be

194
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:47,069
a different 2015, not the 2015
that Marty and Doc were in.

195
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:50,088
This is <i>Hot Tub Time Machine</i>
all over again.

196
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,410
If future Biff
goes back to 2015

197
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,296
right after he gives
young Biff the almanac,

198
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:00,415
he could get back to the 2015
with Marty and Doc in it.

199
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:03,719
Because it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

200
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:05,837
that 1955 Biff
placed his first bet.

201
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,972
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

202
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:08,724
Is “placed” right?

203
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:09,641
What do you mean?

204
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:11,810
Is “placed” the right tense

205
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:14,012
for something that would have
happened in the future

206
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:17,099
of a past that was affected
by something from the future?

207
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:21,069
Had will have placed?

208
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:23,605
That's my boy.

209
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:28,660
Okay, so, it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

210
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:30,696
that Biff had will have
placed his first bet

211
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,114
and made his millions.

212
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:34,249
That's when
he altered the timeline.

213
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:36,968
Yeah, but he had will
haven't placed it!

214
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:41,456
What?!

215
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,458
Unlike <i>Hot Tub Time Machine,</i>

216
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,544
this couldn't be more simple.

217
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,546
When Biff gets the almanac
in 1955,

218
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:49,965
the alternate future
he creates isn't the one

219
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,851
in which Marty and Doc Brown
ever use the time machine

220
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,186
to travel to 2015.

221
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,137
Therefore,

222
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,605
in the new timeline,

223
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,607
Marty and Doc never brought
the time machine...

224
00:08:58,609 --> 00:08:59,691
W-Wait.

225
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,276
Is “brought” right?

226
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:09,634
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought?

227
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,788
I don't know.
You did it to me.

228
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,374
Oh, I'm going with it.

229
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:18,160
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought

230
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,462
the time machine to 2015.

231
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:23,048
That means 2015 Biff could also

232
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,002
not had have had brought
the almanac to 1955 Biff.

233
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:31,673
Therefore, the timeline in which
1955 Biff gets the almanac

234
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:33,175
is also the timeline

235
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:36,011
in which 1955 Biff
<i>never</i> gets the almanac.

236
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,846
And not just “never gets.”

237
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:41,833
Never have, never hasn't,
never had have hasn't.

238
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,123
He's right.

239
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,911
Also, what kind of name is Biff?

240
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:55,480
Sounds like when you pop open
a can of Pillsbury dough.

241
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:58,083
Biff.

242
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:02,671
Oh, that stuff is so good
wrapped around cocktail weenies.

243
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:03,622
Guys...

244
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:04,840
Do you know that
the word “wiener”

245
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,041
comes from the German name

246
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,375
of the Austrian capital
Vienna, or “Wien”?

247
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:09,711
Do you know if you look
at Austria on a map

248
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,129
it actually looks like a wiener?

249
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,799
Guys, what are
we doing?

250
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,966
W-We sent the girls away

251
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:16,184
so we could focus.

252
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:19,304
I don't think it worked.

253
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:38,943
Maybe after this, you'll be
in the mood for some Manilow.

254
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:42,029
I think after this,
I'll be dead.

255
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,064
Look at us out,

256
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:45,950
while Penny's in
the room studying.

257
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,201
I'm proud of her.

258
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:48,335
This is a great opportunity.

259
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:50,204
It's nice to see her take it
seriously.

260
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:51,206
It is.

261
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:52,207
But enough about Penny.

262
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,008
Let's talk about us.

263
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,343
We're looking good.

264
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:58,429
We are...

265
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,097
Better than good.

266
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:03,517
I mean, look at you.
Your body's bangin'!

267
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,302
Amy!

268
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:06,637
Don't “Amy” me.

269
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,638
We're always talking
about how hot Penny is.

270
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,974
Come on... scientist
to scientist,

271
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:13,644
how big are those
Hadron Colliders?

272
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,898
You're embarrassing me.

273
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,983
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

274
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,318
I'll show you the divot
in my spine.

275
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,929
What?

276
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,872
No, no, it's okay.
I was born with it.

277
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:26,073
If you put a double-A
battery in there,

278
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:28,959
it makes my leg kick.

279
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,162
All right.

280
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:34,415
Oh, this is already better.
There are

281
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,800
far fewer distractions in here.

282
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:37,918
Plus, this is where our minds

283
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,219
are conditioned
to focus on work.

284
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:40,921
So, I've been thinking
about the hover boards,

285
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:43,640
and maybe there's a way
we could use Maglev technology.

286
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:46,343
Or if we could figure out a
way to supercool the materials,

287
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:47,978
we could utilize
quantum coupling.

288
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,147
Well, I wonder
if anyone's tried that.

289
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,648
Go online and look it up.

290
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,233
Oh, I can't argue with him.

291
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:54,685
It's right there on the screen.

292
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:58,238
Austria does look like a wiener.

293
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:00,407
That's nothing, dude.

294
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,559
Go check out
how hung Florida is.

295
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:06,780
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's
walking funny.

296
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:08,198
Can we get back to work?

297
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,951
Yeah... he's right.

298
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:13,170
Oh, here's a thought.

299
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:16,623
What if we use some form of
operant conditioning techniques

300
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,592
to keep us from
getting off topic?

301
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:20,461
Like behavior modification?

302
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,512
Yeah, exactly.

303
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:22,780
Did you know

304
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,215
those techniques were used
to actually teach pigeons

305
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:26,767
to play ping-pong?

306
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:28,802
That cannot be true.

307
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:41,648
Hey, it was match point.

308
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:44,201
Some psychologists

309
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:46,153
perform operant conditioning
with punishment.

310
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:47,621
Maybe we can come up
with a punishment

311
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:49,490
for straying off topic.

312
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:54,244
Not getting to see who wins at
pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.

313
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:56,413
We could snap a rubber
band on our wrists

314
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,382
every time we
get sidetracked.

315
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:01,835
Mmm, not bad.
You know, in medieval times,

316
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:04,004
idle chatter was punished
with a device called

317
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:05,672
the scold's bridle.

318
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:07,257
It's an iron cage

319
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,345
that's locked around the head
and pierces the tongue.

320
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:14,548
If only we had one.

321
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,818
Oh! I'll check Amazon.

322
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,492
Housekeeping!

323
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:28,946
We had a complaint

324
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:32,466
about somebody pooping
on a party in there!

325
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:37,538
It was us the whole time!

326
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,541
Why'd you tell her?
It was working.

327
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:42,009
Was it working?

328
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,428
Yeah.

329
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,181
Oh, I'm so sorry.

330
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:50,050
You guys look
like you're having fun.

331
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,552
We're having
the best time.

332
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:56,056
Guess who won $100
playing craps.

333
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,558
That's a dollar.

334
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,145
Then guess who wildly overtipped
a cocktail waitress.

335
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:03,614
Hey, Penny... hey, let's go.

336
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:06,950
We found a place that has
Australian male strippers.

337
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:08,068
We want to see

338
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,404
if they twirl their junk
in the other direction.

339
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,749
That sounds so great.

340
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:25,252
But I have
a little more studying to do.

341
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:28,055
Can you
believe this nerd?

342
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,925
Come on, do you want to
sit here being a loser,

343
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:33,093
or do you want to watch me climb

344
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:34,595
into an Australian man's
G-string

345
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,763
like a baby kangaroo?

346
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:45,239
All right, guys, look,
I would love to go out,

347
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,773
but I've got
to get this done, okay?

348
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,942
So have fun at the club.
And if you get

349
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:50,444
in trouble, find a policeman.

350
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:52,279
And if he's taking off
his pants,

351
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,665
he is not a real policeman.

352
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:58,202
Okay, okay, this is obviously
very important to her.

353
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,371
Let's just, we'll help her study
so she can get done quicker.

354
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,090
Here...
here, I'm gonna quiz you.

355
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:05,759
I'm gonna quiz you.

356
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,128
I got your notes!

357
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,346
I got your notes!

358
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:11,265
I got your notes!
If you want these,

359
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:14,368
they're gonna be
at the strip club!

360
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:17,804
Aren't you gonna chase her?

361
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:20,107
To the walk-in closet? Sure.

362
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,149
Okay, so we agree,

363
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:30,484
whenever someone
takes us off topic

364
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:33,787
they get their arm
hair yanked off.

365
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:34,905
And I really
can't let that happen

366
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:36,290
or the girl who does
my eyebrows will think

367
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,791
I've been cheating on her.

368
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:42,329
All right, now, one benefit
of quantum coupling...

369
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:43,714
Wait, no, question:

370
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:45,749
who decides if someone's
gone off topic?

371
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:48,335
I think it'll be pretty clear.
If not, we'll take a vote.

372
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,053
Oh, and also...

373
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:52,673
Ow!

374
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,758
W-We didn't vote!

375
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,927
We didn't have to...
that was clearly a tangent.

376
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,595
Now come on.
Back to work.

377
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:00,480
If we're leaning towards
quantum coupling...

378
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,599
Aah! Why?

379
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,318
You said
“quantum coupling.”

380
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,520
That made me think
of the show <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

381
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:08,212
That's a tangent
and it's your fault.

382
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:09,601
That's ridiculous.

383
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,625
Sheldon, I vote that
is not a tangent.

384
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,694
Thank you.
And now I owe you one.

385
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,779
Ow!

386
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:17,531
That was your fault.

387
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,082
Hey!

388
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,335
Ooh, that is a lot of hair.

389
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,587
Ow!

390
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,007
And now I'm gonna hear it
from Jenny.

391
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,009
Everyone stop.

392
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:30,260
This was a stupid idea.

393
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,546
Negative reinforcement
isn't working.

394
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:34,381
I think you mean
positive punishment.

395
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:37,834
Negative reinforcement is the
removal of a positive stimulus.

396
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,219
It's a common mistake.

397
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:41,471
Negative reinforcement
is really wrong?

398
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:43,223
Oh, it's used incorrectly
all the time.

399
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:45,025
Even Bill Murray
makes that mistake

400
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:47,044
in the first scene
of <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

401
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:50,681
No way. Not Bill Murray.

402
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:53,233
I'm studying the effect
of negative reinforcement

403
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,152
on ESP ability.

404
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:56,236
Huh.

405
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:59,406
Bill Murray did get it wrong.

406
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:01,208
Jump ahead to the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.

407
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,909
No!

408
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:04,878
Leonard's right.

409
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,413
We can't just jump ahead.

410
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:09,082
We have to watch the whole movie.
Look.

411
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:11,218
We keep procrastinating.

412
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,053
We saw <i>Back to the Future II,</i>

413
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:14,204
pigeons playing
ping-pong,

414
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,756
a bunch of countries
that look like genitals

415
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:18,759
and one guy whose genitals
look like Denmark!

416
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:22,829
Yeah, sorry for
clicking on that.

417
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,400
It's late.
We've wasted hours.

418
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:28,185
Can we please find it
in ourselves

419
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:29,986
to do any amount of work
tonight?

420
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:33,573
But we didn't see them bust
one ghost.

421
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:37,744
So y-you're saying
we should stand here

422
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,579
in my lab on a
Saturday night

423
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,781
and watch the rest
of <i>Ghostbusters</i>

424
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,449
on a crappy laptop?

425
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:43,917
No.

426
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:56,430
It really does hold up.

427
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:08,642
See? Isn't this better
than a hotel room?

428
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:11,645
Yep. Shake that thing!

429
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,932
Have you ever seen a body
so fine?

430
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:18,618
We had some pretty hot corpses
in my anatomy class,

431
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,121
but none of them
moved like that!

432
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,504
Good morning.

433
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,138
You want to go
to the pool?

434
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:45,510
Come on...
you said it yourself.

435
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,379
Only nerds and losers
stay in the room.

436
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:51,632
Oh! Oh!
Oh!

437
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:53,351
Wow, it's bright out.

438
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:56,020
Isn't it bright? I should
probably close these curtains.

439
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,638
Nah. Bye!

440
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:01,592
Would you please close
the drapes?

441
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:02,894
Okay.

442
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,000
