1
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:04,317
Leonard, I've been working
on an opening joke

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,859
for our lecture at Berkeley.

3
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,030
Oh, I like to laugh.

4
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,535
But say it anyway.

5
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:11,475
Okay, um...

6
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,142
What do you say
to a graduate

7
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:16,416
of the UC Berkeley
physics department?

8
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:19,018
I'll have fries with that.

9
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:21,996
Because his education
hasn't prepared him

10
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,862
for a career in the sciences.

11
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,703
You know, when they chase
you out of there,

12
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,400
you only have to run
faster than Sheldon.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,476
Are you all set
for your trip?

14
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:32,812
Yeah, I think so.

15
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:36,047
I just restocked the old PRK.

16
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,088
"PRK"?

17
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,584
Public restroom kit.

18
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,327
Everything a boy needs
for making pee pee

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,591
in new and strange places.

20
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:47,031
I don't see what's crazy
about bringing a backpack

21
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,366
with your own toilet paper
and Purell.

22
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,465
Keep going.

23
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,244
And rubber gloves,
uh, air freshener.

24
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:56,846
Um, noise-cancelling
headphones.

25
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,415
Oh, danger whistle.

26
00:00:58,417 --> 00:00:59,680
Um...

27
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:00,985
pepper spray.

28
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:03,955
Ooh, a multi-language
"occupied" sign.

29
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:05,364
Uh, let's see.

30
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,734
We have seat protectors,
uh, booties for my shoes,

31
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,799
a clothespin for my nose.

32
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:14,104
Oh, and a mirror on a stick,

33
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,512
so I can make sure the person
in the stall next to me

34
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:18,345
isn't some kind of weirdo.

35
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:24,051
You still worried some Berkeley
girl is gonna steal him away?

36
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:27,662
Yes, who do you think gave him
the danger whistle?

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,198
Would you like to play
a physics car game I invented

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,167
called "I Can't Spy"?

49
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,502
It's all the nail-biting
tension of "I Spy"

50
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:10,502
but the added fun of subatomic
particles and waves

51
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,637
outside the visible
spectrum.

52
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,205
If it's half as much fun as

53
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,341
"One Times Ten to the Fourth
Bottles of Beer on the Wall,"

54
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:18,014
I'm in.

55
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,647
I'll begin.

56
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:24,153
Uh, I can't spy
with my little eye...

57
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,992
...something passing
right through us.

58
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,656
That soy Frappuccino I had.

59
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:32,663
Will you please
play the game?

60
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,263
I can't spy
with my little eye

61
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:37,295
something passing
right through us.

62
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,367
I don't know, um...

63
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,039
If 65 billion
solar neutrinos pass

64
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,103
through a square centimeter
every second,

65
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:46,144
given the surface
area of this car is

66
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,041
about 60,000
square centimeters,

67
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:52,787
that means 3.9 times ten
to the 15th solar neutrinos?

68
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,354
I don't want
to play anymore.

69
00:02:58,356 --> 00:02:59,921
We haven't been on a road trip
in a while.

70
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,121
This is fun.

71
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:02,592
We get it-- you won the game.

72
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,393
Stop bragging.

73
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,563
No, listen, we wrote
a paper together.

74
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,299
Now we get to go to a university
and talk about it?

75
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:09,803
That's pretty cool.

76
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,506
I suppose it is.

77
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:17,042
In fact, if you'd like to
celebrate with a little music,

78
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,672
I'd be okay with that.

79
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:21,508
What...?

80
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,975
This road trip just got crazy.

81
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,202
Play that funky music,
white boy.

82
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,134
I'm surprised you know
that reference.

83
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:35,036
What reference?

84
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:41,036
So, I put stickers
on everything we're gonna sell.

85
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,898
We just need help taking it
all out to the driveway.

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,265
Can I be in charge
of pricing?

87
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,769
I've been going to garage
sales my whole life.

88
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:49,043
Can you believe I got these
pantyhose for a nickel?

89
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:54,114
All right, Amy's in charge
of pricing and being 75.

90
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:57,344
Hey, Penny, can you
give me a hand with this?

91
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,449
Sure.

92
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,049
Aw, we had one of
these growing up.

93
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,520
I used to play
all the time.

94
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:03,287
Oh, yeah?
I love Ping-Pong.

95
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:05,517
Oh, I meant beer pong.

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,254
I had a table, too,

97
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,894
but I didn't have any friends,
so all I did was serve.

98
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,569
You know, you can leave one
side up and play against it.

99
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,476
And if I had a friend,
they might have told me that.

100
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:21,740
Excuse me.

101
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,907
Why is there a sticker on this?

102
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,715
It's my TARDIS
from<i> Doctor Who.</i>

103
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,748
I was planning on
moving it in the house.

104
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,021
I think you just answered
your own question.

105
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,989
Come on, one day,
this may double in value

106
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,662
and be worth half
what I paid for it.

107
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,294
Sweetie, we have a lot to do.

108
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:40,094
We don't need
to decide this right now.

109
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:43,068
Well, I guess as long as
you're keeping an open mind.

110
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,933
Of course.

111
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,142
♪ ♪

112
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,893
So... they're requesting

113
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:06,198
that the white boy play
the funky music, yes?

114
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,167
Yes.

115
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,305
And this music we're listening
to right now is funky as well?

116
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,480
Sure.

117
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,143
Let me ask you this.

118
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,614
Do you think

119
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:24,247
this song is the music
the white boy ultimately plays?

120
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,024
It could be.

121
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:31,590
So it's like the musical
equivalent of Russell's Paradox,

122
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,261
the question of whether
the set of all sets

123
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:37,490
that don't contain themselves
as members contains itself?

124
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:39,458
Exactly.
Well...

125
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,761
then I hate it.

126
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:42,065
Music should just be fun.

127
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,494
Making great time.

128
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:48,630
Gonna be there pretty early.

129
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,270
Will our hotel room
be ready?

130
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:51,636
I doubt it.

131
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,235
Aren't you worried
that sitting in the lobby

132
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,770
for a long period of time
might attract the attention

133
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:59,504
of the hotel detective?

134
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,135
If we do,

135
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:04,805
we'll just tell him
to "hit the bricks, see?"

136
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:09,184
Seems a little confrontational,
but all right.

137
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:13,049
You know,
we won't be very far

138
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,458
from Skywalker Ranch.

139
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,322
Oh, that's true.

140
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,226
It's not like
we can get in there.

141
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,258
Why not?

142
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,267
I-I don't think George Lucas
put his headquarters

143
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:25,333
in the middle of nowhere because
he wanted people dropping in.

144
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:29,604
Yoda's swamp was
in the middle of nowhere.

145
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,772
Tatooine was in the middle
of nowhere.

146
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,980
Hoth was in the middle
of nowhere.

147
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,949
That's code, Leonard.

148
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,150
He wants us
to drop in.

149
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:42,918
We do have time.

150
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,821
I mean, we could drive by
and just look at it.

151
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,955
Yes! Oh...

152
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,595
I'm so excited.

153
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,994
And I just can't hide it.

154
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,869
"I'm about to lose control,
and I think I like it."

155
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,807
What are you
talking about?

156
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,753
So when do you guys think
you're gonna move in?

157
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,690
We're still figuring how much
remodeling we want to do.

158
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,723
It's tricky finding
the right balance

159
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:13,827
between "tasteful modern"

160
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,690
and "Jewish mother
tchotchke crapfest."

161
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,066
Have you made a decision
about the TARDIS?

162
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,265
I think I can sell it if we call
it, "Big British Porta-Potty."

163
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,304
We're not selling
it-- it's mine.

164
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,936
You can't just decide.

165
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,775
How about I arm-wrestle you?

166
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,143
That's not fair.

167
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:37,047
It's like me challenging you
to a sexy pants contest.

168
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:39,743
You could play
Ping-Pong for it.

169
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:41,352
I would do that.

170
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:42,281
How is that fair?

171
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,586
You grew up
with a table.

172
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,058
Yes, but I mostly used it
as a battlefield

173
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,856
in an ongoing war between the
Transformers and the ThunderCats

174
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:51,456
for control of a bra
I had found in the woods.

175
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,602
Bernadette, for every episode
of<i> Doctor Who</i>

176
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:56,930
Leonard has made me sit through,

177
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:58,202
I will play on your behalf

178
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,234
and send that TARDIS
back to Gallifrey,

179
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,202
where I hate
that I know it belongs.

180
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:04,808
Yes, Penny
plays for me.

181
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,806
That's not fair--
she has upper body muscles.

182
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,981
Dude, three-time
Sanskriti School

183
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:14,916
for Well-Born Boys
badminton champion.

184
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:17,714
That's right-- okay,
Raj can play for me.

185
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,450
Ooh, you just chose champions.

186
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,417
It's like we're reenacting
the ancient German practice

187
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,321
- of trial by combat.
- Yeah, it's also like

188
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,690
when the Mountain fought the
Red Viper in<i> Game of Thrones.</i>

189
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,458
Leonard makes you
watch that, too?

190
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,994
No, no, I like that show.

191
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,826
It's got dragons
and people doing it.

192
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:33,128
So it's settled.

193
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,697
The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS
will be decided

194
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:38,232
by a<i> Game of Thrones</i> inspired
death-match on the battlefield

195
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:41,336
of ThunderCats
versus Transformers.

196
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,640
If you still have that bra,
I'll give you a nickel for it.

197
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,708
There it is.

198
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,683
It's just a gate.

199
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:59,681
On a road.

200
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,849
Wasn't even that
hard to find.

201
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,017
This is so amazing!

202
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,889
I know!

203
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,457
You want to
get a picture?

204
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,992
I want more than a picture.

205
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,256
I want to go in.

206
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,960
Well, so do I, but
they'll never let us.

207
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:18,432
Is that the attitude
that helped you get Penny?

208
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,303
No, but I don't have three years

209
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,638
to make that gate
feel sorry for me.

210
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:26,502
Uh, there's
a speaker box.

211
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:30,006
Drive up, push the button,
and let's see what happens.

212
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,477
Okay, yeah.

213
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,108
What do we
have to lose?

214
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,524
I'm a little nervous.

215
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:47,157
Well, get over it.

216
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,830
Confidence is key
in these situations.

217
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,695
Right.

218
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,370
You pushed it--
are you out of your mind?!

219
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:57,875
May I help you?

220
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,939
Um...

221
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,148
Uh, uh... we don't
have an appointment,

222
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,381
and-and we don't
belong here,

223
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,685
but we-we're, like,
crazy-big fans.

224
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,252
I mean...

225
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,387
"crazy for<i> Star</i>
<i>Wars"</i> crazy,

226
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:11,354
not crazy like we have a
backpack full of duct tape,

227
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:12,753
although we do
have a backpack

228
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,952
that you really don't
want to look in.

229
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,098
You're blowing it.

230
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,762
We want to meet
George Lucas

231
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:23,296
and become his friends
and play with him!

232
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:26,998
Hello?

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,903
This speaker's not working,
just pull up.

234
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:35,543
And that's how it's done.

235
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,599
All right, we've defeated
the first challenge.

236
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:55,671
Now we must steel ourselves
to face the monster

237
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:57,935
who defends the gate.

238
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,503
We're trying to get past
a security guard,

239
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,374
not rescue Zelda.

240
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:06,579
I think what really needs to be
rescued is your sense of whimsy,

241
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:08,579
but one quest at a time.

242
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:12,250
So what's the plan?

243
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:14,546
Uh, I'm just gonna be honest
with the guy.

244
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,921
Honesty will never
get us in.

245
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,554
Well, what's
your plan?

246
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:21,924
All right, my plan is
predicated on the assumption

247
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:23,892
that they have
a nurse's office

248
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:26,764
and your willingness
to be lightly stabbed.

249
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,205
Who are you here to see?

250
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:37,774
Uh, I'm just gonna
tell you the truth.

251
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:40,310
Oh, you are killing me.

252
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,350
We don't have
an appointment.

253
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,350
We-we're just fans
of Mr. Lucas's work,

254
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:45,615
and we thought
we'd take a shot

255
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,654
and see if we could get in
and look around.

256
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,086
Sorry, guys, we get this a lot.

257
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,189
Can't let you in.

258
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:54,089
What if I told you
that I was the voice of Yoda?

259
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:59,295
A recording
session I must attend.

260
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:01,988
I'm sorry, don't
listen to him.

261
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,692
We're actually
physicists.

262
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:05,594
We're giving a lecture
at Berkeley later today.

263
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:07,594
We just... we had
some time to kill.

264
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,865
Hey, listen, you
seem like decent guys.

265
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,160
I can't let you in,

266
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:13,695
but I got some hats and T-shirts
I can give you.

267
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,566
Thank you so much.

268
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,134
See?

269
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,439
Maybe honesty is the best...

270
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:19,439
What are you doing?

271
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,102
Shedding the yoke
of my oppressors,

272
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,310
you blind,
sad little man.

273
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,478
Don't move!

274
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,510
Code A-A-23, A-A-23.

275
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,878
Copy.

276
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,013
I can see the ranch, Leonard!

277
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,580
Oh, it's rustic,
it's lovely.

278
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:36,419
I'd take a picture,
but people are chasing me.

279
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,282
I'm gonna make it...!

280
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:40,585
I'm gonna make it!

281
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,919
They have Tasers,
but they wouldn't dare use...

282
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,421
Come on, Raj.

283
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:53,125
You are the King Kong
of Ping-Pong.

284
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,899
You are the menace
of table tennis.

285
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,001
Put her away,
'cause I don't have a third one.

286
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:01,768
Yes!
Yes!

287
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,232
Rajesh eight, Penny four.

288
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,202
Sorry,
he's really good.

289
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,335
Hey, Raj.

290
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:10,504
if Howard can't
keep the TARDIS,

291
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,206
how great would it
look at your place?

292
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,237
What?

293
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,676
Yeah, what?

294
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,104
I don't know much
about<i> Doctor Who,</i>

295
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,004
but if, um, you were to put this

296
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,037
right outside your front door
and open up the back,

297
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,066
it would be like
your entire apartment was

298
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,833
the inside of the TARDIS,

299
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,569
which is pretty cool

300
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,901
'cause on the show,
the inside of the TARDIS

301
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:34,835
is bigger than the outside.

302
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:38,759
But then again, I don't know
much about<i> Doctor Who.</i>

303
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,597
Don't listen to her.

304
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,332
You and I go way back--
we're like brothers.

305
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:46,835
We are. We are.

306
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:50,066
Oh, no!

307
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:51,465
What a terrible serve!

308
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,007
Sorry, brother.

309
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,372
Eight-five.
This is ridiculous.

310
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:57,634
I want a new champion.

311
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,399
Amy, were you serious
about being able to serve?

312
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,733
Uh, it-it's been
a long time.

313
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,700
I don't know.

314
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,637
I'm probably
pretty rusty.

315
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,444
Wow.

316
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,476
She's my champion!

317
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,515
Well, if you can switch
champions, so can I.

318
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:15,916
I want Raj.
Hey.

319
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,780
Oh, come on, like
you even care.

320
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:19,117
I care!

321
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,957
Oh, wait, no, I don't.
Good luck, Raj.

322
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:25,536
You know, I thought our
friendship meant more to you.

323
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:27,925
So did I.

324
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,936
Do you think
they're gonna call the police?

325
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,865
I don't know.

326
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:42,168
Maybe they'll call Imperial
Officers to take us

327
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,440
to a holding cell
on the Death Star.

328
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:50,544
Oh, I think that's below the pay
grade of an Imperial Officer.

329
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,911
Stormtroopers are really
the ones who...

330
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:53,543
Oh, shut up.

331
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,350
He's right.

332
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:58,454
Uh, Stormtroopers actually
combine both the function

333
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:00,620
of infantry and military police.

334
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,817
Uh-huh, I'm normally
very nice,

335
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,552
but you shut up, too.

336
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,789
So...

337
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,596
what are you in for?

338
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:21,266
Honestly, I just wanted to meet
Mr. Lucas and say thank you.

339
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,762
You know, growing up, the movies
had such an impact on my life.

340
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:27,067
I never really fit in anywhere.

341
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,107
Till I discovered
the worlds he created

342
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:31,905
and finally found a place
where I belong.

343
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,207
But why are you here?

344
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,839
Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence,

345
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,510
and they caught me
in the sculpture gallery

346
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:41,276
making out
with a Chewbacca statue.

347
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:48,875
Excuse me.

348
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:59,050
Leonard,

349
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:01,321
they have a
sculpture gallery.

350
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,687
All right, I talked
to my supervisor,

351
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:08,895
and we're gonna let you go
with a warning.

352
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:10,696
But if you ever
come back,

353
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,360
we will call the police
and press charges.

354
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,360
We understand.

355
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:14,328
Thank you so much.

356
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,935
Uh, what about me?

357
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:17,366
No, you're not going
anywhere, kissy face.

358
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:18,934
Let's go.

359
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,037
I have to take your picture
to post at the guard gate.

360
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,005
Uh, one question

361
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,500
about that picture.

362
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,307
Can it be with
George Lucas?

363
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,107
Ooh, grumpy you are.

364
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:38,082
Okay, this is the match
that decides it all.

365
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,355
First to 11 wins.

366
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:42,186
Serve switches
every five points.

367
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:43,723
And just so you know,
when this started,

368
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:46,492
I was going to put the TARDIS in
a discreet corner of the house,

369
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:48,028
but I've since turned
mean, and now it's going

370
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,531
right in the middle
of the living room

371
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,298
on a rotating platform with
a sign that says "suck it."

372
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,466
Game on.

373
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,169
Except...

374
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,537
Raj is gonna win.

375
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,832
Isn't that right, Raj?

376
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:02,302
Uh, yeah, I mean,
her serve was pretty good.

377
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,836
Come on, get
in her head.

378
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,002
Be intimidating.

379
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:07,034
Okay, uh...

380
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:08,201
I'm gonna own you, bitch!

381
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,872
Whoa!
Hey!

382
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,376
That's not nice.

383
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,280
Let's just play.

384
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:19,584
One-zero.

385
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:21,152
Two.

386
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:22,817
Three.

387
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,687
Four.

388
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,487
Five-nothing.

389
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:27,887
Wait,

390
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,223
did you play badminton

391
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:31,863
or sad-minton?

392
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,862
Don't listen to him--
all she's got is a serve.

393
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:37,334
Now, grab a fresh tampon
and put her away.

394
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:38,334
Wha...?

395
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:39,832
A-And that's not offensive?

396
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:40,874
Where's the line?

397
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,010
It's in your purse. Play.

398
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:46,916
One-five.

399
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,884
Two-five.

400
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:51,019
Three-five.

401
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:52,682
Four-five.

402
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,881
Five-five!

403
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,154
Six.

404
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,458
Seven.

405
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,322
Eight. Nine.

406
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:04,394
Ten-five!

407
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,836
Six.

408
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:11,741
Seven.

409
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,445
Eight.

410
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:15,412
Nine.

411
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:18,443
Ten-ten!

412
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:23,377
Well, that was
an exciting 40 seconds.

413
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:26,784
It was, and now
the serve is back to you,

414
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,552
and the game is over.

415
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,792
You know, Amy,
I, uh...

416
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,760
can't help but wonder
how Sheldon would react

417
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,960
if the TARDIS was
at your place.

418
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,961
Don't listen to her,
just hit the ball.

419
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:42,330
Keep talking.

420
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:48,906
If this doesn't get him
into your bedroom,

421
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:50,578
nothing will.

422
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,450
Are you still
mad at me?

423
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:02,125
Yes, we missed our lecture,
we were almost arrested,

424
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:04,126
and you got me locked
in a room with a man

425
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:08,630
who forced his tongue down the
throat of a stuffed Wookiee.

426
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:11,997
Boy, some people are just
glass-half-empty.

427
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,534
The glass is
empty, Sheldon.

428
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:15,774
It's completely empty.

429
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,773
If you gave that glass to a
man who was dying of thirst,

430
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,805
he would be dead,
do you know why?

431
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,909
Before I answer,
was he a smoker?

432
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,683
I think you're looking
at this all wrong.

433
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,282
Fine, then tell me
how I should be looking at it.

434
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:36,586
Well, not only did we go to
Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

435
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,889
No one we know
can say that.

436
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:42,226
And for all the times
you find me irritating,

437
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:45,500
today you got to watch
someone shoot me with a Taser.

438
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:51,475
That part was pretty good.

439
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:53,170
See?

440
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:56,145
You did flop around a lot.

441
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:58,411
I'll take your word for it.

442
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,517
I was too busy
trying not to defecate.

443
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,686
You know, when they were
escorting us

444
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,925
to the detaining room,
I looked through a door,

445
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,893
and I'm pretty sure
I saw a display case

446
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,828
with the Ark
of the Covenant.

447
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,163
That's amazing.
I know.

448
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:18,435
And I saw Jabba the Hutt
riding by on a motorcycle.

449
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:20,835
Although that was
right after the Tasing,

450
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,908
so who can
say for sure?

451
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:27,170
I-I guess this could count
as an adventure.

452
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,442
It was.

453
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,073
And even though we're
not allowed back there,

454
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:33,378
they can never take
today away from us.

455
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,112
Unlike my sense
of smell,

456
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:38,679
which hasn't returned
since the Tasing.

457
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,853
No, I got nothing.

458
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:55,340
Amy, the Daleks
are right on my tail!

459
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,677
Quick, we need to reset
the time circuits.

460
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,846
Oh, no, I left my sonic
screwdriver behind.

461
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,138
Really should have
thought this through.
