1
00:00:02,673 --> 00:00:05,907
This is an easy one.
You love this guy.

2
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:07,676
Me.

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:12,214
Come on, he's an
underappreciated genius.

4
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:14,683
Still think it's me.

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:16,284
It's not you.

6
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:18,987
Now think, there's
a car named after him.

7
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,222
Of course there is.

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,324
The Mini Cooper,
'cause it's me.

9
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,428
How about this:

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,563
he's a poor man's
Sheldon Cooper.

11
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,198
Oh, Tesla.

12
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,067
- Hi.
- Hey! - Hello.

13
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:33,602
How'd it go?
Oh, not fun.

14
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:36,771
The doctor shoved a camera
up into my sinuses.

15
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,907
Yeah, I watched. It was like
the scary boat tunnel

16
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,009
in<i> Willy Wonka.</i>

17
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:44,379
Did they figure out what's wrong?
Yeah.

18
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,347
It's a deviated septum.

19
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:46,481
The surgery
to correct it is simple.

20
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,682
He's gonna do it next week.

21
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:49,618
Why would you have surgery?

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,319
Because I can't breathe.

23
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,822
I snore, I get sinus
infections...

24
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:56,324
Yeah, back off,
he's all mine.

25
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:58,593
But you don't have
a life-threatening condition.

26
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:00,495
Why would you
take the risk of surgery?

27
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,297
Sheldon, it's a routine
procedure.

28
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,399
I've heard you complain
about his snoring.

29
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,601
We... Yes, for the first
five or six years,

30
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:08,503
but I've gotten used to it.

31
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,505
It helps me sleep.

32
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:13,175
He's like my mucus-powered
white noise machine.

33
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,344
Sheldon, I'm gonna get
the surgery, it's no big deal.

34
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,445
End of story.

35
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:18,994
Very well.
I'm done talking about it.

36
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:19,811
Thank you.

37
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,450
I believe it was
your turn in the game.

38
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,784
Okay.

39
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:25,620
Let's see...

00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:28,390
Oh, this person is most famous

41
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:29,558
for never having gotten

42
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,494
his nose mutilated
with elective surgery

43
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:34,996
and never living the rest
of his life in the shadows

44
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:36,831
as a hideous, disfigured freak.

45
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:40,435
I think you could
give a better clue.

46
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:41,536
I don't.

47
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:44,739
I'm not even sure if
that's a person or a typo.

58
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:31,653
Okay, why?

59
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,755
I'm listening to you snore.

60
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:36,958
I'm wondering how
I'll ever sleep without it.

61
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,694
If it helps you sleep,

62
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:41,630
then why are you sitting here
staring at me

63
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,999
like the albino boogeyman?

64
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,135
Really, Leonard-- insults?

65
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,870
After I spent two hours
in your closet,

66
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:50,305
waiting for you to fall asleep?

67
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:54,709
What's your problem?

68
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:58,780
If the surgery is successful,
the snoring is gone.

69
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,316
And if you die during surgery...

70
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:04,686
...the snoring is gone.

71
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:09,091
It sounds like either way,
I finally get some rest.

72
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,026
I have to be honest
with you Leonard,

73
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,694
I'm truly worried.

74
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:15,597
I-I told you, there's
nothing to worry about.

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,165
Well, I've been
doing some research

76
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,701
and I've learned that
one in 700,000 people

77
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:22,003
die from general anesthesia.

78
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:24,706
Buddy, w... Do you realize that
that also means

79
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,677
699,999 people don't die?

80
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:32,414
I suppose that's true.

81
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,618
You're such a glass
half-full kind of guy.

82
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,989
I'm going to miss that.

83
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:46,828
Oh, so, my, uh, parents'
40th anniversary's coming up

84
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,030
and I can't think
of a thing to get them.

85
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,465
Damn, can you imagine

86
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:54,236
being married to someone
for 40 years?

87
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,040
Not anymore.

88
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,547
Anyway, any ideas on a gift?

89
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,682
Well, what are some
of the things they like?

90
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:10,085
They used to like
going to the Mumbai Symphony,

91
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,387
but last year my mom thought
they were phoning it in.

92
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,622
Then my dad said
based on their

93
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:16,858
love life, she should know
about phoning it in.

94
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:18,795
He said that to her?

95
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:20,363
Well, they weren't
speaking at the time,

96
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:22,197
so he had a servant
say it to her.

97
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,333
Oh, maybe I could
make a gift for them.

98
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,737
I know how much you guys love
the coasters I made for you.

99
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,708
They're yours in the divorce.

100
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:39,814
Hey. What're you working on?

101
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:41,716
Remember when I said
if you went through

102
00:04:41,718 --> 00:04:45,320
with your surgery, there was a
one-in-700,000 chance of dying?

103
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,522
Yeah...?

104
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:49,224
Well, I've been
crunching the numbers,

105
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:52,561
and so far, I've gotten
your probability of death

106
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:54,229
all the way to a
sphincter-tightening

107
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:56,798
one in 300.

108
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:59,701
Great timing.

109
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:02,571
My “check sphincter”
light just went on.

110
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:05,373
Leonard, what if you have
an allergic reaction

111
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,742
to the surgeon's latex gloves?
I'm not

112
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:09,010
allergic to latex.

113
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:10,645
Well, then why don't you
wear the rubber gloves

114
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:12,280
I bought for you
to do the dishes?

115
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:15,784
For the same reason I don't
wear the apron or the hair net.

116
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:18,720
Fine. What about epilepsy?

117
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:20,488
I don't have epilepsy, either.

118
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,924
You don't,
but the surgeon might, hmm?

119
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:26,428
And your carotid artery is just
one shaky scalpel away

120
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,965
from becoming the dancing
fountain at Disneyland.

121
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:33,335
Sheldon, do you realize that
driving is riskier than surgery?

122
00:05:33,337 --> 00:05:36,571
I do. I have the drive
to the hospital right here.

123
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:37,906
That is if
you make it

124
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:40,742
to the car without
falling down the stairs.

125
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:43,778
And don't expect me to carry
you, I do that enough in life.

126
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,715
Buddy, I-I get that
you're worried about me

127
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:49,618
and I-I appreciate that,
but I'm not going to die.

128
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,253
You don't know that.
Well...

129
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:54,756
I do know that it won't
be from an asteroid strike.

130
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:57,559
You know who else said that?

131
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,561
Every cocky T. Rex
currently swimming around

132
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:01,630
in the gas tank of your car.

133
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,266
I-If there was
an asteroid strike,

134
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:05,467
wouldn't you die, too?

135
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,202
I don't know--
I'm smart and scrappy,

136
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:09,537
I think I'd find a way.

137
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,341
Tell you what--
the surgery's not for a week,

138
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:14,576
I'll think about it.

139
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:17,379
Thank you. And while
you're thinking about it,

140
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,481
if you have the surgery
in Nicaragua during

141
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:21,082
monsoon season,
I can practically

142
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,484
guarantee your death.

143
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,458
Yes. Okay.

144
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,093
I-I understand.

145
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,428
Of course, yes.

146
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,463
I'll call you tomorrow.

147
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,265
Bye.

148
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:40,502
So I found this fencing school
in Burbank

149
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,904
that has a Jedi class.

150
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,608
And if you're cool
being the only adults there,

151
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,877
they said they are.

152
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:51,479
Dude, my parents just split up.

153
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:54,349
What?!
Uh, that was my dad on the phone.

154
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,284
He moved out.

155
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,187
Oh, my God, I... I'm sorry.

156
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,090
I mean, if you're not up to it,
we don't have to go out,

157
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,059
we can just hang here.
No,

158
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:06,227
it's fine.
It's not that big a deal.

159
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,530
As long as they're happy,
I'm happy.

160
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,765
And when I get to see them
for the holidays,

161
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,834
I'll get to celebrate
Diwali twice--

162
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,436
one at each house.

163
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,940
That's double the Diwali.

164
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,176
You sure you're okay?

165
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:22,277
I'm okay.

166
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,511
You don't look okay.

167
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:26,014
How can I be okay?
I come from a broken home.

168
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:31,086
The doctor said I should be
out of surgery by 10:00.

169
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,554
Okay.

170
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:36,324
And Sheldon really believes
we're at a public swimming pool?

171
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,695
He was so busy figuring out
how many parts per million

172
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,498
of urine we'd be floating around
in, he didn't even question it.

173
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:48,069
18 parts per million.

174
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,406
And he's still doing it.

175
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:54,109
Don't worry about that.
I'm happy to take you to work.

176
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,543
Well, thank you.

177
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:58,980
And Leonard never lets me have
French toast sticks in the car.

178
00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:01,082
I can't have syrupy fingers,

179
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:04,052
but he can do the backstroke
in a toilet bowl.

180
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:07,789
It's nice they're
getting exercise.

181
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,059
Although now that
I think about it,

182
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,228
Leonard would never
go swimming in public

183
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,830
without his swim shirt.

184
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:17,999
I'm sure he brought it.

185
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,068
No, but last year,
at Magic Mountain,

186
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,736
he got such a bad sunburn,

187
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:24,506
we had to cut him out of it.

188
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,742
He probably got a new one.
Finish your breakfast.

189
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,644
Look, there's an entire
section of my dashboard

190
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:31,446
that doesn't have
any syrup on it.

191
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:35,250
You're acting odd. Why?

192
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:38,386
I'm odd all the time,
everyone knows that.

193
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:39,854
Just last night,

194
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:42,991
I tried to see how many fava
beans I could fit in my mouth.

195
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,660
Tell me the truth.

196
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:48,263
28.
Come on.

197
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:50,999
Fifty-six.

198
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:52,233
Amy!

199
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:54,702
What's going on?

200
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,638
All right.

201
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,806
Don't get upset, but...

202
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:01,109
an earlier appointment
opened up for Leonard

203
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:04,779
and he's getting
the surgery right now.

204
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,618
I see.

205
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,125
Take me to Leonard.

206
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,227
Just go to work,
he'll be fine.

207
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:22,063
Amy, he's my best friend,
and if you don't take me,

208
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:23,631
I'm going there anyway.

209
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,734
Fine.

210
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:29,337
It's sweet that you
care about him so much.

211
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,572
I do.

212
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:32,240
And I wouldn't
be able to forgive myself,

213
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:34,542
if something happened to him
and I wasn't at his bedside

214
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,811
to say, “I told you so.”

215
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:54,769
Hello.

216
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,537
We had a really nice swim.

217
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:57,805
Oh, stop it.

218
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:01,242
I assume this medical
center's already treated

219
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:04,278
the burns on your bottom
from the recent pants fire.

220
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,715
'Cause I'm a liar, liar?

221
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,817
That's for the fire marshal
to determine.

222
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:12,853
You had to tell him?

223
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,388
He wore me down.

224
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,723
And I was distracted.

225
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:18,726
He has on
extra baby powder today.

226
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:20,194
Is he okay?

227
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:22,196
He's still in surgery.

228
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,399
Very well.

229
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,835
He's gonna be all right.

230
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,004
That is sticky.

231
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,507
Come on,
let's talk about something

232
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,675
other than the surgery.

233
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,277
That's a good idea.

234
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,648
Penny, did you and Leonard ever
discuss funeral arrangements?

235
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:44,619
I think she meant
something a little happier.

236
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:49,056
I suppose we could try
to make it a celebration,

237
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:51,392
but he died so young.

238
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,731
Knock, knock.
Hi.

239
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,732
Hey.
What brings you by?

240
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh...

241
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:02,236
muffin much.

242
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,172
Told you-- not funny.

243
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,174
He's just not laughing

244
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:11,746
because he's feeling...
<i>blue</i> berry.

245
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:16,317
Tough crowd.

246
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,852
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:19,587
This is very sweet. Thanks.

248
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:20,721
So, how you doing?

249
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,956
Better. I guess

250
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,291
the news just hit me
a lot harder than I expected.

251
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:25,660
Well, of course.

252
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:28,095
I would be devastated
if my parents split up.

253
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:31,532
Why? Your father barely
speaks to your mother.

254
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:32,967
Well, at least
he stuck around,

255
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,802
not like your dad,
who just took off.

256
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:38,105
As you can see, we're
here to cheer you up.

257
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,808
Sorry, Raj.

258
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,510
Do you have any sense of
what happened with your folks?

259
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:46,480
I think, over time, they started
to resent each other,

260
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,982
and instead of talking
about the things

261
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:49,950
that bothered them,
they kept it bottled up,

262
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,952
and the hate just grew.

263
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:54,789
It's a shame they spent
all that time unhappy.

264
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,691
But sometimes,

265
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:59,326
there's<i> muffin</i>
you can do about it.

266
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,497
You get it, right?

267
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:09,437
Oh, it's nice
you got him that.

268
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,205
Oh, this isn't
for Leonard, no.

269
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:13,808
Amy bought it for me.

270
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:18,946
Stubbed his toe on the
revolving door on the way in.

271
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,716
You know those confounded
things make me dizzy.

272
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:24,885
Who told you
to keep going around?

273
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:26,854
There was a large
plant in the lobby.

274
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:28,823
It kept looking
like the outside.

275
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,492
Okay, listen,
when Leonard comes out,

276
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,060
he is not gonna feel great,

277
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:35,229
so, please don't
give him a hard time.

278
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,430
Penny has a good point.

279
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:38,466
This is like the man
in the supermarket

280
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,134
with the goiter on his neck.

281
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:43,037
Whatever you're thinking,
just keep it to yourself.

282
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,507
It was like a grapefruit.

283
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:48,342
And I'm sure he knew that

284
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:51,345
before you held
a grapefruit up next to it.

285
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,114
Well, I'm not
making any promises.

286
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:56,083
Not only did Leonard take what
I feel is an unnecessary risk,

287
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:57,318
he deceived me.

288
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,819
Okay, the reason
he deceived you is

289
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,488
you were being
a pain in the ass.

290
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,723
The reason I was being
a pain in the B is

291
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:04,959
because I was worried about
him, and no one else was.

292
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:06,727
Really? You won't
even say “A”?

293
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:08,729
You bet your
sweet B I won't.

294
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,498
Obviously, I care
about Leonard.

295
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,033
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life with him.

296
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,735
And I'm not?

297
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:19,039
It's an earthquake.

298
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,274
I knew it.

299
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:21,976
Sheldon, it was
just a little tremor.

300
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:24,879
A little tremor that turns
routine sinus surgery

301
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,815
into a frontal
lobotomy.

302
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,720
Oh, I don't care
for this at all.

303
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:35,422
Oh, I need to
see he's okay.

304
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:37,224
Sheldon, you can't
go back there.

305
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:39,026
Try and stop me!

306
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,963
Are you okay?

307
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:45,099
Why didn't you stop me?!

308
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,470
Can I tell you
something?

309
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,806
This whole thing
with Raj's parents

310
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:54,341
just got me
a little worried about us.

311
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,944
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

312
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:57,978
And Raj's parents

313
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,948
probably split up
because of Raj.

314
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,616
What?!

315
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,319
They always say the children
aren't to blame, but...

316
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:08,222
Come on.

317
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,626
I'm not joking, Howie.

318
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,261
You heard what he said
about his parents.

319
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:16,463
It was the little things
they kept bottled up.

320
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:18,933
I don't want that
to happen to us.

321
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:21,068
How can I convince you it won't?

322
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,672
Well, is there anything about me
you're keeping inside?

323
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,574
I'm not answering that.

324
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,643
It's a trap.

325
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,113
So there<i> are</i> things
you don't like.

326
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:36,116
And here I am in the trap.

327
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,520
You just keep talking.

328
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,022
I'm gonna chew my leg off.

329
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:44,225
Just tell me one thing
that bothers you,

330
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:45,793
and I promise I won't get mad.

331
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:48,963
Okay. The truth is...

332
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:51,098
sometimes... you're too...

333
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
beautiful.

334
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,702
Oh.

335
00:14:54,704 --> 00:14:57,137
Howie, be serious.

336
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,106
Okay, okay.

337
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,375
I really don't like

338
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:03,611
how your wings poke me
when we sleep

339
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:06,447
'cause you're an angel.

340
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:10,117
Okay, fine,
maybe it was a bad idea.

341
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,853
I just don't think the secret
to a happy marriage

342
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,389
is going out of our way
to criticize each other.

343
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:18,692
Although, there are ways
to improve our communication.

344
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:21,629
One thing I learned when
I was in couples therapy was...

345
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:22,863
Who were you

346
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,031
in couples therapy with?

347
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,200
Not important.

348
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:28,435
Was it your mom?

349
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,037
Not important.

350
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,573
It was your mom.

351
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:35,809
Anyway, the therapist had us
tell each other

352
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,479
what we loved about one another.

353
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,214
Oh, that's so sweet!

354
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:41,882
I want to do that.

355
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,217
All right.

356
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,152
Okay, um...

357
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:48,155
I love that you make me laugh.

358
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,890
Thank you.

359
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:54,728
And I love that you're strong
and independent.

360
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,798
And yet, I still love
when you hold a door for me.

361
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,702
I love that I'm kind of a slob
around here, and...

362
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:03,938
you're okay with that.

363
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:08,943
Uh-huh.

364
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:13,147
And I love that I work
and do all the cleaning,

365
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:15,516
and you're okay with that.

366
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:17,985
See, I am.

367
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:20,054
Isn't this great?

368
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,425
Come on, smile.

369
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:26,393
This is gonna be
my Christmas card.

370
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,668
You know this is
all your fault.

371
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,172
How is it my fault?

372
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:40,107
I told you not to
get the surgery.

373
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:43,544
Okay, first of all,
the surgery was a success,

374
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:45,980
and secondly,
I didn't even want you there.

375
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:49,683
Wow. I don't know
which hurts worse--

376
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,852
my nose or my heart.

377
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:54,355
Well, I'm done
speaking to you.

378
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:55,489
Don't be like that.

379
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,491
You two need to
talk this out.

380
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,827
Yeah, 'cause
you sound really funny.

381
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,898
Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about the surgery,

382
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,934
but you were worried
about nothing.

383
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:09,169
Oh, you're hardly
out of the woods, no.

384
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:12,006
You still run the risk of
infection, a blood clot,

385
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,375
the possibility that
an inattentive surgeon

386
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:17,311
let a barn spider
lay eggs in your nose.

387
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:21,949
The minute you sneeze web,
I'm moving out.

388
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:24,451
I never thought
I'd say these words,

389
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:26,653
but come on, nose spider!

390
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:29,289
Who are you kidding?

391
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,491
You were so panicked

392
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,226
Leonard was gonna die,
you'll never leave him.

393
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:34,261
Sheldon will move out
eventually.

394
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,730
Yeah, once he figures out
how to work a door.

395
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,769
I was not panicked, and I am
not overly attached to Leonard.

396
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,937
You were so worried
that you smashed your face

397
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,105
trying to check on me.

398
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,573
You<i> love</i> me.

399
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,076
Yeah. Tell me

400
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,577
those aren't the
words of a man

401
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,613
with a spider eating its
way through his brain.

402
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:55,416
Amy, you're a neuroscientist.

403
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:58,085
Crack his skull open,
spray some Raid in there.

404
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:03,023
I love that you take pride
in your looks,

405
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:04,024
even when I have

406
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:05,325
to pee in the morning,

407
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:08,128
and you're in there
spending an hour on your hair.

408
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,566
I love that you're too good
to pee in the kitchen sink.

409
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:15,169
I love
that you have the confidence

410
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:19,206
to speak, even without giving it
an ounce of thought.

411
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:22,810
And I love how your hair
is always on the soap.

412
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,379
It's like washing myself
with a hamster.

413
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,917
Hey, guys.
Sorry I am so late.

414
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,953
I was on the phone
with my mother.

415
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:33,987
Oh, how is she?

416
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,122
Pretty good.

417
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,157
She bought the book
<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>

418
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,494
and used it to set my father's
Mercedes on fire.

419
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,599
So, what's up with you guys?

420
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:48,469
We're just saying all the things
we love about each other.

421
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:51,405
Oh, like you and I
did at couples therapy.

422
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:05,214
Ooh, what'd you get?

423
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,449
Oh, I ordered it
before your surgery.

424
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:11,086
It's the urn I was going
to put you in.

425
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:13,422
Okay, that's morbid.

426
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:14,690
Send it back.

427
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:19,161
I can't send it back--
I had it engraved.

428
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:22,765
“Here lie the ashes
of Leonard Hofstadter.

429
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:27,202
He thought he was right,
but his roommate knew better."

430
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:30,506
That's funny.

431
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,508
Boy, I'm gonna miss
these painkillers.

432
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,811
Hey, why did you get two?

433
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:38,814
"I'm with stupid."
Oh, that one's mine.
