1
00:00:02,106 --> 00:00:05,574
Oh, hey, we ran into your
mom at Benihana last night.

2
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:07,275
Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

3
00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:09,177
Every time they flip
a shrimp in the air,

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,813
she practically leaps out
of her seat to catch it.

5
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:15,083
That's why I don't take her
to SeaWorld.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,619
I know you-you don't
want to hear it,

7
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:18,920
but she was there with Stuart.

8
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:20,088
That's fine.

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,323
I don't care.

10
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,425
It doesn't bug you when
they go out on dates?

11
00:00:23,427 --> 00:00:24,693
They're not dating.

12
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:27,529
They're just two friends
who went out to dinner.

13
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,498
And then went back
to the home they share

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,565
where they probably fell asleep

15
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,134
in the matching pajamas
she got them

16
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:35,070
because they both
just love penguins.

17
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:39,040
Hey, lots of people
wear matching pajamas

18
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,008
who aren't dating.

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,078
Like who?
Like you and your dog.

20
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:47,282
Don't rule out the dating.

21
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:49,918
Fine, it bothers me.

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,787
You happy?

23
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,388
You think you've got problems.

24
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,325
The gibbon is the only member
of the ape family not classified

25
00:00:57,327 --> 00:01:00,128
as a great ape.

26
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,030
How is this helpful?

27
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:04,566
All the non-human apes
are classified

28
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:06,201
as great apes except one.

29
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:09,437
That means taxonomists created
the entire category

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,440
of lesser ape just
to single out the poor gibbon

31
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:15,143
as the weird kid
on the playground.

32
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:19,314
Now there's a hairy little
fellow with a genuine beef.

33
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:22,284
But the gibbon doesn't know
what it's categorized as.

34
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:23,919
It doesn't even know
it's called a gibbon.

35
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:25,887
True.

36
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,490
Sorry, kid, you've got it
worse than a gibbon.

47
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,919
Hi.

48
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,853
Hey.

49
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,121
We brought snacks
for movie night.

50
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,422
Oh, great.

51
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,358
I don't suppose you also brought
napkins, clean bowls,

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,226
utensils and a roll
of toilet paper.

53
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,228
Right here.

54
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,262
Ah!

55
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,664
You guys are the best.

56
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,732
What's with the clothes?

57
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,700
Well, with all the new stuff
I bought for work,

58
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,369
I needed to make room
in my closet.

59
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,970
I meant why are they folded?

60
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,239
But whatever.

61
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,775
Ooh, what's this?

62
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,678
That, believe it or not,
is my prom dress.

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,980
Wow, you still have it?

64
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,482
I just assumed
it was balled up

65
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,085
in the corner
of a barn somewhere.

66
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,656
What kind of teenager
did you think I was?

67
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,759
Slutty.
Easy.

68
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,963
The word is "popular."

69
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,966
How was your prom?
Did you go?

70
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,501
No, but I was
on clean-up crew.

71
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,169
Aw, that's sad.

72
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,804
No, it was okay.

73
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,340
The DJ let me dance
one slow song with my mop

74
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,742
before he shut down.

75
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,045
Whenever I see
a bucket of dirty water,

76
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,748
I still hear "Lady in Red."

77
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,652
My prom was pretty
terrible, too.

78
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,953
I was so excited
about my date,

79
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,722
but it turned out
he only asked me

80
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,790
'cause he liked my friend.

81
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,858
He spent the whole night
talking about her.

82
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,261
Okay, we get it, you had
a friend<i> and</i> a date.

83
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,063
Stop bragging.

84
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,631
Doesn't matter.

85
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,698
Prom is silly anyways.

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,367
Easy for you to say;
you probably went

87
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,802
with the captain
of the football team.

88
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,937
No.

89
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,605
I just made out
with him a little

90
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,474
while his date was puking.

91
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:32,811
My date would've had
to clean that up.

92
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,613
Ooh, I have an idea.

93
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,650
Maybe we can have,
like, a prom do-over.

94
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,585
Oh, that would be so much fun.

95
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,455
We could decorate the roof
and make the guys wear tuxedos.

96
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,356
Ooh, and get our hair done,
and slow-dance.

97
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,624
Okay, guys, trust me,

98
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,426
as someone who's been to,
like, seven proms,

99
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,895
it is never as good
as you want it to be.

100
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,598
You went to seven proms?

101
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,799
Yeah, let's see.

102
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,535
Uh, four "Under the Seas,"
two "Enchanted Evenings,"

103
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,770
and one "Night to Remember"

104
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,006
that... I cannot remember
for the life of me.

105
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,710
Hey.

106
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,412
Hey.
Hey, where's Bernadette?

107
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,048
She and Amy are out dress
shopping for their prom thing.

108
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,883
Oh, yeah,
I got that Evite.

109
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,618
Ever since I saw<i> Pretty in Pink,</i>

110
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,653
I've wanted to go
to an American prom.

111
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,323
But then I saw<i> Carrie,</i>

112
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,059
and I did not want to go
to an American prom.

113
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,360
But then I saw
<i>Never Been Kissed,</i>

114
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,928
and I'm back
on the prom bandwagon.

115
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,233
This prom thing's been
a real roller coaster.

116
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,835
Bernie's really excited.

117
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,071
I-I could tell because
her voice got so high,

118
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,707
the beagle next door
started howling.

119
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,710
Did you go to your prom?

120
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,612
No.

121
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,181
I had a date
with a proper education.

122
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,620
Instead of a tuxedo,
I dressed myself in good habits.

123
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,754
Instead of spiked punch,

124
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,290
I enjoyed the intoxicating
flavor of knowledge.

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,826
Instead of
dancing in a gym,

126
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,395
I shook my booty
to the seductive rhythms...

127
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,063
Okay, okay.

128
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,798
...of AP Calculus.

129
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,837
How come you're not shopping
with Amy and Bernadette?

130
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,640
Let me guess, you think
the whole idea is lame?

131
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,141
Well, who cares what I think?
What do you think?

132
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,143
Hmm, to be honest,

133
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,213
it's kind of a dream come true
to go to even a fake prom

134
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,814
with a woman
as beautiful as you.

135
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,484
Ugh, thanks a lot.

136
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,286
What?

137
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:25,423
Well, now I can't blow this
thing off without being a bitch.

138
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,825
That sounds like a "yes"!

139
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,065
Ooh, every single person
RSVP'd "yes."

140
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,833
This is so exciting!

141
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,169
Isn't this exciting?

142
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,674
Yep.

143
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,176
Look, even Stuart's
bringing a date.

144
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,244
I wonder who it is.

145
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,179
You know exactly
who it is.

146
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,514
He's gonna bring my mom.

147
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,049
Why did you even invite him?

148
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,785
Because he's our friend,
and you two need to get along.

149
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,220
And why can't
he take your mom?

150
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,989
You took her
to your prom.

151
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,893
I didn't "take" her;
she was a chaperone.

152
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,029
I saw a picture of you two
dancing together.

153
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,164
W-What was I gonna do?

154
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,665
They were playing our song!

155
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,669
I can't take
this anymore.

156
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,341
Hello.

157
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,609
Stuart, we have to talk.

158
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:22,313
This thing with you and my mom,
I-I hate it.

159
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,048
It's making me crazy.

160
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,584
You and I were
friends for years,

161
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,088
and now you're bringing my
mother to a party I'm going to?!

162
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,556
What the hell?!

163
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,125
I'm not bringing your mother,
I have a date.

164
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,661
Oh, so now you're cheating
on my mother?

165
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,499
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

166
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,967
Wha-What are you talking about?

167
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,970
There's nothing weird going on
with me and your mother.

168
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,840
Stewie,
your bath is getting cold!

169
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,210
I got to go, bye.

170
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,614
Penny?

171
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,849
Penny.

172
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,083
Penny.

173
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,451
Penny.

174
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,186
Penny.

175
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,522
You knocked more than usual.

176
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,723
Next time I might be in a rush,

177
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,292
it's good to have
a few in the bank.

178
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,093
Okay, what's up?

179
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,462
I'd like to discuss this party

180
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,997
that Amy and Bernadette
are throwing.

181
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,167
Since you and I are both
reluctant to go,

182
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,737
I think I've come up with a
perfect way for us to enjoy it.

183
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,139
Great, how?

184
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,274
We pretend we're aliens.

185
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,146
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

186
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,015
but I'm gonna say that you love
it and want to hear more.

187
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,585
Now,
in the beloved novel

188
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,487
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

189
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,991
an alien named Ford Prefect
pretended to be human

190
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,227
in order to blend in so that he
could write an entry about Earth

191
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,396
for<i> The Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

192
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,999
which is a travel book
within the actual book,

193
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,200
which is also called

194
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,003
<i>The Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy.</i>

195
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,839
Okay, just one question.

196
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,107
What?

197
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,311
My point is,
pretending to be an alien is

198
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,680
a valuable coping mechanism
I've used many times.

199
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,817
I did it the first time
I went to see you in a play.

200
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,987
You had no idea
Commander Umfrumf

201
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,223
of Ceti Alpha Three
was in the audience.

202
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,127
Oh, d-don't worry,
he gave you seven thumbs up.

203
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,930
Here's a question--

204
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,133
as an alien pretending to be
human, are you planning

205
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,938
to engage in any post-prom
mating rituals with Amy?

206
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,811
There are post-prom
mating rituals?

207
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,113
Not always.

208
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,281
Unless your date drives
a van with an air mattress,

209
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,150
then always.

210
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,188
Well, if it's part of the prom
experience, then I'm open to it.

211
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,924
You're kidding.

212
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,861
I may be an alien,
but I have urges.

213
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,899
If Amy wants to copulate
by firing her eggs into space,

214
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,634
well, then,
I will happily catch them

215
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,804
with the reproductive sac
on my upper flermin.

216
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,310
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

217
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,113
but I can see that
you're a little turned on.

218
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,886
You know, if you're not
gonna learn how to do this,

219
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,554
they make some
pretty good clip-ons.

220
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,957
Bruce Wayne doesn't
wear a clip-on.

221
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,328
Bruce Wayne doesn't make
his roommate tie it for him.

222
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,198
His name is Alfred,
and, yes, he does.

223
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,669
There, perfect.

224
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,937
What, are you sure?

225
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,573
It's my first prom,
I want to do it correctly.

226
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,809
I thought you were gonna
pretend to be an alien.

227
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,278
I was, but Penny didn't want to.

228
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,779
You didn't want to.

229
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,683
Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali
and Wolowitz didn't want to.

230
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,953
And even I knew it was weird
to hire somebody.

231
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,593
Was that a flask?

232
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,994
Yes.

233
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,030
I've decided to embrace
all of the traditions

234
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,933
associated with prom,
including spiking the punch.

235
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,370
You're gonna put alcohol
in the punch?

236
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,073
Oh, no, this is
pomegranate juice.

237
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,509
It's all the fun
of high school high jinks

238
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,779
with the cell-protecting zip
of antioxidants.

239
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,416
If you had ripped jeans
and a leather jacket,

240
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,252
you'd be like the toughest kid
on the Disney Channel.

241
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,990
So, anything else
planned for tonight?

242
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,658
Oh, everything.

243
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,394
Getting our picture taken,
slow-dancing,

244
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,730
being elected prom king.

245
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,801
Pointing out that
kings aren't elected.

246
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,706
It's gonna be off the hook.

247
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,275
And while you're at it,

248
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,644
I know that at this age
your hormones are raging,

249
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,613
but just because all
your friends are having sex

250
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:49,914
doesn't mean you have to.

251
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,784
Why would you say that?

252
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,087
You know, 'cause...

253
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,389
'cause a lot of people lose
their virginity on prom night.

254
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,391
Penny implied the same thing.

255
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,526
Is this true?

256
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,461
Just relax, it's a joke.

257
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,297
You don't have
hormones.

258
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,733
Wow, you look amazing.

259
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:24,436
Thank you, so do you.

260
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,700
Sheldon,
you look so handsome.

261
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,969
Thank you.

262
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,206
Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

263
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,409
That's got to put some starch
in the upper flermin.

264
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,445
What's that?

265
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,280
Oh, it's a scaly
genital organ

266
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,982
that grows between
his shoulder blades.

267
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,052
Try not to touch it
when you're dancing.

268
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,254
Excuse me.

269
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:48,555
Where are you going?

270
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,823
I can't do this.

271
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:51,325
And for your information,
Leonard,

272
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,193
the upper flermin doesn't grow
between my shoulder blades,

273
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,496
it grows out of the belly button
on my neck.

274
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:02,403
He's right, I was thinking
of the lower flermin.

275
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:08,308
Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart,
let him know we're close.

276
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,910
That's a neat tattoo.

277
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:13,313
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from
<i>Nightmare before Christmas.</i>

278
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,548
Aw, that movie's
so cute.

279
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,650
Do you like her because
you both have red hair?

280
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,420
Uh, a little, but more
that she's covered in scars

281
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:22,389
and can pull her own limbs off
and sew them back on.

282
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:27,194
I like Cinderella.

283
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,164
Did you know,
in the original book,

284
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,199
the sisters cut off
their toes with knives

285
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,101
in order to fit
in the glass slipper?

286
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:38,238
I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

287
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,675
Hey, here comes
Stuart and his date.

288
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,810
Oh, she's cute.

289
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:45,646
Oh, my God.

290
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:46,747
What?

291
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:47,681
That's Jeanie.

292
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,649
That's Jeanie?!

293
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:50,417
Who's Jeanie?
Don't say it.

294
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,586
That's Howard's cousin
that he had sex with.

295
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,891
She is my second cousin.

296
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,561
We were 15... I just said,
"Don't say it."

297
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,229
No, it's okay.

298
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,097
He told me that story
a long time ago.

299
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:05,165
Raj!

300
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,300
It was our first date,

301
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:07,401
there was an
awkward silence.

302
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:10,003
What was I
supposed to say?

303
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,978
Oh, it's beautiful.

304
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,247
Oh, the girls really
did a nice job.

305
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:21,348
Aw...

306
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,816
I know I wasn't
into this before,

307
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,352
but I'm so glad I get
to take you to your first prom.

308
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,354
What makes you think
I didn't go to my prom?

309
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:29,356
I went.
Well, who'd you go with?

310
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:33,327
I took a little lady
I like to call loneliness.

311
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,495
Aw...

312
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:35,863
Aw, it's all right.

313
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,164
We ended up having a threesome

314
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,132
with her friend humiliation,
so...

315
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:43,737
Well, if I would have been
there and saw you alone,

316
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,005
I would've asked you
to dance.

317
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,106
No, you wouldn't have.

318
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,207
Well, you don't
know that.

319
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,675
It was before
my growth spurt.

320
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:49,810
What, that already happened?

321
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,780
Very funny.

322
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,349
Well, you wouldn't
have asked me either.

323
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:56,583
I would have asked you.

324
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:58,619
In my head.

325
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,789
On the way home.

326
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,058
While I was having a good cry.

327
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,866
Sheldon, can I come in?

328
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,202
I don't think
that's a good idea.

329
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,436
Why not?

330
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,572
According to an online
message board,

331
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,741
I may be having a panic attack.

332
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,976
SoccerMom09 had
similar symptoms.

333
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:29,116
But to be fair, the twins were
a real handful that day.

334
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,517
You're making me worry.

335
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,652
What's going on?

336
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:35,556
What's going on is we're
about to go to a prom.

337
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:36,690
And there's
a great deal of pressure

338
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,659
on young couples
like us to engage in

339
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:42,996
what Mr. Bob Eubanks
called making whoopee.

340
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,631
What pressure?

341
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,433
All I said was
you look handsome.

342
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:49,169
Can you please
open the door?

343
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:51,004
It's not just that.

344
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:53,574
Leonard and Penny also
made comments about it.

345
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,208
And I'm not blind.

346
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,744
Even I looked twice
when I saw my posterior

347
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,780
in these tuxedo pants.

348
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:04,551
So, I met Jeanie
at your Aunt Gladys'.

349
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:06,053
She passed me
the Manischewitz,

350
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,754
I took one look
at this punim,

351
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,924
and I almost plotzed
on the kugel.

352
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:15,295
Is this what I sound like
when I talk about India?

353
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,200
So, my mother's okay
with this?

354
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,669
Why would your mother have
a problem with me and Stuart?

355
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,772
'Cause they have a weird,
inappropriate relationship.

356
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:29,209
Weirder than what you and I
did in my dad's Corolla?

357
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,680
This is so messed up.

358
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,783
I know, I'm having
the best time.

359
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:39,620
Why would you even come to this?

360
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,121
Didn't you know I'd be here?

361
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,090
It was a long
time ago, Howard.

362
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,258
And you're only second
cousins, who cares?

363
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,728
So, you knew and you
brought her anyway?

364
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,731
Oh, so she's good enough
for Howard, but not for me?!

365
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,698
Yeah.

366
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,699
Yeah, go have weird
relationships

367
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,800
with your own
mother and cousin.

368
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:54,802
This is his turf.

369
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,003
Yeah.

370
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:02,609
Well, I might not have
asked you to dance then,

371
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:05,078
but I will ask you now.
There's no music.

372
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,313
I don't care.

373
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,514
We'll make
our own music.

374
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,516
My God, who's the dork now?

375
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,893
Thank you for
wearing your flats.

376
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,095
Thank you for
wearing your heels.

377
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,033
Mmm.

378
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,367
Look at me.

379
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,604
Dancing with the prettiest
girl at the prom.

380
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,673
Want to take a picture
of us and send it

381
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,409
to your old friends
in the chess club?

382
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,311
I sent them a bikini shot
of you years ago.

383
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,917
This is nice.

384
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,886
I kind of wish
no one else was coming.

385
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:48,955
I know, me, too.

386
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:52,793
But it will be fun to have a
prom without all the drama.

387
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,264
Howie, get off of him!

388
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,701
Not until he stops humping
his way up my family tree!

389
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:05,305
Sheldon, this is silly.

390
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:06,773
I'm not missing another prom.

391
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,874
I'm going upstairs now.

392
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:09,409
Good-bye.

393
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,512
I really did think
you looked pretty.

394
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,347
You did?

395
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,683
Yes.

396
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,086
So much so that
I started to panic.

397
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,021
Well, you can relax.

398
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,524
Just because you think
I look pretty

399
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,960
doesn't mean we have
to spend the night together.

400
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,597
Were you hoping we would
because it's prom?

401
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,933
I'm always hoping.

402
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:38,505
But tonight I just wanted
to have a nice time with you.

403
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:41,675
And maybe dance
with someone who has arms.

404
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,412
Thank you for understanding.

405
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,748
Of course I understand.

406
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:52,285
Sheldon,

407
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,287
there's something else
I've been wanting to say,

408
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:56,256
but before I do,
I just...

409
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,993
I want you to know that you
don't have to say it back.

410
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,962
I know you're not ready,

411
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,497
and I don't want you to say it

412
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,098
just because
social convention dictates...

413
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,067
I love you, too.

414
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:12,572
You said it.

415
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,242
There's no denying
I have feelings for you

416
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,611
that can't be explained
in any other way.

417
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:22,649
I briefly considered
that I had a brain parasite.

418
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,788
But that seems even
more farfetched.

419
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,793
The only conclusion was love.

420
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,431
I know what's happening.

421
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:42,202
This is a panic attack.

422
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,805
SoccerMom09 says to lie down
with your feet elevated.

423
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:45,972
Okay.

424
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:47,808
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

425
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,409
Just because I love you
doesn't mean

426
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,344
girls are allowed in my room.

427
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:08,973
Okay.

428
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:10,675
Here we go...

429
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:13,244
Say "Cheese"!

430
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:18,149
Say "Cheese"!

431
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:23,287
Say "Cousin"!

432
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,625
Say...

433
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:29,628
Oh, sorry.

434
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,829
Hang on, sorry.

435
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,566
Hey, Debbie.

436
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:37,601
I... Yeah, yeah, I'm
here with Jeanie.

437
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,472
Okay, but we're just friends.

438
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,040
It's... Yeah. I got to go.
