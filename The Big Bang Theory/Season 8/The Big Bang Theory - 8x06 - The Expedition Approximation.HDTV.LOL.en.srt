2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,146
I like your suit!

3
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:06,699
Oh, thanks. Got a couple
new outfits for work.

4
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:08,651
How does it feel knowing
your fiancée's job

5
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:10,786
is to go out
and flirt with doctors,

6
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:13,489
looking like that,
while you sit here, you know...

7
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,541
looking like this?

8
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:18,160
She doesn't flirt with doctors.

9
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:20,296
Yeah. It's all
very professional.

10
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:22,415
You know when you bend over,
I can see down your shirt?

11
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,216
Okay, good.

12
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:26,802
Speaking of new careers,
how are things going

13
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:28,754
with dark matter,
Sheldon?

14
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:31,424
Oh, yeah, I'd have to say
it's the most exiting time

15
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:33,259
in the history of the field.
Oh.

16
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:34,261
What's going on?

17
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:36,812
I started doing it.

18
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:38,014
You know, the government funded

19
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:40,766
the biggest experiment yet
to detect dark matter.

20
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:42,151
Oh, yeah,

21
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:44,437
I've read about that...
they're sending research teams

22
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,939
down into abandoned salt mines.
You know, Sheldon,

23
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:49,075
if we apply to be
one of those teams,

24
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,577
we could be on the ground floor
of something big...

25
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,196
not just for theoretical physics
but for astrophysics as well.

26
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:57,249
Wait, hang on... you guys
are gonna work in a mine?

27
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:58,451
Why not?
You had

28
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:01,337
a panic attack when
we went through the car wash.

29
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,290
Perhaps the emotion
you're referring to was shock

30
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:06,876
at you having something cleaned.

31
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:10,162
I think what Penny meant is,
the thought of you two

32
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:13,933
in a mine is kind of funny...
it's like a cat riding a Roomba.

33
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,469
If they get scared,
they'll have those hats

34
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,137
with the lights on them,
'cause down there

35
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,973
it's night-night all the time!

36
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:22,074
Maybe they could

37
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:24,110
ride around in one of
those mine carts that go,

38
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:26,695
ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.

39
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:30,816
Yeah, it'll help them get away
when they see a gh-gh-ghost...!

40
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,236
Are they making fun of us?
Yup.

41
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:37,156
I miss the old days

52
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:09,354
So, one of my favorite
video games of all time

53
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:11,873
is called Shadow of the Colossus,
and it was only

54
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,108
for PlayStation 2,

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,026
but then they came out
with a new version

56
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:16,328
for PS3 with better graphics.

57
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,113
I finally got the chance
to play it,

58
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:21,650
and for some reason, it just
wasn't as good as the first one.

59
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,707
Or something about yoga.

60
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,676
I'm sorry...
I was thinking about work.

61
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:34,095
Well, I was just saying that
there was this video game...

62
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:36,631
Yeah, that's when I started
thinking about work.

63
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:39,100
Uh, listen, I've got
some good news.

64
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:41,102
Hmm.

65
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:42,721
This is for you.

66
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,389
Huh.

67
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,827
What is this?

68
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,762
Well, you know how
they gave me the company car?

69
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:53,064
Didn't make sense to have two,
so I sold the other one.

70
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,816
The one I gave you?

71
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:57,369
Yeah. And there's your money
back... and now we're even.

72
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,704
How great is that?

73
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:01,906
Uh, yeah.

74
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,708
What?

75
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,710
Nothing.

76
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:08,463
Oh, come on, Leonard, I know
the car was a thoughtful gesture

77
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:09,714
and I really appreciate it,

78
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,549
but it doesn't make sense
to have both.

79
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,468
You're right.
What should I have done?

80
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,921
Taken a picture of us in the car
and put it in a pink frame

81
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:21,276
with puffy paint around it
that says “best fiancé ever”?

82
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,929
Doesn't sound that bad.

83
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:27,265
Well, good, because...
that's why I did!

84
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,516
Aw...

85
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:31,386
Oh...

86
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:32,437
thank you.

87
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,988
That-that is so sweet.
No, it's not

88
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,774
that sweet...
I paid for the frame

89
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:38,026
with your money
and then got a massage.

90
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:41,446
You know what, you don't
have to give me this.

91
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:42,747
You keep it.

92
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:43,948
Why?
The car

93
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,567
was a gift... it was something
you needed.

94
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,001
I was happy to
help you out.

95
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:49,838
And I really appreciate it,
but now I <i>don't</i> need it,

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,090
so... here you go.
Well,

97
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,875
this is silly... so you
don't need the car,

98
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,760
but you could use it to buy
yourself something else,

99
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:59,998
like a... new purse to
put all this money in.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,383
Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.

101
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:02,767
I have a good job now.

102
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,235
I know, and I'm
proud of you,

103
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,104
but that doesn't mean I
can't do something nice.

104
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:09,107
Like this.

105
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,142
Okay, I don't want this
to turn into a fight.

106
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:12,277
I don't, either.
Great.

107
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:14,229
Thank you.

108
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,983
Can you pass the salt, please?
Sure.

109
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:28,109
In my mind, that broke
the tension with comedy

110
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:30,078
and led to sex.

111
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:37,285
Hey, Sheldon, you busy?

112
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,170
I'm always busy.

113
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:42,507
This mind is capable
of advanced multitasking.

114
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,475
You know, currently,

115
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:44,809
I'm attempting to solve

116
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,010
the Penrose conjecture,

117
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:48,646
I'm composing
my Nobel acceptance speech

118
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:51,149
for when I've solved
the Penrose conjecture,

119
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:54,369
and I'm wondering
how mermaids have babies.

120
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,356
Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

121
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,993
Now I've got room
for another thing.

122
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,445
What do you want?

123
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,164
So, I did a little
research on what

124
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,999
the conditions are like
in the mines,

125
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,501
and the guys might be right...

126
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,869
sounds pretty rough
down there.

127
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,837
For starters, it's very humid,

128
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,622
and about a hundred degrees.

129
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:17,459
Well, I'm from Texas
and you're from India...

130
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:21,596
we're no strangers
to the fragrant armpit. Next.

131
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:25,283
It's also a live mine, so
there'll be dynamite explosions

132
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,552
going off in the distance.
Yeah, I have

133
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:29,387
a lactose-intolerant roommate

134
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,440
with a taste
for ice cream. Next.

135
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:35,393
Oh, you have to be down there
for 12 hours at a time.

136
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:38,146
Yeah? We have to be somewhere.

137
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:39,314
Well, there's no toilets...

138
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:41,065
we'll have to do our business
in a bucket.

139
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,152
So it's settled...
we're not doing it.

140
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:48,373
Look, I get it, but...
before we pass up

141
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,025
on an incredible opportunity,
I was thinking about

142
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:53,211
when Howard was training
to go to space,

143
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,163
they put him
in a simulated environment.

144
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:58,466
Interesting. You're
suggesting that we recreate

145
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:00,301
the conditions
of the mine

146
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:02,720
to see if we can handle it.
Exactly.

147
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,756
Very well.
So where should we do it?

148
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:08,092
Well, I'll just Google
“hot, dark and moist,”

149
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:11,262
see what comes up.

150
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,481
Uh, Sheldon...

151
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:16,451
Oh, there, well, look,
there's all kinds of videos.

152
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:21,439
Hey, you got a sec?

153
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,774
Hi. Sure.

154
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,492
I was hoping we could talk
about the money again.

155
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:27,278
Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
No, no, no, no,

156
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,948
hear me out. I know things
got a little weird last night.

157
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,201
Well, leaving an envelope full
of cash on my dresser after sex

158
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,837
would count as weird.

159
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,207
Well, I think I came up
with a pretty good solution.

160
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:39,915
Mm.

161
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,069
Why don't we just put the money
in a joint account?

162
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:43,845
It'll be our first
money together.

163
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,097
We can use it for the wedding,
the honeymoon, whatever.

164
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,049
You know what, that's great.
I love that!

165
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:51,936
Yeah, of course you do...
I'm not just a genius in bed.

166
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:02,480
You sure are, baby.

167
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:05,817
You two want to be alone?

168
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,703
I want you to know I get
why you don't want the money...

169
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,405
you've got this new job,
you're excited

170
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,073
about being financially
independent...

171
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,125
and I am nothing
but proud of you.

172
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:15,493
Oh, thank you so much.

173
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,579
It feels so good
to hear you say that.

174
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,796
And I want you
to know

175
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,665
that I get this job
kind of changes

176
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,166
the balance in our relationship,

177
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:24,586
and... I'm trying
to be sensitive to that.

178
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,007
What?

179
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,509
Well, I just think that
maybe you're a little hung up

180
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:34,062
on the money because
I'm less reliant on you now,

181
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,513
and that's a little scary.

182
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,683
Hmm.

183
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,368
Maybe.

184
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:44,689
<i>Or</i> maybe I tried
to do something nice

185
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,158
and maybe you had
a problem with it

186
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,877
because of your control issues.

187
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,281
Control issues?

188
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:56,034
Maybe.

189
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,336
<i>Or...</i> maybe...

190
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,538
now that I'm no longer
an out-of-work actress

191
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,590
who can't pay
for her own dinner,

192
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:04,709
that makes you
a little insecure.

193
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,311
Well, I can't believe
you'd say that.

194
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:10,064
You know how insecure I am
about my insecurities.

195
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,134
You know what?
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,969
It's stupid
to fight over money.

197
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:17,038
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
We're about to share

198
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,473
the rest of our lives together.

199
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:20,775
It's <i>our</i> money...
who cares who has it?

200
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:23,645
Ugh! You're right...
who cares? Mm.

201
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:26,614
Get that money
out of my back pocket

202
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:28,983
or I will break your fingers.

203
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,071
Huh. All this time
I never knew

204
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:34,739
there were steam tunnels
down here.

205
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,624
Most universities
have them.

206
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:39,410
When I was an undergrad,
I spent three days in one

207
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:40,828
pledging a sorority.

208
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:43,731
Did you get in?

209
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,249
No. They forgot I was there.

210
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:47,719
But it really opened up
my pores.

211
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:50,588
Well, according
to my research,

212
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,558
the steam tunnels
below this access point

213
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,811
should be the closest
analog to the mines.

214
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:58,229
This is gonna be
so much more accurate

215
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,347
than the steam room at the gym.

216
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:00,598
Plus, there's almost no chance

217
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,317
we'll see any
of our coworkers half naked.

218
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:06,571
Or totally naked.
I love Howard,

219
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:08,690
but the dude needs
a little shame.

220
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:12,110
All right, Amy, this
walkie-talkie is yours.

221
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:14,612
If we run into any problems,
I'll contact you.

222
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:16,781
And if anything bad happens,
what's the rule?

223
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:20,368
Save you first; Come back
for Raj only if there's time.

224
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,954
We're going
to be fine.

225
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,956
Sheldon, I'm really impressed

226
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,708
you're willing to try this.

227
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,459
Well, admittedly,
this brushes up

228
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:31,846
against my well-known aversions
to heat, small places,

229
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,431
going below floor-level,

230
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:35,800
dampness, hatches,
ladders,

231
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:37,685
darkness, echoes,

232
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:41,105
and eliminating in
Home Depot buckets.

233
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,808
That last one is quite new,
but I have a feeling

234
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,227
that's gonna rocket
to the top of the list.

235
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:03,014
I'm sweating already.

236
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:08,102
Yeah, as the person beneath you,
allow me to say, I know.

237
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,974
How hot is it?

238
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,643
Uh, let's see.
704?

239
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:18,062
No, wait, it's on “clock.”

240
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,481
No, the real answer
isn't much better.

241
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,650
102 degrees.

242
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:23,985
Well, that's what we wanted.

243
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:25,700
This is as hot
as the mines will be.

244
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:26,739
True.

245
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,826
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,
entry one.

246
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,495
Koothrappali's restating
of the obvious

247
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:37,248
is already getting on my nerves.

248
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,302
Thanks again
for having us.

249
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,972
Oh, of course. What did
you guys want to talk about?

250
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,974
Well, you know, now
that we're engaged,

251
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:49,477
we had some questions about how
you handle money as a couple.

252
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:53,014
I told you they weren't gonna
ask us to swing with them.

253
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,517
I didn't think
they were going to.

254
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,102
I just wanted to have
a way to say no

255
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,154
without hurting
Leonard's feelings.

256
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:04,025
Well... nailed it.

257
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:05,526
So what did you
want to know?

258
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:08,579
Well, do you guys ever
fight over money?

259
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,081
Sure, sometimes.

260
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,249
I mean, it can be
a little awkward

261
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:13,868
since I make so much more money
than Howie.

262
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:17,955
You didn't have to say
“so much more.”

263
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,540
Well, I didn't have to,
but for the sake of accuracy

264
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,676
I felt that I should.

265
00:11:22,512 --> 00:11:24,178
I brought a lot of
significant assets

266
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,747
into the
relationship, too.

267
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:29,884
Like what? Your incomplete set
of <i>Star Trek</i> collector plates?

268
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,203
For your information,
I just bought the last one

269
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,522
I needed on eBay.

270
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:36,207
Without asking me?

271
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,293
There were only three minutes
left in the auction

272
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:43,648
and it was a mint condition
Scotty from a smoke-free home.

273
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:46,868
How much, Howie?

274
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,819
Not a lot.

275
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,721
How much?

276
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:52,907
Let's not talk about this
in front of our friends.

277
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:56,411
Was it more or less
than falconry school?

278
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:02,767
For the tenth time,
that was a Groupon.

279
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,770
Like I would swing
with him.

280
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,143
How you feeling?

281
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,578
Good.

282
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,431
Little claustrophobic.

283
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,815
Let's set up
the equipment.

284
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,101
It'll help take
your mind off of it.

285
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:24,155
Miners often sang mining songs
to keep their spirits up.

286
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,907
Do you know any
mining songs?

287
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,942
Just the hits.

288

307
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,632
Okay. How 'bout
a little Miley Cyrus next?

308
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:26,300
Who's he?

309
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,223
Talk about wasted money.

310
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:34,559
What about the late fees
on our credit card

311
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,260
because somebody didn't pay
the bill on time?

312
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:37,562
Well, maybe I would have paid it

313
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:40,097
if I wasn't also doing
everything else around here.

314
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:42,316
Oh, you're saying I don't do
anything around here.

315
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:47,405
Look at my chore chart.

316
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:50,858
She made him a chore chart.
I see it.

317
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,362
“Do the dishes.”
There's a star right there.

318
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:57,365
That was a pity star. Putting
water in the roasting pan

319
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,334
and leaving it in the sink
is not doing the dishes.

320
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:04,539
That pan had to soak
and you know it.

321
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,624
Well, don't come crying to me

322
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,342
when you don't get
your allowance.

323
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:10,261
It's not an allowance.

324
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:11,546
It's a stipend!

325
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,464
And we said we weren't gonna
call it an allowance

326
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:14,799
in front of my friends.

327
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:21,722
I usually don't like
lemon bars,

328
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:24,225
but Th-these are really good.

329
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:30,231
So, as Hannah
Montana, Miley

330
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,816
was a world-famous pop star.

331
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:33,818
But then she would take off
her wig and go to school

332
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,036
like a
normal girl.

333
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:36,070
Which, I don't have to tell you,

334
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:39,073
at that age,
is its own headache.

335
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,375
That's preposterous.

336
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:44,495
How would she go unrecognized
just by wearing a wig?

337
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,581
But you're okay with Superman
concealing his identity

338
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,832
with a pair of glasses?

339
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,750
He doesn't just put on a pair
of glasses.

340
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:51,385
He combs back his curlicue

341
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:54,555
and affects
a mild-mannered personality.

342
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:56,924
You guys doing
okay down there?

343
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:59,977
I told you to use
the walkie-talkie!

344
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:04,432
You guys doing okay down there?

345
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:09,020
Please keep this channel clear
for emergencies. Thank you.

346
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:12,740
I'm going to the vending
machine. Do you want anything?

347
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:15,359
This is a simulation.
We have to survive

348
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,694
on the supplies we brought.

349
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:19,280
Okay, just checking.

350
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:22,250
We should have asked her
to get some Funyuns.

351
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,168
You're not going to have Funyuns

352
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,504
when we're a mile
below the surface of the Earth.

353
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,289
What if we brought them down
with us?

354
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,792
We'll take some Funyuns.

355
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:33,794
Anything else?

356
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,464
Some York Peppermint Patties,

357
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,132
a couple
of Dr. Peppers, and...

358
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:40,885
run to Best Buy and see if
they have a portable DVD player

359
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:44,522
and season one of a show
called <i>Hannah Montana.</i>

360
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,891
Have her get season two.

361
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:49,810
Season one,
it was still finding itself.

362
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:53,314
Sorry you guys had to see that.
Oh,

363
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,649
don't apologize.
Yeah.

364
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:58,035
It just makes it a lot harder
to pretend it never happened.

365
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,154
Money's a sensitive subject
for Howie

366
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:02,123
because of the difference
in our income.

367
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,374
It really bothers him?

368
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:04,625
Well, sure.
There's still a lot of pressure

369
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:05,993
on guys to be providers.

370
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:07,962
So even though
he's happy for me,

371
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:09,764
it's just a little tough on him.

372
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,465
Uh-oh.
What?

373
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,667
Well,

374
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:13,834
if I do well in sales,

375
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,670
I could end up making a
lot more money than you.

376
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:17,672
Not a problem.
I grew up with a mother

377
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,340
who emasculated
my father financially

378
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:21,759
and in every other aspect
of his life, so...

379
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:26,180
...really, it's what I think
love looks like.

380
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,984
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check on him.

381
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,892
Maybe it's a good
thing we came here.

382
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,929
It's like a lesson
in what not to do.

383
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,693
Yeah I don't want something dumb
like money to come between us.

384
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:40,861
It won't. Let's just promise
to figure this kind of stuff out

385
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:41,946
before we get married.

386
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:44,332
Why are you
being so bossy?!

387
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,233
Why are you
being a baby?

388
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,836
I'm not a baby!
I'm a grown man,

389
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:52,373
and I made the bed.
Now where's my star?

390
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,594
Should we go?
Hang on.

391
00:16:56,596 --> 00:16:59,347
I want to see if
he gets the star.

392
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:04,602
Oh, this heat is brutal.

393
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:07,104
As someone from the tropical
subcontinent of India,

394
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:09,607
you should know that fanning
yourself in a humid environment

395
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,143
only raises
your body temperature.

396
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:15,112
Huh. That does explain why
the servants used to look so hot

397
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:16,864
while they were fanning me.

398
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:20,618
Let's get our minds off
how uncomfortable we are.

399
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,953
We could take some more
simulated instrument readings.

400
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,238
My major focus

401
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,957
at the moment is keeping
my claustrophobia at bay.

402
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,542
How's that going?
You tell me.

403
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:30,411
I feel like I can't breathe,

404
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:33,080
and I am tempted
to crack you open

405
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:36,050
and suck the air
right out of your lungs.

406
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,637
Sheldon, if this is
too much, we can stop.

407
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:40,721
We're not stopping.

408
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:42,506
You don't have to
bite my head off.

409
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,091
I apologize.

410
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,476
I j...

411
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:48,396
I'm plagued
by an internal struggle.

412
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,097
If you would just use
the bucket,

413
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,566
you'd be
so much more comfortable.

414
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:55,686
My struggle is emotional.

415
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,438
Oh. Is it Amy?

416
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,607
It's dark matter.

417
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,842
When I entered
the field

418
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:04,278
of string theory,
I was a prodigy.

419
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,365
I rose to a position of respect,

420
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,751
and I assumed
my career would continue

421
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,820
on that upward trajectory.

422
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,623
Now here I am in my 30s,

423
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,626
I'm back at square one.

424
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:22,146
And, frankly, it's frightening.

425
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,600
Sheldon, you know
what I think of when I'm scared?

426
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:27,968
<i>Voyager.</i>

427
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,187
<i>Voyager</i> the space probe

428
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:33,974
or <i>Voyager</i>
the <i>Star Trek</i> TV show?

429
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,443
The space probe.

430
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,061
Good.
Because I am too hot and tired

431
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:40,314
to go on about how much
I hate <i>Voyager</i> the TV show.

432
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:43,317
By the time
I was born,

433
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,736
<i>Voyager 1's</i> mission
was supposed to be over.

434
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:46,871
It had seen

435
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,957
Jupiter and Saturn
and all their moons,

436
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,326
but it kept going.

437
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:55,129
When I left India for America,

438
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:57,798
I was never more scared
in my life.

439
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,167
I had no idea
what lay ahead.

440
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:02,937
Whenever I feel that way,
I think about how...

441
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:06,841
<i>Voyager</i> is still out there

442
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,477
somewhere
beyond our solar system,

443
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:12,346
going further than anyone
ever thought it could.

444
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:18,435
Don't leave!
You can do this!

445
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:22,323
Sheldon,
is everything okay?

446
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,858
It's too late for Koothrappali.

447
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,875
Let's go!

448
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,198
11 minutes.
That's longer than I thought.

449
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,501
They're in my shirt!

450
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,817
Okay, this is definitely
the most fun thing we can do

451
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,985
with the money.

452
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,942
I've never done it on
a big old pile of cash before.

453
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:01,532
“Me neither, Leonard.
It's my first time, too.”

454
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,122
I'm so sorry I made you feel bad
about the money stuff.

455
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,308
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

456
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,627
I want us to be
partners, equals.

457
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,380
Adults in a mature
relationship.

458
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,549
I want that, too.

459
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:22,136
Now, let's talk about
your birthday party.

460
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,638
Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
Oh!

461
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,059
Do you really need me
to transcribe this?

462
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,361
You're not doing it for me.

463
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,363
You're doing it
for future generations

464
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,032
who will benefit
from my struggle.

465
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:38,736
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,

466
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,238
entry four:

467
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,075
My Kit Kat has melted.

468
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,579
All is lost.

469
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,131
You call yourself
a friend?!

470
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,333
I was trying

471
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,668
to help you!
And at the first sign of trouble

472
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,840
you ran away, leaving me
to fend off a family of rats!
