1
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:04,008
Look, I know you guys don't want
to do this,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,142
but we have no choice.

3
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:06,511
So, you can either
bitch and whine

4
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:08,012
or we can
just get it over with.

5
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:08,896
I got "whine."

6
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:10,565
I got the "b word."

7
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,717
Yeah, well,
it's in our contract

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,402
to serve on a
university committee.

9
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:15,403
And frankly,

10
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:16,654
this is one I believe in.

11
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:17,989
Okay, here we go.

12
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:20,891
Encouraging more women to
pursue a career in the sciences.

13
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,326
Come on,
if I was any good

14
00:00:22,328 --> 00:00:23,727
at convincing women to do stuff,

15
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:26,497
I wouldn't have spent so much of
my 20s in the shower.

16
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:29,183
If you ask me,

17
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,002
this whole thing is a waste of
our time.

18
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,253
Helping women?

19
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,905
Yeah, helping anyone.

20
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:37,291
People should take care
of themselves.

21
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:38,843
Oh, like yesterday,

22
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:41,045
when you made me drive you
to the dry cleaners,

23
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:42,913
the pharmacy
and the post office?

24
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:45,683
I'm not saying people
can't use tools.

25
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:50,354
Even an otter picks up a rock
when he wants a clam.

26
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:52,940
You don't think it's worthwhile

27
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:55,026
to try to get more women
working in science.

28
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:57,194
I think
that's incredibly sexist of you.

29
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:59,530
I believe in a
gender-blind society

30
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:02,533
like in <i>Star Trek,</i>
where women and men

31
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:06,120
of all races and creeds
work side by side as equals.

32
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:08,623
You mean
where they were advanced enough

33
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,675
to invent
an interstellar warp drive,

34
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:14,078
but a black lady still answered
the space phone?

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,714
Oh, I did spend a lot of my

36
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:18,666
shower time
with Lieutenant Uhura.

37
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:23,454
Howard's
disturbing recollections aside,

38
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,840
I don't appreciate
being forced to do

39
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:26,974
banal committee work.

40
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:28,893
Yes, I know,
you're too smart for this.

41
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:29,877
Exactly.

42
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,345
It's like
asking the Human Torch

43
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:34,065
to heat up your frozen burrito.

44
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,149
Got it.

45
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,151
All right,
I'm thinking one way

46
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:39,070
to counter bias
in the peer-review process,

47
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,522
is for papers to be submitted
under gender-neutral names.

48
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:42,907
Like S. Smith

49
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,158
instead of Samantha Smith.

50
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,944
I suppose there is a history of
professional women

51
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:49,614
using their initials,
so as not to be pre-judged.

52
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:51,866
<i>Harry Potter's</i> J.K. Rowling,

53
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:54,035
uh, <i>Star Trek's</i> D.C. Fontana.

54
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:57,088
Van Nuys pole-dancer
D.D. Melons.

55
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:01,876
All right, I think we've
really helped women today.

56
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:03,427
Let's fire
up the old Xbox.

57
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,713
Guys, please don't make this
a school project

58
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:07,548
where I'm the smart kid doing
all the work

59
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,183
while the slackers
sit back and watch.

60
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:10,434
No, we're not.

61
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:11,786
This time you're the smart
kid doing all the work

62
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:14,639
while the even smarter kids
sit back and watch.

63
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:17,608
So, you think I'm
one of the smarter kids?

64
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,111
No, you're a tool I was

Guys, our topic is "Encouraging
Women in Science."

76
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,079
Can you at least play
a less sexist game

77
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:04,418
How is it sexist?

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,339
My character wields a
battle axe as well as any man.

79
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,392
Not to mention she
has mammary glands

80
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,094
that could
nurse a family of 30.

81
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:19,650
And have enough milk left over
to open a Baskin Robbins.

82
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:23,488
Mother, warrior-princess,
franchise owner--

83
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,858
I hear glass ceilings
shattering all over town.

84
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,609
Sheldon,
you're always saying

85
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:30,495
how much smarter
you are than me.

86
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,363
Spend five seconds
and come up with one idea

87
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,248
on how to get more women
into science.

88
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:39,453
All your ideas address the issue
at a university level.

89
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:40,505
By then it's too late.

90
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:42,723
You need to
design an outreach program

91
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,425
that targets girls
at the middle school level

92
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:46,294
and sets them on an
academic track

93
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,762
towards the hard sciences.

94
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,497
That's actually good.

95
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:51,883
Why didn't I
think of that?

96
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:54,051
Some people are otters,
some people are rocks.

97
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,440
I wonder if there's a way

98
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,842
we could give the idea
a trial run.

99
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:05,363
Maybe I could call my old
middle school,

100
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,182
see if we can talk to some of
the female students.

101
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:09,350
That's great--
try to set up something

102
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:10,985
for the three of us
to go over there.

103
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,203
Oh, hold on.

104
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,005
While I'm comfortable speaking
about science,

105
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,991
I'm not sure I know how to spark
the interest of schoolchildren.

106
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:19,460
Better Google it.

107
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:21,512
What exactly are you looking up?

108
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:25,750
"How do I get
12-year-old girls excited."

109
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:27,618
No!
No!

110
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:35,142
Thanks again for letting
me crash "girls' night."

111
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,177
Are you kidding?

112
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,212
You brought fancy
wine and made fondue.

113
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:40,598
I've slept
with guys for less.

114
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:47,355
It's a joke.

115
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:49,556
Based on real events.

116
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:52,827
Anyway,
I was hoping I could, uh,

117
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:53,945
pick your brains a little.

118
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:55,663
I'm supposed to take
Lucy out Friday

119
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,448
and I need a killer first date.

120
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,785
Well, evolutionary biology
says that women are attracted

121
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:03,254
to a man who is steady
in the face of danger,

122
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:05,873
so I recommend an
unsafe environment.

123
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:10,845
Seedy bar on the wrong
side of the tracks...

124
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:14,248
picnic near
a lunatic asylum...

125
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,351
a wine tasting on Skid Row.

126
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:21,806
Eh, Lucy has some,
uh, social anxiety issues.

127
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:23,641
Maybe we could start
with something simpler.

128
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:26,060
Why don't you take
her to Disneyland?

129
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,528
You go on Space Mountain,

130
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,413
you're in the dark,
she's holding onto you.

131
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:30,531
Yeah, but you
just have to remember,

132
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,983
that ride is
shorter than you think

133
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,934
and they take a
picture of you at the end,

134
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:36,070
so make sure
you got your clothes back on.

135
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:41,292
It's a joke.

136
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:43,244
Based on real events.

137
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:44,278
Mm, Disneyland?

138
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,663
I don't know.

139
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,748
With all the crowds and the
weird characters walking around,

140
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
just reminds me
too much of India.

141
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,587
I haven't been to Disneyland
since I was a kid.

142
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:54,922
We should
definitely go one weekend.

143
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,307
Weekends are too crowded.

144
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:58,009
So, blow off work,
go on a weekday.

145
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,644
Hooky?

146
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:01,696
I've never
played hooky in my life.

147
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,581
My mom said
that's how girls end up

148
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,183
addicted to
reefer and jazz music.

149
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,471
It's more like how girls end up
at a Best Western hotel

150
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:12,907
with a 34-year-old guy
named Luther.

151
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,027
Joke?

152
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,579
I can laugh about it now.

153
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:22,867
So, what do you say?

154
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:24,535
This Friday we ditch work
and go to Disneyland?

155
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,569
I'm in.

156
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,204
Me, too.

157
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,372
Excuse me,

158
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:30,958
I thought we were trying to
solve my problem?

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,510
Oh, yeah, right.

160
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:33,794
Wait, what was your problem
again?

161
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:37,164
I am a man
who can't talk to women,

162
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,517
trying to figure out how to go
on a romantic date

163
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,552
with a girl who suffers
from such crippling

164
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:44,772
social anxiety she can't be
around other people.

165
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:47,425
Yeah, that's a toughie.

166
00:06:48,627 --> 00:06:50,761
Let's think.

167
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:51,929
Hmm.

168
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:01,572
We doing just Disney
or California Adventure, too?

169
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,709
It's nice
of your old school

170
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,745
to let us try out our science
talk on some female students.

171
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:08,963
Well, they're
actually pretty excited.

172
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,148
I'm their
most famous alum.

173
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,483
If you don't
count the serial killer

174
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:14,201
who ate all
those prostitutes.

175
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,755
This must feel
pretty good for you,

176
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:20,141
coming back to your
alma mater as an astronaut.

177
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:25,012
Yeah, last time I was here, I
was just a scrawny little nerd.

178
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:28,715
And now
you're also an astronaut.

179
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:29,900
So many memories.

180
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:32,353
I mean, how many
times in these hallways

181
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:36,407
was I tripped,
punched and spit on?

182
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,559
Oh, look,
here's my old locker.

183
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,212
I have a
masters in engineering

184
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:44,749
and I still can't figure out
how Scott Kapinski

185
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,917
got me and my briefcase
to fit in there.

186
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:51,839
Hey.

187
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,907
What?

188
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,543
Nothing.

189
00:07:57,963 --> 00:08:00,214
Smart. We don't
want any problems.

190
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,718
I can't believe I ditched work
for Disneyland.

191
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,470
What did you
tell your boss?

192
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,889
Oh, I was very clever,
I did it in stages.

193
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:10,524
At 7:00 last night,

194
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:12,276
I called about
a problem at the lab

195
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:14,695
and casually mentioned
I was going out for seafood.

196
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:16,147
At 9:30,

197
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:19,733
I called and told him that
one of my scallops tasted weird.

198
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,452
At 11:30, I called and said

199
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:23,404
I was
throwing up like a fire hose.

200
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:29,276
At 12:45, I called and made
nothing but dry heaving sounds,

201
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,579
and now I'm
going to Disneyland.

202
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:35,166
Penny, what did you say?

203
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,467
I work at the
Cheesecake Factory,

204
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,252
I said "bye."

205
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,755
So, what are we
gonna do first?

206
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:42,973
I don't know
about you guys,

207
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,258
but I'm gonna make
a beeline for the place

208
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,643
that gives you
a princess makeover.

209
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,261
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

210
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:48,762
You're
kidding, right?

211
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:51,348
We're not just gonna get drunk
and go on rides?

212
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,401
Come on, do it with us.

213
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,187
All right, whatever.

214
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:57,404
How does it work?

215
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,639
Okay, so,
you pick your princess--

216
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,691
Sleeping Beauty, Snow White
Cinderella--

217
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:03,027
they give you
hair, makeup, the works.

218
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,313
Guess it would be fun
to be Cinderella.

219
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:07,865
Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.
Yeah.

220
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:11,085
We can't all be Cinderella.

221
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,422
Then how do we decide?

222
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:16,540
Well, it's simple.

223
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,824
This was my idea.

224
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:18,843
I'm driving.

225
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:19,760
I'm Cinderella.

226
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:21,328
You bitches
got a problem with that,

227
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,347
we could stop the car right now.

228
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,680
Excuse me,
I'm meeting a girl here.

229
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:40,981
It's kind of our first date.

230
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,534
In a library?

231
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:46,520
She and I
are both a little awkward

232
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:49,740
in social situations,
so this seemed like a good idea.

233
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:54,795
People say
I'm a little awkward, too.

234
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,680
May I join you?

235
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,750
No, you can't join us.

236
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:01,552
Just go-go climb back up

237
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:04,004
whatever beanstalk you came
down from.

238
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:11,228
You can do better.

239
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:18,018
Oh, we're eating here?

240
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,076
We're having
a texting date?

241
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:31,916
<i>I love that.</i>

242
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,238
<i>As you're reading,</i>
<i>it will help to remember</i>

243
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,293
<i>I have an adorable accent.</i>

244
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay,
who's ready for some science?

245
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,255
Me, too.

246
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:57,391
Okay, I am
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

247
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:59,143
I am here with my friends
Dr. Cooper

248
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:02,529
and real-life astronaut
Howard Wolowitz,

249
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:04,148
and we are going
to show you girls

250
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,901
how cool a job
in science can be.

251
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,119
How cool, you ask?

252
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,156
Well, how about
negative 273 degrees,

253
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,240
'cause that's the temperature

254
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:16,927
at which entropy reaches
its minimum value.

255
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,832
Did I just learn something new
and have fun doing it?

256
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,134
What?

257
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:29,073
All right!

258
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,058
So now let's bring out

259
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,959
theoretical physicist

260
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,347
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

261
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,936
Hello, female children.

262
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,874
Allow me to inspire you

263
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:50,544
with a story
about a great female scientist.

264
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:55,499
Polish-born, French-educated
Madame Curie.

265
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,368
Codiscoverer of
radioactivity,

266
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,336
she was a hero

267
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:03,173
of science...
until her hair fell out;

268
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:06,593
her vomit and stool became
filled with blood...

269
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,228
and she was poisoned

270
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,098
to death by her own discovery.

271
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,018
With a little hard work,

272
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,971
I see no reason why
that can't happen to any of you.

273
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:22,643
Are we done?

274
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,795
Can we go?

275
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,542
The thing to remember is

276
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,761
you can go to outer space, too.

277
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:38,630
I mean, look at me.

278
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,998
I went to this very school.

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,718
Those desks you're sitting in,

280
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,220
I was once superglued
to one of them.

281
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,108
Did you go to the moon?

282
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,193
No, but I did go

283
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:55,313
to the
International Space Station.

284
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:56,180
Did you fly the rocket?

285
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,765
No,

286
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:00,518
but I was in the rocket.

287
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,186
I didn't actually...

288
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:04,289
So you just flew around?
That's kind of like my uncle.

289
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,690
He's a flight attendant.

290
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,296
No...

291
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:12,714
I'm an American hero.

292
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,699
Your uncle
brings people nuts, okay?

293
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:18,002
Boy, we are learning
a lot here, huh?

294
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,221
Thank you, astronaut Howard.

295
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,225
Um, I am what's called
an experimental physicist,

296
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:28,146
which is super-fun,
because I get to test theories

297
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,480
and work with lasers.

298
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,782
Yes?

299
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,900
How did you decide
to become a scientist?

300
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:34,352
Uh, excellent question.

301
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:38,222
Um, I suppose I've always been
into science, you know...

302
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:40,057
My mother and father
are scientists,

303
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,059
so I was kind of led
in that direction.

304
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:44,862
Eh, pushed might be
a better way to describe it.

305
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,614
To be honest
with you guys,

306
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,915
when I was your age,

307
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,784
I wanted to be a rap star.

308
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,203
Like Snoop Dogg,

309
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:54,405
but with a healthy respect
for the police.

310
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:58,259
Yeah, no, sure, you laugh.

311
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,795
Just like my mother did.

312
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:04,081
After I confided,
I was derided

313
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,667
and chided,
my moms and I collided.

314
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,918
She said my dreams
were misguided.

315
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:16,427
That's just a little freestyle.

316
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:21,866
<i>My dad's a gynecologist</i>
<i>in India,</i>

317
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:24,435
<i>so if you're over there</i>
<i>and need a check up,</i>

318
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:27,938
<i>as he likes to say,</i>
<i>he's "at your cervix."</i>

319
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:34,829
<i>That's terrible.</i>

320
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:37,598
<i>Your dad should be sent</i>
<i>to the pun-itentiary.</i>

321
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,172
<i>That's a fitting</i>

322
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,673
<i>pun-ishment.</i>

323
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:52,930
<i>I still don't know</i>
<i>what you do for a living.</i>

324
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,235
<i>Web design.</i>

325
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,090
<i>Anything I might have seen?</i>

326
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,610
<i>I don't know.</i>

327
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,712
<i>You ever look</i>
<i>at porn Web sites?</i>

328
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:20,508
<i>No, never.</i>

329
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,760
<i>What is porn?</i>

330
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,749
<i>Sorry. Autocorrect.</i>

331
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:29,767
<i>That was supposed to say</i>

332
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,002
<i>"prom Web sites."</i>

333
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:39,076
<i>Ooh, fun. I love prom.</i>

334
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:40,545
<i>The romance, the gowns,</i>

335
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:43,114
<i>it's like a fairy tale come</i>
<i>to life.</i>

336
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,723
<i>Sorry. Autocorrect.</i>

337
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:53,958
<i>That was supposed to say,</i>

338
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,327
<i>"I like sports."</i>

339
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:02,650
I never wanted to play
the cello.

340
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:06,254
How do you meet girls
playing the cello?

341
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,089
"Hey, you want
to come over to my house

342
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:09,574
"and listen to me play
an instrument

343
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,809
that sounds like
a suicidal bumblebee?"

344
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,846
Quick,
pull the fire alarm.

345
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,064
Let's get out of here.

346
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,649
Uh, hello again.

347
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:22,520
Um, yeah, I don't know
if women in general

348
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:26,107
have been actively discouraged
from pursuing the sciences,

349
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:31,061
but it's clear you young women
here, today, have been.

350
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:38,419
While I was listening to
my colleagues waste your time,

351
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:41,906
it occurred to me that it
might be much more meaningful

352
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,208
to hear about women in science

353
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,761
from actual women in science,

354
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:49,764
and, uh, I happen to know
two brilliant examples

355
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:53,050
who have agreed to speak
to you on the phone right now.

356
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:56,554
Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski,
Dr. Fowler, are you there?

357
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,689
We're here.

358
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:01,309
Thank you for taking time
out of your very busy schedule

359
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,228
to enlighten these young women.

360
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,931
It's our pleasure.

361
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,904
I'm Dr. Fowler, and
I'm a neuroscientist.

362
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,105
And I'm
Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz,

363
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,707
and I'm a microbiologist.

364
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,293
The world of science
needs more women,

365
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:22,580
but from a young age, we
girls are encouraged to care

366
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,215
more about the way we look

367
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:27,552
than about the
power of our minds.

368
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:30,788
That's true.

369
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,673
Every one of you has
the capacity

370
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:34,508
to be anything you want to be.

371
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,962
Unless you want
to be Cinderella.

372
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:39,513
Come at me.

373
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:41,015
See what happens.

374
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:46,470
<i>This was really fun.</i>

375
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:52,109
My battery's dying,
so I'm just gonna talk.

376
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:54,362
Thanks for today.

377
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,981
I've been trying to do
more things that scare me,

378
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:59,984
and coming here
was definitely one of them.

379
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:02,420
But it was also really nice.

380
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:05,423
So thanks, and, um,

381
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:06,958
I'm gonna go.

382
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:14,265
Maybe I could do
one more scary thing

383
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:17,668
before I go
and give you a kiss good-bye?

384
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,186
You know,

385
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:21,272
if that's okay.

386
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:27,278
Okay.

387
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:30,998
Panic attack!
Maybe next time.

388
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,354
I'm counting that as foreplay.

389
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,871
Bernie,

390
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:50,022
I'm home.

391
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,874
You have fun today?

392
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:55,128
Yes, and I have a
surprise for you.

393
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,764
Please be Cinderella.
Please be Cinderella.

394
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:02,251
Well, hello, Prince Charming.

395
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,374
Milady.

396
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:23,189
Hey, how was your... what?

397
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:24,774
I can explain.

398
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:26,359
I played hooky with the girls,

399
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,578
then we all went to Disneyland
and got...

400
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,829
What are you doing?

401
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:32,949
Disneyland. Go on,
I'm listening.

402
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:41,007
Sheldon, all Snow White needs
is one little kiss to wake up.

403
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:43,686
Heard you the first time.
