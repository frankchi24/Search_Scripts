1
00:00:02,144 --> 00:00:04,945
So, anyway, last night on
video chat, I spent, like,

2
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:07,381
20 minutes just staring
into Lucy's eyes.

3
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:08,883
Oh, that sounds romantic.

4
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:11,219
It was until I realized
the screen had frozen.

5
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:15,122
Still one of my top three dates
of all time.

6
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:17,475
So, are we ever gonna
hang out with this girl?

7
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:18,843
I'd love that,

8
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:20,845
but she's not really comfortable
around people.

9
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:24,015
Yeah, I used to be
uncomfortable around people,

10
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:25,733
but then I learned a trick.

11
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,318
I pretend everyone I meet

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,304
is a beloved character
from Star Trek.

13
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,774
How's that been working
for you?

14
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:36,277
Oh, like a charm, unnamed
crewman in a red shirt.

15
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:40,531
Leonard, I may have
gotten you a job.

16
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:41,949
I have a job.

17
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:42,950
Yes, he does.

18
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:45,319
He caters to
my every whim.

19
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:48,656
No, in a couple of weeks,
Stephen Hawking's team

20
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,825
is sending an expedition
to the North Sea

21
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:53,461
to test hydrodynamic
simulations of black holes.

22
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:55,780
One of their experimental
physicists dropped out,

23
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:57,665
and I recommended you.

24
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,468
Well, do you really think
I have a shot?

25
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,436
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking.
I talked you up.

26
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,188
He knows your research.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,389
I think this could happen.

28
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:07,508
He knows-- Wow!

29
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,178
Well, now, but do you
think that's a good idea?

30
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,981
Uh, you know Star Trek.

31
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,516
Should a guy
with no name

32
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:18,119
and a red shirt really
go on an expedition?

33
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,855
Hey, don't discourage him.

34
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:22,490
This is a fantastic opportunity.

35
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:23,825
No one asked you, Uhura.

36
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:32,383
Would you like to hear a classic
Sheldon Cooper factoid?

37
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,468
What do you think?
Great.

38
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:39,223
I've been doing some reading
about vehicular safety.

39
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,726
Did you know
that the highest number

40
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,047
of drowning accidents happen
on or around boats?

41
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,517
Interesting that you would
bring that up

42
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,435
when I might go work on a boat.

43
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:53,220
Well, that's the thing
about factoids--

44
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:54,739
they're interesting.

45
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,609
I know what
you're doing.

46
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,745
You don't want me going
on this research trip

47
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,496
because you're afraid
to be alone.

48
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,699
I'm not afraid to be alone.

49
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,284
On land.

50
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,237
On the sea,
it would be terrifying.

51
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,625
Because of all the drowning.

52
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:16,627
Sheldon.

53
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,629
Fine, no more drowning talk.

54
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:20,548
I'll change the subject.

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,418
Oh. Who do you think
would win in a fight--

56
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,772
you or a shark?

57
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,808
Look, I appreciate
your signature blend

58
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,861
of concern for me
and incredible selfishness.

59
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,397
If I get the chance to do this,

60
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,699
there is nothing you can say
that's going to stop me.

61
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,534
Very well.

62
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,373
Things between you and Penny
have never been better.

63
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,209
I hope four months apart
doesn't change anything.

64
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:56,667
I should have opened

75
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,698
If you look
carefully at Venus,

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,150
you should be
able to see

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,869
the International
Space Station pass by.

78
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,538
Wow.

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,073
Your friend
was actually up there?

80
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:37,341
Yeah. He brought me back
a T-shirt that said,

81
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,243
"My Friend Went to
the Space Station

82
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:41,579
and All I Got Was
This Lousy T-Shirt""

83
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,882
Did he take the
T-shirt to space?

84
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:47,769
Nope. It's exactly
as lousy as advertised.

85
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,705
Speaking of friends,

86
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:52,807
they have been
asking to meet you.

87
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:54,475
I was thinking

88
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:56,043
maybe we could all
hang out sometime?

89
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:57,478
I don't know.

90
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,763
How many are there?

91
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,715
Let's see. Six.

92
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:03,901
That's pretty cool;
I have six friends!

93
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:07,188
Kind of like Sinatra.

94
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,741
Six strangers?

95
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:12,727
That's a lot of pressure.

96
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,745
Staring at me,
asking me personal questions.

97
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,914
Like, "What do you do""

98
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,533
"Where are you from?"

99
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:21,786
"Why did you lock yourself
in the bathroom?"

100
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:24,905
Okay, how about
you just dip your toe in

101
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,340
and meet one of them?

102
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:29,093
Will you be there?

103
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,261
Of course.

104
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:32,246
Well, that's two.
Three if you count me.

105
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,914
Oh, this is getting out of hand.

106
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,669
So, then, during
my afternoon shift,

107
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:41,189
I spilled an entire tray
of drinks on myself.

108
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:42,773
Oh, that's awful.

109
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,275
Not really.
My shirt was soaking wet.

110
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,761
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.
Oh.

111
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,616
So, listen, do you remember
when I said

112
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:53,401
the similarities
of the equations

113
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:55,870
of general relativity
and hydrodynamics suggest

114
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:58,439
you could find the equivalent
of Unruh radiation

115
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:00,024
in a large body of water?

116
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:02,109
I thought I said that to you.

117
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,965
Anyway,

118
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,418
Stephen Hawking's team
is looking into that,

119
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,720
and I've been invited
to join them.

120
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:14,155
Wow, Hawking!

121
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,389
Good for you!

122
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,457
Well, it is.

123
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,676
Just-- you know,
I'd be gone for a while.

124
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:19,760
Well, how long?

125
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:20,961
Three, four months.

126
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:22,480
Whoa.

127
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:24,482
When would you leave?

128
00:05:24,484 --> 00:05:25,483
Couple weeks.

129
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,251
Wow.

130
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:29,103
O-Okay, well,
I'll just come visit you.

131
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:31,189
That's the thing-- you can't.

132
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:33,124
I'll be on a ship
in the North Sea.

133
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,475
On a ship?

134
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:38,229
Aren't they afraid Hawking will
just roll overboard?

135
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,498
Uh, he's not gonna be there.

136
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,618
He's just sending a team
to research his theory.

137
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,835
Oh, sure.

138
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:48,489
Like when you send me
to kill spiders in your bathtub.

139
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,210
Wow. Okay.

140
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:53,827
Four months.

141
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,413
Yeah.

142
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:56,964
And I'm a little worried

143
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:59,584
because things
between us have been so great,

144
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:02,336
and I'd hate to do anything
that screws that up.

145
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:04,338
Oh, sweetie,
if you're gonna screw things up,

146
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,191
it's gonna be while you're here,
not while you're away.

147
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,393
Oh.

148
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,748
No. I mean, look,
you have to go.

149
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,683
It sounds like
an amazing opportunity.

150
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:16,951
And I'm just basing that

151
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:19,654
on how much I didn't understand
what you said about it.

152
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:22,323
Okay.

153
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,992
I'll confirm the travel
arrangements in the morning.

154
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:26,711
Okay. Good.

155
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:28,796
I do have to ask
you one favor.

156
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:30,064
Sure.

157
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,249
Sheldon's nervous
about me leaving.

158
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,084
Just keep an eye on him
while I'm gone.

159
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:34,869
Oh, I don't know.

160
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:38,589
Remember what happened when
I took care of your goldfish?

161
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,909
Well, flush Sheldon down
the toilet and get me a new one.

162
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,048
Really, you guys do not need
to throw me a going-away party.

163
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,216
Are you kidding me?

164
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:51,902
How often can you say
"Bon voyage" to somebody

165
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:54,822
when they're actually going
on a voyage?

166
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:58,075
Hello, Rajesh.

167
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,081
Hello, Amy. Nice to see you.

168
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:09,236
What can I say?
It's funnier with the accent.

169
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:11,905
There's beer in the fridge.

170
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:14,759
Anyway, you guys really don't
need to make a big deal.

171
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,277
Leonard, you're being selfish.

172
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:19,246
We need to give you a proper
send-off so we'll have closure

173
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:21,932
when you die at sea
and crabs eat your face.

174
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:25,186
Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.

175
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,887
You know, one of the things

176
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,273
that helped me get through
Howard being in space

177
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:31,925
for so long was getting
married before he left.

178
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,832
Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.

179
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,067
Okay.

180
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,485
I have a request to make.

181
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,487
And now he can talk.

182
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,456
I want to cut open your brain

183
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,875
and see what the heck's
going on in there.

184
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:52,880
The only person allowed
inside this head is Dr. Phil.

185
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,782
Anyway,

186
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:57,051
I-I spoke to my new lady friend
about meeting you all,

187
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,003
and she thought
it would be easier for her

188
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,171
to start with just one.

189
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:01,922
Oh, gee, I don't know.

190
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,124
My schedule's a little busy.

191
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:06,510
Actually,
I was thinking Leonard.

192
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:08,229
Oh. Thank you, Raj.

193
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,347
I'd be honored.

194
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:10,598
What the hell?

195
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,900
I thought
I was your best friend.

196
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:15,903
You are, but you've got
kind of a big personality,

197
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:19,740
with your flashy clothes and
your Woody Allen swagger.

198
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:22,943
You know,

199
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:25,646
maybe she'd be more comfortable
meeting a girl first.

200
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:27,081
Good idea. Bernadette?

201
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,250
What the hell?!

202
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:31,035
Well, you're very pretty.

203
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,820
That could be intimidating
to another woman.

204
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:34,988
Oh, yeah.

205
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,042
Hey, you don't think I'm pretty
enough to scare your girlfriend?

206
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,827
Calm down, Bernie.

207
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:41,629
You're very scary.

208
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:44,765
It should be me.

209
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,016
Why?

210
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,386
So you can make jokes
about cutting open my brain?

211
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:51,004
A, that was not a joke.

212
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,057
That was a sincere request.

213
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:56,143
And B, more
importantly,

214
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:57,695
I was the outsider
to this group,

215
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:59,864
and I know how frightening
that can be.

216
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,900
But you guys took me in
and made me feel loved,

217
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:05,119
like I was family.

218
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,907
Fine, I'll do it.

219
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,862
So, after I started
dating Sheldon,

220
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,364
I met Leonard,
and then everybody else,

221
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,834
and they've all been
so wonderful to me.

222
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:21,218
That's really nice to hear.

223
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,370
Maybe next week,
we could all get together.

224
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,473
Oh, Lucy, you don't
have to answer that.

225
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:27,975
Don't put her on the
spot. She hates that.

226
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:30,043
Am I right? Tell her
how much you hate

227
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:32,263
being put on the spot.
Go ahead, tell her.

228
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,849
Ignore him. He's a little
nervous 'cause he doesn't think

229
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:36,567
I understand the severity
of your social anxiety.

230
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:38,652
What the...?
Are you crazy?

231
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,720
You can't talk
about social anxiety

232
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:41,272
to someone who has
social anxiety.

233
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:44,275
It makes them
socially anxious!

234
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:46,110
Excuse me, but I'm
a neurobiologist.

235
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,362
I think I'm a little
more qualified than you

236
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:51,615
to understand what's not working
in your girlfriend's brain!

237
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:52,750
Don't call her my girlfriend.

238
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:54,452
We haven't discussed
whether or not

239
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,953
we're girlfriend
or boyfriend yet.

240
00:09:57,405 --> 00:09:58,956
Now that it's
out there...

241
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,560
...are you my girlfriend?

242
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:03,694
By the way,
if you say no,

243
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,297
I'll never be happy again.

244
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:09,283
Not to put you on the spot.

245
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,604
I think I have to go
to the bathroom.

246
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,109
We might as well
go ahead and eat.

247
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,861
She's not coming back
anytime soon.

248
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,173
This is ridiculous.

249
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:32,906
We're shopping
for a party.

250
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:34,709
This store doesn't even
have a party section.

251
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:37,912
Yeah, it does,
and here we are.

252
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,965
You know, I have to say, Penny,

253
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:43,134
I don't understand
why you of all people

254
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,519
are encouraging Leonard
to do this.

255
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,921
Well, I'm his girlfriend;
of course I'm gonna support him.

256
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:50,141
Yeah, well,
you're his girlfriend for now.

257
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,926
You know, maybe
you're not aware of this,

258
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,928
but there is
a rich tradition

259
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,199
of men at sea finding comfort in
each other's arms and britches.

260
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,703
Honey, this is a big
deal for Leonard, okay?

261
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,538
He gets to work with
Stephen Hawking.

262
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,707
Who, by the way,
will not be on the boat.

263
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,775
I checked it out.

264
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:10,110
It's not that big
of an opportunity.

265
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:12,480
And even if Hawking's theories
are correct,

266
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:15,049
all they prove is
where the universe came from,

267
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,969
why everything exists and
what its ultimate end will be.

268
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,820
I mean, me?

269
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,390
I'm interested
in the big questions.

270
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,795
Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius
is jealous of Leonard.

271
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,513
I'm not jealous.

272
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,182
I'm just very unhappy

273
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:33,017
that good things
are happening for him

274
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,935
and not happening for me.

275
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:37,655
Look, sweetie, this is
a natural thing to feel, okay?

276
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:39,640
But just because good things
are happening to Leonard

277
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:41,492
doesn't take anything
away from you.

278
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,411
You know what? Let me
tell you a little story.

279
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:45,446
Once there was a girl who worked
at the Cheesecake Factory,

280
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,998
and she wasn't very good
at her job.

281
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,617
It was you.
It wasn't me.

282
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:51,669
But she was also an actress,

283
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:53,404
and we were both up
for the same part

284
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:54,455
in a toothpaste commercial.

285
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,757
She got it. Look,
I was so jealous.

286
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,326
But instead of ripping out
her fake blonde hair...

287
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,429
You ripped out
your own fake blonde hair.

288
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,097
I...

289
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,849
looked her in the eye,

290
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:07,168
smiled and said,
"I'm happy for you."

291
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,836
Because that's what friends do.

292
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,473
They lie
so they don't look petty.

293
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:13,607
Yeah.

294
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:14,942
How?

295
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:17,078
Like this.

296
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,880
I am so happy for you.

297
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,751
Wow.

298
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:26,404
No wonder you didn't get
that toothpaste commercial.

299
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:31,859
Hey.

300
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:33,294
Hi.

301
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,629
I want to apologize
for Amy last night.

302
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,031
She was completely out of line.

303
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:45,639
Are you... are you
not speaking to me

304
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,475
or did the screen freeze again?

305
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,744
Amy wasn't the problem.

306
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,762
Okay. I know.

307
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,397
It was me.

308
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,366
I-I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.

309
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,817
Thank you.

310
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,770
You know,
I-I've been thinking that...

311
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:03,140
maybe meeting somebody
one-on-one is too intense,

312
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,341
so...

313
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:06,177
Friday night, my friends
are having a party.

314
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,878
A party?
A little one!

315
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,448
It's-it's a farewell
for Leonard,

316
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,666
so all the attention
will be on him.

317
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,419
If you wear something brown
and sit on the couch,

318
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,471
they won't even know
you're there.

319
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,374
I'm not sure.

320
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:21,509
Oh, please?

321
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:22,777
Raj.
Come on.

322
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:23,911
Don't make me beg.

323
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:27,131
And I'm from India,
so I know how to do it.

324
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,634
Okay.

325
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:31,752
Y... Thank you!

326
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,270
Th-This means a lot to me.

327
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,022
My friends are like my family.

328
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:36,941
Unless you don't like them;

329
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:39,210
in which case,
they're dead to me.

330
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:44,264
So, have you ever spent
a long time on a boat before?

331
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,200
Yeah.
Are you referring to the time

332
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:49,403
we got stuck on the Small World
ride at Disneyland?

333
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,156
Yeah.

334
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,327
I'm proud of you, Leonard.

335
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,162
Working out
on the North Sea

336
00:13:58,164 --> 00:14:00,948
for months--
that's really something.

337
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,833
I know. As far as science goes,

338
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,118
this is the adventure
of a lifetime.

339
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,954
Maybe your lifetime.

340
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:09,140
I went to space.

341
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,309
It's not a competition.

342
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,677
You're right, you're right.

343
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,262
I'm really proud of you, and...

344
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:17,148
I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone.

345
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:20,701
And space beats water.

346
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:25,406
Rajesh, I thought
Lucy was coming.

347
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,408
She is. She's just running
a little late.

348
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,743
You know how it is--
girls always fussing about

349
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,978
their hair, their makeup.

350
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,163
She'll be here.

351
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:34,215
Just give it a rest, okay?

352
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:40,221
Um, can I have
your attention, everyone?

353
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,925
That's, uh, B-flat, for those
who don't have perfect pitch.

354
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,712
I would like
to propose a toast

355
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:51,799
to my best friend,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

356
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:55,553
He has been presented with
a wonderful opportunity,

357
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:58,772
and I couldn't
be happier for him.

358
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:02,693
Thank you, Sheldon.

359
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,812
That must've been
very hard for you to say.

360
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:06,697
Well, I mean it.

361
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,349
I'm really happy
for you.

362
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:12,203
And that's how you get
a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.

363
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:14,755
Cheers.
Cheers.

364
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,994
It was really nice of you
to try to be happy for Leonard.

365
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:21,495
Mm. Thank you.

366
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:24,197
It must've killed you
when I went to space.

367
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,453
Oh, no.

368
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,672
Buddy, you okay?

369
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,176
Oh, man.

370
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,262
What's going on?

371
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:40,147
Uh, go ahead. Read it.

372
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,349
"Raj, I can't come
to the party.

373
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,684
"This is all just

374
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:45,352
"too much for me.

375
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:48,239
"I don't think
we should see

376
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,441
"each other anymore.
Sorry.

377
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:52,443
Lucy."

378
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:54,111
Excuse me.

379
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,780
Raj, I'm so sorry.

380
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:59,016
Me, too.

381
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:05,172
It did not kill me
when you went to space.

382
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,761
Monkeys went to space.

383
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:16,884
Well, here we are.

384
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,686
Yep.

385
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:21,105
I'm really gonna miss you.

386
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,806
I'm gonna miss you, too.

387
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:25,109
Penny, we're
in the red zone.

388
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,696
The white zone
is for loading and unloading.

389
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,198
We're breaking the law.

390
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,483
Okay, there's no space

391
00:16:32,485 --> 00:16:33,901
in the white zone, so...
Anyway,

392
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:37,237
we can e-mail, and I-I think
the phone connections

393
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,455
are pretty good.

394
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,291
All right, you have to get
out of the car right now.

395
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:41,575
I'm not going
to jail for you.

396
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:42,609
Would you just relax?

397
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:44,878
Oh, I see a space
in the white zone.

398
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,381
Quick, circle the airport.

399
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,249
Did you bring enough inhalers?

400
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,551
Yeah.

401
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:51,802
And, uh, extra Dramamine?

402
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:54,421
You remember what happened
on It's a Small World.

403
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:55,723
I'm covered.

404
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:56,957
Okay.

405
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,676
Oh, dear Lord,
a police officer's

406
00:16:58,678 --> 00:16:59,927
glancing in our direction.

407
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:02,396
We've been made.

408
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:05,683
Calm down.
I'm getting out.

409
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,401
I have something
I want to give you.

410
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:08,902
Oh, Leonard.

411
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,387
It's just a heart-shaped
locket with a picture of

412
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:12,406
Leonard's face in it. He got
it at the mall on clearance.

413
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,274
Now move, move, move!

414
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,194
I love you.

415
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:19,363
I love you, too.

416
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,701
Don't worry, Officer.

417
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,318
They just love each other.

418
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,871
We're not smuggling drugs.

419
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,846
Raj, it's Penny.

420
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,214
Are you in there?

421
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:38,932
Hang on.

422
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:43,520
Hey. I'm just coming back
from the airport.

423
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,439
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

424
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:46,974
That's-that's very nice of you.

425
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:48,842
Uh, come, come. Come on in.

426
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:50,444
Can't stay long.

427
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,714
I left Sheldon in the car
with the window cracked open.

428
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,651
He's gonna go through
that activity book

429
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,820
in, like, 30 seconds, so...

430
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:02,639
Are you okay?

431
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:05,309
No.

432
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:07,194
Oh.

433
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,362
I'm so sorry.

434
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:10,497
No.

435
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:12,249
It's my fault.

436
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:15,302
You know, I finally found
someone who was right for me,

437
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,938
and I-I drove her away.

438
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,341
Oh, Raj.

439
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,427
Penny, I...

440
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:25,479
I miss her already.

441
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,947
I know how you feel.

442
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:28,198
I miss Leonard, too.

443
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,551
What's... what is
wrong with me?

444
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:34,438
Why-why can't I
ever have love?

445
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,722
You will.

446
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:38,025
No, I... I won't.

447
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:39,576
I'm-I'm unlovable.

448
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:42,579
That's just
the booze talking.

449
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,064
No, it's not.

450
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,784
I haven't had a drink
since last night.

451
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,211
You're talking to me.

452
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:58,896
I am.

453
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:03,050
And now I'm crying for
a whole different reason!

454
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:04,601
Me, too!

455
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,988
So I-I guess
what I'm saying is.

456
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,880
I get where Lucy's
coming from.

457
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:18,631
That's great.
Do you want some wine?

458
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,082
Uh, no, water's fine.

459
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,852
Anyhow, I-I've been
thinking about it a lot,

460
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:25,804
and-and I totally see
why Lucy did what she did.

461
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:26,722
I pushed too hard.

462
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:28,257
But you know what?
If I back off

463
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,342
and give her enough space,
maybe there's still

464
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:31,727
a future for us.

465
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:34,013
Yeah, the funny thing about life
is that, you know, sometimes...

466
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,149
Does he ever shut up?

467
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:42,151
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

468
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:49,762
...at least
my heart is starting to heal.

469
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:51,597
Slowly but surely.

470
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,365
And  how I cried.

471
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:56,268
It was like a little, uh,
thunderstorm on my face.

472
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,003
But I'm a man, okay?

473
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,172
So I need to pull myself
together, pick up a pen

474
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,807
and get it all out
in my journal.

475
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,609
I mean,
it's not all bad, right?

476
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:04,877
Having my heart broken

477
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:06,504
has allowed me to finally speak
in front of you...

478
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,410
so, you know,
it was a silver lining.
