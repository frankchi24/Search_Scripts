1
00:00:02,782 --> 00:00:04,485
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:06,486
Penny, have you been
recording shows

3
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:08,321
on our DVR again?
No.

4
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:10,991
Answer honestly.
This is not a trial.

5
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:14,244
That'll come later.

6
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:16,513
Absolutely not.

7
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,615
Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.

8
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:19,599
Yeah.

9
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,452
Uh... maybe we were hacked.

10
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:25,488
You know, the Chinese have been
hacking everything lately.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,744
Why would the Chinese make our
DVR record <i>Paul Blart: Mall Cop?</i>

12
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,247
I don't know.

13
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:37,283
It's a fat guy on a Segway.
That's funny everywhere.

14
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:39,052
I'm deleting it.

15
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:40,420
Well, hang on.

16
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:43,256
Maybe the Chinese haven't
finished watching it yet.

17
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:46,977
You know, if you're trying
to make space on the DVR,

18
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,311
why don't you just get rid of

19
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:49,813
some of the stuff
you've already watched?

20
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:51,464
Like, um... <i>Alphas.</i>

21
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,316
No, that's
the season two finale.

22
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,651
That was quite the cliffhanger.

23
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,803
I'm going to re-watch it
before season three starts.

24
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,972
There is no season three.
They canceled that show.

25
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,994
Well, they can't cancel it.

26
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,779
It ended on a cliffhanger.

27
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:08,248
- They did.
- Uh, Sheldon,

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,816
there are two dumplings left.
Do you want them?

29
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,150
Dumplings?

30
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,153
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

31
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:15,154
As a rule, no.

32
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:18,408
That show ended with all
the residents of New York

33
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,876
either dead or unconscious.

34
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:22,512
Now I'll never know
what happened.

35
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,597
Well, why don't you
make up your own ending?

36
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea.

37
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:28,184
And after that,

38
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,220
I'll make up my own rules
of oral hygiene.

39
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:32,639
You know, instead of flossing,
I'll rub pudding on my gums.

40
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,025
I'm going to get the number
of the SyFy Channel

41
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:36,776
and give them what for.

42
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:38,061
Oh, please, don't do that.

43
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:40,680
No. They can't just cancel
a show like <i>Alphas.</i>

44
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:43,066
You know? They have to help
the viewers let go.

45
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:46,069
<i>Firefly</i> did a movie
to wrap things up.

46
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:49,072
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>
continued on as a comic book.

47
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:52,459
<i>Heroes</i> gradually lowered
the quality season by season

48
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,294
till we were grateful it ended.

49
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:57,147
I feel bad for whoever
gets that phone call.

50
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,465
Ah, don't.

51
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,767
If they didn't want to be
yelled at by crazy nerds,

52
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:02,529
they shouldn't have started
a sci-fi channel.

63

I think you're gonna
be really happy

64
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:35,768
with this security camera.

65
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,253
The optics are great,

66
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:38,638
it's got infrared technology,

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,989
and there's even

68
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,641
a backup battery
when the power goes out.

69
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:42,792
Whatever.

70
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,227
I can see my little princess

71
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:46,396
while I'm at work, right?

72
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:50,132
Why can't you just watch porn
like a regular guy?

73
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:54,821
I need your laptop so I can
configure the software.

74
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:55,905
Wait, hold on.

75
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,473
This is weird.

76
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,658
What?

77
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,993
I was Googling that girl
I've been dating,

78
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:01,644
and I found her blog.

79
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,829
Cool.

80
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,080
Anything juicy?

81
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,915
She said she recently
went on a date

82
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,350
with a guy named Roger?

83
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,120
And he's Indian?

84
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:14,290
And he's an astrophysicist, too?

85
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,043
You know what's going on,
don't you?

86
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:19,509
Yes.

87
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,763
Mummy was right.

88
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,516
American girls are
sexually voracious devils.

89
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:25,885
I can't believe
I have to explain this.

90
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:29,355
People change names on blogs
to protect their privacy.

91
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:32,007
Roger is Raj.

92
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,559
Oh.

93
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:35,511
I always thought,
if I had a white name,

94
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:37,680
it would be Gavin.

95
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,067
Keep reading.
What does it say?

96
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,618
No, no, I don't know
if I should.

97
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,354
If she wanted me to know about
her blog, she would've told me.

98
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:46,739
It's almost like
I'm reading her diary.

99
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:49,325
That's exactly what it's like.
Keep reading.

100
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,544
No, this is creepy.

101
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:54,047
Oh, I think we were looking
at creepy in the rearview mirror

102
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:56,916
when I put up that camera.

103
00:03:56,918 --> 00:04:00,586
It's not creepy.
Don't listen to him.

104
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:04,924
Oh, look who's got
the sweetest kisses.

105
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:14,684
Should I go?

106
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,057
With all the TV Sheldon
was talking about,

107
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,893
I had the greatest idea ever.

108
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:25,495
It even blows away my idea

109
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:28,247
for a <i>Star Wars</i> themed coffee
shop called "Brewbacca's."

110
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,234
You need to watch
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</i>

111
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:34,420
It is the perfect show
for the two of us.

112
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:36,122
It's got action and jokes

113
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,708
and hot vampires and romance.
I cannot oversell this!

114
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,242
What do you say?

115
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:43,245
It's 6:30 in the morning.

116
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:47,216
I thought you
grew up on a farm.

117
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:52,889
Hello, SyFy Network?

118
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,975
Yeah, this is your
vice president of programming.

119
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:59,278
Now, we have made a horrible
mistake regarding <i>Alphas.</i>

120
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,381
Yeah, we need to uncancel it
immediately.

121
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:04,867
Well, you just put me through
to the people who handle that,

122
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:06,101
you tell them it's me,

123
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:07,954
and I don't want to answer
a lot of questions

124
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:10,272
about if I really am
who I say I am, you know?

125
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,242
I just... I want this done.

126
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:16,129
No, I am not the person
who just called.

127
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:21,083
That man was clearly a cowboy.

128
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:22,385
Yeah, who was plumb concerned

129
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:23,953
about y'all canceling
his favorite show.

130
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,674
Why do they keep
hanging up on me?

131
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,059
I'm sorry you're upset.

132
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:33,796
You know, Sheldon, sometimes
people seek the comfort

133
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,265
of physical contact
in moments like this.

134
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,855
I am not flying
back to Texas

135
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,291
just so my mom
can give me a hug.

136
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,994
Okay.

137
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:50,329
Well, what I think
is going on here

138
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:53,082
is you have a pathological
need for closure.

139
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,251
Oh, that's nonsense.

140
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:58,037
I mean, you tell me stories
about your day all the time.

141
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,622
I don't care how they end.

142
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,593
You know, I might be able
to help you with this.

143
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:06,429
There's a whole field
of behavioral neuroscience

144
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:09,164
that examines ways to retrain
your neural pathways

145
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,217
so stuff like this
bothers you less.

146
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:12,552
Yeah, but I just told you,

147
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,187
I don't have a problem
with closure.

148
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,688
You sure about that?

149
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,973
Oh, quite sure.

150
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,453
That proves nothing.

151
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,041
Ready to go to lunch?

152
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,009
Do you think I'm feminine?

153
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:39,662
Yeah. Let's go.

154
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:41,881
Thanks a lot.

155
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:42,932
What's going on?

156
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:46,035
I broke down,
and I read Lucy's blog.

157
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:47,202
And in one
of the entries,

158
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,704
she said, when we first met,

159
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,339
I struck her
as a little feminine.

160
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,041
Just a little?

161
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:53,593
That's great.

162
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:56,062
I have to talk to her
about this.

163
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,396
Oh, geez, why do you girls

164
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:59,048
always want to talk
about things?

165
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,234
Listen to me,

166
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,618
if she's writing
about your relationship,

167
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,237
use it to your advantage.

168
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,738
Rig the game.

169
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,490
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

170
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,892
Is it fair that girls
like confident, normal guys

171
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,245
more than nervous weirdos?

172
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,496
No, it's not.

173
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,898
I've always thought
that was unfair.

174
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,934
So take what's
in that blog

175
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,336
and use it to get
her pants off.

176
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:22,738
Why do you have to make
everything so filthy?

177
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,590
Why couldn't you just say
the blog is like

178
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:26,375
her giving me
the key to her heart?

179
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:28,344
"The key to her heart."

180
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:29,912
That's nice.

181
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:30,963
Were you quoting someone

182
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,415
or is it tattooed
on the small of your back?

183
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,417
I was quoting a man

184
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,553
who knows a thing or two
about women:

185
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:39,438
Sir Elton John.

186
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:49,598
So, did you love it?

187
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Of course you loved it.
How could you not love it?

188
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,653
Tell me how much you loved it.

189
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:55,104
It was cute.

190
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:59,441
Oh, don't say cute.

191
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:00,459
That's the worst.

192
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:01,610
W's wrong with cute?

193
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:03,629
It just makes things seem small.

194
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,081
It diminishes them.

195
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,551
So you want me to stop calling
your little tushy cute?

196
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:11,120
You can try,
but nobody's gonna believe you.

197
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:16,458
I just... I don't understand how
you can watch a show that great

198
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,977
and not be excited by it.

199
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:19,645
I liked it. I'm excited.

200
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:21,814
Well, then, tell your face.

201
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,266
What do you want from me?

202
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:25,301
You know what?

203
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,019
Never mind.
We gave it a shot.

204
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,471
Let's just see
what else is on.

205
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,570
Oh, come on,
don't be like that.

206
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,241
Well...

207
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,525
I'm sorry I called it cute.

208
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,309
Let's watch another one.
Really?

209
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:35,328
Yeah, it was fun.

210
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,279
Kind of reminded me
of my high school.

211
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,982
But instead of vampires,
we had meth heads.

212
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:45,304
But both came out at night
and had messed up teeth.

213
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,756
All right, cool.

214
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,424
I-I think you'll like
the next one better.

215
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,876
All the cheerleaders are
suffering from an evil curse.

216
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,879
Oh. Well, that's like
my high school, too.

217
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,749
But instead of a curse,
it was crabs.

218
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:01,637
I've come up with
a series of exercises

219
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,856
to help with your
compulsive need for closure.

220
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:07,176
I take issue with
the word "compulsive."

221
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:09,845
All I'm saying is,

222
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,015
we live in a world where
closure isn't always an op...

223
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,379
...tion. Okay.

224
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:31,083
For the sake of argument,
let's say I have a problem.

225
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:33,335
What would be your plan
for addressing it?

226
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,971
I'm going to recondition
your brain

227
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:40,209
so that the need for completion
isn't so overwhelming.

228
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:43,545
By playing tic-tac-toe?

229
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,714
Yep. Your turn.

230
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,817
Oh, Amy.

231
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,902
And you wonder why people
think neuroscience

232
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:52,188
is nothing but a goofy game
for diaper babies.

233
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:57,276
Tic-tac-toe can only end
in win, lose or draw...

234
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,496
none of which will
deny me closure.

235
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:02,231
Especially since
I'm about to win.

236
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:14,877
B-But we didn't finish.

237
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,629
Exactly.

238
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:18,247
How does that make you feel?

239
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,801
The same way any
normal person would.

240
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,437
Feel like I want to
peel off my own face

241
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,555
and tear it in two
and then again and again

242
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:28,607
until I have a handful
of Sheldon-face confetti.

243
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,777
And that's exactly the feeling
we want to address

244
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:32,895
with this course of treatment.

245
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,864
Yeah, or you could pitch in,
grab a nostril

246
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,949
and help me get this face off.

247
00:10:36,951 --> 00:10:39,101
Come on, you can do this.

248
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:41,871
You don't know what it's like
to feel completely frustrated.

249
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,205
To have a-a desire

250
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,107
build up within you
and be denied

251
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:47,710
any opportunity for release.

252
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:56,802
Yeah, sounds like a drag.

253
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:14,025
Okay, help me out here.

254
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:15,876
Why does he love
this show so much?

255
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:18,296
Well, there was action,
it was funny.

256
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:19,914
I mean, you do get

257
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,550
that usually the monster
chases the pretty girl,

258
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:25,403
but this time the pretty girl
chases the monsters?

259
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,572
Yippee, it's backwards.

260
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:30,424
I get it.

261
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:33,010
Why does this
bother you so much?

262
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,729
I don't know.

263
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:37,064
It's just, he's so passionate
about so many different things.

264
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,549
I just don't get that way.

265
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:39,817
Do you?

266
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,653
Well, sure. I'm pretty
passionate about science.

267
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:45,272
I remember the first time
I looked through a microscope

268
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,692
and saw millions
of tiny microorganisms.

269
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,027
It was like
a whole other universe.

270
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:54,665
If I wanted to, I could wipe
it out with my thumb like a god.

271
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:58,619
See? I wish I had some
of that fire in my life.

272
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,538
I mean, I want
to care about things

273
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,123
and get excited
like you guys.

274
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,507
Well, there's no
reason you can't.

275
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,675
You think?

276
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,661
Absolutely.
All we need to do is spend

277
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:09,263
a little time and find something
you're passionate about.

278
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:12,967
That sounds
like a lot of work.

279
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:18,806
Hey, what's up?

280
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:20,941
Uh, Lucy's coming over.
I need some advice.

281
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:25,830
However long you think the
foreplay should be, triple it.

282
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:29,867
Just tell me which one you think
is more manly.

283
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,987
This hockey jersey or...

284
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,705
this football jersey.

285
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:38,242
I don't know. Go with hockey.

286
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,628
Good-- black is more slimming.

287
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:43,464
Oh, that's her.

288
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:46,000
I got to go be butch.
Toodles.

289
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,390
Hey.
Hi.

290
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,341
Come in.

291
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:56,844
Oh, look how cute
your little doggy is.

292
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,846
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't get too close.

293
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,598
If I give the right command
in German,

294
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,066
she'll rip your face off.

295
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:11,075
♪ O'er the land
of the free ♪

296
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:13,661
♪ And the home

297
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:16,113
♪ Of the...

298
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:17,915
Next.

299
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:24,238
That's quite an impressive
layout, isn't it?

300
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:28,092
Yes.

301
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,713
Let's box it up.

302
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,383
"Let's box it up."

303
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:47,361
That's enough.

304
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,481
Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!

305
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:56,804
Okay, Sheldon, make a wish
and blow out the candles.

306
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:04,378
Oops, missed one.

307
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,464
Now your wish can't come true.

308
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,719
Lucky for you,
'cause I wished you were dead.

309
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,391
I like your jersey.

310
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:19,093
Thanks. I love hockey.

311
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:20,711
Oh, cool. So does my dad.

312
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:22,680
We watched it
all the time growing up.

313
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,398
Who's your favorite player?

314
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,907
Not Brian Boitano,
that's for sure.

315
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:35,776
How's your burrito?

316
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:38,362
It's still a little frozen
in the middle.

317
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,080
Probably because I didn't read
the instructions.

318
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:43,250
No wrapper's
going to tell me what to do.

319
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:46,003
Unless his name is Jay-Z.

320
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:47,755
Is something going on?

321
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:48,856
What do you mean?

322
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,591
Well, you're acting all weird.

323
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,009
And I'm pretty weird,

324
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,628
so I think I know
what I'm talking about.

325
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,849
I don't know. Maybe it's all
those steroids I've been taking.

326
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:01,018
I think I'm gonna go.

327
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,470
Thank you for the burrito
and the pork rinds

328
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,922
and the 20-minute lecture

329
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:08,359
on why monster trucks
are better than regular trucks.

330
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,027
Wait, wait.

331
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:14,615
I-I found your blog
where you wrote about me.

332
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:17,868
Oh. I kind of just write that
for myself.

333
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,653
I didn't think anybody
actually read it.

334
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,906
No kidding. You didn't make it
easy to find.

335
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,707
I spent hours
digging around online.

336
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,963
For the record, you have
excellent credit scores.

337
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:29,213
And your diabetic aunt seems

338
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:32,049
to be adjusting
to her new leg just fine.

339
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:35,502
Why were you acting
so strange tonight?

340
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:37,755
You called me feminine.

341
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:38,806
And I...

342
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,675
I wanted you to think
I was more manly.

343
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:44,645
Raj, I didn't say "feminine"
was a bad thing.

344
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,730
I meant that you're sweet
and thoughtful

345
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,766
and your skin looks so much
like caramel,

346
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:51,301
I just want to dip
an apple in your face.

347
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:53,904
I do have a pretty
balls-to-the-wall

348
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:56,657
moisturizing regimen.

349
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,826
So, are you okay?

350
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,361
Yeah.

351
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:02,145
Good.

352
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:03,414
Do you even like hockey?

353
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,832
No.

354
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,149
Bought this
at the Staples Center

355
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:07,868
when I went
to see Taylor Swift.

356
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:14,625
So, I was thinking
how excited you get

357
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:17,044
about stuff like <i>Buffy</i>
or science

358
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,880
or which TV remote
you and Sheldon should buy.

359
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:21,098
The "Harmony One" was fine.

360
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,967
We didn't need to upgrade
to the 1100,

361
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:26,270
which he knows
is too big for my hand.

362
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:29,607
See, that's the kind of passion
I didn't think I had.

363
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,192
But then I realized
I'm passionate about you.

364
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:36,864
Oh... my cute little tushy
strikes again.

365
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:39,733
No, I'm serious.

366
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:42,119
Look, I've always had
these plans.

367
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:44,855
I was gonna be in movies
and live this glamorous life,

368
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:46,240
and anything less than that

369
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,708
just wasn't worth
getting excited about.

370
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,827
Those things can still happen.

371
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:50,995
Oh, obviously it's gonna happen.

372
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:53,363
Yeah, a psychic at a
bachelorette party told me so.

373
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:56,133
Anyway, what I meant was...

374
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:58,702
I shouldn't wait, you know?

375
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:03,724
I've got you, I've got Sheldon,
all these wonderful friends.

376
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:06,143
My life is exciting right now.

377
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,395
That's a big deal.

378
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:11,482
It is, isn't it?

379
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,235
So, does that mean
we get to do stuff

380
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:18,889
like talk about cool shows
or get dressed up

381
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:21,925
in matching costumes
and go to Comic-Con?

382
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:26,229
Leonard, I had an epiphany,
not a stroke.

383
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,952
Amy, I must say,
I was skeptical at first,

384
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:35,589
but this has truly been
a transformative evening.

385
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:38,408
I'm a little surprised to hear
you feeling so positive.

386
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,961
Well, you're an excellent
neuroscientist,

387
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:44,798
you're a wonderful
girlfriend, and...

388
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,552
And?

389
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:51,421
Doesn't matter, does it?

390
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,891
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

391
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,596
And a complete sucker.

392
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:06,103
Oh, yeah.

393
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,429
There he is.

394
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,970
♪ And the home of the brave...

395
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,711
Don't stop. Yes, keep going.

396
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:33,347
Just like that.
Almost there, almost there.

397
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,720
Sheldon, you big weirdo,

398
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:42,756
I want you to know that I love
that you're in my life.

399
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,592
I love you, too.

400
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:59,456
Hello. Uh, is this
the Bruce Miller who wrote

401
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:02,523
the season finale of <i>Alphas?</i>

402
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:05,359
Oh, smashing.
Yeah, you already sound nicer

403
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,395
than the last Bruce Miller
who suggested

404
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,281
I have sexual relations
with myself.

405
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,765
Yeah, now, down to business.

406
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,484
Um, your show ended
on a cliffhanger.

407
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,422
Could you please tell me
how you planned to resolve it?

408
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,540
Uh-huh.

409
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,109
Mm-hmm.

410
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:22,460
I see.

411
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:24,617
Well, that all stinks.

412
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,252
No wonder you got canceled.
Bye.
