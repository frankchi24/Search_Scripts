1
00:00:02,653 --> 00:00:04,329
Sheldon, your food's
getting cold.

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:05,747
I'll eat later.

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:06,949
Right now, I'm suckling

4
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:09,284
at the informative bosom
of mother physics.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,154
It's hot when
Sheldon talks dirty.

6
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:18,427
So, I found this Web site
where you send them pictures,

7
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:19,594
they sculpt your head

8
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:21,596
and make an action figure
out of you.

9
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:22,597
How awesome is that?

10
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:23,715
Oh, let me see.

11
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:24,800
Yeah, you can pick
your wardrobe.

12
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:26,468
You can even choose
your accessories.

13
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:31,473
Leonard, you can get
a little asthma inhaler.

14
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:33,775
Oh, this is neat.

15
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,310
Think about all
the action figures

16
00:00:35,312 --> 00:00:36,511
we've bought over the years.

17
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:39,281
It would be kind of cool
to have ones that look like us.

18
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:40,515
Don't you think?

19
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,237
Yeah, if that's your idea
of what's cool,

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,188
you should get one.

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,541
Yeah, so, I'm out.

22
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,244
What do you think,
Sheldon?

23
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:54,162
Want an action figure
that looks just like you?

24
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:56,064
Would it come with kung-fu grip?

25
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,432
No.

26
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,584
Don't waste my time.

27
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:03,672
You get that these are
personalize action figures.

28
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:06,008
Honey, if you want one,
just get one.

29
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,309
You're still
out, right?

30
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,394
Yep.

41
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:37,282
A hush falls over the crowd

42
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:40,902
as Cooper studies the board.

43
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:43,071
He makes his move.

44
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,506
He's dividing both sides by "I."

45
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:46,424
He's adding back
the coefficient.

46
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:47,759
He has a value for "P."

47
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,077
He's plugging that back in.

48
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,045
He takes the derivative,

49
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:51,179
and he solves the equation.

50
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,297
The crowd goes wild.

51
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,398
Nobel! Nobel!

52
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,934
Cooper?

53
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:57,018
Nobel.

54
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,186
Kripke.

55
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,806
Don't look at my board.

56
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:05,026
What's that?

57
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:07,479
That's a drawing
of a really cool train.

58
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,847
Don't look at that, either.

59
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,098
What do you want?

60
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,733
I have some
bad news.

61
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:13,118
You're working
on a grant proposal

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,569
for a new
fusion reactor.

63
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,539
I'm working on a grant proposal
for a new fusion reactor.

64
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:21,126
The university is only allowed
to submit one proposal.

65
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:23,895
So they asked you to pack up
your things and ship out.

66
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:25,297
That's hard cheese, Barry.

67
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:26,898
You're one of the good ones.

68
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:31,836
No, they're making us
work together.

69
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:34,389
That's ridiculous.

70
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,675
I am one of the great minds
of our generation.

71
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,843
I work on a level so rarified

72
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:40,312
you couldn't
even imagine it.

73
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:43,565
I said stop looking
at my cool train!

74
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:46,735
Hmm.

75
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:47,802
Kind of a strange place

76
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:49,487
to put a picture of you
and Bernadette.

77
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:54,526
Well, I wanted everybody
to know I love my wife.

78
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:57,812
And nobody to know I forgot
to turn off the laser.

79
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,234
They're here.

80
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:04,953
Our action figures
have arrived.

81
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,488
This is the best $500
I've ever spent.

82
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,374
$1,000 on action figures?

83
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,209
How can you afford that?

84
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:12,660
Easy-- his family's loaded,

85
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,662
and Bernadette has a great job.

86
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:17,498
My wife came with both
fun bags and money bags.

87
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:23,138
Say hello to an exact
scale model of me.

88
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:31,730
Oh, I'm not dark chocolate.

89
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:34,616
I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.

90
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:38,403
Oh, man.

91
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:44,859
Look at my nose.

92
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,661
Maybe it's a shipping problem.

93
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:48,296
What?
Yeah.

94
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:49,748
Maybe Wesley Snipes
and Toucan Sam

95
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,033
just got action figures
that look like you guys.

96
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,703
This sucks.

97
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:57,389
I can't believe
I wasted all that money.

98
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:00,558
Aw, and my girlfriend
wouldn't let me get one.

99
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,862
Look at my face.

100
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:06,214
Do I look smug?
I feel smug.

101
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,987
I hate it when you make me
sit through all the credits.

102
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,105
Well, sometimes there's
a secret ending,

103
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:15,824
like in <i>The Avengers.</i>

104
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,742
Yeah, but I don't think
that's going to happen

105
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:20,412
in a documentary
about the Holocaust.

106
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:23,615
They could
show bloopers.

107
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:27,568
Oh, no.

108
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,670
What is that?

109
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:30,171
That is Sheldon's

110
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:34,125
"I'm unhappy and about
to destroy the planet" music.

111
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:36,261
Come on, let's just go
to your place.

112
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:38,413
Well, wait, if he's unhappy,
shouldn't we talk to him?

113
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:39,464
"Shouldn't we talk to him?"

114
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:42,017
Have you learned nothing
in six years?

115
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,191
You doing okay, sweetie?

116
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:55,113
There is ominous music playing,

117
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:57,315
and there is an afghan
over my head.

118
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,717
I don't know where you're from,

119
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,952
but where I'm from,
that means I'm not doing okay.

120
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,955
Want me to make
you some tea?

121
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,224
Tea is for when I'm upset.
I'm not upset.

122
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:09,110
The university's forcing me
to work with Kripke.

123
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:10,611
I'm outraged.

124
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:13,214
So, cocoa?

125
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,782
Yes, cocoa.

126
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:19,454
Do you have any idea what
it's like to be paired

127
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,756
with someone who's so
incredibly annoying?

128
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,008
Oh, teacher! Me! Me!

129
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,296
See, I did all this great work,

130
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,565
and now he's just going to
come along and ruin it.

131
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,734
I am angrier than ever
and filled with despair.

132
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:35,153
What beverage
do you make for that?

133
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,939
Oh... no, no, no, I know this.

134
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:39,124
Uh...

135
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:40,575
hot apple cider
with cinnamon sticks?

136
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:42,994
Yes, hot apple cider
with cinnamon sticks!

137
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,984
What the frig, Cooper?

138
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:50,952
We were
supposed to meet

139
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:53,321
in my office
a half an hour ago.

140
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,673
And yet,
now you're in my office.

141
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:58,159
Point: Cooper.

142
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,512
Welcome to the Thunderdome,
Kripke.

143
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:03,681
We agreed to exchange
copies of our work.

144
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:04,766
Let me see yours.

145
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:07,936
Why don't you show me
yours first.

146
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:10,972
You think I just fell
off the turnip truck?

147
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:13,858
We exchange at the same time.

148
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,628
How do I know you're not
going to take my ideas

149
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,163
and publish them
as your own?

150
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:20,064
How do I know you're not
going to do that with mine?

151
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:21,182
Yeah, because I'm not interested

152
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,867
in getting published
in <i>Mad</i> magazine.

153
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,956
Zingers fly fast
in the Thunderdome, Barry.

154
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,792
Are we going
to do this or not?

155
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:32,327
Thank you.

156
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,212
So, we read each other's work,
meet again tomorrow?

157
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:36,364
Fine.

158
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:42,220
Nice try.
This is blank paper.

159
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,222
And I am sure it's
still more valuable

160
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:45,706
than whatever's in here.

161
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,593
Cough it up, Cooper.

162
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,145
Very well.

163
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:58,987
If this one's blank, too,
I'm going to be furious.

164
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,323
Fine.

165
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,734
You!

166
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:15,003
Always bet on black.

167
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:18,173
Get that waste of money
out of my face.

168
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:19,924
It's only a
waste of money

169
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:22,210
if we don't
play with them.

170
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:23,744
He's right, dawg.

171
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,048
Please, I'm working.

172
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,385
You know, there is a way
we can get action figures

173
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:31,936
to look exactly
like us.

174
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:33,104
Oh, yeah?
How's that?

175
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:34,189
Two words:

176
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,357
3-D printer.

177
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,942
Wait, maybe it's three words.

178
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:39,394
No, hang on.

179
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:42,697
Okay, one word, a letter
and a number and...

180
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,232
maybe a hyphen.

181
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,401
3-D printer.

182
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:49,737
I have always wanted
a 3-D printer.

183
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,122
Of course you have.

184
00:07:51,124 --> 00:07:52,240
They're an
engineer's dream.

185
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,374
Anything you can design,

186
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,610
a 3-D printer can make
out of plastic.

187
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,912
Yeah, but they're so expensive.

188
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:58,963
Oh, come on.

189
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,048
You deserve one.

190
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,499
You've worked hard
to find a woman

191
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,051
who makes a lot of money.

192
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:07,455
Well, the prices
have been coming down.

193
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:08,623
Oh, true.

194
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,758
They're practically
giving them away.

195
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,745
You know, in exchange for money.

196
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:16,797
And we can make stuff
we need for work with it.

197
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:19,434
Prototypes
of my CAD/CAM designs,

198
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:20,518
specialized tools...

199
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Not to mention
Malibu Koothrappali

200
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:25,607
and his totally bitchin'
dream house.

201
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:28,809
We don't need Malibu
Koothrappali's dream house.

202
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:30,194
Really, smart guy?

203
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:32,747
Where's he supposed to park
his sweet little Corvette?

204
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:39,487
The monkey in my tobacco study
has taken to smoking a pipe.

205
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:42,823
I'm supposed to remove
his brain to examine,

206
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:45,677
but it's hard because now he
reminds me of my uncle.

207
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,014
You've been
awfully quiet tonight.

208
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:51,332
Is everything okay?

209
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,601
I'm fine.

210
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:56,387
All right, well,
how was work today?

211
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,640
Did you exchange your research
with Kripke?

212
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,360
Yes.

213
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:04,845
Sheldon, what's going on?

214
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:10,184
I read his research, and...

215
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:13,521
it's leaps and bounds
ahead of mine.

216
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:16,541
Which means the mommy
of the smartest physicist

217
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:21,629
at the university is not
my mommy as I had thought.

218
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,548
It's his mommy.

219
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,135
Sheldon, I wish there was
something I could do

220
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:28,636
to make you feel better.

221
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,006
May I offer you a consoling hug?

222
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,726
What do we have to lose?

223
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,268
How's that?

224
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,221
I feel like I'm being strangled
by a boa constrictor.

225
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:53,027
Why'd you stop?

226
00:09:56,961 --> 00:10:00,296
Come on, Sheldon!
We're going to be late!

227
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:03,182
I can't go in today.
I'm sick.

228
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:04,284
You're not sick.

229
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:05,501
You just don't want
to face Kripke.

230
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,987
No, look.

231
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,526
128.

232
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:17,013
See?

233
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,315
What did you do,
put this in your tea?

234
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,200
Oh, dear.

235
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:24,287
Now I'm not even smarter
than you.

236
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,789
Sheldon, Kripke's not
smarter than you.

237
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,541
You just got stuck
on a wrong path.

238
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:29,776
Happened to Einstein.

239
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:32,412
He got stuck on the unified
field theory for decades.

240
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,363
Oh, don't play
the Einstein card.

241
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,633
His great breakthroughs happened
when no one knew anything.

242
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,135
So everything
was a great breakthrough.

243
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:40,420
Sheldon Lee Cooper,

244
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,138
I do not have time
for this nonsense.

245
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,257
Now, go put your clothes on,
get in the car,

246
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,842
and lets go to work.

247
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,596
All right, geez.

248
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,147
What a grouch.

249
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:55,435
How did I do that?

250
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,187
I got to remember
how I did that.

251
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,658
Do you realize, by
owning a 3-D printer,

252
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,577
we are reclaiming
the manufacturing process

253
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:08,498
and taking jobs back
from sweatshops in China?

254
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,901
I think this thing
was made in China.

255
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,754
Eh, what can you do?

256
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,423
Ooh, I-I think it's done.

257
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,260
It worked!

258
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:24,263
We printed a whistle.

259
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,716
Amazing.

260
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:28,751
You realize these things
go for 25 cents a pop

261
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:29,919
at a party store.

262
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,221
And we made it
in only three hours.

263
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,893
Sounds just like
store-bought.

264
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:41,764
Okay, give me
a superhero pose,

265
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,032
and I will scan you

266
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,734
into the computer
for your action figure.

267
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,570
Oh, I wish I was
in better shape.

268
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,324
Stop holding
your stomach in.

269
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:54,276
I'll give you a six-pack
with the computer.

270
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,662
Oh, okay, great.

271
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,997
Now I can look
like Val Kilmer as Batman

272
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,783
instead of Val Kilmer
as he looks today.

273
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,972
All right, you can
suck it in a little bit.

274
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,227
Cooper, we have a problem.

275
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,979
Your work is really not

276
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,014
at a level
I expected it to be.

277
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,849
I know.

278
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:18,434
Go ahead, mock me.

279
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:21,404
Just use small words
so I understand.

280
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:23,656
Don't play dumb
with me.

281
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:25,575
We both know
what your problem is.

282
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:27,176
We do?

283
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,828
You have a girlfriend.

284
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,479
So?

285
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,415
So my work would suffer, too,

286
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,752
if I was getting laid
all the time.

287
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,758
Yes.

288
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:45,445
That is the reason.

289
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,016
My work is suffering
because of...

290
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,435
all the laid I'm getting.

291
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,522
You lucky bastard.

292
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:59,058
What can I say, you know?

293
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,677
She enjoys my genitals.

294
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,199
I am giving them to her
on a nightly basis.

295
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,569
Okay, stop bragging.

296
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,738
You had some brilliant
insights in here,

297
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,955
but if we're gonna
make this work,

298
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,824
you need to buckle down
and focus.

299
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,375
I'll do what I can.

300
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:19,746
But it's not going to be easy,
because when I'm with Amy

301
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:23,649
and our bathing suit areas
mush together...

302
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:26,135
boy howdy, is it magic

303
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,395
Oh, good,
you're home.

304
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,631
Got a little
surprise for you.

305
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:39,816
What?

306
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,900
Say hello

307
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:43,069
to my little friend.

308
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,891
Oh, my God.

309
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:50,243
That's so cute.

310
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:53,062
I didn't think there could be
a smaller version of you.

311
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:57,250
I know, right?

312
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:59,068
And, thanks
to photographs

313
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,670
and a little
3-D modeling,

314
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,372
here comes the bride.

315
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:06,459
Oh, Howie,
I love these.

316
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,460
I thought you might.

317
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,178
Were they expensive?

318
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,713
Didn't cost a thing.
I made them myself.

319
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,265
How?
Koothrappali and I

320
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:15,885
bought a used 3-D printer
for $5,000.

321
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,421
$5,000 for a
couple of dolls?

322
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,590
Are you out
of your mind?

323
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:25,094
Not just
a couple of dolls.

324
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,730
For as many dolls
as we want.

325
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,734
And whistles.

326
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,737
At any point, did it dawn
on you to talk to me

327
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:36,539
about spending this
kind of money?

328
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,609
It's kind of
dawning on me now.

329
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,628
I don't believe you!

330
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,631
Howie, we can't afford to waste
money on junk like this.

331
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,583
What are you talking about?

332
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,252
We make plenty
of money.

333
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:50,553
<i>I</i> make plenty of money!

334
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,454
You make peanuts!

335
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:55,842
Yes, but we're married now.

336
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,426
That means, when you

337
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:00,179
get sick,
I take care of you.

338
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:03,015
And when you make
a bunch of money,

339
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:05,301
I get to buy stuff.

340
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:08,654
Sorry if you
don't like it,

341
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:11,324
but that's how
love works.

342
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:13,976
No, here's how
love works.

343
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,528
You're gonna return
the machine,

344
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,864
or you can print out a
working set of lady parts

345
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:19,315
and sleep with those.

346
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:23,920
Oh, my God! Are you
actually thinking about it?

347
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:28,824
All right, I don't understand.

348
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,676
Why didn't you just
tell Kripke the truth?

349
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:33,379
Because the truth
made me look bad,

350
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,332
whereas a ridiculous bald-faced
lie makes me look good.

351
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:38,217
Anyway,

352
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,501
if Kripke asks,

353
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,888
tell him my coitus with Amy
is frequent,

354
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,907
intense and whimsically
inventive.

355
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:53,783
Is my coitus
whimsically inventive?

356
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,869
That is what I write
on the bathroom walls.

357
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:58,621
"For a whimsically
inventive time,

358
00:15:58,623 --> 00:15:59,822
call Leonard Hofstadter."

359
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:04,961
I know you're joking,
but I'd be okay with that.

360
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:06,377
Yeah.

361
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,714
Sheldon, can I ask you
a question?

362
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:10,833
Of course.
You ever going to sleep with Amy?

363
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,771
That's awfully personal.

364
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,340
We don't ask Sheldon
things like that.

365
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,540
Maybe you don't; I do.

366
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,708
What's the deal?

367
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:23,379
Well, word around the university

368
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:26,616
is I'm giving her sex organs
a proper jostling.

369
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,267
All right, come on,
be serious.

370
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,519
Look, you guys have been
going out a long time.

371
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:31,988
She would clearly like

372
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,739
to have a physical
relationship with you,

373
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,358
so what are you doing?

374
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,892
All right, we're down
the rabbit hole.

375
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:38,527
What <i>are</i> you doing?

376
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:42,198
Well, first of all,
I'm quite fond of Amy.

377
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,699
Then what's
the problem?

378
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:45,851
Penny...

379
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:49,205
all my life,
I have been uncomfortable

380
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,923
with the sort
of physical contact

381
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,009
that comes easily
to others--

382
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,645
hand-shaking, hugging,

383
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,546
prostate exams.

384
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:03,769
But I'm working on it,
you know?

385
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:07,940
Just recently, I had to put
VapoRub on Amy's chest.

386
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,643
A year ago, that would
have been unthinkable.

387
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:14,230
Now you know how I feel
when I have to put it on you.

388
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,450
Okay. Hang on.

389
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,403
Are you saying someday
you and Amy might...

390
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:23,789
actually get physical?

391
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:28,110
It's a possibility.

392
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,948
Oh, my God!

393
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:41,173
Sheldon, I know this
wasn't easy for you,

394
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,059
and I'm really glad we could
have this conversation.

395
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,310
Oh, yeah.

396
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,462
Ow!

397
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:52,680
Are you sure you
want to do this?

398
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:54,682
Give up your half
of the 3-D printer?

399
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:56,017
Yes.

400
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:58,303
And can you please make
that out to Bernadette?

401
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:00,138
I was taken off
the joint account

402
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,525
until I learn
the value of money.

403
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,444
Wow, that's harsh.

404
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:08,546
Tell me about it.

405
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,615
Aren't you gonna eat lunch?

406
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:14,602
Nah, I blew my food allowance
on Pokemon cards.

407
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:20,592
Well, the equation
balances,

408
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:22,327
but it's certainly
not elegant.

409
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:24,445
Whatever.
You get any last night?

410
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,633
Yes.

411
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:31,052
Gave it to her good, huh?

412
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:34,639
No, I gave it to her well.

413
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,127
Now, over here,
I was thinking

414
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:41,096
the turbulence could be
reduced if we just put...

415
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:42,163
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:45,150
Was she naked,
or was she wearing lingerie?

417
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:49,938
I didn't notice.

418
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:53,307
How could you
not notice?

419
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:54,909
I was too busy

420
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:57,979
squishing all the desirable
parts of her body.

421
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,198
Ah, you're killing me, Cooper!

422
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:03,501
Can we get back to work?

423
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:06,254
Sure, sure, sure.

424
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:08,957
You guys ever use any toys?

425
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,660
Toys?

426
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:17,265
I do have a model rocket
next to my bed.

427
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:20,272
A rocket?
You're a freak! I love it!

428
