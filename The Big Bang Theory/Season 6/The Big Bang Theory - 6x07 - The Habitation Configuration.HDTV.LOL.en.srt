00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:04,995
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:04,997 --> 00:00:08,765
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun with Flags.

3
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:13,203
Before we get started,
I'd like to announce

4
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:16,106
the winner of our design
your own flag competition.

5
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:18,275
But I can't.

6
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:20,944
The only entry
was from GameyGamer75,

7
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:24,882
and I know that was a jpeg
of your buttocks.

8
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:27,251
Now this week we have
a very special episode

9
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:28,919
where we explore the flags

10
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:32,222
of the popular entertainment
franchise, <i>Star Trek.</i>

11
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:34,491
And to help me,
I'm pleased to introduce

12
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,326
Internet personality,

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,029
former star of <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Next Generation,</i>

14
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:42,533
and the only guy I know lucky
enough to be immortalized

15
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:47,638
in 1/16 scale--
set phasers to "fun"...

16
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:52,309
...for my friend, Wil Wheaton.

17
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,679
Hi, Sheldon.
Thanks for having me.

18
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm happy to be here.

19
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,599
Cut.

20
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:59,700
What's wrong?

21
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:01,969
Sorry, Sheldon, you were
brilliant as always.

22
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:04,755
Wil, that was
a little wooden.

23
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:07,307
Wooden?

24
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,642
Don't worry,
it wasn't terrible.

25
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:12,479
Just, this time, try to say it
the way people sound.

26
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:15,816
And action.

27
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,151
My friend, Wil Wheaton.

28
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:19,820
Hi, Sheldon.
Thanks for having me.

29
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:21,054
I'm excited to be here.

30
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:23,740
So, Wil, what do you
have for us first?

31
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:25,659
Well, this is
an exciting one.

32
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:28,095
This is the flag of the
United Federation of Planets.

33
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:30,063
Now what's interesting about this flag...
Cut.

34
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:32,749
What was wrong with that?

35
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:35,335
It's called "Fun with Flags."

36
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:37,671
They're not at half-mast,
nobody died.

37
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:39,840
Let's try and keep it upbeat.

38
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,125
Um, no offense,

39
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:43,894
but I've been acting
since I was a kid.

40
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,596
I think I can
handle a Web show

41
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:46,847
without a lot
of direction.

42
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,098
It's true.

43
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,633
In 1982, Wil
played the voice

44
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:52,302
of Martin the mouse
in <i>The Secret of NIMH.</i>

45
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:54,438
You moved me.

46
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,990
You'll have to forgive me.

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,077
This is my first time directing,
I just want it to be good.

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,478
So do I.

49
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,363
Great. So, this time let's try

50
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:05,165
more real boy, less Pinocchio.

51
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:07,918
And action.

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,303
And cut.

53
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,422
You realize that I'm doing this
for free, right?

54
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,510
Yes. And so far, we're still
not getting our money's worth.

55
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:21,298
Let's try it again.

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,166
Everybody's having fun.

57
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:25,135
And action.

58
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:27,337
So, Wil...

59
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,080
...what do you have
for us first?

60
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:41,318
Well, this is
an <i>exciting</i> one.

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,886
This is the flag

62
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:44,888
of the United
Federation of Planets.

63
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,156
Cut.

64
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:48,959
Problem,
first-time director?

65
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,210
Oh, none that I could see.

66
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,664
I saw a man who loved flags
almost as much as I do.

67
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,166
I got goose bumps.

68
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,368
He was overacting on purpose.

69
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,469
Really?

70
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,089
He reminded me of a
young William Shatner.

71
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,473
Listen, Sheldon,
I'm really happy

72
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,976
to do this for you,
but not if she's gonna be

73
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,045
a huge pain in the ass
the whole time.

74
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,098
You gonna let him
speak to me like that?

75
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,235
Well...

76
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,720
you're my girlfriend

77
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,655
and I don't want
you to be upset.

78
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,323
Then again,
Wil Wheaton's my friend

79
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,576
and I don't want
him to be upset.

80
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,745
Hmm...

81
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,396
This is a sticky wicket.

82
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,282
What do you think?

83
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,702
Can I speak to you
for a second?

84
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:34,037
I'll be right back.

85
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,423
Feel free to play
with yourself.

86
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,249
I don't care for your friend,
he's being rude to me.

87
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:47,684
You need to ask him to leave.

88
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,754
Amy, I can't just ask
Wil Wheaton to leave.

89
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:52,689
He's a minor celebrity.

90
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:57,427
Once you explain who he is,
many people recognize him.

91
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,279
Fine. Then maybe I should go.

92
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,865
Could you?
That would solve everything.

93
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,535
You are the <i>best.</i>

94
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,370
I'll see you at dinner tonight?

95
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,039
You sure you wouldn't rather
have dinner

96
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,240
with your friend Wil Wheaton?

97
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,793
Come to think of it, I would!

98
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,446
You, little lady, are on fire.

Every time we eat
dinner here,

110
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:50,266
your mother refuses to let me
help with the dishes.

111
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:52,969
Don't take it personally.
She likes doing them by herself

112
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,888
so she can lick the plates
with no one looking.

113
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,723
You ready to go?

114
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:01,444
Yeah, let me just grab a couple
of fresh turtlenecks.

115
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,780
I don't understand
why you keep your stuff here

116
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:05,598
when there's plenty
of room at home.

117
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,333
What are you
talking about?

118
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,169
All I have here
is a few sweaters,

119
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:12,989
books, bank stuff,
computers,

120
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,458
mail, collectibles, medicine
and my electric body groomer.

121
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:19,579
Ooh, there's my plaid dickie.

122
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:22,748
Oh, got this at the Goodwill
store for 50 cents.

123
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,201
Can you believe it?

124
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:29,055
50 cents sounds right.

125
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,724
Let's go.

126
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:32,892
You know, it's kinda late.

127
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:34,543
Why don't we just spend
the night here?

128
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,179
Because we don't live here.

129
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:37,379
I know.

130
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:39,348
Do you? You said when you got
back from space

131
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,983
you were gonna move into
my apartment,

132
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:42,602
but half the time we stay here.

133
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:45,071
That's not true.

134
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:47,156
Howard, I'm doing laundry!

135
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:49,492
You want me to put
anything in for you?!

136
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:52,829
There's some underwear
in the hamper!

137
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:56,249
Oh, good! I got that new
stain stick to try out!

138
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,723
Thank you! I only put it
on the list two weeks ago!

139
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,858
Okay, I see what
you're getting at.

140
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,878
How about this weekend

141
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,850
I'll box up all my things
and move them to our place.

142
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:15,268
Thank you.

143
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,937
The lightsabers are gonna
look great in the living room.

144
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,090
Or in the closet.
We can decide later.

145
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,359
Howard, help!

146
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,112
My hand's stuck
in the garbage disposal!

147
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:30,283
Let go of whatever piece of food
you're holding!

148
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:31,951
Are you kidding?!

149
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:35,388
It's a perfectly good
chicken leg!

150
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,626
Hey, look who's out
after dark, like a big boy.

151
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:44,380
I was out raising heck
with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

152
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:45,998
Four hours more
and we would have

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,051
closed down the
HomeTown Buffet.

154
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,586
I thought you had plans
with Amy.

155
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:55,007
Yeah, I did, but then Wil called
Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

156
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,893
She got huffy and left,

157
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,145
then Wil and I headed out
to dinner.

158
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:02,265
That place really did remind me
of my hometown.

159
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:06,085
Because there we also have
a HomeTown Buffet.

160
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,356
Hold on.
Wil and Amy had an argument?

161
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,491
Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

162
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:14,827
Then Amy got mad and left?

163
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,495
Walked right out the door.

164
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,531
And you...?

165
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,183
Enjoyed a delightful dinner
at a reasonable price.

166
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,153
The manager recognized Wil

167
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:27,206
and let us sit right next
to the frozen yogurt machine.

168
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,474
Right next to it!

169
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:32,812
I was closer to it than
I am to you right now.

170
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:35,932
Buddy, I think Amy
might be upset.

171
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,683
Why's that?

172
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,668
Because your friend
was rude to her,

173
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,470
and then you went
to dinner with him.

174
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:44,640
You're just repeating
what I said.

175
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:46,976
It's like living with
a lactose-intolerant parrot.

176
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:51,781
Trust me, call her.

177
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:55,952
Fine. It's a shame you didn't
go to dinner with us,

178
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,536
because the buffet
you're about to enjoy

179
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,288
only serves humble pie,

180
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,241
a dessert much less tasty
than frozen yogurt.

181
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:03,626
I was this close.

182
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:09,649
What?

183
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,150
You'll appreciate this.

184
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:13,719
Leonard has some ridiculous
notion that you're mad at me.

185
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:15,504
Tell him you're
not mad at me.

186
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:16,922
Go ahead, set
him straight.

187
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,491
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

188
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:23,012
Hmm. Eat one of
your Luna bars.

189
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:26,449
Very often when women
think they're angry,

190
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:28,818
they're really just hungry.

191
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,370
I'm not hungry.

192
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:34,373
Your friend insulted me,
and you didn't do anything.

193
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:39,111
Precisely, I didn't
do anything.

194
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:42,231
Now does someone feel like
checking her emotional math?

195
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:45,451
Keep going, buddy,
you're doing great.

196
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,036
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend,

197
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:48,921
and you should have
taken my side.

198
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:52,425
That's it. End of story.
Good night.

199
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,097
Wow, Amy's mad
and Leonard was right.

200
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:00,800
What a weird day.

201
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:04,753
Hey. Sorry this took so long.

202
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:07,390
But you used to work here,
you know how it is.

203
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,058
Kitchen slammed again?

204
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,811
No, I'm a terrible waitress,
remember?

205
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:14,263
So, is there anything I can do

206
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:15,597
to help you with the move
tomorrow?

207
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,866
Now that you mention it,

208
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,985
I was thinking tomorrow
might not be great.

209
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:22,238
What's your excuse this time?

210
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,958
No excuse. It's just, you know,
I'm Jewish, and technically,

211
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,494
we're not supposed to drive or
carry anything on the Sabbath.

212
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:31,881
So this one's on God.

213
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,282
That might be
a little more convincing

214
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:36,268
if you didn't have a mouthful
of bacon cheeseburger.

215
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,455
My religion's kinda
loosey-goosey.

216
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,640
Basically, as long as you got
your schmekel clipped

217
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,743
and don't wear a cross,
you're good.

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,596
Howie, you promised you'd move.

219
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:48,848
And I will.

220
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,182
Yeah, right.

221
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,651
I will. I'm obviously not going
to live in my mother's house

222
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:55,321
for the rest of my life.
I'm not a child.

223
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:58,624
I've seen her burp you.

224
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,061
She did not burp me.

225
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:05,631
She was patting me on the back,
and I happened to burp.

226
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,319
Don't you have other tables
you should be waiting on?

227
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:13,422
Yeah, but I told you,
I'm not good at my job.

228
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:14,507
Bernadette,
listen to me.

229
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:15,624
He is never gonna leave.

230
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:17,626
I'm starting to think
you're right.

231
00:10:17,628 --> 00:10:19,295
All right,
I've had enough of this.

232
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:21,881
I'm a grown man,
I have a successful career.

233
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:24,433
For the love of God,
I've been to space!

234
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,051
I will move out when I'm ready,

235
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:28,387
and I don't need anyone
badgering me into it!

236
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:32,007
Wow, excuse me.

237
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,510
That was just for her benefit.

238
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,479
I'll move tomorrow. I love you.
Don't leave me.

239
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,185
Amy.

240
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,187
Amy.

241
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:47,573
Angry Amy.

242
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:49,792
What?

243
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:52,244
I've been thinking about
what happened,

244
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:54,497
and I hope this gift

245
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:56,582
will make things better.

246
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:01,637
<i>Star Trek</i> DVDs?

247
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,888
Why would I want this?

248
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,090
First of all, you're welcome.

249
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:08,043
Furthermore, not being familiar

250
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:09,478
with Wil Wheaton's body of work,

251
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,063
there was no way for you to know

252
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:12,932
you were being rude
to a national treasure.

253
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:17,703
Get ready for 130 hours
of "I told you so."

254
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,741
Fine.

255
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,394
I'll just tell you what happens.

256
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:28,397
Episode one,
"Encounter at Farpoint."

257
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,698
Fade in.

258
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,585
The new <i>Enterprise</i> heads out
on its maiden voyage

259
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:35,287
to contact the Bandi people
of Deneb IV.

260
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:38,374
Enter Wesley Crusher,
played by my buddy...

261
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,181
She's hooked.

262
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:57,943
Wow.

263
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,693
An end of an era.

264
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:04,715
Boy, if these walls could talk.

265
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:08,336
They'd say, "Why does he
touch himself so much?"

266
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,642
Yeah.

267
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:20,248
I can't believe I'm not going
to live here anymore.

268
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,601
This has always been my bedroom.

269
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:27,021
Right here is where my mom
used to mark my height.

270
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:28,722
Oh, yeah.

271
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:30,141
Fifth grade.

272
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:31,576
Sixth grade.

273
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:32,860
Seventh grade.

274
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:33,995
Eighth grade.

275
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:36,330
Ninth grade.

276
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,534
I remember when I was five,

277
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:43,538
hiding under this desk
with all my Halloween candy.

278
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,905
Had some Peanut M&M'S,

279
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:48,092
went into my first
anaphylactic shock

280
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:51,796
and had to be rushed
to the hospital.

281
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:53,798
Came home,
celebrated with a Snickers,

282
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,716
went into my second
anaphylactic shock.

283
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:59,887
When did you figure out
you were allergic to nuts?

284
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:02,056
Sometime
around the third Almond Joy.

285
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:04,425
Okay.

286
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,561
You want to start loading
this stuff into the truck?

287
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,262
Yeah, I guess.

288
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:10,498
Hey, would you do me a favor?

289
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,732
Go on ahead.

290
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:16,270
I just want one last moment
alone in my old room.

291
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,289
We're not standing outside
by the U-Haul

292
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,458
while you fondle yourself.

293
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,545
Fine, let's go.

294
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:32,336
Hey.

295
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:33,921
What brings you in?

296
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:35,640
Penny, if you wouldn't mind,

297
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:39,644
I'd like to have a conversation
about girls.

298
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:43,197
I had a feeling we'd have a
talk like this sooner or later.

299
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:48,302
Are you finally getting
fuzz in weird places?

300
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:49,803
Penny, please,

301
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:52,006
I'm on the horns
of a relationship dilemma.

302
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:54,325
And for the record,
I had a full pubis of hair

303
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,944
by the time I was 19.

304
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:59,163
And for the record...

305
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,784
So what are you drinking?

306
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:05,536
Well, it's been a rough day.

307
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:06,987
I usually go chamomile tea,

308
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:08,856
but I don't think
that's going to cut it.

309
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:12,076
You could have a
Long Island Iced Tea.

310
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,366
Will that calm my nerves?

311
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:21,969
It's calmed the pants
off me a couple of times.

312
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:23,621
Sold.

313
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:26,474
Oh.

314
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:29,877
So, the heart you got from
the wizard giving you trouble?

315
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,845
The trouble isn't with me,
Penny,

316
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,364
it's with your gender.

317
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:34,782
Someday,
scientists will discover

318
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,784
that second X chromosome
contains nothing

319
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:39,503
but nonsense and twaddle.

320
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,656
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

321
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,040
Look, just apologize.

322
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,659
It'll warm her twaddle.

323
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,878
It's a Band-Aid at best.

324
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,582
The core problem is that Amy
and Wil do not like each other.

325
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:55,336
Which is baffling because
they're both crazy about me.

326
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:57,705
And I like them,

327
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:59,840
which indicates
they're bright and interesting

328
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,426
and/or were on <i>Star Trek.</i>

329
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:05,546
Honey, you can't make
people like each other.

330
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:06,897
Not true.

331
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,599
Leonard made me like you.

332
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,569
And let me tell you,
that was a hard row to hoe.

333
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:15,022
Cheers, pal.

334
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,225
Ooh.

335
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:22,079
Boy, that is a treat
that's hard to beat.

336
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:26,567
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn,
I'm having a tea party.

337
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,841
You might want to pace yourself.

338
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:35,876
I drink tea all the time.

339
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:38,546
I think I know what I'm doing.

340
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:42,383
Far be it from me to criticize
a man with a full pubis.

341
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:46,754
Look, Sheldon, your problem
is not Wil Wheaton, okay?

342
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,539
Your problem is the way
you treated Amy.

343
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,776
My problem is I'm out of tea.

344
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:54,779
Come on, someone insulted

345
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:56,731
your girlfriend and
you just let him do it.

346
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,283
I thought you Texas guys
stood up for your womenfolk.

347
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:01,202
Penny, please,

348
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:04,388
I think I've evolved beyond
my simple rustic upbringing.

349
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,106
Sorry.

350
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:09,343
On the other hand, that low-down
polecat done wronged my woman.

351
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:14,915
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

352
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,669
Amy deserves better.

353
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:21,338
You know, when we buy
the Planter's deluxe mix,

354
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,892
she eats all the Brazil nuts
so I don't have to look at them.

355
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:29,830
She's a unique blend
of saint and squirrel.

356
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:31,632
Yeah, that she is.

357
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:32,616
Here you go.

358
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,518
I'm a callous egomaniac.

359
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,303
She's gonna leave me.

360
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,421
No, she won't.

361
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:39,640
No, she won't. I'm great.

362
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:52,953
Okay, I have now

363
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:55,506
officially moved
out of my mother's house.

364
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:57,541
You are now the only woman
in my life

365
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:59,810
who I'll see naked
in the bathroom.

366
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:02,129
I know this wasn't easy.

367
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:03,414
You doing okay?

368
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,998
Oh, I'm fine.

369
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,851
It's just her I'm worried about.

370
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:08,636
Aw, she'll be okay.

371
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:10,588
She's a grown woman.
I know.

372
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,673
It's just
ever since my dad left,

373
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:15,142
I've felt responsible for her.

374
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,728
That's a lot for a
kid to deal with.

375
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,831
She was just so sad
all the time.

376
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,068
Yeah, I was the only person
who could cheer her up.

377
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,470
Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

378
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:30,124
She's lucky you were there.

379
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,962
You know, she's why
I first got into magic.

380
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:36,714
I would do little shows
for her,

381
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:40,417
hang up a bedsheet
like it was a curtain,

382
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,753
put on a top hat and cape.

383
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:44,171
And part way through the act,

384
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:47,925
I would say I needed a volunteer
from the audience

385
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:50,711
to be my beautiful assistant

386
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:53,481
and invite her up on stage.

387
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:57,217
I can still remember
the way she'd smile.

388
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:59,904
For a few minutes,
she'd...

389
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,773
forget how lonely she was.

390
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,327
Aw, crap.

391
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,045
Let's go.

392
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:10,230
Where we going?

393
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:11,499
Grab a box.

394
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,334
We'll sleep
at your mother's place tonight.

395
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:15,186
No, but I want to live here.

396
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,570
Well, you should've
thought of that

397
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:19,423
before you told me
the stupid magic trick story.

398
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:21,926
Can't we talk about this?

399
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:25,546
No husband of mine is gonna
break his mother's heart!

400
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,922
Wil Wheaton!

401
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:37,925
Wil Wheaton!

402
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,077
Wait, how many was that?

403
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:43,898
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

404
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,651
Wouldn't you like to know?

405
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:49,119
Have you been drinking?

406
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:51,906
Just tea.

407
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:55,809
The best tea I've ever had.

408
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,795
Why are you here?

409
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:59,580
I'll tell you.

410
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,582
I'm from Texas.

411
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:05,286
Need I say more?

412
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:09,073
Yeah, actually, a little more
would be helpful.

413
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:10,808
You insulted my woman.

414
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,227
I'm here to defend her honor.

415
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,462
Two! It was two.

416
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:18,315
Wil Wheaton!

417
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,486
Now prepare yourself

418
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:25,656
for what may come.

419
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:29,159
Oh, Sheldon, do you really
think we're gonna fight?

420
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:30,911
My fists are not up here

421
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:34,782
because I'm milking a
giant invisible cow.

422
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,036
They're up to beat an
apology out of you.

423
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,188
Okay, I'm sorry.

424
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,959
Well, that was a long bus
ride for not very much.

425
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:47,127
Are you okay?

426
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:49,162
You're asking a lot of
questions, Wil Wheaton.

427
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,765
As a matter of
idle curiosity,

428
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,385
which of your
shrubberies do you feel

429
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,604
would benefit from
a thorough vomiting?

430
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:58,639
Never mind, I'll choose.

431
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,564
You were so good in <i>Stand by Me.</i>

432
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,517
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

433
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,221
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun with Flags.

434
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,791
Get ready
for a very special episode

435
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,426
where we explore the flags

436
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,994
of the popular
entertainment franchise,

437
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:31,975
<i>Star Trek.</i>

438
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:35,010
And to help us, I'm pleased
to introduce a special guest--

439
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,112
surprisingly,
it only took gas money

440
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:39,315
and the promise of free food
to get him here--

441
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,650
Mr. LeVar Burton.

442
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,354
Hey, Sheldon,
it's a pleasure to be here.

443
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,773
- Well, we've got some interesting flags for...
- Cut!

444
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:53,462
Yikes, this guy is worse
than Wil Wheaton.

445
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:58,100
I don't know what
she's talking about,

446
00:20:58,102 --> 00:21:00,202
but I'm obligated
to agree with her.

447
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:01,370
She's my girlfriend.

448
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,205
Ah, I hear you, brother.

449
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:06,541
I still get lunch, right?

450
