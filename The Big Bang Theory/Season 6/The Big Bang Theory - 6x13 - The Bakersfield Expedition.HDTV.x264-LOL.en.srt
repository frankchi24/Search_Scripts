1
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:04,074
Hey, will you steam
my uniform next?

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:05,047
Yeah, w...

3
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:06,330
Interesting.

4
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,948
Do you recall this conversation?

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,301
"Leonard, want to go halfsies
on a steamer?"

6
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:13,504
"No, Sheldon,
we don't need a steamer."

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,891
Looks like that rumpled
chicken's come home to roost.

8
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,126
Hi.

9
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:20,645
Here are the make-up sponges
you asked for.

10
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,914
Oh, thanks,
I thought I had more.

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,686
Damn, you've got
more makeup than I do.

12
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:31,606
You've got better makeup
than I do.

13
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:33,524
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

14
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,609
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:35,976
This is my Comic-Con makeup.

16
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,196
I love you,
but there are some things

17
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,081
a man doesn't share
with his girlfriend.

18
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,334
That's a wise policy.

19
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,985
I once borrowed
my sister's makeup

20
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,170
for a costume contest.

21
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:47,788
Got a terrible case of pinkeye.

22
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Yeah, but luckily,
I was going as a zombie.

23
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,676
I won second place.

24
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:54,795
I feel like you guys
just went to Comic-Con.

25
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:55,829
That was San Diego Comic-Con.

26
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,965
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

27
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,634
Is that better?

28
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:00,935
Well, it's a lot smaller.

29
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,019
It's more about
the comic books.

30
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,521
The way these
conventions used to be

31
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,356
before they went
all Hollywood.

32
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,309
So to answer your question,
no, it's not better.

33
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,728
Well, then why are you going?

34
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,630
It's a comic book convention.

35
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:14,982
You know, it's like pizza
or particle accelerators,

36
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:17,485
even the stinky one's
still pretty good.

37
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:18,703
All right.

38
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:19,704
Well, you guys have fun.

39
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:20,854
I guess I'll see you
Sunday night.

40
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,022
Yeah.
Okay.

41
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,524
Oh, hang on a second.

42
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:25,710
Hold this.

43
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,831
What was that for?

44
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,634
To show people
when they don't believe me.

55
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,263
Oh, this is the best.

56
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,098
You have booze
with breakfast on a Tuesday,

57
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,149
you got a problem.

58
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,652
You do it on the weekend,
you got brunch.

59
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:12,570
Sheldon doesn't believe
in brunch.

60
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,055
He can't stand being at a table

61
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:15,323
where one person's
having an omelet

62
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,609
and another person's
having a sandwich.

63
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:20,945
He's not exhausting at all.

64
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,032
Oh.

65
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,400
It's Leonard.

66
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,702
he says they're on the road
and headed for Bakersfield

67
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,120
at "warp speed."

68
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,905
Maybe it's the mimosa,

69
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:33,341
but I'm gonna give
the kid an LOL.

70
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,344
It's cute how excited they are.

71
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:37,545
You should have seen Howard

72
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,347
sewing his costume all week
for the convention.

73
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,299
When did Howard learn
to sew?

74
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:42,934
When he was a little boy,
every couple months,

75
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,853
he would have to let
his mom's pants out.

76
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:51,226
I don't even understand why
they go to these conventions.

77
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:53,478
I know. The four of them work
at a major university.

78
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,479
They're all super smart.

79
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,730
How can they still be
into something

80
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:57,232
made for 12-year-olds?

81
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,566
I don't mind it.

82
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,852
I think Howie's just in touch
with his inner child.

83
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,987
Although when he comes to bed
in his Batman pajamas,

84
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,825
sometimes it feels like
I'm touching his inner child.

85
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:10,912
It's probably because
they were bullied growing up.

86
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:12,664
In a world
where you can't fight back,

87
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,216
superheroes provide
meaningful wish-fulfillment.

88
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,553
Now I feel bad for picking
on all those kids.

89
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:20,004
Although, in my defense,

90
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,390
if Danny Biffle didn't want
to eat a mouthful of dirt,

91
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:26,311
he shouldn't have shown up
to school wearing a bow tie.

92
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,680
I've never even read
a comic book. You guys?

93
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:29,814
Uh-uh.
No.

94
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:30,849
I mean, it's such an important

95
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,816
part of their lives.

96
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:33,401
Maybe we should try
reading some.

97
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,820
Seriously?

98
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,239
The comic book store
isn't far from here.

99
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:40,608
That is an amazing idea.

100
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,912
Okay, how many of these
have I had?

101
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,618
I think you should turn
on the GPS.

102
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,253
It is on.

103
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:55,507
But the turn-by-turn
voice option isn't on.

104
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,791
I know I'd feel more safe

105
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:58,710
if you turn on the turn-by-turn
voice option.

106
00:03:58,712 --> 00:04:01,262
I love the turn-by-turn
voice option.

107
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:05,500
Has it really only
been ten miles?

108
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:08,136
I'm turning it on,
but just to shut you up.

109
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:13,024
Leonard, bear left and continue

110
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,310
on Interstate 210.

111
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:19,364
Ooh, sounds like that fellow
knows what he's talking about.

112
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:23,234
I'd put on my listening ears
if I were you.

113
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,852
What did you do?

114
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,738
I found a hack online.

115
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,573
I was able to upload
MP3 recordings

116
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,825
of my voice to your GPS.

117
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:31,910
That is so cool.

118
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,912
Counterpoint,
no, it's not.

119
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,581
Continue on Interstate 210

120
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,082
for five miles.

121
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:42,754
Here's an interesting fact
about interstates.

122
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:44,756
Really?

123
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:47,258
Shh,
he said it's interesting.

124
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,728
Interstates are numbered
as follows.

125
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,765
Even-numbered routes
run east and west,

126
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,267
odd-numbered routes

127
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,269
run north and south.

128
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:02,390
Three-digit route numbers
indicate bypasses

129
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:05,527
or spurs.

130
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:08,413
Look, Leonard,
there's a bridge.

131
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:09,747
Drive off it.

132
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:13,618
You know, we're not that far
from Vazquez Rocks.

133
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,955
Oh, they shot a lot
of <i>Star Trek</i> episodes out there.

134
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:19,123
We've got our costumes
in the trunk.

135
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,709
We could go there
and have a little photo shoot.

136
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,094
Great idea.

137
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:25,463
I haven't had a carbohydrate
in two weeks.

138
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,715
These cheekbones need
to be in front of a camera

139
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,884
before I eat a pretzel
and they're gone.

140
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:31,970
Yeah, that sounds fun.

141
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:33,221
Oh, smashing.

142
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,923
Now, Leonard,
do you know how to get there?

143
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:36,523
No.

144
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,727
Yeah, well luckily,
someone in the car does.

145
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,528
Recalculating.

146
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,531
While we're waiting,

147
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,067
do you know
which president signed

148
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,270
the Intestate Highway System Act
into law?

149
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:53,107
The answer,
coming up in 14 miles.

150
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,994
None of you will get it.

151
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,162
It's Eisenhower.

152
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,177
Why are they staring?

153
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:15,513
Who cares?

154
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:18,182
Just soak it in.

155
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:20,401
Hello, boys.

156
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:25,240
Oh, hey.

157
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,676
Could you please stop staring?
They're just girls.

158
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:32,413
It's nothing you haven't seen
in movies or in drawings.

159
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:35,700
Hey, Stuart.

160
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:36,701
Wh-What brings you guys here?

161
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,152
We were looking
for a recommendation

162
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:39,504
about comic books.

163
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:40,722
Oh, well, I recommend

164
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,957
you don't open a store
and sell them.

165
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,275
No, we were just wondering

166
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,927
why the guys like
this stuff so much,

167
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,629
so we thought we'd
give it a try.

168
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,714
Oh, okay. What do you think
you might be into?

169
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,266
Superhero, fantasy,
graphic novels, manga--

170
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:55,670
I swear
I will turn a hose on you.

171
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:01,943
What kind of comics
do the guys like?

172
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,578
Um, a litt bit of everything.

173
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,396
Mostly superhero stuff.

174
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,315
All right, well,
who's the best superhero?

175
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:08,499
Shh!

176
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,451
You can't ask a question
like that in here.

177
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,121
Are you trying
to start a rumble?

178
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,990
Well, what do you recommend?

179
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,358
Well, uh, let's see.

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,294
You've got your basic
clean-cut good guys--

181
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:21,079
Superman, Spider-Man,
Captain America.

182
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,982
Then you have
your darker anti-heroes--

183
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:26,617
your Batman, your Wolverine,
Punisher.

184
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:30,088
Ooh, I do love a bad boy.

185
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,975
As evidenced by your boyfriend
and his fear of hamsters.

186
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:38,763
If I were you,
I'd go for <i>Fables</i> number one.

187
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,214
The artwork
is sophisticated,

188
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:41,399
it's intelligently written,

189
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,401
and it doesn't objectify
or stereotype women.

190
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:44,602
Ooh, Thor!

191
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,238
He's hot.

192
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,824
Yeah, he kind of is.

193
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,497
And we're blending,

194
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,366
and we're blending,

195
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,251
and we're done.

196
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:06,457
I know Mr. Data
isn't supposed to smile,

197
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,043
but here it comes.

198
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,715
Come on, guys.

199
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,299
Let's do this.

200
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,603
Yeah, I'm sweating
my bald cap off.

201
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,559
So what's our first
pose going to be?

202
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,395
I say we begin with a classic
<i>Star Trek</i> fight scene.

203
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,313
I'll set the timer.

204
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,704
Sheldon,
how is that a fight pose?

205
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,741
Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.

206
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:41,376
I'm wielding it.

207
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,452
Phasers on the Borg!

208
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,723
<i>Charlie's Angels.</i>

209
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:00,762
Okay, what's next?

210
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:01,929
Now let's do

211
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,464
some sexy glamour shots.

212
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,632
I'll set the mood.

213
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,851
Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz...

214
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:10,521
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz,
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz...

215
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:13,408
oontz, oontz, oontz,
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz.

216
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,576
Yeah, nice one.

217
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,161
Oontz, oontz, oontz.

218
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:18,863
That's right.

219
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:19,864
Oontz, oontz, oontz.

220
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,450
Oh, my God.

221
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,285
Leonard,
someone's stealing your car!

222
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,487
What? Hey, hey!

223
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,122
Come back here!
Stop!

224
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:31,492
Stealing is against the law!

225
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:34,545
I don't believe this.

226
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,180
Son of a bitch.

227
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,832
I'll call 911.

228
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:38,933
Wha...

229
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:41,135
Oh, no, my phone is
in my other pants.

230
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,887
Oh, so is mine.
Mine, too.

231
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,472
Anybody got any ideas?

232
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:45,890
Nope.

233
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,559
The only thing left to
do now is assign blame.

234
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,728
Nice going.

235
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,274
What kind of a person steals
another person's car

236
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:03,742
in broad daylight?

237
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:06,328
What kind of person
leaves his keys in the car?

238
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,630
I thought we agreed this was
all Koothrappali's fault.

239
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:09,882
You're right.

240
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:12,301
Nice going.

241
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,119
Car.

242
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:22,544
What is wrong with people?

243
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:23,679
Why don't they stop?

244
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:25,147
Maybe we're better off.

245
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,933
What if we were to get in a car
with a crazy person?

246
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,601
Look at us, Sheldon.

247
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:31,153
We're the crazy people.

248
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,441
Well, perhaps we should
hold up a sign

249
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:40,662
that assures passing motorists
of our mental competence.

250
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:42,614
Good idea.

251
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,917
Why don't you
get started on that?

252
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:47,986
Come on,
let's just start walking.

253
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,372
There's got to be a gas station
or something nearby.

254
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,040
What, you think just
because you're wearing

255
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,343
a captain's uniform,
you're in charge?

256
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:56,428
Yes.

257
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,413
All right.

258
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:11,393
Hmm, okay, I'm done.

259
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:13,362
How did you guys
finish so fast?

260
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,447
I don't know,
there were a lot of pictures,

261
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,568
and one page only had
the word "brakkadoom!"

262
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,039
Yeah, well,
I have street smarts.

263
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,058
So, what'd you guys think?

264
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,211
Well, there was a lot of action,
Mmm.

265
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,496
and the story moved along
at a brisk pace.

266
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,415
It was, overall...

267
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,533
what's the word I'm looking for?

268
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:37,169
Stupid?
So stupid.

269
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,304
I don't know how
Leonard can get

270
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,422
so caught up in this.

271
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,723
It's crazy; they spend hours

272
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,875
arguing about things
that don't even exist.

273
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,510
What a waste of time.
I know.

274
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:48,080
A hammer so heavy that no
one else can pick it up?

275
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,733
I don't think it's heavy.

276
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,937
It's some sort of magic,
so only Thor can lift it.

277
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,072
That makes even less
sense, I mean...

278
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:01,660
No, no, no, it doesn't.

279
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:02,811
Thor is a god.

280
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,913
The hammer is his;
only he can use it.

281
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:08,083
It's like Sheldon
and his toothbrush.

282
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:11,753
Or his thin, beckoning lips.

283
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,540
Okay, hang on, what if
Thor's hand is on the hammer?

284
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,709
I mean, if he's touching it
with his god magic,

285
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,244
does that mean I could lift it?

286
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,964
No.
Yes.

287
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:24,032
Well, which is it?

288
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,435
Maybe we missed something.

289
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:27,552
Let's read it again.

290
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,821
Okay.
Yeah.

291
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,528
You want some tea?

292
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,529
Good idea.

293
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,481
I'll help you.

294
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,316
Wait, I thought we were reading.

295
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:42,618
We are.

296
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,455
We're just, uh,
giving you a head start.

297
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:57,633
I wish my mom was here.

298
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:01,953
We could all hang out
in her shadow.

299
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,139
Wool pants in the desert.

300
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:07,476
I feel like I've got
poached testicles.

301
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,646
Oh, you poor thing;

302
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:12,114
you're sweating.

303
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:14,933
That's so much worse than
having your car stolen.

304
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:17,002
Insurance is gonna buy you
a new car.

305
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,238
It's not gonna
de-funk my junk.

306
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,407
Gentlemen,

307
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,192
a little less bellyaching.

308
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,610
We're Starfleet officers

309
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,746
and a member
of the Borg Collective.

310
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,699
Please, Sheldon,
I am so not in the mood.

311
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:34,319
Leonard,
all our lives we have dreamed

312
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,587
of finding ourselves

313
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:38,423
inside one of
the fantasy worlds we love.

314
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,509
And look at us.

315
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,260
At this moment, we are, in fact,

316
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:44,429
a <i>Star Trek</i> landing party

317
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:48,066
stranded in an alien
and unforgiving environment,

318
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,936
relying only on our wits,
our fortitude

319
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,604
and our moxie.

320
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,006
As long as we have
those things,

321
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,342
- nothing can stop...
- Nerds!

322
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,233
I hate this planet.

323
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,657
It says right here
on the hammer,

324
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,293
"Whoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,

325
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,079
shall possess
the power of Thor."

326
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,797
Hold on,
who decides who's worthy?

327
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,165
Does the hammer decide?

328
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,500
Yes!
No!

329
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,669
It can't decide.

330
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,971
It's a hammer.

331
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,539
You said it's a magic hammer.

332
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,424
Yeah, it can't make decisions.

333
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:31,009
If Harry Potter's wand
can make decisions,

334
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,644
why can't Thor's hammer?

335
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,347
Okay, if you're going to start
comparing wands and hammers,

336
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:38,934
I can't even take you seriously.

337
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:58,370
Hello.

338
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,789
Hello.

339
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:05,127
Uh, four glasses
of water, please.

340
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,013
Anything for you guys?

341
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:10,515
Can I use your phone?

342
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,800
Our car got stolen.

343
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:14,553
Why don't you ask Scotty
to beam you up?

344
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:19,775
Scotty was on the
original series,

345
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:22,477
and we're <i>Next Generation.</i>

346
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:26,364
So... joke's on you.

347
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:32,154
We're not with him.

348
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,210
You can't pick something up
in outer space.

349
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:40,579
In space, there is no up.

350
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:44,115
Oh, yeah? Then how does
the sun come "up" every day?

351
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,453
Hard to argue with those kind
of street smarts.

352
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,560
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes
of comics across the hall.

353
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:56,845
Why don't we go look at those?

354
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:58,680
Oh, great! Yes!
And then you will see.

355
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,233
I am not wrong, because
if we were in outer space,

356
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:03,018
then anyone
could pick up the hammer

357
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,452
because it would be
floating around

358
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:05,737
in a weightless environment.

359
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,972
Yeah, that's right, the
slow reader used science.

360
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,391
Suck on that.

361
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:14,246
Was there anything
valuable in the car?

362
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:17,115
Our clothes,
our wallets, phones.

363
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,750
And about $300 worth of makeup,

364
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:22,070
so this thief could look like
anyone right now.

365
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:24,256
Makeup?

366
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,491
Sure.

367
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,929
Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con
in Bakersfield.

368
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,997
They have a big costume contest.

369
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,268
It's cooler than it sounds.

370
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,272
I don't know,
sounds pretty cool.

371
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,107
I-It is.

372
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,308
It's not just comic books.

373
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,893
They've got
action figures, toys,

374
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:46,611
a Tron-themed dance party...

375
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,230
Okay, he gets how cool it is.

376
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:51,149
I think I have all I need here.

377
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:52,850
You guys need me
to call someone?

378
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:55,853
I'm guessing your moms?

379
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,641
Thanks,
but we've got it covered.

380
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,860
Okay,
I just talked to my mom.

381
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,199
She arranged for us
to get a rental car.

382
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,367
Great.

383
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,002
We can still make it
to Comic-Con.

384
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,304
Are you kidding me?

385
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:14,506
After all we've been through,
I just want to go home.

386
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,873
Don't be like that.

387
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,225
Come on, Howard,
talk to him.

388
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,727
I'm with Leonard.

389
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:20,712
I'm done.

390
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,398
Fine, then I guess
it's two against two.

391
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,766
How do we decide?

392
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:28,687
Actually,
it's three against one.

393
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,054
What?!

394
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,189
What about the mission?

395
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,991
You said we were
a real-life landing party.

396
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,809
Yeah, well, we're not.

397
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,528
We're an imaginary landing party

398
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,080
who had real-life garbage
thrown at us

399
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:41,833
by real-life strangers
who think we're idiots.

400
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,369
And to tell you the truth,

401
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:46,671
I'm starting to feel like one.

402
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,240
I want to go home now.

403
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,543
Okay.

404
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:55,297
Did we at least rent the car
from Enterprise?

405
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:00,352
Get it? Enterprise?

406
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:04,255
Screw you. That's funny.

407
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,810
Well, what if the
Hulk picked up Thor

408
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:10,762
while Thor is
holding the hammer?

409
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:12,063
Yeah?

410
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:13,264
Then by the transitive property

411
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:16,401
of picking things up,
Hulk picked up the hammer.

412
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:18,570
No.

413
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:20,572
Hulk picked up Thor,
Thor picked up the hammer.

414
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:21,656
Okay, hang on.

415
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:23,625
If I go to a bar
and pick up a guy,

416
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,744
and he picks up a girl,
and then we all leave together,

417
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,779
did I pick up the girl?

418
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:34,619
Did that ever happen?

419
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,340
Hey, are we talking about me
or are we talking about Thor?

420
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:49,067
Well, I say that's the last time
we ever go outside.

421
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,352
Look, right here.

422
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:52,237
Red Hulk is picking
up Thor's hammer

423
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,688
'cause Thor's touching it.

424
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,157
No, it's because
they're in space.

425
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,642
He's really
just touching the strap.

426
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,811
The strap is part
of the hammer!

427
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:01,746
No, it's not!

428
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:04,816
Are they actually arguing
about comic books?

429
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,334
No, that can't be right.

430
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:08,203
Maybe "Thor's Hammer"

431
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:12,090
is a new color of nail polish.

432
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,758
Then Red Hulk must be worthy.

433
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
How could
Red Hulk be worthy?

434
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:18,046
You don't know his life!

435
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,502
There's only one
logical explanation.

436
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:26,638
Somewhere in the desert
we crossed

437
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,973
into an alternate dimension...

438
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:30,341
where the women in our lives

439
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:33,311
can finally appreciate
great literature.

440
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,881
If it's an
alternate dimension...

441
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:40,285
sounds like a job
for a landing party.

442
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,958
Captain,
what are your orders?

443
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,794
I say we investigate.

444
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:54,916
Wait.

445
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,087
They might be hostile.

446
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,040
Fine, but set them to stun.

447
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,375
If we vaporize Penny,

448
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,344
I'll never find a girlfriend
that pretty again.

449
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,393
<i>Fun fact:</i>

450
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:24,880
President Eisenhower signed
the Federal Aid Highway Act

451
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:27,483
from his hospital room.

452
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:30,629
Wow, that is interesting.

453
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:35,083
You learn something new
every day.

454
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,502
Say, can you
name the four state capitols

455
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,388
that are not served
by the interstate system?

456
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,042
Ooh, another quiz.
Yes!
