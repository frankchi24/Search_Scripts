1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,860
Oh,I always tear up when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,610
Tears seem appropriate.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,570
Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,150
is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,350
Fa-la-la,la-la-la, la,la,la...

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,210
You really didn't like it,Sheldon?

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,480
No,on the contrary.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,090
I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,270
And I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
and returned the presents and saved Christmas.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,600
What a buzz kill that was.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,850
When we watchFrosty the Snowman,he roots for the sun.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,890
Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,110
Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,750
A crime,by the way,for which he is never brought to account.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,590
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la,la-la.

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,740
I just love decorating the Christmas tree.

21
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,820
It makes me feel like a little girl again.

22
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,100
We didn't have a tree when I was growing up.

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,300
Really? Why not?

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,220
Mmm,in my family,

25
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,580
holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological

26
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,780
and psychological implications on human society.

27
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,080
Oh,sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?

28
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,600
Mmm,in a way. We presented papers.

29
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,690
And then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,110
Sheldon,what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,610
Oh,yes.

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,010
We had a tree,we had a manger,

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,580
we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

34
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,030
And to make things even more jolly,there were so many blinking lights on the house

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,020
they induced neighborhood-wide seizures.

36
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,580
So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.

37
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,000
I do not.But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home

38
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,720
I would request that you add this.

39
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,410
What is it?

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,480
You're kidding,right?

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,410
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,620
Oh,sure,sure. Very Christmasy.

43
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,350
Wait,excuse me, but it's much more "Christmasy" than anything you've put on the tree.

44
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,570
Here we go.

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,430
December 25,1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born.

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,040
Jesus,on the other hand, was actually born in the summer--

47
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,490
His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,320
that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

49
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,920
Which,frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother

50
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,060
followed by a fruitcake.

51
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,380
Merry Newton-mas,everyone.

52
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,040
I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.

53
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,460
No,it's fine. Look,Sir Issac can go right next to this little candy cane.

54
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,570
No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.

55
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,190
No,he doesn't.

56
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,040
I understand. You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus

57
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,240
and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.

58
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,880
Yeah,you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.

59
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,510
Well,perhaps when your mother gets here, she'll talk some sense into you.

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,020
What? Your-your mother's coming? When?

61
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,410
Tomorrow.

62
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,100
- When were you going to tell me? - tomorrow?

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,430
Why were you keeping this a secret?

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,540
- Well,I just-- I thought... - If I can interject here,

65
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,210
obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.

66
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,340
Why wouldn't she approve of me? I'm adorable.

67
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,200
- You are,it's just... - If I can interject again.

68
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,200
Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family,

69
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,480
who have all chosen high-achieving partners.

70
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,960
He probably feels that it's doubtful that

71
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,980
his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman

72
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,560
whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.

73
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,900
Hey,it's a big menu.

74
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,450
There's two pages just for desserts.

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,920
I know. And those specials-- they change every day.

76
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,570
Okay,you know what? It's lame when I say it.

77
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,760
- It's just ridiculous when you pile on. - Okay. Sorry.

78
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,410
So what did she say when you told her we were going out?

79
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,850
You didn't tell her we were going out,did you?

80
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,710
Why not?

81
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,650
Leonard...I'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down,

82
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,630
I believe the word is "Om."

83
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,300
It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.

84
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,070
No trouble at all.

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,550
I drove,Mother.

86
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,190
I'm driving now.

87
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,840
Yes,dear. Mommy's proud.

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,450
I've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.

89
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,940
My pleasure.For a non-physicist,

90
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,450
you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules

91
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,560
could not possibly form a Bose condensate.

92
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,630
Wait,wait,wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,310
August 16.

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,280
Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.

95
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,970
- Oh,did I thank you for the flowers? - You did.

96
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,430
I don't really like flowers.

97
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,290
- Neither do I,but it's the social convention. - It is,isn't it?

98
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,490
Wait,wait,wait. You had surgery?

99
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,290
Yes,and Sheldon sent me flowers.

100
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,230
- No,I heard that. - Then what was all that "wait,wait,wait" about?

101
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,570
I just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do.

102
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,210
Well,I would assume it's because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect,

103
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,750
while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,010
It's what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder.

105
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,870
We discussed it at length during our last video chat.

106
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,120
Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.

107
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,030
Yes,but we are on the subject, so I'm obliged to ask.

108
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,410
Leonard,how are you?

109
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,750
Fine,Mom. How are you?

110
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,100
Mmm,menopausal.

111
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,650
Now I'm less fine.

112
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,910
- Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged? - No.

113
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,500
Sheldon,why didn't you tell me?

114
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,690
My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.

115
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,270
She's a remarkable girl.

116
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,160
The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medalist.

117
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,350
- You must be very happy. - Why? I'm not marrying her.

118
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,430
So,how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?

119
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,650
Well,I'm not sure about interesting,but...

120
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,820
- Not the time,Sheldon. - Very well.

121
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,190
Shall we switch topics toIsaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

122
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
It's all right,Sheldon.

123
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,530
I will just pretend that Leonard's not withholding information.

124
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,790
Although, I will point out,Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist

125
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,560
and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics

126
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,690
that accompanied your learning to masturbate.

127
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,830
Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

128
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
How I envy you.

129
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,130
So,Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage

130
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,970
to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?

131
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,100
What? No.

132
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,380
Why not?

133
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,430
Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.

134
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,720
I see.

135
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,560
No,really. I have a girlfriend now.

136
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,160
And where is she this evening?

137
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,550
She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.

138
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,100
I see.

139
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,870
Her grandmother died.

140
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,910
Honest to God.

141
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
Leonard,tell her I have a girlfriend.

142
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

143
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,440
What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?

144
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,220
Tell her I have a girlfriend!

145
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,110
All right. He "has" a "girlfriend."

146
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,520
Her name is Bernadette.She's working as a waitress,

147
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,620
but she's going to school to be a microbiologist.

148
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,870
Howard,keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct,

149
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,720
the more you're hurting your partner.

150
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,420
Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?

151
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,130
Sorry I'm late.

152
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh,glad you're here. Uh,sit down. I'll get you a plate.

153
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,930
Mom,you rember Penny.

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,710
Oh,yes,the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues.

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,370
Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?

156
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,560
Well,he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas, so I'm going to say no.

157
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,480
If it helps,we're all good with your breasts.

158
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,150
Classic overcompensation.

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,720
Oh,speaking of fathers,Leonard, that reminds me, I'm divorcing your father.

160
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,390
- What? - Yes. He was cheating on me.

161
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,070
- No! - Yes,with some waitress from the university cafeteria.

162
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,610
Can you believe it? A waitress?

163
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,280
Oh,no offense,dear.

164
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,290
No,it sounded like a compliment.

165
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,760
When did this happen?

166
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,370
Mmm,well,let's see. Sheldon,when did I leave Leonard's father?

167
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,800
September 22.

168
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh,yes,that's right. The weekend after Leonard's dog died.

169
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,010
Mitzy's dead?

170
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,100
She was old and blind,Leonard.

171
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,610
What choice did we have?

172
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,130
I don't believe this. Why am I the last to know?

173
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,770
Excuse me,Leonard,I am the one who's getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead.

174
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,440
Why are you the one making a fuss?

175
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,390
You're right. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I'mwayout of line!

176
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,310
So,Penny,what's new in your life?

177
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,360
Nothing. Not a damn thing.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,260
Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.

179
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,830
Oh,it's not a problem.

180
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,820
I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable

181
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,430
and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.

182
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,500
No,you do not.

183
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,870
Your "check engine" light is on.

184
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,530
Yeah,I gotta put a sticker over that.

185
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,650
So,uh,you must be devastated about your divorce.

186
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,070
Oh,not at all.

187
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,340
But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that's not subjected to regular maintenance.

188
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,410
Come on,I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?

189
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,720
Well,initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger,

190
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,620
but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system

191
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,600
to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.

192
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,560
Sure,sure.

193
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,370
Thankfully,my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that

194
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,210
I haven't had intercourse with him in eight years.

195
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,590
Eight years?

196
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,010
Oh,that's nothing.

197
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,270
I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.

198
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,290
Yikes.

199
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,980
What's so funny?

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,430
That's exactly what I say during orgasms: "Yikes."

201
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,530
You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?

202
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,380
- Oh,I don't drink. - I do,I'll teach you.

203
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Leonard? Leonard? Leonard...

204
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,890
What is it?

205
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
I made tea.

206
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,300
I don't want tea.

207
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,700
I didn't make tea for you.

208
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,310
This is my tea.

209
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,700
Then why are you telling me?

210
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,100
It's a conversation starter.

211
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,000
That's a lousy conversation starter.

212
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh,is it? We're conversing. Checkmate.

213
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,040
What do you want,Sheldon?

214
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,060
What I want is to be departing the starshipEnterprise in a one-man shuttle craft

215
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,980
headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.

216
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,090
I want that too.

217
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,330
Why are you here?

218
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,670
To comfort you,of course.

219
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,750
No,that's not going to work at all.

220
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,450
I'll comfort you from over here.

221
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:33,270
Leonard,what you're experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis

222
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,490
in which the aging individual mourns the loss

223
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,890
of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.

224
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,810
Thank you, that's very comforting.

225
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,250
That's not the comforting part.

226
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,070
- It's not? - No,no.

227
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,090
The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling.

228
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,940
Weltschmerz.

229
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,340
It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is

230
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,860
to a hypothetical, idealized world.

231
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,650
You're right,I do feel better.

232
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,350
Well,the Germans have always been a comforting people.

233
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,460
Just rember,Leonard, where your biological family has failed you,

234
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,500
you always have me,your surrogate family.

235
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,570
You're my surrogate family?

236
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,520
If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either. Good night.

237
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,300
Okay,now this time try drinking it all at once.

238
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,760
Yikes.

239
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,560
I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003.

240
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,490
Another round for me and my homegirl.

241
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,210
I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.

242
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,190
As long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine.

243
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,990
Oh,that is fascinating.

244
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,020
I'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions.

245
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,830
For example, I'm seriously considering asking that busboy

246
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,810
to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake.

247
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,120
What do you think?

248
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,480
Well,we are known for our cheesecake.

249
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,260
- Hit us again. - Yes.

250
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,400
If a little is good, more must be better.

251
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,930
- Hey,Bev,guess what? - What?

252
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,130
I'm sleeping with your son.

253
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,210
Really? Which one?

254
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,250
The one from whom I live across the hall... from.

255
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,380
Well,that's convenient. How did his penis turn out?

256
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,210
Oh,Beverly,I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.

257
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,160
Oh,fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy's penis?

258
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,470
actually,I've only had the cheesecake.

259
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,050
One more time.

260
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,700
You know,Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.

261
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,590
Really?

262
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,070
Well,that means he's either embarrassed about the relationship

263
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,060
or he doesn't care enough about his mother to tell her he's in one.

264
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,480
Either way,one of us should be insulted.

265
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,110
Well,let's go find out who.

266
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,480
You go get a taxi. I'm gonna slip my business card into that busboy's back pocket,

267
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,760
cupping his firm,right buttock as I do so.

268
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,870
- Leonard...? - Sonny boy!

269
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,960
Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!

270
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,490
What the hell is going on?

271
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,420
You're in trouble.

272
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,270
Why didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl?

273
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,350
- Did I say that right? - Yeah,not bad,not bad.

274
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,550
Are you guys drunk?

275
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,120
Well,I hope so. Otherwise,why would we have stopped at Del Taco?

276
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,540
Now,how could you not tell me you were in a relationship

277
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,020
with this lovely, charming young woman?

278
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,890
- Oh,thank you. - You're welcome.

279
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,260
Is it because she's uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?

280
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,700
What the hell happened to "lovely and charming"?

281
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,950
How come you didn't tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce?

282
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,550
How come you didn't tell me you had surgery?

283
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,430
How come you didn't tell me my dog died?

284
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,650
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait...

285
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:03,620
What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.

286
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,190
I do.

287
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,130
There. It's late. Now,go to bed.

288
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.

289
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,230
That's the Del Taco.

290
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,720
Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?

291
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,060
Speaking of warm feelings-- come here.

292
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,590
No,I'd rather have the busboy.

293
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,720
Thank you for taking me to the airport.

294
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,970
You're very welcome.

295
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,700
Once again, I'm driving. I'm right here.

296
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,600
Please,I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval.

297
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,010
Sheldon,I do hope you'll forgive me for my inappropriate behavior last night.

298
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,890
I don't blame you. You were intoxicated.

299
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,980
Thank you.

300
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,910
I blame Penny.

301
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,560
I blame Penny,too. Bad Penny.

302
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,530
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?

303
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,770
What inappropriate behavior?

304
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,780
I think it's best that you not know.

305
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,150
- Agreed. - Agreed.

306
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,700
What the hell-- agreed.

307
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,460
And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.

308
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,650
- Oh,thank you,Beverly. - You're welcome.

309
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,890
She doesn't have much in the way of career prospects.

310
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,610
Don't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.

311
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,830
Mother,remember when I was complaining that you don't communicate with me enough?

312
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,640
- Yes,dear. - I'm over it.

313
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,910
