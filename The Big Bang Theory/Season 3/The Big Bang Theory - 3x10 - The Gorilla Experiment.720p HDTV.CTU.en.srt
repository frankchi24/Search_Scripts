1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,700
Hey, Leonard, check this out.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,230
Leonard, she's doing it again.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,460
I think it upsets Sheldon

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,860
when you play with the food.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,300
No.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,300
It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,830
from the containers without regard

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,200
for its equitable distribution.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,230
This is essentially why you have famine in India.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,960
You want me to put it back?

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,560
Leonard.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,500
It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,930
What's up, my nerdizzles?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,260
Raj, Sheldon,

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,200
I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,300
Hello. Leonard, Penny,

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
you know my girlfriend Bernadette.

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,360
Yeah. Hey.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,630
Bernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.

20
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,160
I don't think I can.

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,860
I don't have Howard's street cred.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
I hope it's all right-

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,300
I told my girlfriend Bernadette

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,830
she could join us for dinner.

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,830
Sure. The more, the merrier.

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,960
Wa- no, that's a false equivalency.

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,500
More does not equal merry.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,960
If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now,

29
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,960
would we be celebrating?

30
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,560
No, we'd be suffocating.

31
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,730
Sheldon...

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,760
Don't "Sheldon" me.

33
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,100
We ordered for five people, not six.

34
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,630
Oh, come on, it's fine.

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,060
We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.

36
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,430
Oh, sure. And while we're at it,

37
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,200
why don't we put our hands behind our backs,

38
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,660
have an old-fashioned eating contest?

39
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,060
Relax, it'll be fine.

40
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,130
Sit down, you guys.

41
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,600
No! No! No!

42
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,500
What?!

43
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,260
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

44
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,200
Why not?

45
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,760
That's where Sheldon sits.

46
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,300
He can't sit somewhere else?

47
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,460
No, no, no- you see, in the winter,

48
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,830
that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm,

49
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,260
yet not so close that he sweats.

50
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,260
In the summer, it's directly in the path of

51
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,630
a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there.

52
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,630
It faces the television

53
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,960
at an angle that isn't direct,

54
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,430
so he can still talk to everybody,

55
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,200
yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.

56
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,500
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,560
Ooh, I love your shoes.

58
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh, thanks.

59
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,760
They are cute, aren't they?

60
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,660
Where'd you get them? Shoes for Less.

61
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,100
I've been meaning to go over there.

62
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,300
Oh, great selection, great prices.

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,330
My mother was right. Hell is real.

64
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,500
Come on, Sheldon.

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
Let the womenfolk chat.

66
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,300
Womenfolk?

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,730
Gals?

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,860
Chicks?

69
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,960
Utero-Americans?

70
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,230
Just eat your dinner.

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,960
Don't take him too seriously.

72
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,730
A lot of what he says is intended as humor.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.

74
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,660
Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,600
Howard, never let her go.

76
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,460
So, Leonard, Howard says you're working on

77
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,160
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

78
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,200
I am.

79
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,730
Are you interested in physics?

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,100
Oh, I find it fascinating.

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,530
If I hadn't gone into microbiology,

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,260
I probably would have gone into physics.

83
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,200
Or ice dancing.

84
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,360
Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm

85
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,860
quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point.

86
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,360
Right now, we're testing the phase shift

87
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,760
due to an electric potential.

88
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,900
That's amazing.

89
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,160
SHELDON Yes.

90
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,000
Leonard's work is nearly as amazing

91
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,230
as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.

92
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,660
While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"

93
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.

94
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,530
Are you going to try

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,800
to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?

96
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,900
Yes, I am.

97
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,930
You want to see a simulation on my laptop?

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,460
Oh, yeah, show me.

99
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,830
In microbiology, the most exciting thing

100
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,060
I get to work with is yeast.

101
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,900
Howard?

102
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,930
Yeah?

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,630
Your shoes are delightful.

104
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,360
Where did you get them?

105
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,260
What?

106
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,600
Bazinga. I don't care.

107
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,100
Ha! Eat my dust,

108
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
racially stereotypical plumber.

109
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,830
That's not fair.

110
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,560
I got stuck behind a tree.

111
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,460
And a cow and a penguin.

112
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,400
Face it, dude,

113
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,900
whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car,

114
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,200
you can't drive.

115
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,960
Just need a little more practice.

116
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,430
What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie

117
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,930
who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.

118
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,000
Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?

119
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,630
It's not about shoes, is it?

120
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,800
I don't think I could go through that again.

121
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,300
It's not about shoes.

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,560
Then speak.

123
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,300
Um, actually, can we do it in private?

124
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,130
All right.

125
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,660
Go away.

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,100
I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.

127
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,230
Thanks, Raj.

128
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,030
Okay, so here's the thing:

129
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,660
I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?

130
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,400
A little physics?

131
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,800
There's no such thing.

132
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,800
Physics encompasses the entire universe,

133
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,400
from quantum particles to supernovas,

134
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,660
from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.

135
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,660
Yeah, okay, cool.

136
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,900
I don't need the PBS special.

137
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,330
I just want to know enough

138
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,430
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

139
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,860
You know, like Bernadette does.

140
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,460
Why can't Leonard teach you?

141
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,000
'Cause I want to surprise him.

142
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,100
Can't you surprise him in some other way?

143
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,100
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,330
if you cleaned your apartment.

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.

146
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,130
Penny,

147
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,530
this would be a massive undertaking,

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,360
and my time is both limited and valuable.

149
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,900
You're sitting here playing video games all day.

150
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,460
Okay, point.

151
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,800
What sort of foundation do you have?

152
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,230
Did you take any science classes in school?

153
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,400
Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

154
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,230
The one with the frogs.

155
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,630
Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool.

156
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,730
A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,330
I'm sorry, Penny.

158
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,700
I don't think so.

159
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,860
Oh, come on!

160
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,660
A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge.

161
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,160
You can make it like an experiment.

162
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,560
Interesting.

163
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,900
I suppose if someone could teach sign language

164
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,830
to KoKo the gorilla...

165
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,260
I could teach you some rudimentary physics.

166
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,260
Great!

167
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,500
It's a little insulting, but great.

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,500
I'll be KoKo.

169
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,700
Not likely.

170
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,630
KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words,

171
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,330
not one of which had anything to do with shoes.

172
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
Hey, fellas.

173
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,030
This is my girlfriend Bernadette.

174
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,760
My girlfriend Bernadette.

175
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,230
Who are all those people?

176
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,400
Have no idea.

177
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,430
Hey, Leonard.

178
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,860
Hi. Hey, look,

179
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,530
it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.

180
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,030
Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.

181
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,600
He doesn't mean salt mines.

182
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,260
He means where he works.

183
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,760
Yeah, no, I got it.

184
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,530
So, how's your experiment going?

185
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,860
Ah, terrific.

186
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,260
We're getting the electron accelerator set up.

187
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,200
We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.

188
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,160
Boy, I'd love to see that.

189
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,300
You're welcome to come.

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,460
Really? Oh, that'd be great.

191
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,260
How exciting is that?

192
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,160
Like Hanukkah in July.

193
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,230
Do they have that?

194
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,730
No.

195
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,030
Oh.

196
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,660
You got me again.

197
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,100
This isn't non-fat yogurt.

198
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,800
This is fatty fat fat.

199
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,130
Excuse me.

200
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,460
Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?

201
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,460
Sure. Thanks, honey.

202
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,860
All right, what is your deal?

203
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,230
Excuse me?

204
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,500
Inviting my girlfriend

205
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,960
to come see your electron accelerator?

206
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,630
Yeah? So?

207
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,230
Wow!

208
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,430
You really are a piece of work.

209
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,560
It's not enough

210
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,430
you get the prom queen, you have to get

211
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,600
the head of the decorating committee, too?

212
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,700
What are you talking about?

213
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,460
Don't play innocent with me.

214
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,930
I practically invented

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,430
using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

216
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
Has it ever worked?

217
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,560
Not so far, but that's not the point!

218
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,760
Howard, relax.

219
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,500
I'm not interested in your girlfriend.

220
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,760
I hope not.

221
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,830
Because you don't want to mess with me.

222
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm crazy.

223
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,060
I believe you.

224
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,800
Research journal, entry one.

225
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm about to embark on one of

226
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,730
the great challenges of my scientific career:

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,430
teaching Penny physics.

228
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,830
I'm calling it Project Gorilla.

229
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,730
Hey, Sheldon.

230
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,400
Come in. Take a seat.

231
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,830
Subject has arrived.

232
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,160
I've extended a friendly casual greeting.

233
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,760
Ready to get started?

234
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,030
One moment.

235
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,700
Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic.

236
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Apparently, ignorance is bliss.

237
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,660
All right, let us begin.

238
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,330
Where's your notebook?

239
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Um, I don't have one.

240
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,900
How are you going to take notes without a notebook?

241
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,800
I have to take notes?

242
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,100
How else are you gonna study for the tests?

243
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,460
There's gonna be a test?

244
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,960
Test-sss.

245
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,430
Here.

246
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,560
It's college-ruled.

247
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,300
I hope that's not too intimidating.

248
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,360
Thank you.

249
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,360
You're welcome.

250
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,260
Now, Introduction to Physics.

251
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,130
What is physics?

252
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,130
Physics comes from the ancient Greek word "physika. "

253
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,530
It's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes.

254
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,860
"Physika" means the science of natural things.

255
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,000
And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.

256
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,630
Ancient Greece?! Hush.

257
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,630
If you have questions,

258
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
raise your hand.

259
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,460
It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC.

260
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,530
You've finished your shopping at the local market, or agora...

261
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,400
...and you look up at the night sky.

262
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,100
There you notice some of the stars seem to move,

263
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,730
so you name them "planetes," or "wanderer. "

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,930
Yes, Penny?

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Um, does this have anything to do

266
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,160
with Leonard's work?

267
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,600
This is the beginning of a 2,600-year journey

268
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,560
we're going to take together

269
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,830
from the ancient Greeks

270
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,400
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr

271
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,100
to Erwin Schrodinger

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,700
to the Dutch researchers

273
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

274
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,360
2,600 years?

275
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,560
Yeah, give or take.

276
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,960
As I was saying, it's a warm summer evening

277
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,500
in ancient Greece...

278
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,360
Yes, Penny?

279
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,200
I have to go to the bathroom.

280
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,460
Can't you hold it?

281
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,130
Not for 2,600 years.

282
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,130
Project Gorilla, entry two.

283
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
I am exhausted.

284
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,260
Howard? Huh?

285
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,930
It unhooks in the front.

286
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,530
Oh, that explains a lot.

287
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,160
Howard, I'm home!

288
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,330
Of course.

289
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,130
Senior fitness was cancelled.

290
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,230
It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike.

291
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,030
I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.

292
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,400
That's great, Ma!

293
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,160
What's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man

294
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,900
with half his chin scraped off?!

295
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,460
I guess I should go.

296
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,830
No, no, don't move.

297
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,930
Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?

298
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Lamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.

299
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,660
Please?

300
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,700
I got a real hankering.

301
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,760
Oh, I can't say no to my little tushy face.

302
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,900
I'll be back soon.

303
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
Thanks, Ma.

304
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,230
Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?

305
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,560
Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!

306
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,530
You're right! When you're right, you're right!

307
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,760
What if they're out of the Le Seur?

308
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,830
Then get the regular!

309
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,200
All right! You don't have to yell!

310
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,930
Sorry about that.

311
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,130
Let me just put that on vibrate.

312
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,630
I'm already on vibrate.

313
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,430
You know, that one I got.

314
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,430
Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?

315
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,830
Uh, what do you mean?

316
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,960
He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow

317
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,760
it might weird you out.

318
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,500
Really? He said that?

319
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,500
You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?

320
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,630
Me? No.

321
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,060
I may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate

322
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,860
to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment

323
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,530
without first discussing it with said man.

324
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,960
Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?

325
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,900
I didn't say anything like that.

326
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
I said Leonard has to ask my permission.

327
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,830
Come on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother.

328
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,930
Damn, I was this close on the bra.

329
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,230
Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong

330
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,600
and force was not necessary to maintain motion.

331
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,730
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared

332
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,660
as "A" and we get

333
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,330
force- Earth gravity- equals mass times 9.8 meters

334
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,060
per second per second.

335
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,560
So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"

336
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,300
and what do we know from this?

337
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,860
Uh, we know that...

338
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,500
...Newton was a really smart cookie.

339
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,030
Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

340
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,060
No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts.

341
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,730
Don't write that down! Sorry.

342
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,300
Now, if "ma" equals "mg," what does that imply?

343
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,460
I don't know.

344
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,030
How can you not know?

345
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,660
I just told you.

346
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,130
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?

347
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,060
Hey! You don't have to be so mean!

348
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,560
I'm sorry.

349
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,760
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?

350
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,130
No, you just suck at teaching. Really?

351
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,830
Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?

352
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,660
Oh, God...

353
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,730
Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,

354
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,130
but you're going too fast.

355
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,230
Can you just back up a little bit?

356
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,600
All right.

357
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,060
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...

358
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,730
Not that far back!

359
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,330
Okay!

360
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,500
At what point did you begin to feel lost?

361
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,660
I don't know.

362
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,630
Where were we looking up at the night sky?

363
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,900
Greece. Damn it!

364
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,100
There's no need to get frustrated.

365
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,860
People learn at different rates.

366
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,100
Unlike objects

367
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,730
falling in a vacuum, which...?

368
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,700
"ma" equals "mg"...?

369
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,900
Squared?

370
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,300
No.

371
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,760
Aristotle?

372
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,260
No.

373
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,330
Five?

374
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,200
Oh!

375
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,960
Then I don't know.

376
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,300
Why are you crying?

377
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,800
Because I'm stupid!

378
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,060
That's no reason to cry.

379
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,730
One cries because one is sad.

380
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,100
For example, I cry because others are stupid

381
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,130
and it makes me sad.

382
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,600
Okay, look, can we just please forget about

383
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,460
all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?

384
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,060
All right.

385
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,700
Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles

386
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,160
move the way they do.

387
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,900
Really? That's it?

388
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,760
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.

389
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,030
It's not.

390
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,200
That's why Leonard does it.

391
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay, I just have one question.

392
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,560
What exactly are sub-atomic particles?

393
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,500
A good question.

394
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,600
Thank you.

395
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,400
And to answer it, we first must

396
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,800
ask ourselves: "What is physics?"

397
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,060
Oh, balls.

398
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,560
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...

399
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,530
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

400
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,000
What did I do now?

401
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,660
I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.

402
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,760
What?!

403
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,530
We were completely naked, about to devour each other when,

404
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,100
you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.

405
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,400
You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.

406
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,360
Yeah, but that's not what you tell her.

407
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,960
What was I supposed to tell her?

408
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,060
I don't know; something that doesn't make me come off

409
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,530
as a petty, jealous douche.

410
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,760
And what would that be?

411
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,930
Come on, do I have to think of everything?

412
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Hey, Leonard.

413
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,860
Am I too late to see the experiment?

414
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,360
Oh, hi. Hi.

415
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,600
What are you doing here?

416
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,560
Same thing you're doing here.

417
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,600
I came to see Leonard's experiment.

418
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,930
No, you didn't.

419
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,660
You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.

420
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,060
You told her my experiment was stupid?

421
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,430
I was just repeating what Sheldon said.

422
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,300
Let's not get off topic.

423
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,730
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

424
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,400
I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.

425
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,760
Should I, um, leave you two alone?

426
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,260
No, Leonard, you should hear this.

427
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,230
Okay, good, 'cause I wasn't really gonna go.

428
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,560
Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but...

429
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,800
the truth is I'm not.

430
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,800
We're shocked.

431
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,000
Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.

432
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,300
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

433
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
But I now realize how foolish that is.

434
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,930
He had a panic attack once

435
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,160
when he got his head stuck in a sweater.

436
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,430
It was a full turtleneck.

437
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,530
Why aren't you helping me?

438
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,160
I don't know.

439
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,160
Maybe because I'm... crazy?!

440
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,460
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.

441
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,130
What do you think, Leonard?

442
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Should I give him another chance?

443
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,360
It's up to you.

444
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,200
He didn't call your experiment stupid.

445
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,560
Come here, tushy face.

446
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,130
"Tushy face. "

447
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,860
Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.

448
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,460
The interference pattern was so cool

449
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,100
when the electron beam was on.

450
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,530
Glad you enjoyed it.

451
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,560
Most people aren't that interested in what I do.

452
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,900
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

453
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,200
In fact, recently I've been thinking that

454
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,460
given the parameters of your experiment,

455
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,360
the transport of electrons through the aperture

456
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,630
of the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different

457
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,730
than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands.

458
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,360
Their observed phase shift

459
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,400
in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring

460
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,960
already conclusively demonstrated

461
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,000
the electric analogue

462
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,600
of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect.

463
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,860
That's it. That's all I know.

464
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,300
Oh, wait...!

465
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,060
Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts,

466
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,430
not the scientist.
