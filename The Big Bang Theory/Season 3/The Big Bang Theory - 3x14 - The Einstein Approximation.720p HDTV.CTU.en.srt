1
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,315
Whatcha doing?

2
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:19,050
I'm attempting to view my work
as a fleeting peripheral image

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,923
so as to engage the superior
colliculus of my brain.

4
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:26,598
Interesting.

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,437
I usually just have coffee.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,978
You've been up all night?

7
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:31,834
Is it morning?

8
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:32,562
Yes.

9
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:33,955
Then I've been up all night.

10
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,480
And you're stuck?

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,921
Why else would a person
try to engage

12
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,482
their superior colliculus?

13
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:46,104
Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help
you till I've had my coffee.

14
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:55,808
Penny, I told you if you don't
put him in his crate at night

15
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,401
he just runs around
the apartment.

16
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:03,482
What is he doing now?

17
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:06,250
LEONARD: Hmm, he's
either isolating the terms

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,746
of his formula and examining
them individually,

19
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:10,826
or...

20
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,047
looking for the alligator
that swallowed his hand

21
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,507
after Peter Pan cut it off.

22
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,674
Captain Hook's hand was eaten
by a crocodile,

23
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:19,849
not an alligator.

24
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:23,972
If you're going to mock me, at
least get your facts straight.

25
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:26,015
Aye, aye, Captain.

26
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,702
I can't see it!

27
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:31,351
It just won't coalesce.

28
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:32,932
Maybe you need
a fresh start.

29
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,471
You're right.

30
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:46,466
(tires squealing
and car horns honking)

31
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:48,923
It's a great idea, Leonard.
Thank you.

32
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:53,962
Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state

33
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:57,707
Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait!

34
00:01:57,707 --> 00:01:59,140
The Earth began to cool

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,184
The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools

36
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:04,047
We built the Wall
We built the pyramids

37
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,991
Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery

38
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,888
That all started
with a big bang

39
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:10,869
<i>Bang!</i>

40
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,444
Electrons move
through graphene...

41
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:23,899
act as if they
have no mass...

42
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,632
How long has
he been stuck?

43
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,621
Hmm, Intellectually about 30 hours.

44
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,813
Emotionally about 29 years.

45
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,975
Unit cell contains
two carbon atoms...

46
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:38,038
Interior angle
of a hexagon is 120 degrees.

47
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,724
Have you tried
rebooting him?

48
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:46,181
(chuckles)

49
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,838
(laughing)

50
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:50,014
Nah, I think it's
a firmware problem.

51
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,087
Hey, it's Disco Night
at the Moonlight Roller Rink

52
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,199
in Glendale tonight.

53
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,656
Who's up for getting down?

54
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:58,726
That's perfect.

55
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:01,871
Bernadette's been hocking me
to take her roller skating.

56
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,295
I think Penny likes to skate.

57
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,527
The four of us could double.

58
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:05,870
What could be better?
We're in.

59
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:09,650
Great. It's not like I brought
it up because I wanted to go.

60
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:13,754
You can come with us.

61
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,280
No, it's okay.
I don't have to go.

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,906
I'm happy just to guide
you and your ladies

63
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,404
to suitable
entertainment choices.

64
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:21,589
I'm a walking brown Yelp.com.

65
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:26,092
Structure, constant
structure. One atom...

66
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,710
Boy, he's really gone,
isn't he?

67
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,197
Yeah, this morning he used
a stick of butter as deodorant.

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,800
I thought I smelled popcorn.

69
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,023
Pattern is the same
as fermions...

70
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:40,993
Travels on
the pathways...

71
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:42,771
Hexagonal...
It's always hexagonal...

72
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:45,125
I haven't seen him this stuck
since he tried to figure out

73
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,291
<i>the third Matrix movie.</i>

74
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:49,318
(gasps)

75
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,303
Hey, those are my lima beans!

76
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:54,166
Not lima beans, carbon atoms.

77
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:56,601
But if I don't eat
my lima beans,

78
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,562
I can't have my cookie.

79
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:00,719
Here, you want my peas?

80
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,568
The peas- perfect.

81
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:02,926
They can be electrons.

82
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:04,846
Want my corn?

83
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,900
Don't be ridiculous.

84
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,692
What would I do with corn?

85
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,236
So roller skating
- should we all grab a bite to eat first?

86
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,539
Good. P.F. Chang's?
My mon has coupons

87
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,079
Great.

88
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,660
Your mom's not
coming, right?

89
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:22,157
Not this time, I promise.

90
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,913
Okay, just to be clear,
roller skating was my idea,

91
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:28,242
and I'm very unhappy that you
turned it into a double date,

92
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:29,815
and I hope you both fall
on your asses

93
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,965
and break your coccyxes.

94
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,528
The plural of coccyx
is coccyges.

95
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,338
Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.

96
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,412
Have you ever
been so embarrassed?

98
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,424
Not recently.

99
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,111
I don't know
which was lamer:

100
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,326
their roller-skating
or their disco dancing.

101
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:51,966
For me, the worst part

102
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,024
was when people
saw us leave with them.

103
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,253
You had some nice moves
out there, Howard.

104
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,106
Thanks. You, too.
Yeah.

105
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,042
Did you notice all the
people looking at us?

106
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:07,044
Not really. I was
in my boogie zone.

107
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,008
When Howard tried
to do the splits...

108
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:12,021
Shh.

109
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:14,382
Sorry. I'm moving
a little slow.

110
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,275
I think I bruised
my coccyx.

111
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:17,866
Oh, poor baby.

112
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,419
Don't tell Koothrappali.

113
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:21,157
After you.

114
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:22,832
Oh, what a gentleman.

115
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,708
Hey, Sheldon.

116
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,957
(screams) LEONARD: Oh, my God!

117
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:28,214
Are you...

118
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:29,103
SHELDON:
Good Lord!

119
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:30,583
You're ruining everything!

120
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:31,984
Oh, damn.

121
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:32,757
Are you okay?

122
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,068
Do I look okay?

123
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,778
Don't bark at me.
I fell, too.

124
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:38,225
Oh, you've been falling
all night. You're used to it.

125
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,092
Sheldon, what the
hell are you doing?

126
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,774
The same thing I've been doing
for three days.

127
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:45,349
Trying to figure out
why electrons

128
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,883
behave as if they have no mass

129
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:48,735
when traveling
through a graphene sheet.

130
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:49,854
With marbles?

131
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,023
Well, I needed something bigger

132
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:53,016
than peas, now, didn't I?

133
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,912
Sheldon, when was the last time
you got any sleep?

134
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:58,297
I don't know- two, three days.

135
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:58,960
Not important.

136
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,528
I don't need sleep.
I need answers.

137
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:03,132
I need to determine where

138
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:06,044
in this swamp
of unbalanced formulas

139
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:07,979
squatteth the toad of truth.

140
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,921
Toad of truth?

141
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,123
Is that a physics thing?

142
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,394
No, that's a
crazy thing.

143
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:17,669
Okay, Sheldon.

144
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,433
What happens
to our neuroreceptors

145
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:23,032
when we don't get
enough REM sleep?

146
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:27,816
They lose their sensitivity
to serotonin and norepinephrine.

147
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,231
Which leads to...?

148
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:31,928
Impaired cognitive function.

149
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,483
Right, so march in there,
brush your teeth and go to bed.

150
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:39,330
But I don't want to go to bed.

151
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,566
I'm going to count
to three. One...

152
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:44,888
Oh, all right.

153
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:51,853
That was amazing
how you handled him.

154
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:53,925
I know how to deal
with stubborn children.

155
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:57,180
My mother used to run an illegal
day care center in our basement.

156
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:06,575
(evil laughter)

157
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:14,097
Leonard, you're... you're
giggling in your sleep.

158
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,002
It's not me.

159
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,359
It's my new ringtone.

160
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,385
<i>The Joker from Batman.</i>

161
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,731
Well, it creeps me out.

162
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:24,097
Me, too, but I paid
three bucks for it.

163
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:26,440
Just answer the phone.

164
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,435
(sighs)

165
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,596
Hello.

166
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,274
Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

167
00:07:37,835 --> 00:07:40,569
Yeah, yeah, he's my roommate.

168
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,571
Oh, God, is he okay?

169
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:47,298
Yeah, all-all right.
I'll be right there.

170
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,906
What happened?

171
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:51,735
Sheldon's escaped
and is terrorizing the village.

172
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:56,750
Okay. Have fun.

173
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,866
Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.

174
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,244
Where is he?
Ball pit.

175
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:08,414
Thanks for not
calling the cops.

176
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:09,734
Oh, hey, it's
no big deal.

177
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,224
My sister's got a kid
who's special.

178
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:16,726
Yeah, well,
he's extra special.

179
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,893
Hey, Shelly.

180
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:21,547
Whatcha doin'?

181
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:23,524
Size ratio was all wrong.

182
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:24,573
Couldn't visualize it.

183
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,796
Needed bigger carbon atoms.

184
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,050
Sure, sure.

185
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:33,381
How did you get
into this place?

186
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:35,608
Back door has a five-pin
tumbler system,

187
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:38,611
single-circuit alarm.
Child's play.

188
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,913
You can start sorting protons
and neutrons

189
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,201
while I build carbon atoms.

190
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,324
No, I don't think so.

191
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,747
We need to go home now.

192
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,291
But I'm still working.

193
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:51,003
If you don't come out of there,

194
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:52,921
I'm going to have
to drag you out.

195
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,200
You can try,
but you'll never catch me.

196
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,651
For God's sakes.

197
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:10,064
Sheldon, come here!

198
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:11,230
Bazinga.

199
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:14,973
Bazinga.

200
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,048
Bazinga.

201
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,363
Bazinga

202
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,014
Bazinga

203
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:33,952
<i>(whispering):
Leonard and Penny.</i>

204
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:42,635
Leonard and Penny.
(screams)

205
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:37,028
What?
What, what, what?

206
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,019
Leonard and Penny.

207
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:45,889
What?

208
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,290
I have good news.
LEONARD: And you had

209
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,958
to barge in here
and wake us up

210
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,909
in the middle
of the night?

211
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,910
Your cell phone was off.

212
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,486
Because we didn't want
to be disturbed.

213
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,413
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

214
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,904
Sheldon, what
do you want?

215
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:02,881
I came to tell you
I've got the answer.

216
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,047
Really?

217
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,166
You figured out
the graphene problem?

218
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,286
No, no, I'm still
hopelessly stuck on that,

219
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:12,494
but I figured out
how to figure it out.

220
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,247
Okay, you know what,
Leonard, I know I said

221
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,787
I could handle your roommate,
but I was wrong.

222
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,380
We're going to
have to break up.

223
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,140
What are you
talking about?

224
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,422
(clears throat)
Oh. (sighs)

225
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,095
Einstein.

226
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,360
Yeah, I'm going to need
a little more.

227
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,482
Albert Einstein.

228
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,047
Keep going.

229
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,263
When Albert Einstein came up
with special relativity,

230
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,574
he was working at
the patent office.

231
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,933
So, you're going to go work
at the patent office?

232
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,551
Don't be absurd.

233
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:45,968
That's in Washington.

234
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:47,958
You know I could never live
in a city whose streets

235
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,135
are laid out in a
wheel-and-spoke pattern.

236
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:51,992
No. I'm going to find

237
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:53,902
a similarly menial job

238
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,845
where my basal ganglia are
occupied with a routine task,

239
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,561
freeing my prefrontal cortex

240
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,963
to work quietly in the
background on my problem.

241
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:03,227
Sounds like a great plan.

242
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,363
Of course it is.

243
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,658
Even talking to you is

244
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:06,796
sufficiently menial
that I can feel

245
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,930
the proverbial juices
starting to flow.

246
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,977
Okay, well, thanks
for sharing with us.

247
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:14,282
Good night.
You're welcome.

248
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,731
And good night to you, too.

249
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:16,378
(sighs)

250
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:19,760
Oh, by the way, I was
watching you sleep for a moment,

251
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,090
and I noticed that your snoring

252
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,976
seems to be worse
when you're on your back.

253
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,096
Leonard doesn't snore.

254
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,363
No, I wasn't talking to Leonard.

255
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:31,708
I told you.

256
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:37,346
So, Mr. Cooper, you're
looking for a job.

257
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,470
A menial job.

258
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:41,833
Like yours.

259
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,331
Why, thank you for noticing.

260
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,854
I'm "Menial Employee
of the Month."

261
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,592
Do you have
a particular field in mind?

262
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:54,794
I do.

263
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,532
For thousands of years,

264
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,540
the lowest classes
of the human race

265
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,475
have spent their lives laboring
to erect monuments

266
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,956
under the lash of their betters,

267
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:03,810
until finally,

268
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,851
they dropped down

269
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:08,762
and became one with the dust
through which they trudged.

270
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,780
Do you have anything like that?

271
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,945
No.

272
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:17,610
Shouldn't you check
your database?

273
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,905
No.

274
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:29,322
You didn't really type?

275
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:29,472
I didn't really have to.

276
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:31,860
So, how about
construction?

277
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,177
Oh, that would be good!

278
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:37,650
Sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail

279
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,505
as my working-class
fellows and I

280
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,268
high above the metropolis.

281
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:47,111
No, no. This is
putting up sheetrock

282
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,342
at a housing project
in Rosemead.

283
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:51,652
I could do that.

284
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:53,084
Good.
One question.

285
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,876
Yes?
What's sheetrock?

286
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:57,642
Moving on.

287
00:12:59,139 --> 00:12:59,782
How about

288
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,584
doing deliveries for a florist?

289
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,267
That seems acceptable.

290
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,912
Do you have your own car?
I don't drive.

291
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:08,668
Of course you don't.

292
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:12,637
Mr. Cooper, let me
just ask you a question.

293
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:14,215
What was your last job?

294
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:17,034
Senior theoretical
particle physicist at CalTech,

295
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:20,545
focusing on M theory, or, in
layman's terms, string theory.

296
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:22,847
I see.

297
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:25,486
Just give me a second.

298
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,090
Security!

299
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:38,847
Okay, I'll get those drinks
started for you.

300
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,611
Behind you.

301
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:45,138
Sheldon, what the hell
are you doing?

302
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,980
I'm trying to get
these tables cleared.

303
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,998
We're slammed.

304
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:50,636
No, wait, wait,
no, wait.

305
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,138
<i>Wh-What are you
doing here?</i>

306
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:53,995
A reasonable question.

307
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:57,071
I asked myself, what is
the most mind-numbing,

308
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,989
pedestrian job conceivable,

309
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:00,681
and three answers came to mind:

310
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:03,574
uh, toll booth attendant,
Apple Store genius...

311
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,211
...and what Penny does.

312
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:08,435
Now...

313
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,178
since I don't like

314
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,598
touching other people's coins,

315
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,380
and I refuse to contribute

316
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,611
to the devaluation
of the word "genius,"

317
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,282
here I am.

318
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,150
You just, you just walked in
and they hired you,

319
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,048
just like that?

320
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:23,431
Oh, heavens, no.

321
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:26,565
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

322
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,185
I simply came in,
picked up a tray,

323
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:30,686
and started
"working for the man."

324
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:33,195
Let me get that plate
out of your way.

325
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:33,975
Sheldon,

326
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,321
this is ridiculous.

327
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:35,955
Is it?

328
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,188
Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany

329
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:40,477
regarding the polymer
degradation phenomenon

330
00:14:40,477 --> 00:14:42,509
while scraping
congealed nachos off a plate.

331
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,834
Bernadette, table 10
wants their check.

332
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:46,724
Thanks, Sheldon.

333
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:47,492
Sheldon,

334
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:48,830
wait, this isn't even what I do.

335
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,523
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

336
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:53,034
You're right.
That is more menial.

337
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:56,926
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.

338
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:59,876
I don't recommend the salmon.

339
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:01,338
I saw it in the kitchen.

340
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,407
Now...All right,
one bacon cheeseburger,

341
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,678
breaking two Jewish dietary
restrictions simultaneously-

342
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,128
kudos.

343
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,408
Beer-battered
fish and chips.

344
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:18,476
Now, here's your
tartar sauce.

345
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:19,699
I also brought you salsa.

346
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,810
It's a little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it.

347
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,520
It's zingy.

348
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,407
And for you, Factory
Burrito Grande-

349
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:28,979
no cheese,
no sour cream,

350
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,691
no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.

351
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,673
Bon appétit.

352
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,127
Hang on.

353
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,608
Black beans, not pinto beans?

354
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:39,281
Yes.

355
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:40,442
Double guacamole?
Of course.

356
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,669
No cilantro?
Nope.

357
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,199
Lettuce shredded,
not chopped? Yep.

358
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,575
You understand
why I'm doing this to you?

359
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:47,253
I do.
That'll be all.

360
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:50,735
That was fun.

361
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,869
(laughter)

362
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:54,920
How long can he keep this up?

363
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,689
I heard about this
professor at MIT

364
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,034
who melted down,
bought a van,

365
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:00,692
and spent the rest of his life
as a mobile dog groomer.

366
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,387
He never went back
to the university?

367
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:05,594
Only to shampoo Professor
Shamburg's shih tzu.

368
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,874
Sheesh.

369
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:14,447
I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.

370
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:15,438
But he's afraid of dogs.

371
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:18,144
Yeah, that's the only thing
wrong with that plan.

372
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,446
Hey, guys, sorry you had
to wait, but we are swamped.

373
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:24,624
What's this?

374
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:26,175
Sheldon took our order.

375
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,466
Sheldon doesn't work here.

376
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,466
Well, honey, not to complain,

377
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,536
but we were starting
to think you didn't either.

378
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:36,265
(crashing)

379
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:38,876
Is that really necessary?

380
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,079
Good Lord.

381
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,862
The interference pattern
in the fracture.

382
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,976
The motion
of the wave

383
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:49,318
through the molecular structure.

384
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:51,198
I've been looking
at it all wrong.

385
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,711
I can't consider
the electrons as particles.

386
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:56,629
They move through the graphene
as a wave.

387
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,948
<b>It's a wave!</b>

388
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,000
The moment to applaud
would be now.

389
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,536
Troglodytes.

390
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,270
Sheldon... where are you going?

391
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,388
Aren't you going
to clean this up?

392
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,364
I'm sorry. I don't work here.

393
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:30,319
Happy now?
I'm on a cloud.

394
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:32,736
Swing me.

395
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:59,767
Sheldon, come here.

396
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:01,103
Bazinga.

397
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,029
Bazinga.

398
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:14,913
Bazinga.

399
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,126
Bazinga.

400
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:22,980
Bazinga!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
