1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,240
How much time do we have?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,740
Uh,t-minus five hours, 37
minutes to onset of meteor shower.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,900
Okay,our position is 34. 48
degrees north, 118.31 west.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,790
That means the azimuth should be...

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,670
168. 22 degrees relative to magnetic
north with an elevation of 49.93.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,400
Anything yet?

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,640
Uh,we have a signal, but
there's no frame lock.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,940
Hang on. How about... Now?

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,600
We did it. We have the
west coast feed of hbo.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,180
Ooh,real sex.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,920
Big deal. Every time I watch that show,
it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,130
All right,let's see what's
on the east coast feed.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,850
Dune.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,510
Not a great movie, but look
at that beautiful desert.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,260
Too bad sheldon couldn't come with us.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,570
Yeah,it's just not the same without him.

17
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,960
Oh,this sucks. I'm
switching back toreal sex.

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,910
Sheldon's log.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,760
Stardate 63345.3

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,300
While my colleagues are off
observing the leonid meteor shower,

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,230
I have remained behind to complete my paper on
the decays of highly excited massive string states.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,650
Although my research is going well, I do
Miss the warmth of human companionship.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,800
And good evening to you, siam
palace. This is sheldon cooper.

27
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,470
Yeah,I'm going to be dining alone this
evening, so i'll be reducing my usual order.

28
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,180
I'd like to start with one quarter
of the assorted appetizers plate and,

29
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,940
uh,one half of the
golden treasure for two.

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,470
Oh,for heaven's sake.In
the mid-18th century,

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,720
king rama iv of siam
divided a huge empire

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,130
amongst the colonial powers of europe
in order to preserve his throne.

33
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,600
Surely,you, his cultural descendant,
can handle pad thai and dumplings.

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,430
Sheldon,help!

35
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,640
I need to go-But you keep in mind that
my sharply worded comments on yelp.Com

36
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,460
recently took down a local muffin store.

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,270
- Penny. Penny. Penny.
- Come in! Hurry!

38
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,650
- Penny?
- I'm back here.

39
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,120
Penny. Penny. Penny.

40
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,870
Oh,for god's sakes, i'm in the bathroom!

41
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,810
Shall I come back at a better time?

42
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,120
Get in here! Hurry!

43
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,180
Don't you dare knock!

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,210
Hello.

45
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,600
I slipped in the shower, and I
think I dislocated my shoulder.

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,480
Not surprising.

47
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,400
You have no safety mat or adhesive
stickers to allow for purchase on a surface

48
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,050
with a low coefficient
of static friction.

49
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,970
What?

50
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,150
Tubs are slippery.

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,070
I know. I slipped.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
I have a series of whimsical duck
stickers on the bottom of my tub.

53
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,830
Yeah,okay,whatever. Will you just
turn the water off and help me up?

54
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,570
They're holding umbrellas.

55
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,010
- What?
- The ducks in my tub.

56
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,580
They're whimsical because ducks have neither
a need for, nor the ability to use, umbrellas.

57
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,330
Oh,my god. I got to go
to the emergency room.

58
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,120
Well,assuming you're correct that your right
humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket,

59
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,700
I would certainly think so.

60
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,880
- Okay,can you drive me?
- I don't drive.

61
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,950
Well,I can't drive!

62
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,480
Well,it seems we've reached an impasse.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
I could call you a cab or an ambulance.

64
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,380
No,no,no. I can't wait that
long. You got to help me,please.

65
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,230
All right. Let it never be said that sheldon lee
cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,220
No one's saying that. Let's go.

67
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,900
Well,it does seem rather ironic that
for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks,

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,270
we both might die in a fiery car crash.

69
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,280
I wish penny didn't have
to work. She loves camping.

70
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,890
Yeah,that would have been great.

71
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,310
You and penny having sex in the tent while I
sit out here and watch howard hump a cactus.

72
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,400
Okay,the best I can tell, there
are eight other campsites nearby.

73
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,390
Mostly science nerds like
us, but just over yon ridge

74
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,330
are two not unattractive middle school
teachers who reek of desperation.

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,070
Wonderful. How old are they?

76
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,100
I don't know. 50,55.

77
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,320
Oh,menopause.

78
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,010
Nature's birth control.

79
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,220
Come on. You guys can't be that hard up.

80
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,360
- I am.
- Yeah,me,too.

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,230
Look-they gave me homemade cookies.

82
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,100
Of course,they did. That's
what grandmothers do.

83
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,800
So,what are we waiting for?

84
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,010
Relax. I said we'd stop by a little
later after they have their nap.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,080
Good idea. They'll be refreshed.

86
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,450
- Cookie?
- Thank you.

87
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,460
- Not bad.
- Yeah,very tasty.

88
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,260
Well,so tell me more
about these teachers.

89
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,470
Not much to tell.

90
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,970
They had a vw microbus and were
wearing tie-dyed grateful dead t-shirts.

91
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,310
Good cookies.

92
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,610
I see no organizational
system in here whatsoever.

93
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,320
Which panties do you wear on mondays?

94
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,060
I don't need panties. I
just need shorts and a shirt.

95
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,380
My mother always told me one should wear
clean underpants in case one is in an accident.

96
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,370
One was already in an accident.

97
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,170
That doesn't mean one won't be in
another, especially if I'm driving.

98
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,850
- Clothes,sheldon. I need clothes!
- Okay. Here.

99
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,750
Seriously? Those shorts with that top?

100
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,250
All right.

101
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,670
No.

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,110
No.

103
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,900
Oh,that's cute.

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,140
We should have you
checked for a concussion.

105
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,370
Okay. Now,you got to
help me put these on.

106
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,630
- All right.
- But don't look.

107
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,430
- Don't look?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

108
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,310
Well,that's understandable.

109
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,440
You may be interested to know
that a prohibition against looking

110
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,730
is well established in heroic mythology.

111
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,090
Uh,lot and his wife, perseus and
medusa, orpheus and eurydice...

112
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,340
- Yeah,great.
- They always look. It never ends well.

113
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,480
Okay. Now you got help me
get my arm into the sleeve.

114
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,680
Okay.

115
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,130
Is that my arm?

116
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,910
It doesn't feel like an arm.

117
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,960
Then,maybe you should let it go.

118
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,190
All righty.

119
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,260
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,390
Up above the world so high.

121
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,360
Like little diamonds in the sky.

122
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,120
That's beautiful,dude.

123
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,610
You should... You should write
that down before someone steals it.

124
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,630
So,when do the meteors get here?

125
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,640
The meteors don't get here. The
earth is moving into their path.

126
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,480
I can feel it.

127
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,730
I can feel the earth moving.

128
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,120
It's moving too fast. Raj,slow it down.

129
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,100
Okay,how's that?

130
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,420
Better. Thanks.

131
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,950
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

132
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,970
What's so funny?

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,850
It's your american accent.
Everything you say sounds stupid.

134
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,120
"stars are pretty,aren't they?"

135
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,470
For the record,I should let you know this is
my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.

136
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,400
You have your learner's permit,right?

137
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,480
Yes,and I have logged a considerable
number of hours on a simulator.

138
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,880
- Good.
- Didn't work out well.

139
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,180
- All right,can we please go?
- One moment.

140
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,270
According to my driver's ed book,
the side mirror is properly adjusted

141
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,100
when a portion of the driver's door handle
is visible in the lower right corner.

142
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,010
There's the handle. Oh,no,too
far. Bringing it back.

143
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,100
Optimized.

144
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,410
Now,where is the switch to
adjust the passenger side mirror?

145
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,300
It's right there.

146
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,220
Where is the passenger side mirror?

147
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,350
In a parking lot in hollywood.
Now,can we please go?

148
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,520
Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat.

149
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,590
Whee!

150
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,810
Oh,dear. I'm going to
have to start again.

151
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,590
if I could speak the language of rabbits, they
would be amazed, and I would be their king.

152
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,820
I hate my name.

153
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,000
It has "nerd" in it.

154
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,640
Len-nerd.

155
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,220
I lost my virginity to my cousin jeanie.

156
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,360
I would be kind to my rabbit subjects.

157
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,270
At first.

158
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,180
You know what's a cool name? Angelo.

159
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,050
That has angel and jell-o in it.

160
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,640
It was my uncle murray's funeral.

161
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,170
We were all back at my
aunt barbara's house.

162
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,800
Our eyes locked over
the pickled herring.

163
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,570
We never meant for it to happen.

164
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,270
One day,I hold a great ball
for the president of france,

165
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,500
but the rabbits-They
hate me and don't come.

166
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,040
I am embarrassed,so I eat all the
lettuce in the world and make them watch.

167
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,630
People could call me angie.

168
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,910
Yo,angie,how's it goin'?

169
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,180
To this day,I can't look at pickled
herring without being aroused and ashamed.

170
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,220
Cousin jeanie.

171
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,730
Could you please drive a little faster?

172
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,900
Oh,I think we're going
sufficiently fast.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,570
- What's that?
- Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.

174
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,060
It can't be nothing. The
check engine light is on.

175
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,860
- We need to find a service station.
- No. The light has been on since I bought the car.

176
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,880
All the more reason to consult
with a mechanic before it explodes.

177
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,630
It's not going to
explode. Just keep driving.

178
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,530
Warp speed ahead,Mr. Spock.

179
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,190
Mr. Spock did not pilot theenterprise.

180
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,800
He was the science officer,

181
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,190
and I guarantee you that if he ever saw
theenterprise's check engine light blinking,

182
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,960
he would pull the ship over immediately.

183
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,600
Oh,god,I'm gonna lose the arm.

184
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,740
Oh,well,red light.Release accelerator

185
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,560
and slowly apply... The... Brake.

186
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,540
Nailed it.

187
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,810
- While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?
- What?

188
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,430
Why do you have the chinese character
for soup tattooed on your right buttock?

189
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,120
It's not soup. It's courage.

190
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,990
No,it isn't.

191
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,520
But I suppose it does take courage to
demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.

192
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,860
How did you see it? You
said you wouldn't look.

193
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,270
Sorry. As I told you,the
hero always peeks.

194
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,370
- Anything?
- No. That was the last pudding cup.

195
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,560
No! What about slim jims?

196
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,030
That's what he used to
eat his pudding,remember?

197
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,480
Right. That was so good!

198
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,920
Sweety and meaty at the same time.

199
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,890
Wait. Wait,wait. So you're
saying we're out of food?

200
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,720
The only thing in here
are blue ice packs.

201
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,840
I know they're poison, but they
look like big, yummy otter pops.

202
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,760
Oh,god,I am so hungry.

203
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,140
Me,too.

204
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,900
Check and see if we
have any more pudding.

205
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,790
Okay.

206
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,430
All right,there's no need to bark at me.

207
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,760
According to the inexplicably
irritable nurse behind the desk,

208
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,260
you'll be seen after the man who
claims to be having a heart attack,

209
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,210
but appears to be well enough to
play doodle jump on his iphone.

210
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,400
We have to fill these out.

211
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,150
"describe illness or injury."

212
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,410
I dislocated my shoulder.

213
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,680
All right. And how
did the accident occur?

214
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,220
You already know that.

215
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,180
"cause of accident."

216
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,040
"lack of adhesive ducks."

217
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,180
Okay,medical history.

218
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,940
- "have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
- No.

219
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,720
- Kidney disease?
- No.

220
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,260
- Migraines?
- Getting one.

221
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,900
- "are you currently pregnant?"
- No.

222
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,890
Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.

223
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,600
Change migraine to yes.

224
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,920
- "when was your last menstrual period?"
- Next question.

225
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,970
I'll put,"in progress."

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,490
Okay,moving to psychiatric disorders.

227
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,970
"list all major behavioral diagnoses,
"e.g.Depression, anxiety,etcetera."

228
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,330
Oh,my god,what the hell does this
have to do with my stupid shoulder?

229
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,640
"episodes of sub psychotic rage."

230
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,970
- Ass.
- "possible tourette's."

231
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,740
All right. "moles,lesions
or other skin conditions."

232
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,950
"soup tattoo on right buttock."

233
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,940
Hey,sheldon, sheldon,look, I
am scared and in a lot of pain.

234
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,320
Could you please take a break from being
you for just a minute and try being--

235
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,590
I don't know-Comforting?

236
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,940
I'm sorry. There,there.

237
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,160
Everything's going to be fine.

238
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,890
Sheldon's here.

239
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,390
Thanks. That's much better.

240
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,250
Oh,I'm so hungry!

241
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,540
Will you shut up? We're all hungry.

242
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,160
Okay,our objective is the boy
scout campsite to the east.

243
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,380
Easy target. Big doughy scout
master, couple of cubs,mostly webelos.

244
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,330
What kind of score we looking at?

245
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,660
Hot dogs,buns,s'mores. I
mean,it's a freaking 7-11.

246
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,800
All right, everyone grab flashlights.

247
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,810
Oh,my god,could it be? Yes!

248
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,700
My mother put an "i love
you" brisket in my backpack.

249
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,750
Quick,get forks.

250
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,030
You don't need forks. It's so
tender, it falls apart in your hands.

251
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,090
He's right.

252
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,320
I feel like we're forgetting
something important.

253
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,100
Me,too. But what?

254
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,150
Maybe a tupperware bowl of
roasted potatoes and carrots?

255
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,210
Yes! Yes!

256
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,590
Now remember,you were given powerful
pain medication and a muscle relaxer,

257
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,010
so,uh,don't operate heavy machinery.

258
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,160
Try not to choke on your own drool.

259
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,660
Wait. You have to help me get into bed.

260
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,560
Sheldon has to get me into bed.

261
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,680
Bet you never thought i'd say that.

262
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,990
Yes.

263
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,110
The charm of your drug-addled
candor knows no bounds.

264
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,820
You know,people think you're this weird
robot man who's so annoying all the time,

265
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,810
and you totally are.

266
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,920
But then it's like that
movie wall-eat the end.

267
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:15,850
You're so full of love, and you can save a plant
and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.

268
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,980
That's a fairly labored metaphor, but
I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

269
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,440
Sing "soft kitty" to me.

270
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,370
"soft kitty" is for when
you're sick. You're not sick.

271
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,880
Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.

272
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:50,670
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

273
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,390
Wait,wait. Let's sing it
as a round. I'll start.

274
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,870
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

275
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,050
So,that's where you
come in. I'll start over.

276
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,880
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

277
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,490
I've got all night,sheldon.

278
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:27,820
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

279
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:35,080
Happy kitty, sleepy
kitty,purr,purr,purr purr,purr,purr.

280
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,960
And the next morning when he woke
up, he rolled over and realized...

281
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,200
Duh-duh-duh!

282
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,440
She was his cousin.

283
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,380
That's still not funny.

284
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,870
That's still not funny.

285
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,200
And she was my second cousin.

286
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,090
And she was my second cousin.

287
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,660
You're a real douche.

288
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Who cares? You slept with your cousin.

289
