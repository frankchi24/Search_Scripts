1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,001
Sheldon, you’re wrong.

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:06,008
Wolverine was not born
with bone claws.

3
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:07,519
Howard, you know me to be
a very smart man.

4
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:11,528
Don’t you think
if I were wrong, I’d know it?

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,541
Okay, first of all...
Give it up, dude.

6
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,049
You’re arguing
with a crazy person.

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,559
I’m not crazy.

8
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:19,064
My mother had me tested.

9
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:22,577
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,585
What do you mean?
It’s new comic book night.

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,593
Yeah, but since you and Penny
finally hooked up, we thought

12
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:30,101
you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-yum night.

13
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:33,115
There’s more to life
than sex, Raj.

14
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,126
Okay, who had "Leonard
flames out with Penny

15
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:37,133
- in less than 24 hours"?
- I did.

16
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,143
Nothing flamed out.

17
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,149
We don’t have to have sex
every night, you know.

18
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:45,159
You don’t have to,
but it’s highly recommended.

19
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:47,173
Yeah, take advantage
of that window of opportunity

20
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,684
before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

21
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:52,695
It’s not a matter
of opportunity.

22
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,702
We’re getting to know
each other.

23
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,708
There’s a learning curve.

24
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:56,714
What’s there to learn?

25
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:58,218
You get naked, do nasty
things to each other,

26
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:00,224
then somebody makes
scrambled eggs and salami.

27
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,231
Easy peasy.

28
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,736
Perhaps what Leonard

29
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,241
is obliquely referring to

30
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,749
is the occurrence of some sort
of sexual dysfunction.

31
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:10,259
Okay, who had
"Leonard gets a floppy disk"?

32
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,772
Oh, a clever--
albeit obsolete, euphemism

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,282
for insufficient blood flow
to the male sex organ.

34
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,792
(chuckles)

35
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,801
Nothing like that happened,
all right?

36
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,809
The sex was... just fine.

37
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,817
Just fine?

38
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:27,827
Oh, dude, the fourth Harry
Potter movie was "just fine."

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,842
I’m not saying it was bad.

40
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:32,850
I’m just saying it...
wasn’t great.

41
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:33,859
Okay, when you say
"it wasn’t great,"

42
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:34,863
do you mean for both of you?

43
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,870
Because we can totally see
it not being great for her.

44
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:38,878
Am I right?
Oh, yeah.

45
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,384
To tell you the truth,
I think we were both a little--

46
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,392
I don’t know...

47
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,897
Disappointed? Let down?

48
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:45,904
Ashamed? Horrified?
Repulsed?

49
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,413
All I know is, it wasn’t the wa
y I dreamed it would be.

50
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:53,928
(scoffs)
Sex is never the way
Idream it’s gonna be.

51
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,953
Because in your dreams
you’re a horse from the waist down.

52
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:02,467
Excuse me,
Wolverine: Origin.

53
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,979
Miniseries issue two, page 22.

54
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:07,489
Retractable bone claws.

55
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,998
If you people spent less time
thinking about sex

56
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,006
and more time concentrating
on comic books,

57
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,014
we’d have far fewer of these
embarrassing moments.

58
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:20,033
# Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state #

59
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:23,546
# Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! #

60
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,059
# The Earth began to cool #

61
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:28,066
# The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools #

62
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,077
# We built the Wall #
# We built the pyramids #

63
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,087
# Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery #

64
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,596
# That all started
with a big bang #

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,602
# Bang! #

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,002
BBT S03E02 "Jiminy Conjecture"
by Mikhel

67
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,601
Sheldon, dinner’s here.

68
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,606
SHELDON:
Tandoori Palace?

69
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,111
No, we went somewhere new.

70
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:53,125
You’re good-naturedly
ribbing me, aren’t you?

71
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,632
No, look, Mumbai Palace.

72
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:56,637
Why?

73
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,640
Why would we change?

74
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,146
We had a perfectly good palace.

75
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:03,151
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

76
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:04,657
Trust me, this will be
just fine.

77
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,661
(scoffs)

78
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:06,663
You are the authority

79
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:09,668
on "just fine."
(snickering)

80
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,675
What’s that supposed to mean?

81
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:13,680
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:15,686
"Not bad, but not great."

83
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:16,690
(stifled chuckles)

84
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,697
What are they talking about?

85
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,202
I don’t know
I know.

86
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,205
As I’m sure
you’re aware...
Duh-duh-duh-duh

87
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,210
duh-duh.

88
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:26,714
If that’s Morse code,
that’s terrible.

89
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:29,724
As I was saying,
you and Leonard had

90
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,228
sexual encounter. a disap
pointing

91
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:32,232
Earlier this evening,

92
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,235
Leonard characterized it
as "just fine."

93
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,741
So what you’re seeing
here is a continuation

94
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:38,245
of the mocking that followed.

95
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:41,757
Okay, yeah, well,

96
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,761
I’m just gonna go
eat my dinner elsewhere.

97
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,766
Maybe an airplane
headed for a mountainside.

98
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:48,774
Penny, wait.

99
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:50,279
Aah!

100
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:52,783
What is wrong with you?

101
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:53,789
(door slams)

102
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:59,800
I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

103
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,309
Yeah, you...
No, don’t tell him
.

104
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:05,316
Let’s see if he can
figure it out.

105
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,835
Ugh, I am so embarrassed!

106
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,341
Please don’t be mad.

107
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,344
What did you tell them?

108
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:17,348
Nothing bad, just that
last night was fine.

109
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:19,855
Fine? You said it was fine?

110
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,862
Yeah, it’s a perfectly
good word.

111
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,867
You put it in front
of "wine" or "dining,"

112
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,373
and you’ve really got something
.

113
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:32,388
Okay, well, let me ask you this:

114
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:34,395
How was last night for you?

115
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,902
It was... okay.

116
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,910
Okay?

117
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,416
Yeah, it’s a perfectly
good word.

118
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,422
I mean, you put it
in front of "dokay"

119
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:46,427
and you really got something.

120
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:49,437
All right, look,
let’s not overreact, you know?

121
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,940
For a lot of couples,
it takes time

122
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,444
to get to know
each other’s rhythms.

123
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,449
Learn what the other person
wants and likes.

124
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:56,454
So, you’ve been
through this before?

125
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:57,958
No.

126
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,467
Okay-dokay.

127
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:05,477
You know, I think this is
one of those things where

128
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:06,982
talking about it is not
going to make it better.

129
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:07,986
Want a glass of wine?

130
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,491
So much.
Okay.

131
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,497
See, we should’ve
done this last night.

132
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,503
You know, have a little wine,
take the edge off.

133
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:18,010
Actually, ethyl alcohol
inhibits electrical conduction

134
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:21,017
in the nerve cells and
stimulates reuptake receptors

135
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:26,027
of inhibitory neurotransmitters
like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

136
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:31,045
Don’t talk, just drink.

137
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,057
No, you’re misunderstanding

138
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,564
A shiksa goddess
isn’t an actual goddess

139
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:41,071
And we don’t pray to them.

140
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,079
We prey on them.

141
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,586
Whatever, dude.

142
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:48,090
The point is, Leonard’s
got one and you don’t.

143
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,097
Is this it?

144
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,104
It was inappropriate to discuss
Leonard and Penny’s sex life

145
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,611
in front of Leonard and Penny.

146
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:58,116
Oh, good!

147
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,624
(sighs with relief)

148
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,127
Now I can eat.

149
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:07,140
(cricket chirping)

150
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,148
What’s that?

151
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,653
Sounds like a cricket.
Hang on.

152
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:16,162
(cricket crping)

153
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,671
Based on the number
of chirps per minute

154
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:19,175
and the ambient temperature
in this room,

155
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:22,681
it is a snowy tree cricket.

156
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,189
Oh, give me a freakin’ break.

157
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:27,195
How could you
possibly know that?

158
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:28,700
In 1890, Emile Dolbear

159
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,204
determined that there was

160
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,207
a fixed relationship
between the number

161
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,211
of chirps per minute
of the snowy tree cricket

162
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:34,716
and the ambient temperature.

163
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:36,220
A precise relationship
that is not present

164
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:38,224
with ordinary field crickets.

165
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:40,731
How do you know what the exact
temperature of the room is?

166
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,737
Under the terms of my roommate
agreement with Leonard,

167
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,241
I’ve had unilateral control
of the thermostat

168
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,247
ever since the sweaty night
of ’06.

169
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:51,256
Okay, you were right about
wolverine and bone claws,

170
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:54,265
but you’re wrong
about the cricket.

171
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,772
Howard, don’t embarrass
yourself.

172
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,777
The science chirps for itself.

173
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,784
(chuckling):
Humorous word play.

174
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,292
No, no, not this time.

175
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:04,796
I know insects, my friend.

176
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,300
I spent many

177
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,804
childhood years
capturing them with nets,

178
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,809
putting them in glass jars,
sticking pins through them,

179
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,314
mounting them on corrugated
cardboard with Dymo labels

180
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:15,822
underneath, identifying
the genus and species.

181
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,830
In Latin.

182
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,342
Oh, dude, you are never
getting a shiksa goddess.

183
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,352
(cricket chirping)

184
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:28,358
Thatis a snowy tree cricket.

185
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,863
Oecanthus fultoni.

186
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,369
I was done with Latin
by fifth grade.

187
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:34,876
Okay, okay, tell you what.

188
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,881
I am willing to bet anything

189
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:37,885
that’s an ordinary
field cricket.

190
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:40,390
I can’t take your money.

191
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,895
What’s the matter, you chicken?

192
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:44,901
I’ve always found that
an inappropriate slur.

193
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:46,407
Chickens are not, by nature,

194
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,410
at all timid.

195
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:48,914
In fact, when I was young,

196
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,417
my neighbor’s chicken got loose

197
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,423
and chased me up the big elm
tree in front of our house.

198
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,934
.
Chickens can’t climb trees

199
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:57,939
Thank God.

200
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,447
Okay,

201
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,451
I believe a chicken
made you his bitch.

202
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,961
But the cricket thing,
I don’t buy.

203
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:07,965
Bet me.

204
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,469
Fair enough.

205
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,475
What stakedo you propose?

206
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,482
I will put up my
Fantastic Four number 48,

207
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:17,991
first appearance
of Silver Surfer

208
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,496
against your Flash 123,

209
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
the classicFlash
of two worlds issue.

210
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:25,508
All right, you have a wager.

211
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,016
Hmm.
Great.

212
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,521
Now how are you going to
settle it, hmm?

213
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:31,526
There is no way
to determine the species

214
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,031
of the cricket
without examining it.

215
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:38,039
(cricket chirping)

216
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:41,550
(chirping continues)

217
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:45,560
I wonder what the non-pathetic
people are doing tonight.

218
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,568
(cricket chirping)

219
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,600
More wine?
Hit me.

220
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:07,123
I don’t see anything.

221
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:09,626
Shh!

222
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,635
(cricket chirping)

223
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:15,143
Hallway.

224
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,157
(groaning)

225
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,161
One at a time.

226
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,686
(deep growling)

227
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,197
What was that?

228
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,202
My stomach.

229
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:40,209
Indian food doesn’t
agree with me.

230
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:44,720
Ironic, isn’t it?

231
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:47,227
Shh!

232
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,232
(chirping resumes)

233
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,737
(whispering):
Elevator shaft.

234
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,746
(chirping)

235
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,253
Help me open it.

236
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:57,256
Are you crazy?

237
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:59,760
We can’t go down an empty
elevator shaft.

238
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:01,766
Fine, if you don’t
want to proceed,

239
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:02,770
then you forfeit the bet,

240
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:04,774
and I’ll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.

241
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,282
Let’s open her up.

242
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,293
Are you bothered that I can
so easily manipulate you?

243
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,799
Don’t push me, Sheldon.

244
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:17,305
I may be small, but I took
kung fu when I was 13,

245
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,813
and I remember
a good deal of it.

246
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,319
Oh, really?

247
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,823
Well, I grew up
with an older brother

248
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:24,827
and a very contentious
twin sister.

249
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,333
And I believe I could
easily best you

250
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,837
in any physical confrontation--
be it noogies, swirlies

251
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:31,345
or the classic
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

252
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:37,858
Ooh, big talk from a man who
was once treed by a chicken.

253
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,377
(both chuckle)

254
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:48,891
What are we drinking now?

255
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:50,897
Peppermint schnapps.

256
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,906
Why would you buy
peppermint schnapps?

257
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,913
Because I like peppermint,

258
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,919
and it’s fun to say schnapps.

259
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,927
(both laugh)

260
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,934
Hey, Leonard?
What?

261
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:07,440
Schnapps.

262
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,446
Schnapps.

263
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,452
You’re right
, that is fun.

264
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:16,464
Be careful.

265
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,470
SHELDON:
If I were not being careful,

266
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:21,477
your telling me to be careful
would not ke me careful.

267
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:24,987
(cricket chirping)

268
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:28,496
Stairwell.

269
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,502
SHELDON:
Uh-oh, flashlight went out.

270
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:33,008
I need some batteries.

271
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,014
Fellas?

272
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:39,025
Hello?

273
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,036
It’s really dark down here.

274
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,046
(vomiting)

275
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:50,052
Oh, sweetie.

276
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:53,060
You really can’t hold
your liquor, can you?

277
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:55,570
I’m okay.

278
00:11:55,572 --> 00:11:57,073
Just a little mouthwash,

279
00:11:57,076 --> 00:12:00,580
and then I’m gonna rock
your world.

280
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:06,097
(vomiting)

281
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,602
Are you okay?

282
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,703
Ugh, Toby, what did you do
in a past life

283
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:20,710
to be so disgusting now?

284
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,716
His name isn’t Toby

285
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:25,221
Toby is an absurd name
for a cricket.

286
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,225
What would you name him?

287
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:27,729
An appropriate cricket name.

288
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:30,233
For example, Jiminy.

289
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:31,738
All right,

290
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,241
Sheldon, here we go.

291
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:35,746
Kleingast’s Field Guide
to North American Insects.

292
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:37,250
Hey, Toby.

293
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:39,755
Right here.

294
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,760
See it?

295
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,762
The common field cricket,

296
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:43,265
AKA Gryllus assimilis,

297
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,770
which is Latin
for "suck it, you lose."

298
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,775
Hang on.

299
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:49,279
Voil?.

300
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,783
The snowy tree cricket.

301
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,787
AKA Oecanthus fultoni,

302
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:55,291
which is Latin for
I’ll suck nothing.

303
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:56,296
Of course I’m joking

304
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:59,300
because the Latin for that
isnihil exsorbibo.

305
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:01,807
That is not Toby,

306
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,812
this is Toby.

307
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:04,314
Raj, what do
you think?

308
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,319
Oh, I really don’t care anymore

309
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:11,329
God, I had the most
horrible night.

310
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,835
What happened?

311
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:15,840
Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the shiksi goddess.

312
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,347
Shiksa. Shik-sa.

313
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:19,852
Forgive me.

314
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:22,856
Yiddish was not spoken
in east Texas.

315
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,863
And if it was,
it wasn’t spoken for long.

316
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:27,369
Yeah, fine, whatever.

317
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,372
The point is,
you’re wrong again.

318
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,878
We haven’t established
that I’m wrong once.
All right.

319
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:32,882
Tell you what.
Let’s go down

320
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:34,385
to the Entomology
Department

321
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,889
and let Professor
Crley tell us

322
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:37,893
what kind of cricket
Toby is.

323
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:38,896
SHELDON:
He’s a snow
y tree cricket,

324
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,900
and his name
is Jiminy.

325
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:43,905
I bet I could throw
a rock in this room

326
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,412
and come up
with three better friends.

327
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,934
Holy crap.

328
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:03,451
It’s like Silence
of the Lambs down here.

329
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,960
(screams)

330
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:09,968
Don’t do that!

331
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:11,973
You’re such a girl.

332
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:12,976
They’re just bugs.

333
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,479
Yeah, well,
I don’t like bugs, okay?

334
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:15,482
They freak me out.

335
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:16,986
Interesting.

336
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:19,489
You’re afraid of
insects and women.

337
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:22,997
Ladybugs must render
you catatonic.

338
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:27,507
It was a joke.

339
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:30,014
I made it to lessen
your discomfort.

340
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,521
You’re welcome

341
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,525
(footsteps)

342
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,038
(chuckling): Don’t knock.

343
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,541
Just walk in.

344
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:43,045
Why be polite to the world’s
leading expert

345
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,050
on the dung beetle?

346
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:47,056
Excuse me,

347
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:48,559
are you Professor Crawley?

348
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,563
Who wants to know?

349
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:54,070
I’m Dr. Cooper
from the Physics Department.

350
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,575
Couldn’t wait, huh?

351
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,080
I’m sorry?

352
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,582
I haven’t even packed yet,

353
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,586
and you’re already
measuring my lab

354
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:03,592
for one of your godless
laser machines.

355
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,601
No, you don’t understand.

356
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,606
We just want to ask you
a question.

357
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,611
Let me ask you one first.

358
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,617
What’s a world renowned
entomologist

359
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,122
with a doctorate

360
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,626
and 20 years of experience
to do with his life

361
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:21,133
when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

362
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:23,140
Ask rhetorical questions

363
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:26,146
that make people
uncomfortable?

364
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,152
(sarcastic laugh)

365
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,656
What’s your deal?

366
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,164
Are they planning to outsource
my job to Bangalore?

367
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:38,174
I’m from New Delhi.

368
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,181
Maybe you should find
another entomologist.

369
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:42,185
No, no. We’re here.
Let’s settle this.

370
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:45,190
Professor, can you identify
our cricket?

371
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,695
Of course I can.

372
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:50,201
I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

373
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,707
Not that
that’s going

374
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,712
to keep me from having to move
in with my daughter in Oxnard.

375
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:56,219
And we’re not talking

376
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,723
Oxnard at the beach. No!

377
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:00,228
We’re talking
Oxnard

378
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,233
in the onion fields.

379
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,746
Well, could you
look at Toby?

380
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:10,251
Toby?

381
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:14,259
What a stupid name
for a cricket.

382
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,267
Told ya.

383
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,771
It’s a field cricket.

384
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:19,774
Yes!
No, no, wait.

385
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,778
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

386
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,283
Young man, I’ve been
studying insects

387
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:25,787
since I was eight years old.

388
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,791
You know what
they used to call me

389
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:28,795
in school?

390
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,798
Creepy Crawley.

391
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,803
Cruel as that may be,

392
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,808
that is not in itself
a credential.

393
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,815
Let me show you something.

394
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,819
See that?

395
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,824
That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle

396
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:44,330
I discovered it after spending
six months slogging

397
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,335
through a Bornean rain forest,

398
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,841
while my wife
was back home

399
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:51,847
shacking up with a two-bit
ornithologist

400
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,852
who lives on a sailboat

401
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:56,358
and likes to wear
boot-cut jeans!

402
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,863
So, when I tell

403
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,870
you that that’s a common
field cricket,

404
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:04,878
you can take that
to the damn bank!

405
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:06,383
Cause God knows I can’t

406
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:17,407
Well, apparently,
I was wrong.

407
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,413
Congratulations.

408
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,432
Enjoy Oxnard.

409
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,941
I’m sure your daughter’s
looking forward to having you.

410
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,463
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

411
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:42,467
What you got there?
A new comic book?

412
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,472
Old comic book.

413
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:47,477
I just retrieved it
from my safe deposit box.

414
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:50,485
What do you have a safe
deposit box for?

415
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:53,492
Old comic books.

416
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:55,498
I lost this
to Wolowitz

417
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,503
in an ill-considered
cricket wager.

418
00:17:58,507 --> 00:18:01,510
What, do they have
Wii cricket now?

419
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:05,020
That can’t be very popular.

420
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:07,024
Penny, I’d rather
not talk about it.

421
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:08,529
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

422
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:10,033
I’m not feeling so hot either.

423
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:14,040
Why would that make
me feel better?

424
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:16,546
I don’t know, empathy?

425
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,561
Anyway, I’m just saying,

426
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,566
that you’re feeling upset
about something with Howard,

427
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:26,571
and I’m upset about something
with Leonard.
Yes,

428
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,575
yes, the disappointing
sex.

429
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,081
That’s an inexac
t parallel.

430
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:34,087
You and Leonard can always
return to being friends,

431
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,592
whereas I can never
return to a state

432
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,597
in which Wolowitz
has not bested me

433
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,101
like Mrs. Riley’
s chicken.

434
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,608
What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?

435
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:45,614
A chicken that was owned
by Mrs. Riley.

436
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,121
Okay, forget the chicken.

437
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,627
Well, I wish I could.

438
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,632
No, no.

439
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:54,136
You may be right
about me and Leonard.

440
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,640
Of course I’m right

441
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:58,645
What are the odds I’d be
wrong twice in one week?

442
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,651
No, I mean, we can always go
back to being friends.

443
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,655
I just said that.

444
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,159
This conversation has
started to circle.

445
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,664
Meeting adjourned.

446
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,176
Hello.

447
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:12,179
Hey.

448
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,684
What’s going on?

449
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,188
Oh, you’d like to catch up

450
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:18,192
on the events of the
day. All right.

451
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:20,697
Well, there was a half-hour wait
at the bank

452
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,201
to get into my safe deposit box,

453
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,706
I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems,

454
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,212
and, oh, yes,

455
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:28,215
in a moment filled
with biblical resonance,

456
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:30,220
pride wenteth before my fall,

457
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:34,227
causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.

458
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:35,734
Wait a minute.

459
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:38,238
You talked to Penny
about our sex life?

460
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,743
Leonard, it astonishes me

461
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,748
how you continually fixate
on the trivial.

462
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,754
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

463
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:46,258
Right, right.

464
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,762
You’re saying you talked
to Penny?

465
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:49,265
Ye-Yes.

466
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:49,768
Interesting.

467
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,771
Hardly.

468
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,774
Excuse me.

469
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,278
Have I crossed some
sort of line again?

470
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,283
Little bit.

471
00:19:57,286 --> 00:20:00,289
Hmm.

472
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,302
Ah, who cares?

473
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,202
Oh, hey.
Hey.

474
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,173
Uh, what did Sheldon
say to you?

475
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,151
Not a lot.

476
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:16,636
Just that we always
have the option

477
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:18,615
of going back
to being friends.

478
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,585
Is that what you want?

479
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,056
I don’t know.

480
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,534
I mean, you have to admit

481
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,514
things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

482
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,969
I guess.

483
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:29,948
It would take
the pressure off.

484
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:31,919
It would, wouldn’t it?

485
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:35,375
So, we’ll just be friends.

486
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:36,337
Good.

487
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:37,823
Good.

488
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,802
Come here.
Hmm.

489
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,802
Okay-dokey
