1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,357
Hold.

2
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:05,325
What?

3
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:06,959
Explain your sneeze.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,661
I'm sorry?

5
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:10,396
Do you have allergies? No.

6
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:11,930
Is there too much
pepper on your salad?

7
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,065
I don't put pepper on salads.

8
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,266
I've heard enough. Sit over there.

9
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:16,768
Oh, come on.

10
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:17,969
I don't want to sit by myself.

11
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,139
That's what Typhoid Mary said,

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,082
and clearly, her friends buckled.

13
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,827
Guys, help me.

14
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:24,028
Sheldon, come on.

15
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,053
Yeah, it's just one sneeze.

16
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,604
You're on your own. See you, buddy.

17
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:31,404
Oh, Leonard,
I have something for you.

18
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:33,862
Per our roommate agreement, this is

19
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:36,062
your 24-hour notice
that I will be having

20
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:39,446
a non-related female spending
two nights in our apartment.

21
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,775
When you say "non-related female,"

22
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,535
you still mean human, right?

23
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,823
Of course.

24
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:48,842
Pets are banned under
the roommate agreement,

25
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:51,969
with the exception of service animals,
such as seeing eye dogs

26
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,164
and, one day, cybernetically-
enhanced helper monkeys.

27
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:59,429
Are you planning on
kidnapping a woman?

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,770
Sarcasm?

29
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:04,462
Yes, but mixed with
genuine concern.

30
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:07,682
For your information,
I'll be playing host

31
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:09,227
to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.

32
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,874
The cosmological
physicist from Princeton?

33
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,881
Yes.

34
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:15,167
And until you acquire
a surgical mask,

35
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:17,513
please address your comments
to me through a napkin.

36
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:20,598
We've been corresponding
for years about

37
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,870
our mutual interest in

38
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:23,347
gravitational wave signatures

39
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:25,358
of inflatons in the early universe.

40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,169
And now she's under consideration

41
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,013
for a position at our university.

42
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:31,724
Why didn't you tell me you
knew Elizabeth Plimpton?

43
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,969
I am a huge fan of hers!

44
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,316
I didn't realize I was obligated
to share my connection

45
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:38,425
with things you're a fan of,
but very well.

46
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:40,030
You enjoy Canadian bacon.

47
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,806
I've been to Toronto.

48
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:42,978
Okay, fine.

49
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,320
Where is she going to sleep?

50
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,462
My room, of course.

51
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:47,633
Holy crap!

52
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,721
Holy crap!

53
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:55,097
Yeah, um, I have a
two-part question.

54
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:56,101
Go ahead.

55
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:57,606
A) Are you kidding me?

56
00:01:57,607 --> 00:02:01,011
And B) seriously,
are you freaking kidding me?

57
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:03,243
A) I rarely kid.

58
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:05,409
And B) when I do kid,
you will know it

59
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,042
by my use of the word "bazinga."

60
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,007
So you're saying the two of you

61
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,483
are going to be sleeping
in the same bed?

62
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:14,123
Yes.

63
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,326
Bazinga.

64
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,709
Leonard?

65
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,452
Thank you.

66
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:25,391
Why is a world- renowned scientist

67
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:27,397
staying in our apartment
instead of a hotel?

68
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,001
Well, she doesn't care for hotels.

69
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:30,306
And who can blame her?

70
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:31,376
Windows that don't open,

71
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:32,912
multi-user linens,

72
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,621
keys shaped like credit cards-
as if one walks around

73
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,827
with unassigned slots
in one's wallet.

74
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:39,199
All right, I believe I have time

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,238
for one more question.

76
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,978
Yes, Raj?

77
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,917
When can I sit with you again?

78
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:46,953
When I've seen

79
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,592
two consecutive
negative throat cultures

80
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:50,497
spaced 12 hours apart.
You know the drill.

81
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,202
All right,

82
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,241
if you'll excuse me,
I am off to start

83
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:57,014
a prophylactic course
of antibiotics.

84
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:01,893
I can't believe he's friends
with Elizabeth Plimpton.

85
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:04,601
I can't believe they
let him into Canada.

86
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,171
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You heard the man.

87
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:07,709
Where's your throat cultures?

88
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,717
Kidding. Sit down.

89
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:22,413
??Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state ??

90
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,755
??Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ??

91
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,392
??The Earth began to cool ??

92
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,931
??The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ??

93
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:32,638
??We built the Wall ????We
built the pyramids ??

94
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,281
??Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ??

95
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,185
??That all started
with a big bang ??

96
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:39,157
??Bang! ??

97
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:43,167

99
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:46,861
Hey, Sheldon.

100
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:48,732
Oh, Penny, excellent.

101
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:52,001
I have a question
about these maxi pads.

102
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,603
Are the wings truly functional

103
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:57,272
or have I fallen victim
to marketing hype?

104
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:58,406
What?

105
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:01,042
Why are you doing with-- what?

106
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,743
The stock boy at Walgreens

107
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,845
was frustratingly
uninformed on the subject.

108
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,714
Sheldon, what are you
doing with maxi pads?

109
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,248
I have a lady friend

110
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,417
who will be staying
with me for a few days.

111
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,751
Oh.

112
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,685
What?

113
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,420
I want her to feel at home.

114
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,523
I also bought scented soaps,
pantyhose, Midol,

115
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,893
calcium chews and what
is apparently a yogurt

116
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:26,129
specifically designed to
regulate the female bowel.

117
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:29,565
Wait, wait, hold on, back up.

118
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,533
You're having a
woman stay with you?

119
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,567
Yes.

120
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,569
Why does that seem to
flabbergast everybody?

121
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,304
Oh... no, no, no, no.

122
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:37,538
I'm not flabbergasted.

123
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,139
I'm... puzzled.

124
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,108
Yeah, let's go with puzzled.

125
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:43,143
A word of warning.

126
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:45,111
My guest is a noted physicist

127
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,246
and the leading expert
on quantum cosmology,

128
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:49,247
so please try to avoid
wasting her time

129
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,616
with female jibber jabber.

130
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,251
Female jibber jabber?

131
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,585
Shoe sales, hair styles,

132
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,721
mud masks, gossip about your
friends Brad and Angelina.

133
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,289
Oh, they're not my friends.

134
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,789
I'm not surprised,
considering the way

135
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,760
you talk about them
behind their backs.

136
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,102
She's here, she's here.

137
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,303
How do I look? Do I look smart?

138
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,139
Oh, good grief.

139
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,574
This isn't about you.

140
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:19,608
Coming!

141
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:20,675
Now, listen.

142
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,776
One of the great minds

143
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:24,245
of the 21st century
is about to play host

144
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:27,414
to one of the other great
minds of the 21st century.

145
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,248
So pay attention.

146
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:30,416
Years from now,

147
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,852
my biographer might ask
you about this event.

148
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:37,688
Oh, I have so many things
to tell your biographer.

149
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,223
Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.

150
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,124
I completely forgot your address.

151
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,759
But then I remembered that
I'd written it on my hand.

152
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,027
Lucky for me,

153
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:47,595
I didn't confuse it
with what I'd written

154
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,163
on my other hand,
which are the coordinates

155
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,266
for a newly discovered
neutron star.

156
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,168
'Cause if I tried to go there,
I'd be crushed by hypergravity.

157
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:57,504
Anyway, hello. Hello.

158
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:59,405
Nice to finally meet you in person.

159
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,940
I would imagine it is.

160
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:06,278
This is my friend and roommate, Dr.
Leonard Hofstadter.

161
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,213
Hi-lo.

162
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,381
Oops.

163
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:10,851
I-I started to say "hi,"

164
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:13,153
and then I switched to
"hello" in the middle.

165
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,121
It came out "hi-lo."

166
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,522
Duh.

167
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:20,089
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

168
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,525
I-I've read both your books
and most of your papers.

169
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:26,329
I-I'm Leonard, I live here,
you're brilliant.

170
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,397
I apologize.

171
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,865
He's only an
experimental physicist.

172
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,400
No need to apologize.

173
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,102
Some of my best friends are
experimental physicists.

174
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,103
Well, not

175
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,105
my best friends, but I know them.

176
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,040
My best friend is

177
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,741
a molecular chemist named Wendy.

178
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:42,743
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

179
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:43,743
Hi-lo.

180
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,346
Are you hungry, thirsty?

181
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,511
Can I offer you anything?

182
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:48,978
No, she's my guest.
If anyone should

183
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,511
offer her anything,
it should be me.

184
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,447
Elizabeth, can I get you something?

185
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:53,982
Perhaps a feminine hygiene product

186
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,650
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

187
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,418
Interesting choices.

188
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,287
Based on my current needs,
I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

189
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,288
Excellent.

190
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,622
If the yogurt works,

191
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,424
I bought some delightful
scented candles.

192
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,229
Look, it's you.

193
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:18,700
Thank you so much for
opening up your home to me.

194
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:21,769
Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?

195
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,506
Windows that don't open,
those crazy card-shaped keys.

196
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,942
I'm so glad you understand.

197
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:29,344
No, he doesn't understand.

198
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,378
I understand.

199
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,580
Well, I understand, too.

200
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,182
You're just misappropriating
my understanding.

201
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:35,450
Oh...

202
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,952
I think any university
would want you.

203
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:40,053
Except, of course,

204
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,789
any university that
had already had you.

205
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,590
Because they would've
already wanted you

206
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,725
before they, you know, got you.

207
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:50,161
From the mind that
brought you "hi-lo."

208
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:53,731
Let me show you to your room.

209
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:54,832
All right.

210
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,734
I guess I am tired.
Good night, Leonard.

211
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,502
Uh, sleep night.

212
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:00,104
I mean, obously, good night.

213
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,404
I started to say "sleep tight,"

214
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:03,337
then I changed my
mind in the middle.

215
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,604
I swear to God, I'm smart.

216
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,075
Get it together, man.

217
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:15,312
All right, let me show you

218
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:17,481
some of the features of the room.

219
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:19,082
First, windows.

220
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,083
Conventional.

221
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,718
Open, closed.

222
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,019
Open, closed.

223
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,453
Halfway open.

224
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,189
Or halfway closed, depending
on your philosophical bent.

225
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,258
Over here is my comic
book collection.

226
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,492
Feel free to browse.

227
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,594
There's a box of
disposable reading gloves

228
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:36,063
on the night stand.

229
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:37,564
Good to know.

230
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:38,898
In here, you'll find

231
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,000
emergency provisions.

232
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:44,036
An eight-day supply of
food and water, a crossbow,

233
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:46,838
season two of Star Trek:
The Original Series

234
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,640
on a high-density flash drive.

235
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,641
What if there's a disaster

236
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:52,509
that destroys all the USB ports?

237
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,412
Then there's really no
reason to live, is there?

238
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,247
Can I ask a question
about your roommate?

239
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,983
He's an odd duck, isn't he?

240
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:03,151
What's his relationship status?

241
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:06,087
Well, there was a
misbegotten adventure

242
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,323
with a waitress who
lives across the hall.

243
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:10,591
It ended as inexplicably
as it began.

244
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,326
They had very little in common,

245
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:14,127
except for carnal activity.

246
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,195
That's why I acquired

247
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,664
these noise-canceling headphones.

248
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:19,499
If you decide to use them,

249
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,267
please clean the ear
pieces afterwards

250
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,402
with the Wet Wipes you'll
find in the bathroom.

251
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:25,871
They're in the drawer
labeled "Wet Wipes."

252
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:27,239
Okay.

253
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,139
Good. I'll leave you

254
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,141
to your nighttime ablutions.

255
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,376
I've e-mailed you the
morning bathroom schedule.

256
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:36,113
You'll also find a laminated
copy in your welcome packet.

257
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:40,451
It's on the back of the
emergency escape route diagram.

258
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:41,485
How thoughtful.

259
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:43,687
Sleep well, my friend. You, too.

260
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:47,924
Oh, let me just get one thing.

261
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,426
It's my backup
emergency supply kit.

262
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:53,729
The living room escape route
doesn't pass through here.

263
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,964
Now, good night.

264
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:57,432
And if there's an apocalypse,
good luck.

265
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,503
Yes?

266
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,405
I saw your light on.

267
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,673
Is everything all right?

268
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,541
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

269
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,376
Me neither.

270
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,077
Oh, look what I'm reading.

271
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:15,812
It's you.

272
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,447
I thought you already read it.

273
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,848
I did, but it's been a while,

274
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:22,418
and I wanted to sound
smart over breakfast.

275
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,419
Aw, you're smart.

276
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,486
Oh, good.

277
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:27,054
Wasn't sure it was coming across.

278
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:29,390
What chapter are you on?

279
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:30,924
Uh, six.

280
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:34,926
Oh, the extragalactic
distance ladder.

281
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,527
Want to know a little secret?

282
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:38,262
Sure.

283
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,164
I wrote the section on
the Wilson-Bappu Effect

284
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:41,831
completely naked.

285
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:46,770
Really?

286
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,007
Uh, sure doesn't read that way.

287
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:50,977
Here, let me show yo

288
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:55,549
When we consider the brightness
of pulsating variable stars,

289
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,716
we start to see

290
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:59,519
a possible explanation for
some of the discrepancies

291
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,488
found in Hubble's constant.

292
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:05,757
Wow.

293
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:08,826
You really make science come alive.

294
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:32,500
Vocal test. Morning vocal test.

295
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,948
Second vocal test.

296
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,683
Second morning vocal test.

297
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,185
Morning, Sheldon.

298
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:39,219
Morning.

299
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,253
Morning, Sheldon.

300
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,187
Morning.

301
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:42,688
I trust you had a pleasant night.

302
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:43,822
More than pleasant.

303
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:52,431
Excuse me, I'm going
to relieve myself.

304
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,100
How do you take your coffee?

305
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:57,135
Black. Okeydoke.

306
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:01,639
Pee for Houston, pee for Austin,

307
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,809
pee for the state my
heart got lost in.

308
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:10,446
And shake twice for Texas.

309
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:17,919
Something his mother taught him.

310
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,588
All right, Elizabeth,

311
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,155
the bathroom is yours.

312
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:25,458
The seat is down, and has been
sanitized for your protection.

313
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,427
That's very thoughtful,
but I think I'll finish my coffee first.

314
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,563
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

315
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:34,131
I'll fire off

316
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:36,933
a critical e-mail
to the manufacturer.

317
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, good, you're up.

318
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,368
Look, my car won't start.

319
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,602
I need a ride to work.

320
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,970
Did you once again ignore
your "check engine" light?

321
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,572
No, Mr. smarty-pants.

322
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:47,307
I ignored the "fill
gas tank" light.

323
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,843
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any
residual feelings you have for her

324
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:52,779
in order to get a ride to work.

325
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,815
Oh, yeah, sure, let me just
put this in a travel mug.

326
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,349
Hello.

327
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,617
Hi.

328
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:01,119
Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton--

329
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,887
a leading expert on
quantum cosmology.

330
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:05,755
Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress

331
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,957
who doesn't understand
the role gasoline plays

332
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,058
in the internal combustion engine.

333
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,194
Nice to meet you.

334
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:13,195
Nice to meet you, too.

335
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:14,329
Are you enjoying your stay?

336
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,997
Yes, very much.

337
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,168
Good.

338
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,305
Wonderful. Meaningless
pleasantries accomplished.

339
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,007
Elizabeth, Leonard's
bathroom time is coming up,

340
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,409
and believe me,
you do not want to follow him.

341
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,945
Excuse me.

342
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,281
Okay, well, I guess
I should get dressed

343
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:35,881
so I can take everyone to work.

344
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,082
You and Sheldon

345
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,183
and Sheldon's friend,

346
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,917
Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.

347
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,585
Gonna be fun.

348
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,753
Like a clown car.

349
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:44,787
Hang on. Hmm?

350
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:46,455
Yeah? What? Huh?

351
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:48,123
We just broke up.

352
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:49,324
Wha-- uh, you and me? Yeah, we did.

353
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,292
Not too long ago.

354
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,093
How are you doing with it?

355
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:54,261
Not as good as you apparently.

356
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:55,763
I, um, I don't follow.

357
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,399
You know what? It's,
it's none of my business.

358
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,368
If you want to sleep with
Sheldon's doctor buddy

359
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,670
right after we stopped
seeing each other, go for it.

360
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,505
Well, now... Excuse me.

361
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:06,307
I'm uncomfortable
with you recommending

362
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:08,809
that Leonard pursue having
intercourse with Dr. Plimpton,

363
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,379
who I assure you has
better things to do.

364
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,514
I'm not recommending it.

365
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:15,449
I'm saying it already happened.

366
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,916
That's preposterous.

367
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,918
Tell her, Leonard.

368
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,786
Well...

369
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:25,723
No.

370
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,725
Come on. It wasn't my fault.

371
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:30,428
The implication being
that you sow tripped

372
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:34,297
and fell into her lady parts?

373
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:35,598
You know what?

374
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,233
I'm just gonna take
the bus to work.

375
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,534
Penny, I can still drive you.

376
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:39,602
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

377
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:41,236
You might slip on a banana peel

378
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:42,971
and get me pregnant.

379
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,507
I must say,

380
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,642
I'm ocked by this betrayal.

381
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:49,176
I didn't betray Penny.

382
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:51,611
Not Penny, me!

383
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:53,279
How am I betraying you?

384
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,449
izabeth's my friend,
and you're playingith her!

385
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:03,188
Yeah, I guess I did.

386
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:10,995
What the hell are you doing?

387
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:13,596
Relax, it's Nyquil.

388
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,464
You still have a cold?

389
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:17,199
Maybe, but I don't care.

390
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,333
That's the great thing

391
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,269
about Nyquil,
it's like ten-percent booze.

392
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,938
I call it the nighttime sniffling,
sneezing, coughing

393
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:27,074
so you can talk to girls medicine.

394
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,742
Are you having trouble sleeping?

395
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:31,477
'Cause, boy, I was up all night.

396
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:33,045
Did you get a cold, too?

397
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:36,782
No, but I was awake all night.

398
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:40,118
If you want,

399
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:44,155
I can give you some of
my mom's sleeping pills.

400
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,155
She won't notice they're missing?

401
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:47,224
She doesn't kn she takes them.

402
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:49,493
No, that's okay.

403
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:52,461
It was something else
keeping me up last night.

404
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,396
And again this morning.

405
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:57,231
And... I didn't mind.

406
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,669
I was up last night.

407
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,570
I was up this morning.

408
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:06,539
I didn't mind.

409
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,741
Those are your clues.

410
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:13,244
Ooh, ooh.

411
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:16,247
Did the pigeon on your
windowsill have more babies?

412
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:17,981
No.

413
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,650
Were you up mang another
stop-motion Legoovie?

414
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,118
No.

415
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,419
'Cause let me tell you,

416
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,954
it's not enough to
make the Legos move,

417
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:27,156
they also have to
capture your heart.

418
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:29,191
Okay, I'll give you one more clue.

419
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,626
It involved another person.

420
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:34,862
did you get a Japanese love pillow?

421
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:39,099
How is a Japanese love
pillow another person?

422
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,769
It is if you love her
and give her a name.

423
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,305
Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you
to meet my colleagues--

424
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,973
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali

425
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,042
Hi. and not-a-doctor
Howard Wolowitz.

426
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,176
Hi.

427
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,878
I'm a big fan of your work.
Thank you.

428
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,480
And of course, you've
already introduced yourself

429
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,083
to Dr. Hofstadter.

430
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,484
Hey, you.

431
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,618
Hey, you.

432
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,387
Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.

433
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,156
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?

434
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,390
You know what?

435
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,792
I am a little tired.

436
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,361
Would you be a dear and
get me a cup of coffee?

437
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,863
Sure.

438
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,198
Black, right?

439
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,334
Actually, now I think I want it hot,
brown and sweet.

440
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,402
Coming right up.

441
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,738
What?

442
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,671
What do you mean "what?
" It's Halo night.

443
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,304
I can't. I'm too sick.

444
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:30,536
Go away.

445
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:34,039
That's why we moved
Halo night here.

446
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,673
Look, I brought my
mom's chicken soup.

447
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:36,808
I'm not hungry.

448
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,109
Don't send him away.

449
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,610
Let him in. Who's that

450
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:41,812
I bought a parrot.

451
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,249
Yeah, right.

452
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,251
Dr. Plimpton?

453
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:50,786
Hi. Howard, right?

454
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:52,454
Uh, yeah.

455
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,455
Can I ask you a question, Howard?

456
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,757
Do you like role-playing games?

457
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,394
Yeah, sure.

458
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:03,496
In fact, I'm a dungeon master.

459
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:04,764
Not tonight.

460
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:07,832
Tonight you are a delivery man.

461
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,200
You brought soup,

462
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,802
but uh-oh, Raj and I don't
have enough money to pay you.

463
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:15,372
So we'll have to come to some
other kind of arrangement.

464
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,744
Beg your pardon?

465
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,512
You two figure out the details,

466
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:24,980
I'm going to go
change into something

467
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,216
I don't mind getting
ripped off my milky flesh.

468
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:32,486
What the frak?

469
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,987
Go away.

470
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,756
She wants New Delhi,
not Kosher deli.

471
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:39,157
Besides, you have a girlfriend.

472
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,793
We broke up weeks ago.

473
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,794
Why didn't you say anything?

474
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:44,262
I was waiting for the right time.

475
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:45,663
This is the right time.

476
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,399
Hey, who's ready for Halo?

477
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,866
Oh, this is like a nightmare.

478
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,169
Get lost!

479
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,504
He's right. The numbers
are shaky enough as it is.

480
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:55,972
I don't understand.

481
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:57,274
Oh, good.

482
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,842
Leonard's here.

483
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,410
Good?!

484
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:01,577
Elizabeth?

485
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:02,912
What's going on?

486
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:06,248
What's going on is you and
Howard are my moving men

487
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:07,882
and Raj is my new landlord

488
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:10,717
and I don't have enough
money to pay any of you.

489
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,056
Is she suggesting what I
think she's suggesting?

490
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:16,990
Yep.

491
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:19,693
Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.

492
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,727
Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?

493
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,131
We'll all be naked in
front of each other.

494
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,866
I'm out.

495
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,501
Everybody ready?

496
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,070
Follow my lead.

497
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,872
Almost.

498
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:34,840
We're, we're going to go out

499
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,041
into the hallway and, uh,

500
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,408
make a dramatic entrance.

501
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,208
Oh, good. It's so much
better when everyone commits.

502
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,174
Run. Run, run, run.
Don't look back.

503
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,375
I thought we had something special.

504
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,848
So, you say you can't
pay your rent...

505
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:01,517
Oh, Leonard?

506
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:02,074
Hey.

507
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,492
I found these in the dryer.

508
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,827
I'm assuming they
belong to Sheldon.

509
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:07,295
Thanks.

510
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:10,364
It's really hard to
find these in his size.

511
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:12,700
So, listen.

512
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:15,635
I've been meaning to talk to
you about the other morning.

513
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:18,738
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?

514
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:21,006
Yeah, I wanted to explain

515
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:23,041
Well, you don't owe
me an explanation.

516
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:24,076
I don't?

517
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,310
No, you don't.

518
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,078
So you're not judging me?

519
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,080
Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday,

520
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:32,349
but you don't owe
me an explanation.

521
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,751
Nevertheless, I'd like
to get one on the record

522
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:37,220
so you can understand
why I did what I did.

523
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:38,388
I'm listening.

524
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:42,123
