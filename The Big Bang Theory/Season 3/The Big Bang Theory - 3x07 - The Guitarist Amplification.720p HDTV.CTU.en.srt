1
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:05,347
Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe
you made up your own game.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,066
Oh!

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:08,802
{\pos(192,220)}Research Lab is more
than a game.

4
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:12,093
{\pos(192,220)}It's like the slogan says,
"The Physics is theoretical,

5
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:14,083
but the fun is real."

6
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:17,800
We must not be playing it right.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,457
All right, five.

8
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:23,056
One, two, three, four, five.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,535
Oh, wow, look at that.

10
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:27,083
My Department of Defense
research grant is renewed.

11
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:29,266
Oh! Great roll!

12
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:32,244
Now you can demolish your
Soviet-style cyclotron

13
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:35,033
and build the large
Hadron Collider.

14
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:37,346
Yay.

15
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,483
You're a natural
at this, Penny.

16
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:42,243
{\pos(192,220)}And as the first beta testers,
you two'll have quite the edge

17
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:44,736
{\pos(192,220)}when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

18
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:46,849
{\pos(192,220)}Oh, gee, Sheldon,

19
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:49,315
{\pos(192,220)}I don't think we can
play on Sunday.

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,353
Why not?

21
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:52,264
{\pos(192,220)}Because of the reasons

22
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:53,433
{\pos(192,220)}that Penny will now tell you.

23
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:54,524
Penny?

24
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:57,269
Actually, I have to pick up my
friend Justin from the airport.

25
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:59,788
There you go-- she has to pick up
her friend Justin at the airport.

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,370
And I can't play 'cause
I'm going with her-- right?

27
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:03,735
{\pos(192,220)}Um, yeah, if you want.

28
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:04,704
{\pos(192,220)}I mean, there may not be room.

29
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:07,803
{\pos(192,220)}He's got a lot of stuff--
like guitars and amplifiers.

30
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:08,912
Wait.

31
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:10,664
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:11,830
My friend, Justin.

33
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,589
Pay attention, Leonard.

34
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:14,485
That's why she can't
play on Sunday.

35
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:15,908
Who is this Justin?

36
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,216
- Your turn, Leonard.
- I told you about him.

37
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:18,623
- No, you didn't.
- Roll the dice, Leonard.

38
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:21,307
{\pos(192,220)}Yeah-- my friend from Omaha;
plays the guitar.

39
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:23,180
{\pos(192,220)}Anyway, he's coming to L.A.
looking for some session work,

40
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,741
so I told him he could
just crash on my couch

41
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:25,249
for a few weeks.

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,562
Come on, Leonard--
if you roll a six,

43
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,984
Penny dies horribly in
a nuclear meltdown.

44
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:33,203
See what I mean when I
say the fun is real?

45
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:34,807
Hang on.

46
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:37,208
Some guy is going to be
sleeping on your couch?

47
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,581
He's not "some guy."

48
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,748
He's my friend.

49
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:42,991
So by "friend," do you
mean "friend friend,"

50
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:45,004
"gay friend," or "ex boyfriend

51
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,206
"who you're now platonic with

52
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,056
but still might have a
thing for you friend"?

53
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,646
Well, he's definitely not gay.

54
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,312
Oh, ho-ho, a definitely
not gay musician

55
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:55,352
sleeping on my
girlfriend's couch.

56
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:56,807
Yippee.

57
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:00,670
Okay, we went out a little
bit, a long time ago.

58
00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:02,676
But we were never
like "going out."

59
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:05,073
Okay, not to be pedantic,
but last I checked

60
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,617
"went out" was in fact the past
tense of "going out"--

61
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:08,706
which I think we all know

62
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,938
is a popular euphemism

63
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:12,075
for "saw each other naked."

64
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:15,661
I'll just roll for you.

65
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,694
Do you have a problem with
Justin staying with me?

66
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:20,038
What was your first clue?

67
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:22,601
Uh-oh! Industrial accident.

68
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:24,661
You know what?

69
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:25,965
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

70
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:27,541
I'm not talking to you
like you're an idiot!

71
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,608
I'm saying the whole
idea is idiotic!

72
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:31,994
"You accidentally stare
at a helium-argon laser.

73
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:34,023
Lose one turn and a retina."

74
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:36,795
How is that not talking
to me like I'm an idiot?

75
00:02:36,797 --> 00:02:38,356
It's my friend,
it's my couch,

76
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,574
and it's my freakin' life!

77
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,088
It's also your roll.

78
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,453
You know what?
It is your life.

79
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:46,364
If you want to have some stupid guitarist
stay on your couch, then fine.

80
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,622
Why don't you just rent

81
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:50,081
some bun beds and invite
The Black Eyed Peas?!

82
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,311
Hey, if I want to invite the
entire lineup of Lollapalooza

83
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:54,693
to sleep in my apartment,
I will,

84
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:55,823
and it's none of your business!

85
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:56,897
Are you listening to yourself?

86
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:58,681
Do you know how childish
you sound right now?

87
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,777
Oh, now I'm a child?

88
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,384
Well, at least I'm
not an idiot anymore!

89
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:02,977
(Blender grinding)
The two aren't
mutually exclusive!

90
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,384
Oh, you are such a--

91
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,598
What the hell is he doing?!

92
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:07,692
He's drowning us out.

93
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:08,927
He doesn't like fighting.

94
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,571
Sheldon, just stop!
Ok, the fight is over!

95
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,173
Oh, and FYI,

96
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,875
you never even heard
of The Black Eyed Peas

97
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:15,968
until you met me!

98
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:17,784
I heard of 'em!

99
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,259
Didn't know they were a band.

100
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:22,726
(Grinding continues)

101
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,824
Sheldon, she's gone.

102
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,443
You can turn off the blender.

103
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:35,309
Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

104
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:39,063
No, we just had a little spat.

105
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:40,709
Look on the bright side.

106
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,703
As the result of
Penny's forfeit,

107
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:46,436
you have become the world's
first winner of "Research Lab."

108
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:49,690
Would you like a
commemorative snow cone?

Season 03 - Episoe 07
"The Guitarist Amplification"

118
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,597
I don't get how she
can just announce

119
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,999
{\pos(192,220)}that an old boyfriend is going
to be sleeping on her couch.

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
{\pos(192,220)}Hey, I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

121
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,042
{\pos(192,220)}I don't want to play
a game, Sheldon.

122
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,330
{\pos(192,220)}It's called "Scientists."

123
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:31,505
{\pos(192,220)}Now, I will name
three scientists,

124
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:32,898
{\pos(192,220)}then you will put them in order

125
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,150
of the size of their
contribution

126
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,466
in their respective fields.

127
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,367
To make this game
even more compelling,

128
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,767
{\pos(192,200)}you must consider
only the contribution

129
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:40,971
{\pos(192,200)}of the man to the field,

130
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:43,022
not the validity
of the field itself.

131
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,448
{\pos(192,200)}For example:
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Haiyan

132
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:48,763
{\pos(192,200)}made a greater contribution to
the discredited field of alchemy

133
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,068
{\pos(192,200)}than Halbert Vanderplatt made
to neurobiology.

134
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,842
{\pos(192,200)}Okay, ready to have some fun?

135
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:56,977
{\pos(192,200)}An old boyfriend who's
definitely not gay.

136
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,217
{\pos(192,200)}That's what a guy likes
to hear-- "definitely."

137
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,605
{\pos(192,200)}All right, I'll start
with an easy one:

138
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:05,566
{\pos(192,200)}Um... Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

139
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:09,058
{\pos(192,200)}And then I say one little thing 
and I end up being the bad guy!

140
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,937
{\pos(192,200)}Hint: Madame Curie had
her husband to help her.

141
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:13,731
{\pos(192,200)}What am I supposed to say?

142
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,152
{\pos(192,200)}"Sure, Penny, I'm cool
with your old boyfriend

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
{\pos(192,200)}sleeping in your apartment."

144
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:19,910
{\pos(192,200)}"Well, Leonard, it doesn't
matter if you're cool or not

145
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,318
{\pos(192,50)}"because I'm Penny and I'm pretty

146
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:23,125
{\pos(192,50)}and I can do whatever the hell I want!"

147
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,472
{\pos(192,200)}"Oh, I get it!

148
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,075
{\pos(192,200)}"You think you're doing
me a favor just by

149
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:27,375
being in a relationship
with me!"

150
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,951
"No, no, Leonard!
I'm doing you a favor

151
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,488
just by being in the
same room as you!"

152
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,037
Leonard! Stop the car!

153
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:34,709
{\pos(192,200)}What?

154
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:37,490
{\pos(192,200)}I can't listen to the
two of you fight anymore.

155
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,652
Come on, come on,
we're late.

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,194
Calm down.
We'll make the movie.

157
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,745
I believe my alarm
is appropriate,

158
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:47,730
given the situation.

159
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,216
The movie starts
in 17 minutes,

160
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,834
which means we'll need
to make all the lights

161
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,334
on Colorado Boulevard,
plus skip the concession stand,

162
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,030
and preshow urination.

163
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:57,685
Oh, dude, I wish you
had said something

164
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,903
before pounded
that last Red Bull.

165
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,873
SHELDON: Go, go,
Power Rangers, go!

166
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,527
Hey.

167
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,249
Hey.

168
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:09,515
We're, uh, going to the movies.

169
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:10,715
No, we're not.

170
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,567
We're standing
in the hallway,

171
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,239
suffering through
an awkward encounter.

172
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:17,194
Hang on.

173
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,506
They're showing a new digital
part of Time Bandits.

174
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,840
You wouldn't want to come,
would you?

175
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:22,930
Not really, no.

176
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,911
All right, invitation
pointlessly offered,

177
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,301
invitation declined
as expected,

178
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,568
everyone's civil,
nobody's fighting.

179
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:28,572
Have a nice evening.

180
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:32,901
Just give us a minute.

181
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:34,771
Oh, take all the
time you need.

182
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:42,144
So, are we going to talk
about last night?

183
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,750
Are you ready to apologize?

184
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:44,727
No.

185
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:45,809
(Imitates buzzer)
Wrong answer.

186
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:46,722
But thank you for playing.

187
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,947
Oh, come on.

188
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:49,968
This is stupid.

189
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:50,893
Oh, there it is again!

190
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:51,971
You think I'm stupid!

191
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:52,849
No, there's a difference

192
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:54,944
between being stupid
and acting stupid.

193
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:56,172
Oh, yeah? well,
there's a difference

194
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:58,487
between being a jerk
and being an ass!

195
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:00,361
No, there isn't!

196
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,039
They're synonyms!

197
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:06,210
Well, that was
rather unpleasant.

198
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:10,413
Yeah, I don't think I need my
preshow urination anymore.

199
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,550
Leonard, when that woman
moved in three years ago

200
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,203
I told you not to talk to her,
and now look.

201
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,979
we're going to be late
for the movies.

202
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,170
Hey! Look! Amazing
Spider-Man 183.

203
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,300
Got it.

204
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,223
Remember this one?

205
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:29,856
Spider-Man loses a big fight

206
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,435
and then his girlfriend
breaks up with him.

207
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:36,401
Want me to get it for you?

208
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,475
It'll help take your
mind off things.

209
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:41,222
Hey, guys. What's going on?

210
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,711
Oh, we need to kill
a couple hours

211
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,182
till the next showing
of Time Bandits.

212
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:45,860
Oh, well, no problem.

213
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:48,006
I was thinking of closing
early and going home,

214
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:49,409
but let's face it,

215
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:51,191
that's just a slightly
smaller lonely room

216
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,899
filled with comic books.

217
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,591
Thanks, Stuart.

218
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,524
Let me ask you something.

219
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,786
Do you think it's okay for Penny

220
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:01,597
to have an ex-boyfriend
sleep on her couch?

221
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:03,501
No, I mean, she's obviously
way out of line.

222
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:04,062
Thank you!

223
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,985
But if she dumps you,

224
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,185
she'll have a new boyfriend
by tomorrow morning

225
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,446
and you'll have
a new girlfriend

226
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,563
when you figure out
how to build one.

227
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:15,946
So the only question is:
how long until you fold?

228
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:17,568
I am not going to fold.

229
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,741
Well, excuse me,
I don't think

230
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,107
Penny's out of
line at all.

231
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:21,521
You don't own her.

232
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:23,440
It's like my girl,
Beyonce says

233
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:26,002
"If you like it, you shoulda
put a ring on it."

234
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:28,604
WOLOWITZ:
Come on.

235
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:29,452
At the very least,

236
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,120
when she found out Leonard
was upset about it,

237
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,648
she should've
backed off.

238
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:33,835
You mean like
when a guy's upset

239
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:35,754
because his friend agreed to
take a cooking class with him

240
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:36,680
and then doesn't show up

241
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,154
because he's doing a juice
fast with his mother?

242
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:42,285
I didn't know you were
upset about that.

243
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,205
Really! Did you miss all
the subtle indicators,

244
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,453
like me saying,
"Howard, I am upset."

245
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:47,538
Okay, sorry.

246
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:48,973
Maybe it means something
different in this country.

247
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:51,649
Back in India, it means you're
upset with a guy named Howard!

248
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,788
Yea-- I said I'm sorry.

249
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:54,956
Sorry doesn't make
up for the fact

250
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:57,532
that I had to make chicken
and rice with this vegan guy.

251
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,821
Do you know what vegan
chicken and rice is?

252
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:00,970
Rice!

253
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,599
Yeah, well, you think
I was having fun,

254
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,653
sitting around all night
listening to my mother say,

255
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:07,946
"Have you ever peed so
much in your life?"

256
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:11,813
Oh, my God, you are
such a mama's boy.

257
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,111
WOLOWITZ:
Hey, don't bring my
mother into this!

258
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:15,574
You brought your
mother into this!

259
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,467
Stop it, both of you.

260
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,805
All this fighting,
I might as well

261
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,963
be back with my parents!
"Damn it, George,

262
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,976
I told you if you didn't quit
drinkin' I'd leave you!"

263
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,760
"Well, I guess that
makes you a liar.

264
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,124
'Cause I'm drunk as hell
and you're still here!"

265
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,185
"Stop yelling!

266
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,662
You're making Sheldon cry!"

267
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:31,473
"I'll tell you what's
making Sheldon cry!

268
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,356
That I let you name him Sheldon."

269
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,959
Boy, what got him so upset?

270
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:46,482
Oh, sure, you can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

271
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,325
Oh, thank you very much.

272
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,693
Come back soon.

273
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,236
With the other half of my tip.

274
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,086
{\pos(192,220)}(Sighs)

275
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:02,994
{\pos(192,220)}Hey, Sheldon.

276
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,295
{\pos(192,220)}What are you doing here?

277
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,850
{\pos(192,220)}This is a restaurant.

278
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:06,812
{\pos(192,220)}It's lunchtime.

279
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:07,632
{\pos(192,220)}I would think, as a waitress,

280
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,374
{\pos(192,220)}you should be familiar
with the paradigm.

281
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,458
Is Leonard coming?

282
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,365
No, I believe
Leonard is waiting

283
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:15,902
for you to come crawling back
to him and apologize.

284
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,952
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

285
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,322
I assumed that would
be your attitude.

286
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:19,909
Hence, my true purpose in coming here.

287
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:23,245
- Which is?
- I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.

288
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:24,672
I'm busy.

289
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:26,340
Excuse me, miss.

290
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:28,126
I'd like to order lunch.

291
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:33,665
Fine. What do you want?

292
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:35,049
I have a few questions.

293
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,259
First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half-sandwich?

294
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:38,861
Yes.

295
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:41,967
Where exactly does the
half-sandwich come from?

296
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:44,829
Are you giving me half of
someone else's sandwich,

297
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,574
or do I have to wait

298
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:46,559
for someone else
in the restaurant

299
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,173
to order the other half?

300
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,717
No, no, Sheldon, they
just make a half-sandwich.

301
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,535
You can't make
a half-sandwich.

302
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,352
If it's the half
of a whole sandwich,

303
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,356
it's just a small sandwich.

304
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,288
Okay, fine, it's soup
and a small sandwich.

305
00:10:59,294 --> 00:10:59,995
Is that what you want?

306
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:01,881
Of course not.
I'll have my usual.

307
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:03,640
Great.

308
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:06,178
Aren't you going to ask me
if I want a beverage?

309
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:07,339
Don't you usually get lemonade?

310
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:08,475
- Yes.
- Do you want lemonade?

311
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:09,640
- Yes.
- Anything else?

312
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,488
Yes-- I want you to
apologize to Leonard.

313
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:14,596
I am not going
to apologize.

314
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:15,467
I've done nothing wrong.

315
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:16,799
He is completely
overreacting.

316
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,516
Irrelevant.

317
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,866
The disruption in
your relationship

318
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,669
is making my life intolerable.

319
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,939
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but
this really isn't about you.

320
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:25,877
I don't follow.

321
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,981
Yeah, yeah, I'll
be right there.

322
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,009
Look, Sheldon,
I have to go.

323
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,537
All right, let's assume,
ad argumentum,

324
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:34,081
that in this case,
Leonard is wrong.

325
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,170
Leonard is wrong.

326
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,104
Considering the number
of transgressions

327
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:38,839
you've committed
that he's overlooked,

328
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,234
don't you think that,
just this once,

329
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,703
you could return the favor?

330
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:42,856
I'm coming.

331
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:43,556
Good-bye, Sheldon.

332
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:44,700
(Sighs)

333
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,824
What do you mean, transgressions
I've committed?

334
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:52,825
Were you under the impression

335
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,658
that Leonard has no
complaints about you?

336
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:56,724
Like what?!
Yeah, yeah, I see you.

337
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,071
You're making a little
check sign in the air.

338
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,608
I got it.
Just hold your horses.

339
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,193
What does Leonard
complain about?

340
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,374
Your driving.

341
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,526
The plethora of stuffed
animals on your bed

342
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:08,129
that stare at him during
your amorous activities.

343
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,931
Your constant tardiness,
your singing.

344
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:12,904
My singing?

345
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:13,969
That's actually from my list.

346
00:12:13,978 --> 00:12:16,069
But Leonard would be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

347
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,611
Okay, if Leonard has so
many problems with me,

348
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,742
why hasn't he
just said so?

349
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:20,718
Because, according to him,

350
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,730
you're oversensitive
and have a temper.

351
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,099
Oh, really?

352
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:25,142
Well, then, do me a favor

353
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,780
and tell Leonard that
he can drop dead!

354
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,590
And she wonders why she's
constantly undertipped.

355
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:39,545
Hey.

356
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,021
Oh, good, you're home.

357
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,503
I need you to
do me a favor.

358
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:42,942
Sure.

359
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,556
Go apologize to Penny.

360
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:46,120
What?!

361
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,278
Right now would be good.

362
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:48,809
(Loud knocking)
PENNY: Leonard!

363
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,505
Although, a few minutes ago
would have been better.

364
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:52,866
PENNY:
I hear you don't like

365
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:56,071
my stuffed animals,
my driving or my punctuality.

366
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,446
What? Who would tell you
something like that?

367
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:00,764
Why would you tell her
something like that?

368
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:02,237
It doesn't matter
why he told me.

369
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:03,763
It's true, isn't it?

370
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,970
Okay, yeah, it's true,

371
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:06,395
but I can live
with that stuff.

372
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:08,822
What I can't live with is
you casually informing me

373
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:10,730
that some guy's going to be
staying in your apartment

374
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,048
without even
asking me first!

375
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,423
That isn't even your problem!

376
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:14,886
Your problem is
you don't trust me!

377
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:15,872
Oh, come on.

378
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,297
Sheldon, have you ever once heard
me say that I don't trust Penny?

379
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:21,914
Sheldon?
Where did he go?

380
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,036
PENNY:
Oh, your yelling

381
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,757
must have freaked
him out again.

382
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:25,565
Where are you going?!

383
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:26,383
You just walk away

384
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:27,601
- in the middle of an argument?!
- No.

385
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,042
I'm going to go find
your damn roommate

386
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:29,863
before he hurts himself

387
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,012
trying to cross the
street or something!

388
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:33,783
Why didn't you say so?

389
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,861
Oh, now I need your
permission for that, too?!

390
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:37,682
Well, I can't read
your mind, Penny!

391
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,590
Really?
Why not?

392
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,787
You're so smart,
and I'm so dumb!

393
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:44,877
Raj?

394
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,341
Raj?

395
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,194
Raj?

396
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,332
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Stop knocking!
It's open!

397
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:52,747
Please tell my parents that
our dark matter research

398
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,668
is at a critical juncture,
and I can't come home

399
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,402
for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.

400
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:57,408
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALI:
Sheldon,

401
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,893
ask our son what
we're supposed to say

402
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,941
to Mr. and Mrs. Cheldry,
whose daughter, Lakshmi

403
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:03,540
is flying in from London, for
the sole purpose of meeting him.

404
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,626
I didn't ask you to
set me up with Lakshmi.

405
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,996
You should be thanking us!

406
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,760
Yes-- Lakshmi just got
her stomach stapled.

407
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,129
You have an opportunity
to get in good with her

408
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:15,787
before she loses weight,
and her self-esteem goes up.

409
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,414
I don't care!

410
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,951
And why don't you
think I can find

411
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:19,953
a woman for myself?

412
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:20,892
Because you're 27,

413
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,779
and the closest thing we
have to a daughter-in-law

414
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,523
is that Jewish boy Howard.

415
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:28,083
Oh... that is completely
below the belt.

416
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,930
Sheldon, tell my parents that
Howard and I are just friends.

417
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:32,841
Sheldon?

418
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,590
Howard and I are just friends!

419
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:41,505
Fine. I'll come home
for Sanjay's wedding.

420
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,977
(Sighs)

421
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,444
(Shouting):
Sheldon?!

422
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:48,884
(Whistling)

423
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:53,058
What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.

424
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:54,949
Hey, why don't you
just let me find him

425
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:57,483
while you sit there
hitting your imaginary brake?

426
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,516
{\pos(192,220)}The brake might be imaginary,

427
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,860
{\pos(192,220)}but that stop sign
you just ran wasn't.

428
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,021
What stop sign?

429
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,176
Eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road!

430
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:14,821
(Doorbell rings)

431
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,883
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, answer the door!

432
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,443
I'm busy!

433
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,323
HOWARD: I'm busy too.

434
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,531
You answer it.

435
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:22,478
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I can't!

436
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,111
I'm on the toilet!

437
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,977
HOWARD:
For God's sake, I don't
need to hear that!

438
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,350
Can't you just
say, "I'm busy"?

439
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,809
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I said I'm busy,

440
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:33,216
but that wasn't
good enough for you!

441
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,749
HOWARD:
You know what?

442
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,732
I hope it's one of those
home invasion deals,

443
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,540
And they shove me in the head.

444
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:39,438
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Well, if it's a home invader,

445
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:42,407
don't tell them
I'm on the toilet!

446
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:47,610
There's no one there.

447
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:50,769
You're hearing things,
you crazy old lady!

448
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:56,572
Hey, Stuart, have
you seen Sheldon?

449
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,800
Yeah, he's, uh, over in
the graphic novel section.

450
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:03,197
Built himself a little nest.

451
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:05,030
Thank you.

452
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:06,546
Uh, Penny?

453
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,475
Yeah?

454
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,835
Is everything okay?

455
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:09,811
What do you mean?

456
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:10,985
Uh, Sheldon told me

457
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:12,329
you and Leonard
were having a fight?

458
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:14,194
Oh, yeah, kind of.

459
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:15,531
It's-It's no big thing.

460
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,103
Oh, good, good.

461
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:19,588
I love you.

462
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,797
I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

463
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,190
All right,
what's going on?

464
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,627
It's a little hard to explain.
He does this thing

465
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:28,154
where he pretends
he's in an alternate

466
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:30,942
dimension that occupies the
same physical space we're in,

467
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,401
but he can't perceive us.

468
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:35,721
Don't flatter yourself.

469
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:37,490
I'm just ignoring you.

470
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,926
Ok, come on, Sheldon,
let's go home.

471
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,144
Look, we're done fighting.

472
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:43,712
I've heard that before.

473
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:44,897
But then,
the next thing you know,

474
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,335
I'm hiding in my bedroom,

475
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,258
blaring a Richard Feinman
lecture

476
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,507
while my mom is shouting
that Jesus would forgive her

477
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,776
if she put ground glass
in my dad's meatloaf.

478
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:55,742
And my dad's on the
roof skeet-shooting

479
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:58,144
her Franklin Mint
collectible plates.

480
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,222
Hey, there's going to
no more shouting

481
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:03,119
and no skeet-shooting.

482
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,245
Really?

483
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,418
Where's your friend Justin
going to sleep?

484
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,581
Yeah... where's
he gonna sleep?

485
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,846
Oh, my God, would
you let this go?!

486
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,377
STUART:
I'd let it go.

487
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,418
Why should I let it go?

488
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:18,079
Why don't you just tell the guy
to find another place to sleep?!

489
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:19,389
(Robot playing ominous music)

490
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,744
Oh, for God's sakes.

491
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,392
(Turns robot off)

492
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,348
So, you have childhood issues.

493
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,319
We all have childhood issues.

494
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,059
At some point, you just need
to grow up and get past them.

495
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,260
ROBOT:
Fire! Fire!

496
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:32,503
(Robot firing blasters)

497
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:34,729
Leonard, will you just
let me handle this, please?

498
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:36,704
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>
Look... let's... just...

499
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:38,818
(Robot shouting)

500
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:41,196
(Turns robot off)

501
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,812
Sheldon, please,
try and understand.

502
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,944
Look, Leonard and I
are in a relationship,

503
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:50,221
and occasionally,
we're going to fight.

504
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,527
But no matter what happens

505
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,325
between us, we will
always love you.

506
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:57,600
Right, Leonard?

507
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,399
Always is a long time.

508
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,748
Sure. Always.

509
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:06,031
You know, how about
we buy you this robot,

510
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,408
and then we all go home?

511
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:11,233
I want that one.

512
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,537
Okay, you can have that one.

513
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:16,250
Oh, come on, he's just going
to play with it twice,

514
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,356
and then it'll end up in his
closet with all the other junk.

515
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,491
Buy him the robot, Leonard.

516
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,815
Can I get this comic book, too?

517
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,238
(Baby talk):
Yes, you can.

518
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:33,163
(Sighs)

519
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:35,242
We meet again.

520
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:44,770
So what did Justin say
when you told him

521
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:46,464
he couldn't sleep
on your couch?

522
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:47,584
He's a musician.

523
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,184
He'll sleep in his own
vomit, if he has to.

524
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:01,269
I should have asked
for much more

525
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:03,848
than a comic book and a robot.

9999
