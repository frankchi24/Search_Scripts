1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,737
Okay, we've got
power to the laser.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,839
I should've brought
an umbrella.

3
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:08,511
What for?
It's not going to rain.

4
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:11,047
I know that, but with
skin as fair as mine,

5
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:14,450
moon burn is a
real possibility.

6
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:16,151
That's a "bazinga," right?

7
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:18,820
One of my best,
don't you think?

8
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:23,202
Howard, do you want
to double-check

9
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:24,500
the equatorial mount
on the laser?

10
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,488
We need it locked onto
the Sea of Tranquility.

11
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:27,914
You got it.

12
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:30,061
Oh, Raj, no.

13
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:33,158
Billions of dollars have gone
into inventing the Internet

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,164
and filling it
with pictures of naked women,

15
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:37,951
so we don't have
to peep through windows.

16
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:39,301
It's not like that.

17
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:40,417
I'm watching someone's TV.

18
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:42,013
<i>The Good Wife</i> is on.

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,195
I tell you, this is
my new <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

20
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:49,140
Leonard, Leonard.

21
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,285
What is that?
What is that?

22
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:53,586
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

23
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,817
How on earth
can you say

24
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:58,473
"dirty sock" and "relax"
in the same sentence?

25
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:02,951
Sheldon, the world is filled
with dirty discarded socks.

26
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:05,163
Not my world.

27
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:10,035
Hey, you know who'd really dig
seeing this experiment? Penny.

28
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:13,591
I wasn't aware that
lunar ranging was her thing.

29
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:16,580
Although, I suppose the
retro-reflector left on the moon

30
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:20,307
by Neil Armstrong
does qualify as a shiny object.

31
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,860
Why don't you
ask her to come up?

32
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,761
I don't know, it's still

33
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:25,140
a little weird
since, you know...

34
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,780
She dumped you?
She didn't dump me.

35
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:29,798
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

36
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,544
I fail to see how a relationship

37
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:35,000
can have the qualities
of a geographic location.

38
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:35,939
Oh, it's very simple.

39
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,512
Leonard was living
in a little town

40
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:39,156
called "Please don't leave me"

41
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:43,311
while Penny had just moved
to the island of "Buh-bye."

42
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,966
Screw you guys.

43
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,472
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

44
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,183
If it's not
too much trouble,

45
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:52,158
I'd like to point this
at the moon now.

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,195
Wait a second.

47
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,072
The good wife is crying.

48
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:57,849

59
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:28,325
Oh, hi.
What's going on?

60
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:31,194
We're up on the roof bouncing
laser beams off the moon.

61
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:33,296
I'm sorry, what?

62
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:34,697
It's pretty cool.

63
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:36,165
We've got a two-meter parabolic
reflector and everything.

64
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,699
I thought you might
want to see it.

65
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,800
That makes no sense.

66
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,335
Um...

67
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:42,269
How can you bounce
stuff off the moon?

68
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,937
There's no gravity.

69
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:46,205
Uh, Leonard,

70
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:48,575
this is Zack.
Zack, Leonard.
Hey.

71
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:50,807
Oh, sorry, I didn't know you
were busy. Maybe another time.

72
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:51,805
Yeah, maybe.

73
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,398
Hey, I want to see
this laser thing.

74
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,118
Oh, but what about
the party?

75
00:02:55,119 --> 00:03:01,174
It's a surprise party-- doesn't
matter when we get there.

76
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:02,886
Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

77
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,233
So, how'd you two guys meet?

78
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:13,010
My company designs the menus 
for the Cheesecake Factory.

79
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,840
Your company?
Well, my dad, but...

80
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,270
but me and my sister are VPs.

81
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:20,957
So... menus.

82
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,687
I know it sounds easy but there's a lot
of science that goes in designing one.

83
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,623
Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

84
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:36,962
Thank you.

85
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,886
Raj, keep an eye out
for the other one.

86
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,486
Hey, guys, this is
my friend Zack.

87
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:44,340
Hey.

88
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,827
Hello.
Whoa!

89
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:46,947
Is that the laser?

90
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:48,720
It's bitchin'.

91
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,126
Yes.

92
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,320
In 1917, when Albert Einstein
established

93
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,812
the theoretic foundation
for the laser in his paper

94
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:58,706
<i>"Zur Quantentheorie der</i>
<i>Strahlung,"</i> his fondest hope

95
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,899
was that the resultant device
be bitchin'.

96
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,792
Well, mission
accomplished.

97
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,733
Let me explain
what we're doing here.

98
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:10,653
Um, in 1969,

99
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,393
the astronauts
on <i>Apollo 11</i>

100
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:14,099
positioned reflectors
on the surface of the moon,

101
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,672
and we're going to
shoot a laser off

102
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,512
one of them
and let the light bounce back

103
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:18,966
into this photomultiplier.

104
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,705
Oh! That's very cool.

105
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:21,859
One question.

106
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,985
How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

107
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:26,005
The laser?

108
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:27,345
The moon.

109
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,512
See, now this is
a man for Penny.

110
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,958
That's a great
question, Zack.

111
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,811
No, it's not.

112
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,798
Sheldon!

113
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,118
Play nice.

114
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,372
It's not a great question.

115
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:42,778
How could somebody
possibly think

116
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,517
we're going to
blow up the moon?

117
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:48,531
<i>That's</i> a great question.

118
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:50,437
Don't worry about the moon.

119
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,777
We-We set our laser to stun.

120
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:54,818
Smart.

121
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,971
Now, we'll be able to see
the beam when it leaves,

122
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,711
but it won't be strong enough
when it comes back

123
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:00,850
to be seen by the naked eye.

124
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,823
Naked.

125
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:09,177
Right. Uh... funny.

126
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:11,837
Uh, that device,
there, will measure
the photons that return

127
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,077
and let us see it
on this computer.

128
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:15,950
Raj, get them
some glasses.

129
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:18,309
Cool, it's gonna
be in 3-D?

130
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,910
Preparing to fire laser
at the moon.

131
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,430
Make it so.

132
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:35,117
There it is.
There's the spike!

133
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,090
2.5 seconds for the
light to return.

134
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,630
That's the moon!
We hit the moon!

135
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:44,664
That's your big experiment?

136
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:47,091
All that for
a line on the screen?

137
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:48,511
Yeah, but, uh,

138
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:49,917
think about
what this represents.

139
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:50,937
The fact that

140
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:53,177
we can do this
is the only way

141
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,050
of definitively proving
that there are man-made objects

142
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:57,643
on the moon, put there
by a member of a species

143
00:05:57,644 --> 00:06:00,803
that only 60 years before
had just invented the airplane.

144
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:02,829
What species is that?

145
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:06,656
I was wrong.

146
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,682
Penny can do better.

147
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:11,089
Okay, guys, thank you,
it's been fun.
Yeah, thanks.

148
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,301
Should we invite
them to the party?
No, just keep walking.

149
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:19,644
He must be very
skilled at coitus.

150
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:24,277
I'm telling you, dude,
the only way

151
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:26,984
to feel better about Penny
going out with other guys

152
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:30,530
is for you to get back
on the whores.

153
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,690
Horse.

154
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:34,743
What?

155
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,517
The phrase is "get
back on the horse,"

156
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,843
not "whores."

157
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:41,668
That's disgusting, dude.

158
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,294
No, it's not...

159
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:46,434
Never mind.

160
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:47,521
He is right, though.

161
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:50,147
If you want, I can turn
you on to this great new

162
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:52,187
dating site I found.
No, thanks.

163
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,327
You sure? They say they can
find a match for anybody.

164
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,542
Have they found
a match for you?

165
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,435
Tons. I've had, like, eight
dates in the last month.

166
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:03,370
And 12 if you count the ones
who showed up and left.

167
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,072
I can't bring
the nitrogen tank down.

168
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:07,216
Why not?
All right, let me restate that.

169
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,245
It's very heavy,
and I don't want to.

170
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:11,885
I'll help you.

171
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:13,136
Thank you.

172
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:16,496
Lift with your knees,
not your back.

173
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,496
Good night.

174
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,528
You know what
<i>would</i> be fun?

175
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,842
Signing Sheldon up
for online dating.

176
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:26,848
Yeah, right.

177
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:27,826
No, think about it.

178
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,137
We make it an
experiment.

179
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,549
Like when
Frankenstein's monster

180
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,448
was lonely and
he found a wife.

181
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,568
He didn't <i>find</i> a wife.

182
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,208
They <i>built him</i> a wife
out of dead body parts.

183
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:42,307
Okay, we'll call
that plan B.

184
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,846
Coming!

185
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:56,317
Damn you, you rat bastard.

186
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:58,018
Are you drunk?

187
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,488
Zack was a perfectly nice guy,
and then you ruined him!

188
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,256
How did I ruin him?

189
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:04,684
'Cause in the olden days,

190
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:08,221
I never would've known
he was so stupid.

191
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:13,136
Come on, he wasn't
that stupid.

192
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:14,237
Yes, he was!

193
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:16,072
He thought you were
gonna blow up the moon!

194
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:18,831
Okay, yeah, he's stupid.

195
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,178
He spent the entire
night bragging

196
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:25,847
about how <i>he</i> invented
the word "appe-teasers."

197
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,118
How is that <i>my</i> fault?

198
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,121
You have destroyed my ability
to tolerate idiots.

199
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,522
Now, come with me.

200
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:36,757
Wh-Where are we going?

201
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,124
We're gonna have sex.

202
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,326
Why? I mean, okay.

203
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:43,729
What's going on?

204
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,664
Put on your noise-
canceling headphones,

205
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,832
'cause it's
gonna get loud.

206
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:52,670
Oh! Not <i>this</i> again.

207
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:10,691
In what universe
is this low-pulp?

208
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,395
Good morning, Penny.

209
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:17,130
What, do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

210
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,900
When one gets beaten up
every other day in school,

211
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:23,003
one of necessity develops
a keen sense of hearing.

212
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:26,240
Incidentally, one can
get beaten up in school

213
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:29,376
simply by referring
to oneself as "one."

214
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:30,678
I'm making
English muffins.

215
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,214
Would you like
an English muffin?

216
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:35,750
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
FYI,

217
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:39,649
my noise-canceling headphones
proved ineffective last night.

218
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,681
Yeah, sorry about that.
As a native Texan,

219
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,350
I must say I've never heard
the phrase "yee-haw"

220
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,418
used in quite that context.

221
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,386
Oh, God.

222
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:52,522
"Oh, God."

223
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:55,824
That I've heard
on multiple occasions.

224
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:03,333
In what universe
is that lightly toasted?

225
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,640
This has to be
the worst day of my life.

226
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,542
Good morning, Leonard.

227
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,745
How many times have
I asked you not to do that?

228
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:18,614
Counting this instance? 317.

229
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:21,049
Where's Penny?

230
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,051
She returned
to her apartment.

231
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,253
I presume to shower and vomit.

232
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:28,054
Not necessarily in that order.

233
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:29,823
I wonder why
she didn't say good-bye.

234
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:34,827
Are you expecting me to offer an
explanation of human behavior?

235
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:36,796
I know. I just
thought as an outsider,

236
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:39,465
you might be able to provide
a fresh perspective.

237
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:47,906
I have <i>no</i> difficulty
believing you're not butter.

238
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,110
Oh, hey.
Oh, hi.

239
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,045
Um, I gotta run.
Early shift.

240
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:55,814
Okay, I'll walk
down with you.

241
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:57,716
So, last night was
fun, huh?

242
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:59,117
Yeah, it must have been.

243
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:02,552
I just threw up
in my closet.

244
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,586
Bummer.

245
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:05,321
Anyway, I was thinking
tonight maybe

246
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:06,688
we could catch a movie.

247
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,589
Oh, yeah, tonight's
not great for me.

248
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,057
Doesn't have
to be tonight.

249
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:12,392
I'm free
pretty much always.

250
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:15,261
Leonard, last night
was a mistake.

251
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:18,230
When you say "mistake,"
do you mean a fortunate mistake,

252
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:21,332
like the discovery
of penicillin?

253
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,933
Look, I'm sorry.

254
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:25,503
I was drunk, I was lonely,
I hated Zack.

255
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:27,338
Can we just forget
it ever happened?

256
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:30,540
No, it's pretty well imprinted
on my brain.

257
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,009
Especially
the whole rodeo thing.

258
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,677
Oh, God!

259
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:35,978
So, that's it?

260
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,579
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

261
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,148
Look, I said I'm sorry.
Can't you please let it go?

262
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:41,748
How am I supposed to let it go?

263
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:43,617
You used me for sex!

264
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:49,157
Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.

265
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,725
Good morning, Leonard.

266
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,895
Or should I say "yee-haw"?

267
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:03,503
Holy crap.
What?

268
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:07,707
We finally have proof
that aliens walk among us.

269
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,841
Excuse me?

270
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:11,710
The dating site matched a woman
with Sheldon.

271
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,211
You're kidding.

272
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:14,412
An actual woman?

273
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:17,713
Yeah, look.
Breasts and everything.

274
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:20,982
Trust me, breasts doesn'
necessarily mean woman.

275
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:23,350
Since when?
I'll show you a picture

276
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:26,386
of my Uncle Louie in a
bathing suit sometime.

277
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,723
Leonard,
you gotta see this.

278
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:31,425
We found a match
for Sheldon.

279
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,726
Great.

280
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:35,328
Maybe she can have sex with him,
and then walk out on him

281
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,364
the next morning without so much
as a "How do you do?"

282
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,798
Do you know what
he's talking about?

283
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,999
Nope.
Why don't you ask him?

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,167
Leonard, what are you talking
about?

285
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:43,369
I don't want
to talk about it.

286
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,705
That was
a lousy suggestion.

287
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:47,573
Whatever.
Right now,

288
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:50,108
Dr. Sheldon Cooper has
to send an e-mail

289
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,842
to his perfect match.

290
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:55,111
"Greetings,
fellow life-form..."

291
00:12:57,848 --> 00:13:01,684
If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.

292
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:03,787
If she can do it, I can do it.

293
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:05,690
I can't do it.

294
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,294
Hello?
Oh, hi. Hey.

295
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,629
Hi, Leslie.

296
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:14,432
Leonard Hofstadter.
What're you doing here?

297
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,765
Uh, I know!
It's been a while!

298
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,132
Yeah, 18 months.

299
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,500
Right. Right.

300
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,402
So how you doing?

301
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,436
Fine. You?

302
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,837
Uh, not bad.

303
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:29,406
You remember when
we used to have sex

304
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:32,640
and you said that it didn't mean
anything, it was just for fun?

305
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:33,641
Yeah.

306
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:37,078
You, uh, want
to do that again?

307
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,621
What happened?
Blondie dumped you?

308
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:41,788
She didn't dump me.

309
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:44,157
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

310
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,591
Right.

311
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,960
Um... anyway,
apparently,

312
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,529
it's okay to go back to people
you're no longer seeing

313
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,664
and have recreational sex
with them.

314
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,598
Uh-huh.

315
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,334
So, what do you say?

316
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,469
Let me think about it.

317
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:08,577
She's not coming back.

318
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,980
Uh-oh.

319
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,948
She wants to meet us.

320
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:15,483
Not us. Him.

321
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,885
Yes, but him doesn't
even know about her.

322
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,987
Well, him about to
find out about her.

323
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,256
Really? Us gonna tell him?

324
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:25,291
Who's going to tell
whom about what?

325
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,459
Sheldon.

326
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,027
Hey. Hi.

327
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:30,028
Your surprise confuses me.

328
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,097
I live here.

329
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:34,365
Right.

330
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:38,169
So, listen, what are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

331
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,603
Be more specific.

332
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:40,804
4:30.

333
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:42,039
That's not afternoon.

334
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,507
That's preevning.

335
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,509
What?

336
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,177
It's a time of day I invented.

337
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,713
It better defines
the ambiguous period

338
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:53,283
between afternoon and evening:
preevning.

339
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:56,886
I'm fairly certain it will catch
on as it fills a desperate need.

340
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,354
Right, okay.

341
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,757
What are you doing
tomorrow preevning?

342
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:02,292
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

343
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:04,059
Saturday night is laundry night.

344
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,126
So I'll be spending
the preevning pre-sorting

345
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:08,658
and pre-soaking.

346
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,360
Okay, what if I
were to tell you,
tomorrow, at 4:30,

347
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,962
you could meet a woman who has
been scientifically chosen

348
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:16,930
to be your perfect mate?

349
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:20,266
I would snort in derision
and throw my arms in the air,

350
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:24,069
exhausted
by your constant tomfoolery.

351
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,571
But it's true.

352
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,175
But we-we put all
your vital information

353
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,376
into this dating site,

354
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,477
answered all their questions
just like you would,

355
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,312
and they found
a match for you.

356
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:37,547
Her name is
Amy Farrah Fowler.

357
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:38,949
Please.

358
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,750
Even assuming
you could answer any question

359
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,551
the way I would,
the algorithms used

360
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:44,987
by matchmaking sites
are complete hokum.

361
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:47,222
And that's exactly the answer
we gave to the question:

362
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:48,890
"What is your attitude
towards online dating?"

363
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:52,827
Howard wanted to write
"mumbo jumbo," but I said no.

364
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:56,563
Our Sheldon would
say "hokum."

365
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,933
Come on, where's your
scientific curiosity?

366
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,367
Well, most of it
is being applied

367
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,902
to unraveling the secrets
of the universe

368
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:05,437
while the rest of it's
wondering why

369
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:07,372
I'm having this conversation
with you.

370
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:09,341
Okay, how about this.

371
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:13,078
Even Spock had a date
once every seven years.

372
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,246
He didn't date.

373
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,514
It was <i>pon farr.</i>

374
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,882
His blood boiled
with mating lust.

375
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:20,652
Well, why-why don't you
start with a cup of coffee,

376
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:24,622
and you can <i>pon farr</i>
Amy Farrah Fowler later.

377
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,157
I don't drink coffee.

378
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:28,124
All right, you can
have a hot chocolate.

379
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,290
As I will not be engaging
in this nonsense,

380
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,689
my choice of beverage is moot.

381
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,757
But for the record,

382
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,125
I only drink hot chocolate

383
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,260
in months with an "R" in them.

384
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,895
Why?

385
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,064
What's life without whimsy?

386
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,534
Okay, I'm out.

387
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:53,406
Sheldon, I've hidden
the dirty sock

388
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:55,808
from the roof somewhere
in your apartment.

389
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,611
Unless you are willing to come
with us to meet this girl,

390
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:02,780
it will remain there forever.

391
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,149
You're bluffing.

392
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,317
Are you willing to risk it?

393
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:11,620
Curse you.

394
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,312
30 feet.

395
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:45,553
Oh. Hey, Leonard.

396
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:49,155
I was a perfectly happy,
geeky, little lonely guy,

397
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:52,123
and you ruined me!

398
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,024
Are you drunk?

399
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:56,760
Come on. We're gonna have sex,
and it's not gonna mean a thing!

400
00:17:56,761 --> 00:18:00,229
Are you out
of your mind?!

401
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:05,868
I'm really starting to think
there's a double standard here.

402
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:12,772
In a few minutes,

403
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:15,574
when I gloat over the
failure of this enterprise,

404
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:17,442
how would you
prefer I do it?

405
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:18,777
The standard
"I told you so"?

406
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,412
The classic
"neener-neener"?

407
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:23,181
Or just my normal look
of haughty derision?

408
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,984
You don't know
we're wrong yet.

409
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:29,920
Haughty derision it is.

410
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:31,254
Excuse me.

411
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:32,455
I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.

412
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:33,689
You're Sheldon Cooper.

413
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,690
Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

414
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:38,658
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been taken in

415
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,993
by unsupportable mathematics

416
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,961
designed to prey
on the gullible and the lonely.

417
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:45,063
Additionally,
I'm being blackmailed

418
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,998
with a hidden dirty sock.

419
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:51,201
If that was slang,
I'm unfamiliar with it.

420
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:54,871
If it was literal, I share your
aversion to soiled hosiery.

421
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:56,372
In any case,

422
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,440
I'm here because my
mother and I have agreed

423
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,675
that I will date at
least once a year.

424
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:01,976
Interesting.

425
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:05,280
My mother and I have
the same agreement about church.

426
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,584
I don't object to the
concept of a deity,

427
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:10,786
but I'm baffled by the notion
of one that takes attendance.

428
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:14,556
Well, then you might want
to avoid East Texas.

429
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:15,757
Noted.

430
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:17,358
Now, before this
goes any further,

431
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,794
you should know that all
forms of physical contact

432
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:23,096
up to and including
coitus are off the table.

433
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,866
May I buy you a beverage?

434
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,435
Tepid water, please.

435
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,676
Good God, what
have we done?
