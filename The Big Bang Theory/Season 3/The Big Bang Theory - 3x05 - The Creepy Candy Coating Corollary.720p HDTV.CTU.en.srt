1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,150
All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,090
and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,030
Choke on that, sucka.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,820
Okay, well, then I'll just cut
your vines with my ruby sword.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,650
That's right, I did it. I cut 'em.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,730
Um...

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,550
I have a question.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,850
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,180
elf beats water sprite,

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,790
and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,560
Unless you have a carrot of power.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,300
Okay, I've got another question.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,050
When does this get fun?

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,960
Are we going to talk

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,380
or are we going to play "Mystic Warriors of Ka-ah"?

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,540
Just play potion card.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,440
Which one?

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,390
It doesn't matter.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,170
You can't possibly win.

20
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,680
Sheldon, don't ruin the game.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,720
How could he ruin the game?

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,330
Given the cards that have already been played,

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,350
Penny can only be holding necromancer potions,

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,680
which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers,

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,470
and there are no more of either left to be drawn.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,400
The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are:

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,790
four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.

28
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,320
See? Ruined.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,260
Sheldon, that is incredible.

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,810
From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,230
Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,290
"Photographic" is a misnomer.

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,320
I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times.

34
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,310
Most recently last year during lunch

35
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,970
on the afternoon of may seventh.

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,690
You had turkey and complained it was dry.

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,810
Oh, I guess game's over.

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,520
Really? Oh, great.

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,530
I mean, aw.

40
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,270
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Why?

41
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,620
Because the last me I didn't go,

42
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,220
I ended up playing "Mystic Warlords of Ka"

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,650
Not "Ka". "Ka-ah".

44
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,390
Buh-eye.

45
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,060
See ya.

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Still can't believe she's going out with me.

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,900
Nobody can.

48
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,160
That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,750
What?

50
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,770
You and I made a pact

51
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,190
that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend,

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,780
that person would have his girlfriend

53
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,950
hook the other guy up

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,440
with one of her girlfriends.

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't remember that.

56
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,980
June 30th, 2004.

57
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,910
Opening day of Spiderman 2 at the AMC Pasadena.

58
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,710
They only had red icees, no blue.

59
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,060
Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,500
Yeah so-- you've been with Penny for like a month and a half now.

61
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,500
Where's my shorty, Morty?

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,350
Howard, you can't hold me to that.

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,570
- Wait, why not?
- Because when I made that agreement,

64
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,200
I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend.

65
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,700
And I was positive you never would.

66
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,180
Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,470
You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge

68
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,390
in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.

69
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, so that's how it works?

70
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,790
I have a teeny bladder and now I don't get a hot girlfriend?

71
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,780
Yeah... Raj that's how it works.

72
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,730
Damn.

"The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary"

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,900
Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,850
I'm sorry, no.

84
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,080
But you have a whole bunch of 'em.

85
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,560
Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system.

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,350
Lap, hands, face and personal emergency.

87
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,100
If you like, starting tomorrow,

88
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,300
I'll add a guest napkin,

89
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,490
but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.

90
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,790
Good luck. That's the face napkin.

91
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,340
So, have you talked to Penny yet?

92
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,330
No, I haven't.

93
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,570
Why not?

94
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,780
Because I've been busy, because I haven't figured out

95
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,830
a way to bring it up,

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,930
and mostly... and I can't stress how key this is... 

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,580
because I don't want to.

98
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,780
Leonard, a pact is a pact.

99
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,620
You have to get Penny to fix me up.

100
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,570
It's not that simple.

101
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,770
What am I supposed to say?

102
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,500
"Penny, do you have any friends you'd like to never hear from again?"

103
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,990
Come on, I'm smart,

104
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,860
I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.

105
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,380
It's true.

106
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,320
I've seen him at the beach.

107
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,200
He's like a human chicken wing.

108
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,630
Leonard, come on.

109
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,240
Fine. I'll ask if she has a friend for you.

110
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,620
A hot friend.

111
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,490
Right.

112
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,380
And tall.

113
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,880
I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain

114
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,020
before they're 20.

115
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,190
I'll see what I can do.

116
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,810
Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?

117
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,510
I'd imagine you heard any number of things today.

118
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,180
When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, "Hello, Raj".

119
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,250
"How are you, Raj?"

120
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,780
Given that you're wearing
a new sweater-vest,

121
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,290
you may have heard "new sweater vest?".

122
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,080
And possibly, though far less likely, "nice sweater-vest".

123
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,990
Why don't I just tell you what I heard today.

124
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,900
That would probably save us some time.

125
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,720
Saturday night at the comic book store,

126
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,760
they're having a "Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah" tournament.

127
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,270
First prize is $500 dollars.

128
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,020
If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.

129
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest

130
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,070
in playing a game in which I find no challenge.

131
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,660
What about the money?

132
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,810
I have money.

133
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,600
This is other money.

134
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,160
How does it different
from the money I have?

135
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,310
Half of it will be mine.

136
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,930
Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?

137
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,760
Leonard, help.

138
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,350
Are you kidding?

139
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,540
I couldn't even talk him into giving me
one of his freakin' napkins.

140
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,810
Wow, you really are a genius.

141
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,520
Not really.

142
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,770
I googled how to do that.

143
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,690
So, listen...

144
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,690
Have you ever made a
pact with someone?

145
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,370
You mean like a pinky swear?

146
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,510
Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.

147
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,500
Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I

148
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,780
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

149
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,340
You know, from Sesame Street?

150
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,570
I-I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.

151
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,950
Knowing fact, we both wanted Ernie.

152
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,740
We didn't speak again until middle school.

153
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,610
Over puppets?

154
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,320
The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.

155
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,960
Okay.

156
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,050
Speaking of what the heart wants... 

157
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,520
Um... a long time ago,

158
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,920
I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.

159
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay, I don't know where you're going with this,

160
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,230
but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.

161
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,610
No, no, nothing like that.

162
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,190
The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend,

163
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,740
we'd have her fix the other one up

164
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,180
with one of her friends.

165
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,550
And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.

166
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,930
Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna bring it up before sex.

167
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,620
And during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so...

168
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.

169
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,220
C'mon-- it doesn't have to be a good friend.

170
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,540
And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.

171
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,180
The problem isn't what's on the inside.

172
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,550
It's the creepy candy coating.

173
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,690
Will you at least think about it?

174
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,960
Just as a favor to me?

175
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,980
Oh, great thing about Ernie,

176
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,170
was he never asked me for anything.

177
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,510
He just gave.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,520
Got it. Got it. Got it.
Got it. Got it. Got it.

179
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,950
Betty and Veronica?

180
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,970
Off.

181
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,840
Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow.

182
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,060
Want me to set one aside for you?

183
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,330
Thank you.

184
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,380
You just robbed me of the opportunity

185
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,970
to stumble upon the figurine

186
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,780
and make the oh-so-satisfying journey

187
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,090
from discovery to desire to possession.

188
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,020
All right, I won't set one aside for you.

189
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,190
But I must have it.

190
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,760
- Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
- Thank you.

191
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,840
You know, I can buy all these things online.

192
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,140
I come here for the personal service.

193
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,240
Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up

194
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,830
for the mystic warlords tournament.

195
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,720
The Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?

196
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,050
Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.

197
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,260
Excuse me.

198
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,040
Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher

199
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,080
on Star Trek: The next generation

200
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,200
is going to be participating in your tournament?

201
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,030
Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?

202
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,720
No wait-- you don't understand.

203
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,260
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton

204
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,770
Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.

205
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,260
Ooh, what a coincidence.

206
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,310
May be you can discuss
that with him

207
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,010
while you're playing
in the tournament.

208
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,890
- Sign here.
- Yeah-- I was such a fan

209
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,390
that in 1995, I traveled ten hours by bus

210
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,530
to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi,

211
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,110
wearing my star flee academy cadet uniform

212
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,600
in order to meet Wil Wheaton

213
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,780
and get him to autograph

214
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,110
my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.

215
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,700
Ooh, it'll be like a reunion then.

216
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,300
Sign here.

217
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,110
My arduous journey, however,

218
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,340
was for naught.

219
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,110
Although advertised to appear, he did not show up.

220
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,290
It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

221
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,710
Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him.

222
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,860
Sign here.

223
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,190
It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton

224
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,530
currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list... 

225
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,040
right between director Joel Schumacher,

226
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,690
who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise,

227
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,350
and Billy Sparks,

228
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,550
who lived down the street from me

229
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,250
and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.

230
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,980
Okay, I get it. He's a bad guy.

231
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,630
Sign here.

232
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,010
In the wooords of Khan Noonien Singh

233
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,740
in the immortal wrath of Khan, "he tasks me...".

234
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,130
"He tasks me and I shall have him".

235
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,610
No doubt, sign here.

236
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,760
"From hell's heart, I stab at thee".

237
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,060
All right, Raj, looks like you're teamed up

238
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,060
with "die, Wil Wheaton, die".

239
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,260
So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.

240
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,960
She's adorable, Howard.

241
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,310
I think you'll like her.

242
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,410
Great.

243
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,190
So what did you tell her about me?

244
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,960
Did you mention the body fat?

245
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,680
No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.

246
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,940
Good, good.

247
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,150
I just told her you're an aerospace engineer,

248
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,350
you speak five languages... 

249
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,320
six if you count Klingon.

250
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,310
Girls don't count Klingon, Howard.

251
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,840
Right?

252
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,870
Right.

253
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,540
Oh. And I told her you have

254
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,700
an unhealthy attachment to your mother.

255
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,020
What?

256
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,250
I'm kidding.

257
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,490
Another delightful surprise for her.

258
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,060
Sheldon, it's your play.

259
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,440
Sheldon.

260
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,710
My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy

261
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,610
with a cursed mace. Game.

262
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,770
Sorry, boys.

263
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,050
Say hi to your mother when she picks you up.

264
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,240
Or I could just tell her later tonight!

265
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,690
We pawned them, dude! Up top!

266
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,030
Look at him.

267
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,440
Wil Wheaton, my old friend.

268
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,730
I have chased you 'round the moons of Nibia

269
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,320
and 'round the Antares maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames!

270
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,510
You know, you keep quoting Wrath of Khan,

271
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,740
but he was in next generation.

272
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,180
It's a totally different set of characters.

273
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,380
Silence!

274
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,230
How much longer must I wait for my revenge?

275
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,260
Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match

276
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,970
and we beat lonely Larry and captain sweatpants

277
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,140
in the next round,

278
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,070
we'll face off for the championship.

279
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,360
So, my path to satisfaction is blocked

280
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,920
by lonely Larry and captain sweatpants.

281
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,390
Very well.

282
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,360
They must be destroyed.

283
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,780
Dude, you have to stop talking like that.

284
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,640
It's really lame.

285
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,900
Silence!

286
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,840
So, Penny tells me you're working as a waitress

287
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,720
to put yourself through grad school.

288
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,840
That's pretty great. What are you studying?

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,370
Microbiology.

290
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,810
Oh, cool. So you could study me.

291
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't understand.

292
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,700
Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.

293
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,480
I know, I'm studying it.

294
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:57,360
And I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing.

295
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,290
It's a joke.

296
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,540
Are you sure?

297
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,390
Do you like science-fiction?

298
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,410
No.

299
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,660
Role-playing games?

300
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,770
Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?

301
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,070
Either.

302
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,890
No.

303
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,800
Gonna be a long night.

304
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,220
Yeah well, it's your fault.

305
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,870
I had to ask. You didn't have to say yes.

306
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,440
You like magic?

307
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,400
Not really.

308
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,470
Okay.

309
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,240
Long a long night.

310
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,980
I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy,

311
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,780
which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord.

312
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,660
Then captain sweatpants, molten river.

313
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,860
I play nightshade dryad. Game, set and match.

314
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,450
Now fetch me Wil Wheaton!

315
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,930
Bot-tash bir jab-loo-di rekh kkhakkh-o ny!

316
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,290
Did that guy just say

317
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,560
"revenge is a dish best served cold" in Klingon?

318
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,420
I believe so.

319
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,850
What is wrong with him?

320
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,470
Everyone has a different theory.

321
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,880
How about computers?

322
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,070
Do you like computers?

323
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,930
I use them. I don't like them.

324
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,900
Okay...

325
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,530
Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?

326
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,280
A puppy once bit my face.

327
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,870
Of course it did.

328
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,390
How about that? Einstein was wrong.

329
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,880
What?

330
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,960
Approaching the speed of light

331
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,970
doesn't slow down time.

332
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,890
Approaching them does.

333
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,280
Excuse me.

334
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,610
Oh, damn. It's my mother.

335
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,860
Are you going to answer it?

336
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm torn.

337
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,890
She might be dying, and, you know,

338
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,730
I wouldn't want to miss that.

339
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,880
On the other hand,

340
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,480
if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.

341
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,160
I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.

342
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,030
Not as crazy as my mother makes me.

343
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,830
Oh, yeah?

344
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,800
Does your mother call you every day at work

345
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,720
to see if you've had a healthy lunch?

346
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,340
My mother calls me at work

347
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,260
to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.

348
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,160
Okay, well, does she lay out

349
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,440
your clothes for you in the morning

350
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,270
like you're nine years old?

351
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,910
You live with your mother?

352
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,090
No. That's the sad part.

353
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,910
Ooh, rough.

354
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,590
Okay, check this out.

355
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,040
My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten

356
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,040
so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.

357
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,030
That's nothing.

358
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,380
I couldn't ride a bicycle

359
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,130
'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump

360
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,530
and lose my virginity.

361
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,790
Oh, wow.

362
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,070
You didn't, did you?

363
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,580
Not on a bicycle.

364
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,840
In a camry.

365
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,520
Oh!

366
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,090
Corolla!

367
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,850
- More wine?
- I'd love some.

368
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,680
Listen, you have to come

369
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,890
to Shabbat dinner at my house sometime.
(Shabbat: seventh day of the Jewish week)

370
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,750
Why?

371
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,300
A catholic girl like you

372
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,590
wearing a big cross like that

373
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,140
might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm

374
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,530
I've been hoping for.

375
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,210
Okay, but only if you come

376
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,900
to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.

377
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,820
It's a date.

378
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,600
Am I a matchmaker or what?

379
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,080
Lava serpent.

380
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,580
Nest of snakes.

381
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,910
Underworld guardian.

382
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,970
Underworld guardian.

383
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,190
We skirmish to the death.

384
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
Invisibility spell.

385
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,960
Luminescence spell.

386
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,280
Water nymph.

387
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,300
Fire demon.

388
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,540
Two-headed tiger.

389
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,980
Three-headed lion.

390
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,270
Sulphur.

391
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,710
Brimstone.

392
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,960
Problem, Wil Wheaton?

393
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,610
Hang on.

394
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,590
You're holding two moderate spell cards,

395
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,980
a small rock and a potion of Zancor,

396
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,930
which will be about as much help

397
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,300
as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth.

398
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,030
Your only move is to play the potion,

399
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,300
lose the skirmish,

400
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,650
and two moves later, the game.

401
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,310
I think he's got me.

402
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,120
The year was 1995.

403
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,010
The place: Jackson, Mississippi.

404
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,820
Having spent ten hours on a bus,

405
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,740
during which I had to twice violate

406
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,430
my personal rule against relieving myself

407
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,110
on board a moving vehicle...

408
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,740
I finally arrived

409
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,410
at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention

410
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,960
only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had

411
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,900
better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.

412
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,030
What?

413
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,860
You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.

414
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,250
Now.

415
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,050
I have my revenge.

416
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,790
You went to the '95 Dixie-Trek?

417
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,290
Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died,

418
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,730
and I had to go to her funeral.

419
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,190
Your mee-maw died?

420
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,230
That's terrible.

421
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,360
Yeah, it was.

422
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,870
But... I'm really sorry that I disappointed you.

423
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,790
No, no, I understand.

424
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,420
Anything happened to my mee-maw,

425
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,750
I'd be one inconsolable moon pie.

426
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,730
I should clarify that statement

427
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,740
by explaining that she calls me "moon pie."

428
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,810
It'a special relationship, isn't it,

429
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,330
between a boy and his grandmother?

430
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,170
- Oh, yes.
- Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas!

431
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,270
Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!

432
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,140
It's okay, Sheldon.

433
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,340
I let you down.

434
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,750
I deserve it.

435
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,180
Potion of Zancor.

436
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,630
What are you waiting for?!

437
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,300
Kill Wil Wheaton!

438
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,630
From hell's heart, stab at him!

439
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,800
I can't.

440
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,110
Sure you can. Do it! Do it!

441
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,050
No.

442
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,820
I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton,

443
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,440
the man who destroyed my dreams.

444
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,680
But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved is mee-maw.

445
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,100
Enchanted bunny.

446
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,440
No! Not enchanted bunny!

447
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,460
I call my mee-maw "nana".

448
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,850
And she's going be very happy

449
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,780
to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny.

450
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,170
Game over, moon pie.

451
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,810
I... I... I don't understand.

452
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,530
Your grandmother's alive?

453
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,470
Oh, you catch on quick.

454
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,660
Come on, Stewie, let's get our prize money.

455
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,940
That was fun.

456
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,810
Wheaton!

457
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,380
Wheaton!

458
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,880
Wheaton!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
