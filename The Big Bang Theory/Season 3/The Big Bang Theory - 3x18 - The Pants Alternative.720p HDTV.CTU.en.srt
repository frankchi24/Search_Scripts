1
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:04,291
Okay in <i>Avatar</i> when
they gave sex in Pandora

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:07,160
they hook up their ponytails,
so we know their ponytails

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,896
are like their junk.

4
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:11,531
Yeah... so?

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,700
So, when they ride horses
and fly on the birds,

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,068
they also use their ponytails.

7
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:16,269
What's your point?

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:18,271
My point is, if I were a horse or a bird,

9
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,751
I'd be very nervous
around James Cameron.

10
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,711
It amazes me how you
constantly obsess

11
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:26,179
over fictional details

12
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,781
when there are more important things

13
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,149
in the real world to worry about.

14
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:33,586
For example, why wasn't William
Shatner in the new <i>Star Trek</i> movie?

15
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:34,621
Hey, Sheldon.

16
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,089
I was up in the administration office,

17
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:37,457
and I happened to overhear

18
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:38,792
the name of the winner

19
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:41,161
of this year's Chancellor's
Award for Science.

20
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:43,229
And you want to rub
my nose in the fact

21
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:45,098
that my contributions are
being overlooked again?

22
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:49,135
I am the William Shatner
of theoretical physics.

23
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:50,203
All right, I'll play.

24
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:51,805
What self-important, preening fraud

25
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:53,373
are they honoring this year?

26
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:57,093
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that.
You.

27
00:00:58,444 --> 00:00:59,979
- I won?
- You won.

28
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,415
I won!

29
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,217
This is astonishing.

30
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,820
Not that I won the award--
no one deserves it more.

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,388
Actually, I guess I misspoke.

32
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:11,458
It's not astonishing;
more like inevitable.

33
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:12,826
I'm not sure what to do first.

34
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,161
Maybe I should call my mother.

35
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,296
Wait! I know-- I'm going
to conduct an interview

36
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:18,976
with myself and post it online.

37
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:22,902
Well, good for him.

38
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:25,805
Yeah, the one thing
the William Shatner

39
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:30,075
of theoretical physics
needed was an ego boost.

40
00:01:56,355 --> 00:01:59,235
(Dramatic movie music plays over TV)

41
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,007
Didn't it look like that spear

42
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,142
was going to go right
through your skull?

43
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:18,842
No.

44
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:21,914
Hey, you didn't want
a Slurpee at 7-Eleven,

45
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:23,874
you don't get glasses.

46
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,552
(Phone ringing)

47
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:29,488
Oh, that will be another
congratulatory call for me.

48
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,223
Uh, mute, please.

49
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:34,303
Wait, wait. Hang on-- flaming arrow.

50
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,163
Hello? (TV audio muted)

51
00:02:38,363 --> 00:02:41,563
Oh, Chancellor Morton,
how are you, sir?

52
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:44,703
Yes, I was expecting your call.

53
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,063
(Quietly): Three years ago.

54
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:48,774
SHELDON: I see.

55
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:51,777
Wait. What happens if I
choose not to give a speech?

56
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,445
Uh-huh.

57
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:56,925
And if I don't want to forfeit the award?

58
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,152
Well, you've got that tied
up in a neat little bow.

59
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:01,220
All right.

60
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,821
Thank you.

61
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:04,189
Problem.

62
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,657
What?

63
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:08,393
They expect me to give
a speech at the banquet.

64
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:09,995
I can't give a speech.

65
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:11,797
Well, no, you're mistaken.

66
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:15,066
You give speeches all the time.

67
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:20,072
What you can't do is shut up.

68
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:21,840
KOOTHRAPPALI: Yeah,
before the movie,

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,211
you did 20 minutes on why
guacamole turns brown.

70
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,947
It turned brown while you were talking.

71
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,884
I am perfectly comfortable
speaking to small groups.

72
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:34,052
I cannot speak to large crowds.

73
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:35,554
What, to you, is a large crowd?

74
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:39,274
Any group big enough
to trample me to death.

75
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:43,462
General rule of thumb is
36 adults or 70 children.

76
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:46,498
Sheldon, congratulations.

77
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:48,166
Brought you a cheesecake from work.

78
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:49,668
You know, 'cause of your award,

79
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,668
not because a busboy sneezed on it.

80
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,342
I'm not accepting the award. Why not?

81
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:00,146
Turns out the great Sheldon
Cooper has stage fright.

82
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:01,847
That's no reason to back out.

83
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,900
You know, I once got a pretty
big honor in high school,

84
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,486
and I was terrified about
appearing in front of a big crowd,

85
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:09,688
but I went through with it,
and you know what?

86
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:12,441
The world looked pretty darn
good sitting on a haystack

87
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:18,001
in the back of a Ford F-150 as a
member of the Corn Queen's Court.

88
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:19,899
Thank you.

89
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,233
Yeah, I'll bear that in mind

90
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:25,593
if I'm ever nominated for
the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

91
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:28,607
Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.

92
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,207
Am I?
Let me tell you a story.

93
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,696
Where's 70 children
when you need them?

94
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:39,518
I was 14 and graduating summa
cum laude from college.

95
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:43,255
"Summa cum laude" is Latin
for "with highest honors."

96
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:45,057
I just love how you always skip

97
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:47,926
over the part where no one asks.

98
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:50,462
I was valedictorian and
expected to give an address.

99
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,698
Even now, I can remember that moment

100
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,901
when I walked up to the podium
and looked out at the crowd.

101
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:57,903
There must have been
thousands of people.

102
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,138
My heart started pounding in my chest.

103
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:01,707
I began to hyperventilate.

104
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:05,377
My vision became blurry,
and before I knew it...

105
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,346
Oh, dear.

106
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,947
Oh, my God.

107
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:10,015
LEONARD: Sheldon?

108
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,583
Sheldon, are you okay?

109
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:13,784
Don't trample me.

110
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,022
SHELDON: Come on, Mother.

111
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:20,058
You know why I can't accept the award.

112
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:24,262
With all due respect,
I don't think praying will help.

113
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:28,367
No, I have not heard the song,
"Jesus, Take the Wheel."

114
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,835
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

115
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:32,371
You don't need to start singing it.

116
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,574
Yes, I'll buy it on the iTunes, Mother.

117
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:37,374
Good-bye, Mother.

118
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:45,017
Hello.

119
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:47,152
Sit down. We want to talk to you.

120
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:48,487
Am I in trouble?

121
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:50,527
Did my mother call you?

122
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:51,990
Just sit.

123
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,861
LEONARD: We think we can
help you with your stage fright.

124
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,295
Oh, I doubt that.

125
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:02,401
I haven't figured out a way, and
I'm much smarter than all of you.

126
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,804
Yes, but you're not smarter
than all of us put together.

127
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:09,073
Oh, I'm sorry.
That is what I meant.

128
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:13,278
Okay. Your problem is, you're
trying to do this all by yourself.

129
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:15,313
We can help you.
We can be your team.

130
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,793
Like, uh,
Professor Xavier and his X-Men.

131
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,523
I do like the X-Men.

132
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,758
Did I see <i>X-Men?</i>

133
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,160
Yeah, we watched it last week.

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,394
You said you liked it.

135
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,394
Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie.

136
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:35,000
So, how about it, Sheldon?

137
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,468
I don't know.

138
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:39,971
If you're my X-Men,
what are your powers?

139
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:43,809
Okay. Well, I am going to take
you shopping, get you a nice suit.

140
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:45,210
Might give you more confidence.

141
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,412
That's not exactly a
mutation that would get you

142
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:50,348
into Xavier's School for Gifted
Youngsters, but go on.

143
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:51,650
Leonard?

144
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,719
I thought I could try to analyze you

145
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,754
and get to the root of your anxiety.

146
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:59,124
What qualifies you to attempt
to understand my mind?

147
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,693
My mother is a highly
regarded psychiatrist,

148
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:04,963
and I've been in therapy
ever since she accused me

149
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,723
of breast-feeding codependently.

150
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,837
Raj says he can teach you...

151
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:13,839
What did you call it?

152
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,479
I don't know-- some
Indian meditation crap.

153
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:19,878
I see.

154
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,847
Well, I assume, since the rest of you

155
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:24,216
have set the bar so low, you're saving

156
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,851
the most impressive
contribution for last.

157
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:27,185
Go ahead, Howard.

158
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:29,453
Dazzle me.

159
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:33,409
My power is the ability to pretend

160
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,705
like I give a damn about
your piddily-ass problems.

161
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:45,602
And that's 24-seven, buddy.

162
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:49,740
And I appreciate the pretense.

163
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,678
So, what do you say, Sheldon?
Are we your X-Men?

164
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:54,880
No.

165
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,283
The X-Men were named for
the "X" in Charles Xavier.

166
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:02,820
Since I am Sheldon Cooper,
you will be my C-Men.

167
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,994
Oh, that's not a good name.

168
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:14,499
(Indian music playing)

169
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,101
Okay, Sheldon.

170
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,803
I'm going to be leading you

171
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:20,005
through a series of
meditation exercises.

172
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:23,308
These methods come from
the ancient gurus of India

173
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:26,788
and have helped me
overcome my own fears.

174
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,514
And yet, you can't speak to women.

175
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:33,819
True, but thanks to meditation,
I am able to stay

176
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,619
in the same room with
them without urinating.

177
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:41,993
Now... (clears throat) close your eyes.

178
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:44,930
Okay, but don't punch me.

179
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,298
What?

180
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,567
When I was little,
my sister would say to me,

181
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,469
"Close your eyes, you'll get a surprise,"

182
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,270
and then she'd punch me.

183
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,106
I'm not going to punch you.

184
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,975
That's what my sister used to say.

185
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,577
Do you want to do this or not?

186
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,378
I'm sorry. Proceed.

187
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,080
All right. (Clears throat)

188
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,149
Imagine yourself in the one place

189
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,917
you feel most at home.

190
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,285
Where is that?

191
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,421
Sim City.

192
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:14,960
More specifically,
the Sim City I designed--

193
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,028
Sheldonopolis.

194
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,498
Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.

195
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,233
Where exactly?

196
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:23,368
Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers?

197
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:27,038
Sheldon Stadium,
home of the Fighting Sheldons?

198
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:28,540
Whatever you like.

199
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,309
I thought this was supposed
to be a guided meditation.

200
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,146
Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.

201
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,347
Really? This time of year?

202
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:36,748
It's a bit nippy.

203
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,817
Then, put on a sweater.

204
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:40,752
Suppose I could run downtown

205
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:44,055
and pick up something at Shel-Mart.

206
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,024
Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.

207
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,360
You know, the nice thing
about Shel-Mart is I own it,

208
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,796
so I get a 15% discount.

209
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:52,497
You own the damn thing.

210
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,466
Just take a freaking sweater!

211
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,668
Look, I didn't turn a profit last quarter

212
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:59,671
by taking product off
the shelves willy-nilly.

213
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:02,440
All right.

214
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,478
You've paid for a sweater,
and you're in Sheldon Square.

215
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,046
(Clears throat) Hang on.

216
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:13,275
It's a cardigan. I have to button it.

217
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:17,055
Oh, no.

218
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:18,223
What now?

219
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:21,259
A Godzilla-like monster
is approaching the city.

220
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,595
I have to get my people to safety.

221
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:26,798
People of Sheldonopolis,
this is your mayor.

222
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:28,066
Follow me.

223
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:31,869
If the children can't run,
leave them behind.

224
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:36,740
Oh, the simulated horror!

225
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:39,843
(Door slamming)

226
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,785
Raj?

227
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:50,989
Just as I suspected.

228
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,791
Meditation is nothing but hokum.

229
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,460
I question your premise.

230
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,695
How is a new suit going to prevent me

231
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,998
from passing out in front of
a ballroom full of people?

232
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,000
It'll give you confidence.

233
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,701
You know, sometimes when
I'm feeling all stressed out

234
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:12,004
about something,
I go out and buy a cute top

235
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,440
or a fun skirt and I have a
whole new outlook on life.

236
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,142
Don't you eventually realize

237
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:18,977
you're just the same
stressed out person

238
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,497
in a cute top or a fun skirt?

239
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,448
Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.

240
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:26,751
Now, let's see what we've got.

241
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:27,919
Ooh!

242
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,322
This is nice.

243
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,225
It's only one color.

244
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,593
Yeah, so?

245
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,796
That's a lot of money for only one color.

246
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:41,533
Fine. Why don't you pick out
what you like.

247
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,069
Hmm.

248
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,969
SHELDON: This is pretty sharp.

249
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:55,478
No, you're wrong.

250
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,716
This is great.

251
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,218
I had a suit like this when I was six.

252
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:07,536
Okay, I think we have a winner.

253
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,596
Where the hell'd you find that?

254
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,965
In the prom department.

255
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,367
It's ridiculous.

256
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:19,487
Says the former member
of the Corn Queen's Court.

257
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,807
Please just try this one on.

258
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:23,842
Okay.

259
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,310
But anything I put on now

260
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,550
is only going to suffer in comparison.

261
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:35,654
This is absurd.

262
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:37,454
I look like a clown.

263
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,827
So, Sheldon...

264
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,399
...how you doing?

265
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:51,036
That's how you start a
psychotherapy session?

266
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,370
"How am I doing?"

267
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,873
I was promised a riverboat journey

268
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,142
into the jungles of my subconscious.

269
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,044
Instead, I get the same question I hear

270
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:03,004
from the lady who slices
my bologna at Ralph's.

271
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,283
I'm sorry, I'll start again.

272
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:07,218
Would it be helpful to you

273
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,421
if I told you about my dreams?

274
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,423
Um, I don't know, maybe.

275
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,758
I recently had a dream

276
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,227
that I was a giant.

277
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,797
But everything around me was to scale,

278
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:21,098
so it all looked normal.

279
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,204
How did you know you were a giant

280
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:28,239
if everything was to scale?

281
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,975
I was wearing size a million pants.

282
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,948
Why don't we just talk?

283
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,083
Ah.

284
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,117
The talking cure.

285
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,585
Classical Freudian. Good choice.

286
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:42,587
If it will help speed things along,

287
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:46,124
uh, my answers to the standard
Rorschach ink blot test are:

288
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:49,127
A) a bat, B) a bat,

289
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,129
C) a bat,

290
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:53,431
and D) my father killing my mother

291
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,733
with a hypodermic needle.

292
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,771
Why don't I just start?

293
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,107
Sometimes

294
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,509
people have trouble
accepting accolades

295
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,444
if, on a subconscious level,

296
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,380
they don't feel they deserve them.

297
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,582
Do you think maybe that's
what's happening here?

298
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,317
Really, Leonard?

299
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,088
You're just going to try to
recycle Adler's doctrine

300
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,523
of the inferiority complex?

301
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,559
I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.

302
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,996
And she'd let me taste some
pieces of cheese for free.

303
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,931
But it could be part of your problem.

304
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,333
Let me give you an example.

305
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,934
When I was eight,

306
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,137
I won a ribbon at the science fair

307
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:35,807
for my project, "Do Lima Beans
Grow Better to Classical Music."

308
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:38,076
But my mother pointed out

309
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:41,012
that it was just a rehash
of my brother's earlier

310
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:44,732
"Do Lima Beans Grow
Worse to Rock 'n' Roll."

311
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:49,220
I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.

312
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,790
And how did that make you feel?

313
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,758
Terrible.

314
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,694
I worked really hard on that project.

315
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:00,131
I stayed up all night singing
the clown's aria from <i>Pagliacci</i>

316
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:03,133
to a lima bean sprout.

317
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,438
Go on.

318
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,440
It wasn't my fault.

319
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,042
I had never seen my brother's project.

320
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,244
And my mother could've told me before

321
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:17,284
instead of at the ceremony
in front of everyone.

322
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:18,550
So, I hear you saying

323
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,886
you're angry with your mother.

324
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,989
Damn right, I'm angry with my mother.

325
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,290
(Crying)

326
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:33,164
For God's sake, I was eight years old.

327
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,066
She humiliated me.

328
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:38,626
That's when the
bed-wetting started again.

329
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:41,639
Thank you, Leonard.

330
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,208
For what?

331
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,009
If someone as damaged as you

332
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,412
can find his way to crawl
out of bed each morning,

333
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:50,782
I think I can face a
simple award ceremony.

334
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,750
Wait, that's it?

335
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,585
I thought we had a whole hour!

336
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:58,556
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

337
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:00,492
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

338
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,894
and it is my very great honor
to introduce the winner

339
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:05,396
of this year's Chancellor's
award for Science

340
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:08,716
and my good friend,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

341
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,536
But before I do,

342
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:14,138
I'd like to share with you a
letter from Sheldon's mother,

343
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,674
who couldn't be here tonight.

344
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:18,343
Isn't that nice?

345
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,311
His mother sent him a letter.

346
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,347
She's proud of him.

347
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,216
I wonder what that feels like.

348
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:28,453
"Dear Shelly."

349
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,788
That's what she calls him.

350
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:32,724
Shelly-- it's a pet name.

351
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,926
You know what my mother's
pet name for me is?

352
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,626
Leonard.

353
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:41,733
But I digress.

354
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:42,800
"Dear Shelly..."

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,736
Oh, dear.

356
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:45,737
What's the matter?

357
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:46,938
I'm getting dizzy.

358
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,273
Don't worry.

359
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:51,241
You're surrounded by your C-Men.

360
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,611
I can't do this.

361
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:55,013
I'm going to faint.

362
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:56,014
Here, drink this.

363
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,081
It'll relax you.

364
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:58,283
Alcohol?

365
00:16:58,483 --> 00:16:59,651
I don't drink alcohol.

366
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,351
Fine, faint.

367
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,858
I don't feel different.

368
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,326
This alcohol is defective.

369
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:11,762
Here, see if this one works.

370
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:14,699
First of all,

371
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:18,736
the projects were totally different.

372
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:19,938
I was showing

373
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,906
that classical music
nurtures lima beans

374
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,374
and makes them grow, but my mother

375
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,276
didn't hear me.

376
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,911
If you'd like to look at the relationship

377
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,947
between nurturing and growth,
I'd like to point out

378
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:32,483
that my brother is eight
inches taller than me.

379
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,519
SHELDON (singsongy): I'm ready.

380
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,988
Oh,

381
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:38,256
right.

382
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,325
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor

383
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,026
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

384
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,729
(Applause)

385
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,333
Thanks, shorty, I'll take it from here.

386
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,069
All right,
you people ready to have some fun?

387
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,671
You have a basic understanding
of differential calculus

388
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:55,873
and at least one year
of algebraic topology?

389
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,553
Well, here come the jokes.

390
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:02,884
Why did the chicken
cross the Mobius strip?

391
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,183
To get to the same side-- bazinga!

392
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,320
All right,
a neutron walks into a bar and asks,

393
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,421
"How much for a drink?"

394
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,901
The bartender says,
"For you, no charge."

395
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:19,696
Hello?

396
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:21,532
I know you're out there.

397
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:23,468
I can hear you metabolizing oxygen

398
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:26,036
and expelling carbon dioxide.

399
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,008
Looks like we have some academic
dignitaries in the audience.

400
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,644
Dr. Randall from the
geology department--

401
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,380
only man who's happy when
they take his work for granite.

402
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,714
Ba-da cha!

403
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,219
I kid the geologists, of course,

404
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:44,822
but it's only 'cause I have
no respect for the field.

405
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,991
Let's get serious for a moment.

406
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,931
Why are we all here?

407
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:55,833
'Cause we're scientists.

408
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,770
And what do scientists study?

409
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,505
The universe.

410
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,674
And what's the universe made of?

411
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:05,209
I am so glad you asked.

412
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,345
# There's antimony #

413
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,213
# Arsenic, aluminum, selenium #

414
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:11,516
# And hydrogen and oxygen
and nitrogen and rhenium #

415
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,052
# And nickel, neodymium, neptunium,
germanium #

416
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,153
Everybody!

417
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,155
# And iron, americium #

418
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:20,058
# Ruthenium, uranium,
europium, zirconium, #

419
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,592
# Lutetium, vanadium #

420
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:22,593
Just the Asians!

421
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:24,395
# And lanthanum and osmium #

422
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,995
# And astatine and radium... #

423
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,760
Penny, Leonard.

424
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,229
Would you be able to
answer some questions

425
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,433
I'm having about the
events of last night?

426
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,068
Sure.

427
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:55,203
Question one...

428
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,205
where are my pants?

429
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,965
You might want to check YouTube.

430
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,078
What do I search?

431
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:06,078
It's already loaded. Just hit play.

432
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,586
SHELDON (on video): All right, people,
let's get down to the math.

433
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:14,022
It is only three dimensional thinking

434
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:16,291
that limits our imagination.

435
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,660
Can I take my pants off over my head?

436
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,962
Of course not.

437
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:22,530
My body's in the way.

438
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,736
But if we had access
to higher dimensions,

439
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,607
we could move our
pants around our bodies

440
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,844
through the fourth dimension

441
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:40,013
and our days of dropping
trousers would be over.

442
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,053
Oh, Lord...

443
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,589
This couldn't be any more humiliating.

444
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,690
Give it a minute.

445
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,658
Now, for the astronomers

446
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,560
in the audience, get ready to see

447
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,840
the dark side of the moon.

448
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,630
And here's Uranus.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
