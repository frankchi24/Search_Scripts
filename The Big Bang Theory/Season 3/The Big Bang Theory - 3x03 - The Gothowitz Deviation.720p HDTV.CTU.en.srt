1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,030
* Going out tonight, I'm feeling all right

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
* Going to let it all hang out

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,770
* Wanna make some noise, even raise my voice

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,680
* Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,140
Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,860
No.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,100
Why not?

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,490
Penny, while I subscribe to the "Many Worlds" theory

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,090
which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,270
in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,740
Are you fun in any of them?

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,210
The math would suggest that in a few I'm a clown made of candy.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,240
But I don't dance.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,070
Alright, want some French toast?

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,400
It's oatmeal day.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,890
Tell you what, next French toast day, I’ll make you oatmeal.

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,060
Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French toast day?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
Morning.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,020
Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,400
Sorry, I haven't given her your schedule yet.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,750
It's an iCal download. She can put it right in her phone.

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,350
And I thought we agreed that you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,250
We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,610
I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,430
No, her bed kind of... broke.

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,930
That doesn't seem likely.

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,230
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,240
Even the addition of a second normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure,

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,200
much less a homunculus such as yourself.

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,590
A homunculus?

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,470
Perfectly formed miniature human being.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,260
Oh, you're my little homunculus.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,060
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,960
Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?

35
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,050
I want oatmeal.

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,330
Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose room-mate isn't a giant pain in the ass.

37
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,410
I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

38
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,980
But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.

39
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,620
You know what, I give up. He's impossible.

40
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,540
I can't be impossible, I exist.

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,720
I believe what you meant to say is, "I gIve up, he's improbable."

42
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,690
Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,300
What am I supposed to do--eat French toast on a Monday?

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,710
Now, that would be impossible.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,750
I'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,860
You can catch even more flies with manure.  What's your point?

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,420
It's a...

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,620
Boy, that does smell good.

49
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,760
Too bad it's Monday.

53
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,190
Okay, Kim the night manager went on maternity leave,

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,170
and her husband's name is Sandy, right?

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,790
So get this-- her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,310
I know. What are the odds?

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,950
Easily calculable. We begin by identifying a set of married couples with unisex names.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,060
We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work--

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,980
the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example look at...

60
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,330
Sheldon-- it's an amazing coincidence. Can we leave it at that?

61
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,340
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,490
Ooh, Penny, it's just if The Cheese Cake Factory is run by witches.

63
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,860
Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.

64
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,190
Come on, you guys, let it go.

65
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,150
Fine, whatever.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,220
Are you finished?

67
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,910
Well, thank you. How thoughtful.

68
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,470
Would you like a chocolate?

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,970
Um, yeah, sure.

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,500
Thanks.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,800
What was that?

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,050
You said be nice to Penny.

73
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,850
I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.

74
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,210
It does. But in my experience, you don't.

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,030
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

76
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,990
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

77
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,390
Now that's you, obnoxious and insufferable.

78
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,030
What's going on, day dwellers?

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,250
Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"?

80
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,190
No. Raj and I are going to a Goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people.

81
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,070
Anybody want to come along?

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,500
Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?

83
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,240
No, no. I'm going out like this...

84
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,120
Howard, what did you do?

85
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,800
They're called tattoo sleeves. Look.

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,670
I got them online. Raj got a set, too.

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,260
Fantastic, right?

88
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,340
Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced,

89
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,620
take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.

90
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,060
You know, I've always wanted to go to a Goth nightclub.

91
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,210
- Really?
- Bazinga!

92
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,450
None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?

93
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,110
Okay, how about you two? Look, I've got some extra tat sleeves.

94
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,340
Why are you carrying extras?

95
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,240
In case I snag one on someone's nipple ring.

96
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,710
Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.

97
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,550
Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?

98
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,190
In this case, you bet she is.

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,880
Yes, she's pushy, and yes, he's whipped, but that's not the expression.

100
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,640
Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.

101
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,260
They're gonna get beaten up at that club.

102
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,930
They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens.

103
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,010
Oh, sorry, Sheldon. I almost sat in your spot.

104
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,630
Did you? I didn't notice. Have a chocolate.

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,440
Thank you.

106
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,750
I think we're fitting in quite nicely.

107
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,960
It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.

108
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,080
What's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?

109
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,780
Hello? It looks like blood.

110
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,140
Did you even read the "Wiki how" link I sent you on being Goth?

111
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,770
No, I'm behind on my Wiki-reading.

112
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,510
I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.

113
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,730
What?

114
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,400
I finished reading the Pelican Brief

115
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,240
And loved it so much, I dived right into The Client.

116
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,880
He was a lawyer himself, so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.

117
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,540
Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.

118
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,530
Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it.

119
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,570
Can you pass the chex mix, please?

120
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,990
Thank you.

121
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,480
We are lost boys.

122
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,820
Good for you.

123
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm actually much more lost than he is.

124
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,010
- Nice ink.
- Thanks.

125
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,940
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

126
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,580
Two light beers.

127
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,570
Light beers. Well, Wiki-how about that.

128
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,710
- What’s your names?
- I’m Howard.

129
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,390
- Raj.  I’m Bethany.

130
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,580
Nice to meet you, Bethany.

131
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes, very nice.

132
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,890
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I’m Sarah. Not that anyone cares.

133
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,240
Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?

134
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,970
What's this cartoon called again?

135
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,880
Demon samurai.

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,930
It’s not a cartoon. It's anime.

137
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,810
Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May.

138
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,400
Anna May Fletcher.

139
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,190
She was born with one nostril.

140
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,980
Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,680
You're here a lot now.

142
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip.

143
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,070
Thank you. Chocolate?

144
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,880
Yes, please.

145
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,090
Hey, Kim. Yeah, I...

146
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,120
You know what, hold on. Let me take this in the hall.

147
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,470
You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work.

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,650
Okay, I know what you're doing.

149
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,720
Really?

150
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,080
Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.

151
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,210
Very good.

152
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,680
- Chocolate?
- No, I don't want any chocolate!

153
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,450
Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat.

154
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,250
Actually, it turns out I can.

155
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,660
Well, you shouldn't.

156
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,310
There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard?

157
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,880
You weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her,

158
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,860
so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques,

159
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,320
building on the works of Thorndike and B F Skinner.

160
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,900
By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool,

161
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,810
balancing a beach ball on her nose.

162
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,290
No, this has to stop now.

163
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,090
I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool.

164
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,450
I thought the "bazinga" was implied.

165
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,660
We're just tweaking her personality.

166
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,230
- Sanding off the rough edges, if you will.
- No. You’re not sanding Penny.

167
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,170
Are you saying that I am forbidden from applying a harmless,

168
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,440
scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?

169
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,650
Yes. You’re forbidden.

170
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,720
Bad Leonard.

171
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,220
So, what do you guys do?

172
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,380
Oh, you know, Goth stuff. Goth magazines, Goth music.

173
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,420
Goth food.

174
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,860
What's Goth food?

175
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,890
Blackened salmon?

176
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,440
No, I meant what do you do for jobs?

177
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,670
- Oh, we're scientists.
- Yeah, you know, the Dark Sciences.

178
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,980
What are the Dark Sciences?

179
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,350
Well, I am an astrophysicist, and a lot of that takes place at night.

180
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,380
When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.

181
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,740
Oy vay.

182
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,390
That sounds really cool.

183
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,770
Does it? Okay. If you like space stuff,

184
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,380
I design components for the International Space Station, which is in space.

185
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,820
Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.

186
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,320
So, what do you gals do?

187
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,710
- I work at The Gap.
- really?

188
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,440
How about that? I've been to The Gap.

189
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,690
I've been there, as well.

190
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,870
I like your t-shirts with the little pocket.

191
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,950
I work there, too. Not that anyone cares.

192
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,590
You know, this place is boring.

193
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,380
Yeah, why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun?

194
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,790
- Okay.
- Sure, we like fun.

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,230
- We are fun people.
- Dark and fun.

196
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,350
Come on.  I know a place you'll really dig.

197
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,500
- Did you bring the black condoms?
- In my fanny pack.

198
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,520
Let's go.

199
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,350
Are you happy now?

200
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,880
Not particularly.

201
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,410
My God, she didn't!

202
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,910
What could she possibly be talking about for so long?

203
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,870
Obviously, waitressing at The Cheese Cake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity

204
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,500
that requires a great deal of analysis and planning.

205
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,900
"Bazinga. "

206
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,150
You know, using positive reinforcement techniques,

207
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,800
I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.

208
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,330
No.

209
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,930
If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.

210
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,160
You're not squirting her in the face with water.

211
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,150
No, of course not.

212
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,810
We're talking very mild electric shocks.

213
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,480
No tissue damage whatsoever.

214
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,090
Forget it.

215
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,670
Oh, come on. You can't tell me

216
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,400
that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.

217
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,150
I'm not.

218
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,510
Well, and Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her what she is.

219
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,210
You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?

220
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,480
Yes.

221
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,450
You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?

222
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,830
You're not changing how Penny laughs.

223
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,400
No, that would be incongruous.

224
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,690
I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.

225
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,550
Sorry, guys. That girl is freaky.

226
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,280
Come again?

227
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,540
- Freaky.
- Freaky?

228
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,010
Yeah, freaky.

229
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,390
Have a chocolate.

230
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,670
Thank you.

231
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,530
Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex

232
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,840
With a strange girl you met in a bar?

233
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,170
Yeah!

234
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,970
What is your mother going to say?

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,640
She's not going to see it.

236
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,560
She takes my temperature orally now.

237
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,940
What are you going to get, Howard?

238
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,260
Well, I can't really decide between a screaming devil,

239
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,880
this mean little skull, or Kermit the frog.

240
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,630
- Kermit the frog?
- You know. I’m on Howard’s butt.

241
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,610
Get the mean little skull, and I'll see if I can make him smile.

242
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,310
Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.

243
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,310
What are you going to get, Raj?

244
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,940
With my luck, hepatitis.

245
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,340
Okay, here we go.

246
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,550
That's just rubbing alcohol.

247
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,930
I know, but it was cold.

248
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,420
I'm putting on the stencil.

249
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,310
What comes after the stencil?

250
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,260
This.

251
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,580
Okay, that's it. No needle. No pain. No tattoo.

252
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,560
What's the big deal? You’ve done this before.

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,650
No, I haven't. Look.

254
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm sorry. I’m a fraud. He’s a fraud.

255
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,000
We're both frauds.

256
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,870
- Yeah, I think I covered that.
- But I was summing up.

257
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,780
We're not Goth.

258
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,170
We're just... guys.

259
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,350
Very, very smart guys.

260
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,590
- So you were totally scamming us?
- Yes.

261
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,040
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again.

262
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,770
Unless, of course, our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive, huh? Anything?

263
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm leaving.

264
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,440
I'm leaving, too. Not that anyone cares.

265
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,550
When we tell this story, let's end it differently.

266
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,520
What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?

267
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,690
Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in.

268
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,790
I trust if you two are planning on engaging in amorous activities,

269
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,220
you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.

270
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,850
- Of course.
- Thank you.

271
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
These are so good.

272
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,170
Unbelievable.

273
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,720
What?

274
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,360
I-I was just thinking we should probably turn in, too.

275
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,610
Well, you know, my new bed got delivered.

276
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,360
If you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.

277
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,640
Really? That’s a lot of work, and it's kind of late.

278
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,000
- Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have to be quiet.
- Let’s go.

279
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,120
Interesting.

280
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,300
Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour.

281
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,850
I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.

282
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,660
Okay, wait.  How about this?

283
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,110
We say there were four Goth girls.

284
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,480
The two girls in the club had two friends.

285
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,330
I like it, I like it.

286
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,850
Did they smell good despite their Goth-like nature?

287
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,250
What's that got to do with the story?

288
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,090
Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.

289
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,470
Fine, they smelled good.

290
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,180
Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle

291
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,060
Whatever.

292
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,600
And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic, hokey pokey for us.

293
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,560
No, no. Look, let me just say my story all the way through

294
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,190
And then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.

295
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,530
- I’m sorry. Go on.
- Okay.

296
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,020
We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.

297
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,260
But we don't have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?

298
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,450
We say they're in a very intimate area.

299
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,080
Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?

300
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,930
Right, right.

301
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,080
So, we go back to their place and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.

302
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,870
But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?

303
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,240
True. Okay. Forget the hot tub.

304
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,290
The point is, we each had a menage with sexy Goth girls.

305
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,330
What a great night.

306
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,960
Yeah.

307
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,970
Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night?

308
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,910
Maybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.

309
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,620
Could happen.

310
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,060
I wonder how they smell.
