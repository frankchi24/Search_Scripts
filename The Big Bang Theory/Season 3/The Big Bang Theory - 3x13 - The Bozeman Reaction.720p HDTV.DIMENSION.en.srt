1
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:04,134
Seems like forever,

2
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:06,436
since the four of us have
been out to eat, you know?

3
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:07,937
Just the guys.

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:09,272
Oh, God! Yes, we get it.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,175
You have a girlfriend now.

6
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:13,710
A little jealous, are we?

7
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,030
No, I'm not jealous.

8
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,637
All right, I'd kill a
hobo if it'll get me laid.

9
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:22,106
Now, can we order?

10
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:25,708
Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,575
So what? It's the same food.

12
00:00:27,643 --> 00:00:29,482
Oh, is it? Look at this.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,719
General Tso's Chicken

14
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:32,487
is no longer listed under "specialties."

15
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:34,589
It's now under "chicken."

16
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:35,893
So?

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,596
Yes, General Tso.

18
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:42,499
Not "Tso," the chicken, "so" the question.

19
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,567
So?

20
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,268
So, why is it no longer a specialty?

21
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:49,569
Did the chef lose confidence

22
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:51,770
in the dish or himself?

23
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,338
And look over here.

24
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:57,175
"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

25
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:59,677
What is "mobster sauce"?

26
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:01,412
It's obviously a typo.

27
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,683
Perhaps. Or perhaps this restaurant's

28
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,588
now a front for organized crime.

29
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:08,090
For all we know, the mobster sauce

30
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:11,294
contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.

31
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,132
No, no, no, no-- I think it just means

32
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,034
it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.

33
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:17,270
It doesn't mean any of that!

34
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,538
It's a typo.

35
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:19,773
You know what? Let's just get a pizza.

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,842
Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.

37
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:24,911
Sure, no mobsters there.

38
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:29,418
You know, the more I think about it,

39
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:31,987
the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain

40
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:34,057
chunks of mobster.

41
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:36,593
And why is that?

42
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,328
It was listed under "seafood."

43
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,435
What if they were mobsters
who slept with the fishes?

44
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,743
Leonard, are we having a
serious conversation or not?

45
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,380
What the...?

46
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,621
The TV is gone.

47
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,423
So are our laptops.

48
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,692
Oh, God.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,527
Oh, God.

50
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,596
Oh, God!

51
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,399
It's all right.

52
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,236
They didn't take my comic books.

53
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,839
Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state

54
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,143
Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait!

55
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,812
The Earth began to cool

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,515
The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools

57
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,017
We built the Wall
We built the pyramids

58
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,719
Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery

59
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,621
That all started with a big bang

60
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,322
Bang

<i>They took our TV,</i>

63
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,078
two laptops,

64
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:46,212
four external hard-drives,

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,780
our PS2, our PS3,

66
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:49,282
our X-Box, our X-Box 360,

67
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,650
our classic Nintendo,

68
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:53,887
our Super Nintendo,
our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.

69
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,223
We like games.

70
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,926
<i>Right, games. They took Halo 1,</i>

71
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,962
<i>Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1,</i>

72
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,330
<i>Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3,</i>

00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:07,669
<i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,</i>

76

Winter Olympics...</i>

79
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:18,877
<i>...and Ms. Pacman.</i>

80
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:21,746
Assorted video games.

81
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:25,650
When does the CSI team get here?

82
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:27,652
What?

83
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,721
In anticipation of their arrival,

84
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,656
I've bagged some evidence.

85
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,458
One of the thieves had the audacity

86
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,726
to quench his thirst while
ransacking our home.

87
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:37,895
You should be able to pull
some good prints off this.

88
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,330
And now, here are my prints

89
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,932
so you can rule me out as a suspect.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,433
What about me?

91
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:45,568
I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's too early to discount

92
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,104
the possibility of this being an inside job.

93
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:51,608
Would I be completely out of
line to ask you to shoot him?

94
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,911
I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour

95
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:56,312
psychiatric hold.

96
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:58,847
I'm not crazy.

97
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:01,016
My mother had me tested.

98
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,417
We're done here.

99
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,886
Call this number, and we'll
fax you a copy of the report

100
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,354
so you can submit it to
your insurance company.

101
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,855
I-I'm sorry.

102
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,424
That's the end of your inquiry?

103
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:13,562
Do you have any more information
that might be relevant?

104
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,630
Oh, my goodness.
Where do I begin? For instance--

105
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,199
my laptop contained

106
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,068
four out of the five gedankenexperiments

107
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,603
necessary for a cogent restatement

108
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,038
of the quantum measurement problem.

109
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,040
How is that going to help them?

110
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,209
Well, they could monitor
scientific publications

111
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:28,879
and see if anyone posts such a
cogent restatement in the next

112
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,047
couple of months. If so,

113
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:31,214
the authors are most likely

114
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,916
in possession of my stolen laptop.

115
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:35,786
Good night, fellas.

116
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,857
Come on, Bochco.

117
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,436
What are we supposed to do now?

118
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:54,539
<i>The only thing we can do.</i>

119
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,041
Watch TV on our phones
until the criminals return

120
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,411
and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.

121
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:02,580
Does that mean you've
ruled me out as a suspect?

122
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,382
Oh, how I wish I could.

123
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,337
I do not have to urinate.

124
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:05,044
I am the master of my own bladder.

125
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,015
Drat.

126
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:14,020
I can't believe it.

127
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,788
If I hadn't been working the dinner shift,

128
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:17,657
I would've run right into the robbers.

129
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,026
Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.

130
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm not scared.

131
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,496
I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.

132
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:26,499
Leonard and Penny.

133
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,733
Leonard and Penny.

134
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,901
Leonard and Penny.

135
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,102
Hand me the bat.

136
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:36,474
We just had a major crime in the building,

137
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,409
and you open the door
without asking who it is?

138
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:41,712
It won't happen again. What's up?

139
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,880
Nothing.

140
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:46,082
I just wanted to see if you were both okay.

141
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,317
We're fine, Sheldon.

142
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,720
All right, then.

143
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,056
Good night. Good night.

144
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:57,426
That was weird, even for him. Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,928
Leonard and Penny.

146
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:00,229
Leonard and Penny.

147
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,897
Leonard and Penny.

148
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:06,435
Who is it?

149
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:08,237
Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.

150
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,706
Yes?

151
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:12,241
May I come in?

152
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:16,178
Yeah.

153
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,821
I see you're drinking wine.

154
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,723
Yes, we are.

155
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,158
And we're about to go to bed.

156
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,194
Uh-huh.

157
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:35,330
Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?

158
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,900
Oh, as small as Leonard is,

159
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,536
I don't think the two of you'd
be comfortable on the couch.

160
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:43,740
<i>What do you want?</i>

161
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,776
It's not what I want,
it's what evolution wants.

162
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:48,045
Human beings are primates.

163
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:49,779
Primates have evolved to live in groups,

164
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,182
both for protection and support.

165
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,652
But you don't like other people.

166
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:58,656
I do tonight.

167
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:01,259
It's scary over there.

168
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:03,529
It's getting scary here, too.

169
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:14,072
Um... three little kittens?

170
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:17,742
Three little pigs?

171
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,348
God, I don't know.

172
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,950
<i>Star Wars?</i>

173
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,820
Did we win? Can we go to bed?

174
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,255
Good Lord-- I could not
have made this easier.

175
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,523
Hydrogen atom, H,

176
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:37,826
plus pigs minus pea-- Higgs.

177
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:41,829
Bow, General Zod trapped
in the Phantom Zone.

178
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,865
Bow-zone.

179
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:47,033
Pear. Tickle.

180
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,735
Pear-tickle.

181
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,973
Higgs Boson Particle.

182
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,975
How could you not get that?

183
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,477
He's right, Penny. It's all there.

184
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,315
Sheldon, sweetie,
I know you're feeling insecure,

185
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:04,083
but we've really got to go to sleep.

186
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,920
All right. I'll take the first watch

187
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:08,388
and wake you at 0400.

188
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:09,823
Great. Good night.

189
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,458
Wait, wait-- what's 0400?

190
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,727
4:00 a.m. That's, like, in 45 minutes.

191
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:15,096
Just keep walking.

192
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,018
It's quiet out there.

193
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:38,187
Maybe a little too quiet.

194
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,521
Where are you going?

195
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,356
Just gonna take a look around outside.

196
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,425
Bad idea.

197
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,529
No, Jim, don't open the door!

198
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,932
Listen to her, Jim.

199
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:53,868
Don't worry.

200
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:55,202
There's no one out there.

201
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,479
Leonard and Penny!

202
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,813
Leonard and Penny!

203
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,215
Leonard and Penny!

204
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:13,119
Who is it?

205
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,015
All right, we've got a titanium dead bolt

206
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,449
and a reinforced jamb

207
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:22,186
controlled by a state-of-th
e-art electronic access system.

208
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,421
What if they cut the power?

209
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,122
There's a 200-watt uninterruptible

210
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,424
backup power supply.

211
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,193
What if someone steals my keys? There are

212
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,962
independent voice and fingerprint scanners.

213
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,231
What if someone kidnaps me,
forces me to record my voice,

214
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,667
and then cuts off my thumb?

215
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,370
I'll send them a basket of muffins.

216
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,274
Now, inside, we've got motion detectors,

217
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:47,578
infrared sensors,
and cameras connected to a server

218
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,548
running state-of-th
e-art facial recognition software.

219
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,449
Where did you get all this stuff?

220
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,285
Eh, I got a buddy over at
the Department of Defense.

221
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,653
He just gave it to you?

222
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,222
I'm sure he would have if I had asked.

223
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:00,957
Ironically, their security

224
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,293
isn't all that good.

225
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,728
Raj, your car is blocking me...

226
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:08,298
COMPUTER VOICE: Intruder alert,
intruder alert.

227
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,533
Intruder alert. What the hell?

228
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,035
Intruder alert. Sorry, let me help you.

229
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:13,637
Wonderful security system

230
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:16,607
if we're attacked by a school of tuna.

231
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,877
Don't worry, the net's
going to be electrified.

232
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,848
You picture her on the floor,
spasming uncontrollably.

233
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,619
Better.

234
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,255
<i> Sheldon's journal.</i>

235
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,257
<i>Security system in place.</i>

<i>However, sleep continues to elude me.</i>

243
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,551
Oh, dear.

244
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:36,190
I am the master of my own bladder.

245
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,075
Leonard and Penny.

246
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,143
Leonard and Penny.

247
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,177
Leonard and Penny.

248
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,178
Oh, my...

249
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:59,816
God, Sheldon.

250
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:05,221
What the hell are you doing out there?

251
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,792
I heard a noise.

252
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:12,228
It was us.

253
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:13,830
We knocked over a lamp.

254
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,798
Why would you knock over a lamp?

255
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,767
We were going to have... He doesn't need

256
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:20,069
to know what we were doing, Leonard.

257
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:24,206
Oh.

258
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:26,675
No, she's right, I don't need
to know what you were doing.

259
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:28,743
Carry on.

260
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:29,744
What are you doing?

261
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,380
Use the door.

262
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,815
Good thinking.

263
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,817
Perhaps I'll check the perimeter

264
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:38,118
and make some warm milk.

265
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,688
Great, you do that.

266
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:43,891
Would you like me to
bring you some warm milk?

267
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,726
I'm lactose intolerant.

268
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:48,196
And you don't wish to alarm
me with any more loud noises.

269
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:49,497
Very thoughtful.

270
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,200
Warm milk, Penny?

271
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,667
No, thanks.

272
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,369
Fine.

273
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:56,671
Good night to you, sir.

274
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:58,973
Miss.

275
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,176
Sorry about that.

276
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:04,044
Ugh, what can you do?

277
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,779
Here.

278
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:08,648
Intruder alert, intruder alert.

279
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,716
Intruder alert, intruder alert.

280
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,662
Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.

281
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,298
Sheldon, are you okay?

282
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:28,733
I-I'm fine...

283
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,270
although I'm no longer the
master of my own bladder.

284
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,442
My new computer came

285
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,746
with Windows 7.

286
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:45,282
Windows 7 is much more use
r- friendly than Windows Vista.

287
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,419
I don't like that.

288
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,691
Don't you think looking
for a new city to live in

289
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,126
is a bit of an overreaction?

290
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,995
Our apartment was broken into,

291
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,863
our security system tried to kill me,

292
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:02,832
and as a result,
I'm leaving Pasadena forever.

293
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,402
Tell me how that's overreacting.

294
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,437
Come on, Sheldon, you can't move.

295
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:09,072
Don't you need to stay in one place

296
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,507
so the mother ship can find you

297
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:13,409
when it returns?

298
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,245
Oh, if that were only true.

299
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:19,382
Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound
for the foreseeable future,

300
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,917
I need to find a location
that's more hospitable

301
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:25,320
than the mean streets of Pasadena, like...

302
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,055
Enid, Oklahoma.

303
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:28,590
Low crime rate

304
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:31,793
and high-speed Internet connectivity...

305
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:34,395
but no model train shops.

306
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:38,899
Sorry, Enid.

307
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:43,169
Is he quitting his job at the university?

308
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:45,405
Oh, no, he's going to telecommute.

309
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,008
Everybody's really excited about it.

310
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:49,242
All right.

311
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,278
Boone, North Carolina.

312
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:54,580
"Every summer since 1952,

313
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:57,683
"Boone has hosted an outdoor
amphitheater portrayal

314
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,920
of the life and times of
its namesake, Dan'l Boone."

315
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:05,691
Sounds like something that
would attract the wrong crowd.

316
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,596
Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?

317
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:11,798
Born and raised.

318
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:20,741
It will take me a few days to get settled.

319
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:24,044
After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs

320
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:26,013
containing diagrams and instructions

321
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,815
that will guide you through
packing and shipping

322
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:30,350
the rest of my possessions
to Bozeman, Montana.

323
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,353
In the meantime, please forward my mail.

324
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,555
Any place specific

325
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:38,124
or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?

326
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:41,527
I sense you're making a joke,

327
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:44,529
but Bozeman does have a comedy
club called The Loony Bin,

328
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:46,798
so do not forward my mail there.

329
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,565
Oh, come on.

330
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,467
So you were the victim of a crime.

331
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:52,168
That's part of life.

332
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:54,404
When my great-grandfather
first came to this country,

333
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,239
he put all his hopes and dreams

334
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,841
into this little butcher shop he ran

335
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,475
on the Lower East Side of New York.

336
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,843
You know what happened?

337
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,779
Every customer who walked
into that butcher shop

338
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,248
and asked for a pound of liver,

339
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,216
got ripped off.

340
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,153
But...

341
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:14,822
those people moved on, and so should you.

342
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,524
<i>I am moving on.</i>

343
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:18,659
I'm going to be a Bozite.

344
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:20,695
They call themselves "Bozites"?

345
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:22,096
They should. It's one of the first things

346
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:23,531
I plan to bring up upon arrival.

347
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,669
Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this,

348
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:29,571
but I'm going to miss you. Please,

349
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,874
Penny, as you know, I'm not comfortable

350
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:35,244
with prolonged goo
d-byes and maudlin displays of emotion,

351
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,313
so I prepared a short video.

352
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,852
Greetings.

353
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,656
As you know, I'm not comfortable
with prolonged good-byes

354
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,857
and maudlin displays of emotion,

355
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,693
so I prepared this short video.

356
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:53,330
The four of you are three
of my closest friends

357
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:55,399
and one treasured acquaintance.

358
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:02,039
Though I cannot state
categorically that my life

359
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:04,941
will be diminished by not having you in it,

360
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:07,177
I am comfortable if you
choose to believe that.

361
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:10,747
Since you intend to remain

362
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,583
in this lawless metropolitan area,

363
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,253
statistics suggest that
you will succumb to tragic

364
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,722
and gruesome ends before we meet again.

365
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,458
Live long and prosper.

366
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:24,928
Sheldon, that's so...

367
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:29,999
You might want to lock the door behind me.

368
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:32,835
This isn't Bozeman.

369
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,541
How the hell do I know who's the friend

370
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:40,277
and who's the acquaintance?

371
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,918
That is a bracing cold,

372
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:49,453
an invigorating cold.

373
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,622
Lord, is it cold!

374
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:55,760
Help you with your bags, sir?

375
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:58,496
Thank you, fellow Bozite.

376
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:01,566
And may I say, you are the
living embodiment of all

377
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:05,203
the promises made by our lovely
town's Chamber of Commerce.

378
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:11,176
Wait!

379
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:14,512
Wait!

380
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,581
Excuse me!

381
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:28,859
One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.

382
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,212
Hey, look who's back!

383
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,381
Interesting.

384
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:43,417
The acquaintance is the first to greet me.

385
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:48,887
