1
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:04,127
So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:06,893
{\pos(192,220)}Guy opens it, and there on his
porch is the snail, who says,

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,458
{\pos(192,220)}"What the heck
was all that about?"

4
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:13,204
I don't really get it.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,443
Well, see, it took two
years for the snail to...

6
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:22,111
Not important.

7
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:25,848
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

8
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,876
Where do you think
this is going?

9
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:32,007
{\pos(192,220)}To be honest, I was hoping
at least second base.

10
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:35,211
You're so funny.

11
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,097
You're like a
stand-up comedian.

12
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:41,602
{\pos(192,220)}A Jewish stand-up comedian,
that'd be new.

13
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,325
{\pos(192,220)}Actually, I think a lot
of them are Jewish.

14
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,228
No, I was just...
never mind.

15
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:53,916
{\pos(192,220)}Look, Howard,
this is our third date and

16
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,369
we both know
what that means.

17
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:56,886
We do?

18
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:58,439
Sex.

19
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,105
You're kidding.

20
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,299
{\pos(192,220)}But I need to know
whether you're looking

21
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:08,198
{\pos(192,220)}for a relationship
or a one-night stand.

22
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:09,913
Okay, just to be clear:

23
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:12,638
there's only one
correct answer, right?

24
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,375
It's not like "chicken
or fish" on an airplane?

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,074
Maybe you need to think
about it a little.

26
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,069
You know,
it's not unheard of

27
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,233
for a one-night stand to turn
into a relationship.

28
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,986
Call me when you figure it out.

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,490
Three dates means sex?

30
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:39,289
Who knew?

31
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,698
Greetings, homies.

32
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:46,744
Homette.

33
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:50,206
Why are you back from
your date so early?

34
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:52,559
In romance,
as in show business,

35
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,076
always leave them wanting more.

36
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:58,668
What exactly
does that mean?

37
00:01:58,668 --> 00:01:59,947

Season 03 - Episode 09
"The Vengeance Formulation"

47
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:29,247
Hey, did either
of you guys know

48
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:30,462
that three dates
with the same woman

49
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,108
is the threshold for sex?

50
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:35,464
{\pos(192,220)} Actually, I've never had three
dates with the same woman.

51
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,563
{\pos(192,220)}With Penny and me,
it took two years.

52
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,509
{\pos(192,220)}Now that I think about it,
that was three dates.

53
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,722
Okay, well, before you
and Penny hooked up,

54
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:48,337
did she ask for any
kind of commitment?

55
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,347
{\pos(192,210)}No, she was pretty clear about

56
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:52,270
{\pos(192,210)}wanting to keep
her options open.

57
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,503
I have something to announce,

58
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,931
{\pos(192,210)}but out of respect for convention,
I will wait for you

59
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,979
{\pos(192,210)}to finish your
current conversation.

60
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,347
What are you
talking about?

61
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:03,612
{\pos(192,210)}The cultural paradigm
in which people have sex

62
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,657
{\pos(192,210)}after three dates.

63
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:05,714
I see.

64
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,671
{\pos(192,210)}Now, are we talking "date",
the social interaction,

65
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:11,081
or "date",
the dried fruit?

66
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:14,884
{\pos(192,210)}Never mind,
what's your announcement?

67
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:18,435
{\pos(192,210)}Oh, good, my turn.
Well, this is very exciting

68
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,486
{\pos(192,210)}and I wanted you to be
among the first to know...

69
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,229
Hey, Cooper.

70
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:24,832
I hear you're going to be on the radio with
Ira Flatow from Science Friday next week.

72
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:28,041
{\pos(192,220)} Thank you, Kripke, for depriving
me of the opportunity

73
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:30,265
to share my news
with my friends.

74
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:31,399
My pleasure.

75
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,079
My "thank you"
was not sincere.

76
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,251
But "my pleasure" is.

77
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:38,877
Let me ask you
a question:

78
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:41,472
{\pos(192,210)} At what point
did National Public Radio

79
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:43,454
have to start scraping
the bottom of the barrel

80
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,862
for its guests?

81
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,213
Don't answer.
It's rhetorical.

82
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,932
Why are you such a stupid head?

83
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,104
That is also rhetorical.

84
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:57,875
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

85
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:00,460
Are you really
going to be on NPR?

86
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,374
{\pos(192,210)}Yes, they're interviewing me
by phone from my office,

87
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,461
{\pos(192,50)}regarding the recent so-called "discovery"

88
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,840
{\pos(192,50)}of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices.

89
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,358
{\pos(192,200)}It's pledge week and they're
trying to goose the ratings

90
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:12,135
{\pos(192,200)}with a little controversy.

91
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,704
Very cool,
congratulations.

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,923
{\pos(192,210)}Thank you.
My mother is very excited.

93
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:19,556
{\pos(192,210)}She's convening her Bible study
group to listen in,

94
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,559
and then pray for my soul.

95
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:24,489
I was on the radio once.

96
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:26,803
I called in to
Fever 104 FM New Delhi

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,491
and was the fourth person
to say the phrase that pays:

98
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:33,414
"Fever 104, aajke naye
acchha sangeetka ghar".

99
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,557
That means: "Fever 104,

100
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:40,104
home of the really
good current music".

101
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:44,483
It's much catchier
in Hindi.

102
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:49,962
All right. These are
the talking points

103
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,616
for my NPR
interview tomorrow.

104
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,513
I need to make sure
that they're simple enough

105
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,770
for the less educated in
the audience to understand.

106
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:01,157
Howard, look this over and
tell me what's unclear to you.

107
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,012
Excuse me, I have a master's
degree in engineering

108
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:06,107
from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

109
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:08,791
It required the completion
of 144 units of grad work

110
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:10,566
and an original thesis.

111
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,852
Yes.

112
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,572
Look this over and tell 
me what's unclear to you.

113
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:19,022
You know, when Sheldon
gives you homework,

114
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,793
you don't have to do it.

115
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:22,962
In fact, it's better
if you don't,

116
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,984
otherwise it makes
the rest of us look bad.

117
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,460
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

118
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,366
Yo, Raj, talk to me.

119
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,325
I'm sorry,
just screwing with you.

120
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,569
Hey, Howard, why haven't
you called Bernadette?

121
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:46,745
Did she say something?

122
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,475
Yeah, she said she hasn't
heard from you in a week.

123
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:49,929
I thought you liked her.

124
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:52,288
I do, but she wants a commitment

125
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:54,406
and I'm not sure she's my type.

126
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:56,037
She agreed to go out
with you for free.

127
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,272
What more do you need?

128
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,250
Look, Bernadette is really nice.

129
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,535
I just always thought
when I finally settle down

130
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,905
into a relationship,
it would be with someone,

131
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,565
you know, different.

132
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:07,993
Different how?

133
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:12,217
Well, you know, more like
Megan Fox from Transformers.

134
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,198
Or Katee Sackhoff

135
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,147
from Battlestar Galactica.

136
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,095
Are you high?

137
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:21,217
You'd have a better shot
with the three-breasted

138
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:23,702
Martian hooker
from Total Recall.

139
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,803
Okay, now you're just
being unrealistic.

140
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:30,098
Anyway, that movie
was like 20 years ago.

141
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:32,644
Imagine how saggy
those things would be.

142
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:39,255
Howard, you're going to throw
away a great girl like Bernadette

143
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,942
because you're holding out
for some ridiculous fantasy?

144
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,913
Hey, just because you settled
doesn't mean I have to.

145
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,487
Excuse me,
I'm sitting here.

146
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:52,627
Hey, I did not
settle for Leonard.

147
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:56,355
I mean, obviously, he isn't the 
kind of guy I usually go out with...

148
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,046
you know, physically.

149
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,945
Again, I'm right here.

150
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,617
My point is, I do not
judge a book by its cover.

151
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,402
I am interested
in the person underneath.

152
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,259
I am here, right?
You see me.

153
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:18,173
Hey, I'm interested
in what's inside people, too,

154
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:21,532
but why is it wrong to want
those insides wrapped up in,

155
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,849
say, the delicious caramel
that is Halle Berry?

156
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:28,666
Yes, you're delicious
caramel, too.

157
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,636
All right, you know what,
I will tell you

158
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,816
- why it's wrong...
- Excuse me, may I interject?

159
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:38,864
What?

160
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,531
Biologically speaking,

161
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:43,657
Howard is perfectly justified
in seeking out the optimum mate

162
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,026
for the propagation
of his genetic line.

163
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:48,379
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- Now, whether that

164
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,494
propagation is in the interest
of humanity is, of course,

165
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,151
an entirely different question.

166
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,967
This is Ira Flatow
and you're listening

167
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:59,650
to NPR's Science Friday.

168
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,355
Joining us today by phone

169
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,834
from his office
in Pasadena, California

170
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,960
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

171
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,123
Oh, this is going to be a riot.

172
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:13,058
Thanks for being
with us today, Dr. Cooper.

173
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,470
My pleasure, Ira.

174
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,712
Now, let's talk about
magnetic monopoles.

175
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:23,223
Can you explain to our audience
just what a monopole is?

176
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:24,517
Of course.

177
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:28,510
First, consider an ordinary
magnet which has,

178
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,186
as even the most uneducated

179
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:33,385
in your audience
must know, two poles.

180
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:37,400
A north and south pole.

181
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:41,442
If you cut that in half,
you have two smaller magnets,

182
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,551
each with its own
north and south pole.

183
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:47,140
Uh, Dr. Cooper,
I think there might be

184
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,894
something wrong
with our connection.

185
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,314
No, I hear you fine.

186
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:56,151
As I was saying, an ordinary
magnet has two poles.

187
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:58,768
The primary characteristic
of a monopole

188
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:02,404
is that it has only one pole,
hence, monopole.

189
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,169
<i>A requirement for string theory,

190
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:07,827
<i>or M-theory, if you will,

191
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,157
<i>is the existence
of such monopoles.

192
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:12,652
<i>I, myself, led an expedition

193
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,974
<i>to the Arctic Circle
in search of said particles.

194
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,070
<i>Kripke, I found the nozzle!
I'm going to kill you!

195
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,764
So nice you could
join me this evening.

196
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,913
You're looking lovely as always.

197
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:31,701
{\pos(192,220)}Thanks, Howard.

198
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:34,412
{\pos(192,220)}Always nice to be part
of your masturbatory fantasies.

199
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:37,657
{\pos(192,220)}Come on, Katee.

200
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,489
{\pos(192,220)}Don't make it sound so cheap.

201
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:41,731
I'm sorry, fiddling
with yourself in the bathtub

202
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:43,751
is a real class act.

203
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:47,081
Thank you.

204
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,401
So, shall we get started?

205
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,214
Sure.

206
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,982
But can I ask you
a question first?

207
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:57,072
Do you want to play
Cylon and colonist?

208
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:58,670
No.

209
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,684
I want to know why you're
playing make-believe with me

210
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:02,812
when you could be out
with a real woman tonight.

211
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:04,805
You mean, Bernadette?

212
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,512
No, I mean Princess Leia.

213
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,133
Of course
I mean Bernadette.

214
00:10:09,138 --> 00:10:12,067
She's a wonderful girl
and she really likes you.

215
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,649
I know, but she's not you.

216
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:16,193
I'm not me.

217
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,802
The real me is in Beverly Hills

218
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:20,649
going out with a tall,
handsome, rich guy.

219
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,963
Really? Tall?

220
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,520
- Six-four.
- Ouch.

221
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:27,139
The point is, you've got
a wonderful girl in your life,

222
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:29,102
and you're ignoring her
in order to spend your nights

223
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:32,232
in the bathtub with a mental
image and a wash cloth.

224
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:35,763
Howard!

225
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,834
What are you
doing in there?

226
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,422
I'm taking a bath!

227
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,615
I hope that's all
you're doing!

228
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:44,856
We share that tub!

229
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,019
Don't remind me!

230
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,637
Oh, man.

231
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,252
All soaped up
and no place to go.

232
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,382
How ya doin', buddy?

233
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,788
I was humiliated
on national radio.

234
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,138
How do you think I'm doing?

235
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,967
Come on, it wasn't
that bad.

236
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:13,800
What do you want?

237
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:15,558
We represent
the Lollipop Guild,

238
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,697
and we want you.

239
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:25,487
Okay, so Kripke
played a joke on you.

240
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:26,729
It wasn't funny.

241
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,913
- I thought it was funny.
- Raj.

242
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,460
You laughed.

243
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:33,082
Did you laugh?

244
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:36,406
I fell on the floor.

245
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,335
All right, he got you.

246
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:40,632
You can get him back.

247
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:42,939
I refuse to sink to his level.

248
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:45,197
You can't sink.
With all that helium in you,

249
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,084
you're lucky you 
don't float away.

250
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,719
Are you really
admitting defeat?

251
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:54,020
I never admit defeat.

252
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:54,889
Good.

253
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:56,384
However, on an unrelated topic,

254
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:58,640
I am never getting out
of this bed again.

255
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,487
What if you could
make Kripke

256
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:03,689
look even sillier
than he made you look?

257
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:04,863
I don't think
that's possible, dude.

258
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:05,863
You're not helping.

259
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:08,324
I didn't come to help,
I came to mock.

260
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:12,620
Sheldon, what you need to do
is figure out a way

261
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,889
to exact vengeance on Kripke,
like, uh,

262
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:19,031
like, how the Joker got back
at Batman for putting him

263
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,525
in the Arkham Asylum for
the Criminally Insane.

264
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,629
That's true. He didn't just stay
there and talk about his feelings

265
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,945
with the other
psychotic villains.

266
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:28,079
He, he broke out and poisoned
Gotham's water supply.

267
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,550
Well...

268
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,406
- I suppose I could poison Kripke.
- No!

269
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:36,198
- No.
- It's a simple matter.

270
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,431
There are several toxic
chemicals

271
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,552
that'd be untraceable
in an autopsy.

272
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,908
Okay, uh, that's the spirit,

273
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,308
but, um, let's dial it back

274
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:48,890
to a non-lethal form
of vengeance.

275
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:51,221
Oh!

276
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:55,171
How about we put a whoopee 
cushion on his office chair?

277
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,982
He'll sit down,
it'll sound like

278
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:59,244
he's flatulent,
even though he's not.

279
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:03,178
Let's keep thinking.

280
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,706
Oh, gee,
you're too late.

281
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,847
Scarlett Johansson and
Wonder Woman were just in here

282
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:14,502
trolling around for
neurotic, little weasels.

283
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:18,289
I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?

284
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:20,206
Yes, but I don't think
she wants to see you.

285
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,117
Why not?

286
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,740
Come on, Howard.
You hurt her feelings

287
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,179
by not calling her all week.

288
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,024
Plus, I've kind of been
talkin' some smack about ya.

289
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,553
Hello, Howard.

290
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,479
Wait, Bernadette,
I need to talk to you.

291
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:32,553
I can't now, I'm working.

292
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:34,385
This will only take a second.

293
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,180
You asked me
to think about where

294
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:39,556
our relationship
was going, and I did.

295
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:41,970
Bernadette?

296
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:47,868
Will you marry me?

297
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,901
Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?

298
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:56,255
No. I'm serious.

299
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,830
I'm never going to find
another girl like you

300
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,754
who likes me and is,
you know, real.

301
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,397
So, this isn't a joke?

302
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:09,184
- No.
- Then you're insane.

303
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,228
I prefer to think
of myself as quirky.

304
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,098
Howard, we've only
been on three dates.

305
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,101
We haven't even had sex yet.

306
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,398
Fair enough.
When's your break?

307
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:22,628
Wow.

308
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,995
Don't you just hate it
when this happens?

309
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,169
Wow.

310
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:38,725
All right,
how's this for revenge?

311
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:41,331
A solution of
hydrogen peroxide,

312
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:44,807
and one of saturated
potassium iodide.

313
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:45,865
What's this?

314
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,403
Mountain Dew.

315
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:51,880
Ahh, refreshing.

316
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:54,484
Now, we're going to
combine these chemicals

317
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:55,927
with ordinary dish soap,

318
00:14:55,932 --> 00:15:00,023
creating a little exothermic
release of oxygen.

319
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,300
Foamy vengeance.

320
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:14,787
Yes, exactly.

321
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,685
This is brilliant, Sheldon.

322
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,583
How are we going to deploy it
in Kripke's office?

323
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,533
Already taken care of.

324
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,003
Observe.

325
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,569
This is a live shot
of Kripke's lab via a mini

326
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,390
webcam I was able to install,
thanks to a dollar bill

327
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:32,153
discreetly placed in the night
janitor's shirt pocket.

328
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:33,316
At the same time,

329
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:35,128
I also secured large quantities

330
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,300
of these chemicals above
the tiles in the drop ceiling.

331
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,098
Oh, Sheldon,

332
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,084
you remind me
of a young Lex Luthor.

333
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,263
You flatter me, sir.

334
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:49,362
- Let me guess: motion sensors?
- Yes.

335
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,878
The reaction will be triggered

336
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,196
when Kripke reaches
the center of the room.

337
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,949
Mwah, ha, ha.

338
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,673
I gotta say,
I am really impressed.

339
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:03,722
This is truly the Sheldon Cooper
way to get even.

340
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:10,866
It may be low-tech,

341
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:13,995
but I still maintain the whoopee
cushion has comic validity.

342
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,757
Here comes Kripke!

343
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:18,855
Who is that with him?

344
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,345
I believe that's
the president of the university.

345
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,494
And the board of directors.
Abort! Abort!

346
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:24,402
There is no "abort".

347
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:25,888
How could you not put in
an "abort?"

348
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:27,984
I made a boo-boo, all right?

349
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,306
I think the board
will really appreciate

350
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:33,170
how well we're using that
NSA grant, President Seibert.

351
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,448
Right here we have
a micro-controlled plasma...

352
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,845
Wow. Looks like the
Ganges on laundry day.

353
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,722
At least they don't
know it was you.

354
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:52,749
Hello, Kripke.

355
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:55,884
This classic prank
comes to you

356
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:59,407
from the malevolent mind
of Sheldon Cooper.

357
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,375
If you'd like to see the look

358
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:04,156
on your stupid face,
this video is being

359
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,487
instantly uploaded to YouTube.

360
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,655
Oh, and a hat tip
to Leonard Hofstadter

361
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,877
and Raj Koothrappali
for their support

362
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:15,492
and encouragement
in this enterprise.

363
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:19,194
Well, I'm going back to India.

364
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:20,741
What's your plan?

365
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:28,495
Hey, here's your tip
from table seven.

366
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,870
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

367
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:31,219
Testing. Check.

368
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:32,159
{\pos(192,220)}Check two.

369
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:35,034
{\pos(192,220)}Oh, now what?

370
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,500
{\pos(192,220)}You want me
to throw him out?

371
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:37,712
{\pos(192,220)}No, that's okay.

372
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,841
{\pos(192,220)}Are you sure? He's small.

373
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,916
I bet I can get a nice,
tight spiral on him.

374
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,390
I want to dedicate this number

375
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:49,129
to a great gal
who I've done wrong.

376
