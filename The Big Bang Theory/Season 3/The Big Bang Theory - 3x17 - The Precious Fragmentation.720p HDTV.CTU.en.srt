1
00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:04,172
Why do I always have to
carry the heavy stuff?

2
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:05,676
Well, it's very simple.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,765
In our ragtag band of scientists
with nothing to lose,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,219
I'm the smart one,

5
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:11,583
Wolowitz is the funny one,

6
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:13,684
and Koothrappali
is the lovable foreigner

7
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,183
who struggles to understand
our ways and fails.

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,884
That leaves you,
by default, as the muscle.

9
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,153
Oh.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,265
One more floor,
and I'd be the pulled muscle.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,636
Oh, it's
about time.

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,872
I'm starving.

13
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:31,447
Um, well, we didn't
actually get Chinese food.

14
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:32,948
Why not?
Don't panic.

15
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,087
This is better.

16
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:35,288
Oh, no.

17
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:37,591
You didn't trade the food
for magic beans, did you?

18
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:40,229
Of course not.

19
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:42,099
And technically,
magic beans would be food.

20
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,234
Although eating them
would be quite a waste,

21
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:45,603
since you could plant them,

22
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,171
and overnight,
have a giant beanstalk,

23
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:50,073
which would provide enough
roughage for a small city.

24
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:52,308
Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.

25
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,978
Sometimes I just watch
your jaw go up and down.

26
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,147
We were on our way to
the Chinese restaurant

27
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,515
when we thought we saw Adam
West, so we followed him.

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,649
Who's Adam West?

29
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,852
Who's Adam West?!

30
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:07,157
Leonard, what do the two of you
talk about after the coitus?

31
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:10,761
My guess is,
"Hey, four minutes!

32
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:12,364
New record!"

33
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:17,505
That's why I'm
the funny one.

34
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,976
Anyway, we followed the guy
to this garage sale,

35
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,545
and they had the coolest stuff.

36
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,646
They were closing up.

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,516
We got this whole
box for 60 bucks.

38
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,917
We didn't even get
to go through it all.

39
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,219
There could be
anything in here.

40
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,588
There a new girlfriend in there?

41
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,957
'Cause you might need one.

42
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,792
No.

43
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:35,163
But there is an
original final draft
<i>Ghostbusters</i> script

44
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:36,899
with actual
slime stains!

45
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,401
Oh, you're right.

46
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:40,637
It's <i>Ghostbusters 2.</i>

47
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,905
Never mind.

48
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,942
Oh, my God.

49
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:50,483
An Alf doll.

50
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:53,486
When I was 11,
my mother got me one

51
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,621
to help me sleep

52
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:56,123
after my dad left.

53
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,458
I used to pretend

54
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,361
that my dad had moved
to the planet Melmac,

55
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:04,767
and Alf was going
to bring him back to me.

56
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,070
But he never did.

57
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:10,307
Where's my daddy, puppet?

58
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,946
Where is he?

59
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:18,815
That is so sad.

60
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,017
No, what's sad is
that you don't know

61
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:23,987
Adam West was TV's Batman.

71
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,866
Here's Spock's
head with no body.

72
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:58,537
Here's Mr. T's body
with no head.

73
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,541
Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body
with Mr. T's head.

74
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,813
I pity the fool
who's illogical.

75
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,451
Okay, I'm just
gonna go home

76
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,553
and make a grilled
cheese and window-shop

77
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:17,688
on eHarmony.

78
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,224
Okay, bye.

79
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:21,825
Okay.

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,262
Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones
connect-the-dots.

81
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:27,430
And an Aquaman
action figure.

82
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,732
Looks like someone
drew a penis on him.

83
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,934
Ooh, that'll come off.

84
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:43,113
You see what you're doing?

85
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:45,582
Stop that.

86
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:46,850
Fascinating.

87
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,218
What?

88
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:50,654
It appears
to be a <i>Lord of the Rings ring.</i>

89
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,156
Oh.
It's even got

90
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,724
the Elvish engraving on it.

91
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:55,058
It's not Elvish.

92
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,296
It's the language of Mordor
written in Elvish script.

93
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:02,467
"One Ring to
rule them all."

94
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,070
"One Ring to find them."

95
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,673
"One Ring to bring them all."

96
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:11,210
"And in the darkness bind them."

97
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:15,180
Holy crap,
are we nerdy.

98
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,485
So, I was doing some checking
on the ring.

99
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,720
Hold on. Sheldon, is there
ketchup on that table?

100
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,989
Yes, there is.

101
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,757
Oh, here's a fun fact.

102
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,058
Ketchup started out

103
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,560
as a general term for sauce,

104
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:30,563
typically made of mushrooms
or fish brine

105
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:31,864
with herbs and spices.

106
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,600
Some popular early main
ingredients included blueberry,

107
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:38,103
anchovy, oyster,
kidney bean and grape.

108
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:42,074
No, that's okay. I'll get it.

109
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:45,478
Listen, I was looking
at the ring, and it

110
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:46,678
seemed a little weird.

111
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:48,247
No copyright notice on it.

112
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:51,751
So, I took it down to this buddy
of mine who deals with--

113
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,753
shall we say--
the seedy underbelly

114
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:55,354
of the collectibles world.

115
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:56,822
Seedy underbelly?

116
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:59,191
You know,
your black market phasers,

117
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:01,360
your screen-worn
Lieutenant Uhura panties,

118
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:02,728
that kind of stuff.

119
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,933
Who's this mysterious
buddy you suddenly have?

120
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,002
Just a guy. I know a guy.

121
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,705
Is it Eddie Crispo?
No, I can't
tell you who it is. Stop asking.

122
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,340
Who else could it be?
It has to be Eddie Crispo.

123
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:15,442
I know lots
of dangerous people, okay?

124
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:18,511
Name one.
Eddie Crispo.

125
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:20,012
Anyway,

126
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:21,914
he said this isn't a replica.

127
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,617
It's the real deal.

128
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:27,587
If you're suggesting that
that is the actual ring of power

129
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,856
forged by Sauron in Mount Doom,

130
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,291
I look at you
with an expression of exhaustion

131
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,326
and ever so slight amusement.

132
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:40,299
He's not saying
it's a magic ring.

133
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:42,235
You're not, are you?

134
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,270
No, but it's close.

135
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:45,771
Look at the markings inside.

136
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:48,073
Those are
production
markings.

137
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:51,043
Nine rings were made for use
in the <i>Lord of the Rings movies.</i>

138
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:52,878
Three were given
to members of the cast.

139
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:54,346
The rest were destroyed.

140
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:56,082
Except one.

141
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,818
One was stolen.

142
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,887
Gentlemen...

143
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,457
this is the one ring.

144
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,295
Mine!

145
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:11,898
No, it is not yours.

146
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,533
We all went in
on the box together.

147
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,868
Well, yes, but I
found it in the box,

148
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,971
and the laws of maritime
salvage clearly state

149
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,873
that the finder of
a sunken treasure

150
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:21,475
is the owner
of the treasure.

151
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,377
How is this maritime salvage?

152
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,812
Other than the lack of
water, how is it not?

153
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:28,348
Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop
being crazy for a second.

154
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:30,516
How much is something
like this worth?

155
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:33,152
Well, it's tough to say
since it's hot,

156
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,254
but on the underground market,
my guy figures...

157
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:36,288
Your guy Eddie Crispo?

158
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:38,489
s.

159
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:44,361
He figures ten,
maybe 15 thousand.

160
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:45,863
Okay, that's a lot of money.

161
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,998
The wise thing to do is invest
it in something practical.

162
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,733
Like a jet ski.

163
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:53,702
Why do you want a jet ski?

164
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:57,039
All the wealthy and beautiful
people in movies ride Jet Skis.

165
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,841
That can't just
be a coincidence.

166
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:00,943
We can't sell it.

167
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:02,545
We have to keep it

168
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,846
and love it and polish it,

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,314
and only take it out
occasionally

170
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:06,648
when we go to the park

171
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:09,652
and reenact our favorite scenes
from the movies.

172
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:13,723
It's sad how great that sounds.

173
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:14,891
Guys, it's stolen.

174
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,526
It should go back
to Peter Jackson.

175
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,361
He made the movies;
it belongs to him.

176
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:19,562
Fine.

177
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,931
He can have it back
as long as he promises

178
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:24,200
to make me a hobbit
in his next movie.

179
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,302
There are no
Jewish hobbits.

180
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,171
Clearly, you've never
been to my house

181
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,440
for dinner
on Rosh Hashanah.

182
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,842
We are not blackmailing
Peter J...

183
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,343
All right,
where's the ring?

184
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,612
You mean my ring?

185
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:37,713
What are you doing?

186
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,881
The ring was
unguarded.

187
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,650
It was just sitting
on the table.

188
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:42,118
Anyone could
have taken it.

189
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:44,053
Proof? I did.

190
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,622
Give me that.
Look, let's be reasonable.

191
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:48,990
We all want to do
different things with the ring,

192
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,927
but your ideas are stupid,
and I want a jet ski.

193
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:53,662
I found it. The
ring is mine.

194
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,999
I don't understand
why in this group I
never get my way.

195
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:03,572
You always get your way.

196
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:07,876
I'll stipulate to that
if you give me the ring.

197
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:09,011
Hey, guys.

198
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,379
Enjoying your food
that I actually

199
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,047
brought you
instead of promising food,

200
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,183
but bringing you a box
of random crap?

201
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,318
Yeah, it's delicious.

202
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,153
The sarcasm's
a little stale, though.

203
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:20,454
Hey, how about this?

204
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,323
Until we figure out
what to do with the ring,

205
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:23,490
Penny holds on to it.

206
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,391
What ring?

207
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:26,560
This ring.

208
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:28,728
Looking for something?

209
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:33,265
Will you hold on to this
for a couple of days?

210
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,901
Why?
It's a prop

211
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:36,869
from a movie, and we're kind of
fighting over it.

212
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:38,571
Okay, just to be clear,
the first piece of jewelry

213
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,305
my boyfriend gives me
is a prop from a movie,

214
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,807
and I don't even get to keep it?

215
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,478
If you had gone out with me
three years ago,

216
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,913
by now, you'd have
my great Aunt Ida's brooch

217
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:51,483
that she smuggled out
of occupied Belgium in a cat.

218
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:54,787
How am I looking now?

219
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,946
Ow!

220
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:56,216
Oh!

221
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,754
You hit me!

222
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:02,958
I'm bleeding!

223
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:05,661
What was that?

224
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,632
Sheldon tried to take the ring
and I punched him.

225
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,835
That's my girl.

226
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:19,254
So, Sheldon,

227
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:22,456
how's it feel to get
beaten up by a girl?

228
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,261
It's not the first time.

229
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:30,697
I have a twin sister
whose assaults began in utero.

230
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:34,834
If only I'd had the presence
of mind to reabsorb her,

231
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,869
then I'd have a mole
with hair in it

232
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:40,306
instead of a tedious
yearly Christmas letter.

233
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,675
Gentlemen, have you come
to the realization

234
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,511
that the only reasonable
course of action

235
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,312
is to sell the ring
and divide the money?

236
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,480
No.

237
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:48,548
I was afraid of that.

238
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,519
Go ahead.

239
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,154
Greetings from Mumbai.

240
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:56,657
I am Raj's attorney,
Venkatesh Koothrappali.

241
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,693
Also my cousin.

242
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:00,162
You brought a lawyer?

243
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:01,396
Don't answer that.

244
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,364
I'll get straight
to the point.

245
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,400
My client's prepared
to surrender

246
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:06,868
any interest
he has in the ring

247
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:09,604
in exchange for two
Kawasaki Jet Skis.

248
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:12,640
We're not giving him
two Jet Skis.

249
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,642
Look, we're big boys,

250
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,844
why don't we just cut to the
chase and meet in the middle?

251
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,146
One Kawasaki Jet Ski.

252
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,313
Done and done.

253
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:23,952
No Jet Skis.

254
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,054
All right, forget
the Jet Skis.

255
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:27,322
Forget the Jet Skis?

256
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:28,823
That was our line
in the sand!

257
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,725
What happened to
"tear them a new one?"

258
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,926
What can I say?

259
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,294
They played hardball.

260
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:34,562
We lost.

261
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:35,897
You're useless.

262
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,732
I told you that
when you hired me.

263
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm signing off now.

264
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,568
Call your mother.

265
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:42,203
She worries.

266
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,606
Okay, just so
you know,

267
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,009
if we're bringing in cousins
who are lawyers,

268
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:50,079
prepare for shock and awe.

269
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:51,914
You know what?
I am ending this.

270
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:53,382
Penny didn't want to
hold the ring anymore.

271
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,716
She gave it to me.
I have it.

272
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,285
I'm sending it back.

273
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,987
Where's the ring?

274
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,456
You mean this ring?

275
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:03,259
Next time be aware
of your surroundings

276
00:12:03,294 --> 00:12:05,462
while urinating
in a public men's room.

277
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:06,663
Give me that.

278
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:07,697
No, it's mine.

279
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:08,631
It's all of ours.

280
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:12,636
Okay, now, this is ridiculous!
Then let go!

281
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,004
I'm not letting go.
You let go.

282
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:15,472
I say this ring belongs

283
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:17,541
to the last person
who can hold on.

284
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,743
Fine. But can't we go home
and start this?

285
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:20,944
Sure.

286
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:22,278
Let go of the ring.

287
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:24,814
All right, it starts now.

288
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,687
You do realize there's
a giant bug movie marathon

289
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:33,956
tonight on the Syfy Channel.

290
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:50,774
Wait, my laptop.

291
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:04,354
You know, there's a point
when this becomes idiotic.

292
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,624
And it wasn't when we were
driving like this?

293
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:10,861
I would advise
the three of you

294
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:12,495
that resistance
is futile.

295
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,164
I have endless
patience.

296
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:16,399
I once spent two-and-a-half
hours on hold

297
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,400
with Hewlett-Packard
customer service

298
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:21,571
just to complain about
their customer service.

299
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,074
You want to talk about
endless patience?

300
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,110
Penny made me watch
all five seasons

301
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:29,278
of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

302
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,382
There are six
seasons, dude.

303
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,552
Oh, crap!

304
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,022
No, no, no, the sixth
season is great.

305
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:43,092
We go to Paris with Carrie
and get our heart broken,

306
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,327
and then Mr. Big shows up,

307
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:47,330
we don't know if we
can trust him again.

308
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:49,532
It's a wild ride.

309
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:53,569
Door.

310
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:02,812
Okay, everybody,
and plié.

311
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:11,988
And relevé.

312
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:17,961
Whatcha doin'?

313
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:20,731
Last one holding the ring
decides its fate.

314
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:21,965
I know, it sounds silly.

315
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,901
No, no, no, no, no,
you are my boyfriend.

316
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:25,936
Nothing you do is silly to me.

317
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,871
Thank you.

318
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:32,676
FYI-- this is a bag
from Victoria's Secret.

319
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,785
I'm out.

320
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:53,330
I'm sorry, Ma,

321
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:55,332
I have to stay late
at the office.

322
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,668
No, he's doesn't!
He's lying to you!

323
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,470
Will you be quiet?

324
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,339
Well, if you want privacy
let go of the ring.

325
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:04,173
I'm so glad

326
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,009
we came to
this gentile
strip club!

327
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,244
Howard,

328
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:09,912
here's more bacon to tuck

329
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:11,780
into the shiksa's G-string!

330
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,449
I'll call you back.

331
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:17,485
I think it's lovely
you call your mommy

332
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,320
and let her know you're
going to be late for dinner.

333
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:20,587
From what I know
about these things,

334
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:22,455
if a woman doesn't
breast-feed on time,

335
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,325
it's very uncomfortable
for her boobies.

336
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,394
Don't you talk about
my mother's boobies!

337
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,029
If you're offended,
let go of the ring

338
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,565
and go on home to your
mother's boobies.

339
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,133
Excellent,
excellent.

340
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,934
Tire each other out,
the ring will be mine.

341
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,703
Howard, why don't you
go after Raj's mother?

342
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,207
Why don't we go
after <i>your</i> mother?

343
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,175
Go ahead.

344
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,311
I have no illusions
about my mother.

345
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,279
She is a kind, loving,

346
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,281
religiously fanatical
right-wing Texan

347
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:52,350
with a slightly
out-of-scale head

348
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,686
and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction.

349
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,122
Anything you'd like to add?

350
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:00,157
That's not gonna
get you anywhere.

351
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,658
Better pull out
the big gun.

352
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:02,659
You're right.

353
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,895
Let's talk about
your grandmother.

354
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,663
No!

355
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:09,233
I call no Meemaws.

356
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,701
Think about this.

357
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:15,205
The only way your mother was
born was your Meemaw had sex.

358
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,575
I don't want to hear this.

359
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,013
Then let go of the ring
and walk away.

360
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,448
Never.

361
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,615
All right.

362
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,816
I'll bet your Meemaw

363
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,286
didn't just have sex
to have your mother.

364
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,923
I bet she had sex
because she liked it.

365
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,659
Stop it!

366
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,394
Yeah, Meemaw
did the nasty.

367
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,197
I said stop it!

368
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,032
We're getting to him.

369
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,033
Waterfalls!

370
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:41,800
What?

371
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,001
Waterfalls.

372
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,002
Crashing waves.

373
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,437
Babbling brooks.

374
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,240
What are you doing?

375
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,474
Subliminal messaging.

376
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,744
I'm going to make you
want to pee.

377
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,547
Dripping faucets.

378
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,582
Leaky gutter.

379
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,419
Peeing.

380
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,154
It's, it's not
working, dude.

381
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,224
Oh-ho-ho,
it's working all right.

382
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,526
I have to pee.

383
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,362
Then let go of
the ring and go.

384
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:10,831
No, actually,
I wouldn't mind going, too.

385
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,366
Fine.

386
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,734
Um, on the count
of three.

387
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:15,169
One, two...

388
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:16,404
Wait, just to clarify.

389
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:20,474
When you get to three,
do we stand up or do we pee?

390
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:25,779
We stand up.

391
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:28,415
Excellent choice.

392
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,583
Three.

393
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,389
Something tells me

394
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,060
this was a bad day
to wear suede shoes.

395
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,980
I've done it!

396
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:00,882
I've won!

397
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,251
The ring is mine!

398
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,453
It's mine!

399
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:15,161
We're going to clean it up
and make it pretty.

400
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,663
My own.

401
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,631
My love.

402
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,800
My precious.

403
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:32,279
Where's the ring?

404
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:36,184
It's in a FedEx box on its way
back to where it came from.

405
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:39,255
The fires of Mount Doom?

406
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,957
Peter Jackson's office
in New Zealand.

407
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,192
It wasn't ours.

408
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:44,660
You quit the game!

409
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:46,061
You had no right
to take it.

410
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:47,663
I came in here, you guys
were all sleeping.

411
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:49,598
The ring was on the floor.
No one was touching it.

412
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:52,168
Well, so then we start the game
over until there's a winner.

413
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,537
There wasn't ever going
to be a winner.

414
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:57,006
There was going to be a selfish,
petty person with a ring

415
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,842
and three people
who used to be his friend.

416
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,143
Is that really
what you guys want?

417
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,410
'Cause if it is, fine.

418
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:03,813
I don't want anything
to do with you.

419
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,949
And I don't know what happened
in that bathroom,

420
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,584
but I am not cleaning it up!

421
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:27,706
My precious.

422
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,593
I knew it.

423
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:51,998
Give us
the precious!

424
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:55,669
Give me! Give me!
Get off of me!

425
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:57,739
Give me the ring!
It's mine!

426
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:00,408
Ugh, gotta go back to dating
dumb guys from the gym.

427
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:01,877
Just give me
the ring!

428
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:03,011
Give it to me!

429
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,346
Give me the ring!

430
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:05,481
I said give it to me!

431
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:07,583
<i>It's mine!</i>

432
