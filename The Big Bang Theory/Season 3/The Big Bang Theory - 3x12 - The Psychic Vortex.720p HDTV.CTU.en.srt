1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:05,188
Look at us. Getting ready for a double date

2
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,324
with actual women who publicly acknowledge

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,826
they're our girlfriends.

4
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:13,196
Yes, actual women are the best.

5
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,264
I don't understand.

6
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,665
What other kind of women are there?

7
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,668
Howard, artificial women
are your department.

8
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:21,671
You want to take this?

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,708
No, it would just freak him out.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,210
Listen, before we leave,

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,213
I should warn you, I'm a passionate man

12
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:33,750
and I tend towards public
displays of affection.

13
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:37,654
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

14
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,357
There might be some making out
in the car or the restaurant,

15
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:42,259
and I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable,

16
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:46,096
so it would help if you
and Penny made out, too.

17
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:48,098
Don't worry.

18
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,390
We're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,394
<i>Namaste, white people.</i>

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,096
Good news!

21
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:00,400
<i>I rented us the fou
r-hour edition of Watchmen.</i>

22
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:01,334
Got it. Seen it.

23
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,836
Detailed analysis posted online.

24
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:06,205
Well, then what are we going to do tonight?

25
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:07,440
Uh, sorry, Raj.

26
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,641
Howard and I are going out to dinner

27
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,009
with Penny and Bernadette. Yeah.

28
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:12,712
No more carefree bachelor
nights for me and Leonard.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,248
These broncos have been saddled.

30
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:22,121
<i>How did we get actual women?</i>

31
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,123
Great.

32
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:26,025
They get girlfriends,
and they just abandon us?

33
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,994
It is great, isn't it?

34
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,397
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us. We do?

35
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,566
Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have

36
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,902
enough room on my hard drive
for a Linux partition,

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,237
so you and I are going
to perform a full backup,

38
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:41,574
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

39
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,043
I don't want to do that.

40
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,378
All right.

41
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:47,380
Well, I'm going to perform full backup,

42
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:50,883
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

43
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:51,985
What about me?

44
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,987
Well, I understand

45
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:56,956
there are several types of artificial women.

46
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,426
Maybe you should look into that.

47
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:05,698
* Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state *

48
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:09,524
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

49
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:10,259
* The Earth began to cool *

50
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:12,828
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

51
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:15,364
<i>* We built the Wall * *
We built the pyramids *</i>

52
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:18,034
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

53
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,936
* That all started with a big bang *

55
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,873
Dude, there's so many cool things

56
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,742
we could be doing tonight. Look.

57
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:33,577
At the Glendale Galleria,

58
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,579
"Put on your best zoot suit,

59
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,482
"it's a salute to Swing music
in the center court near Macy's.

60
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,650
5:00 p.m. to 9 p.m."

61
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,652
Huh? Huh?

62
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:45,379
Sounds like a hoot.

63
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,313
I'm sorry, Raj,

64
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,350
I have no desire to salute any
article of clothing tonight.

65
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:53,853
Much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

66
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,954
Race riots?

67
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:57,323
The zoot suit riots.

68
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,993
Oh.

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,197
I always thought that was some
sort of after-Christmas sale.

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,134
Well, then why don't we just go
to the galleria and walk around?

71
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,136
But I don't need anything at the Galleria.

72
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:11,804
Do you need anything at the Galleria?

73
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:13,706
No. We would just walk
around and see what's what.

74
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:19,145
That's a semantically null sentence.

75
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:21,648
Okay, well, how about this?

76
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,483
From the university Web site:

77
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,486
00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.
, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room,

78
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,155
"mixer for grad students and faculty

79
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,658
"of the science and humanities departments.

80
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,660
"Whether you split atoms or infinitives,

81
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,562
this is the place to be."

82
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,832
Well, that's certainly amusing, but...

83
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,868
I have no interest.

84
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:43,536
Come on, Sheldon,

85
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:45,872
the world is filled with
people doing things outside.

86
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,206
Let's go outside.

87
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:49,676
Outside is good.

88
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:52,679
If outside is so good,
why has mankind spent thousands of years

89
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,447
trying to perfect inside?

90
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,716
I don't know, it's a marketing scheme.

91
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:59,585
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,

92
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,710
virile visitor from a foreign land

93
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:05,007
and I need to strut my stuff.

94
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:07,376
Let me offer you a compromise.

95
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:10,913
Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery,

96
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,949
I use my imagination.

97
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:15,150
Oh, boy.

98
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:17,019
One of my favorite places

99
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,921
to visit is the two-dimensional world

100
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,423
described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy,

101
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,658
"Flatland."

102
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:25,294
I don't want to go to Flatland.

103
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,296
You're only saying that because
you haven't been there.

104
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:33,969
I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space

105
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:37,306
and can only perceive the
edges of other objects.

106
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,475
Oy.

107
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,477
Is that you, Raj?

108
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:43,812
I don't recognize your edge.

109
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,814
Sheldon, I'm begging you.

110
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:48,484
I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

111
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:50,752
Well, you're in luck.

112
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,956
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

113
00:04:55,558 --> 00:04:59,495
Oh, look, there's a sexually
attractive line segment.

114
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:02,030
You should chat her up.

115
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:03,532
What? Tell her you're a circle.

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,201
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

117
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:10,539
I hope you're hungry, Bernadette.

118
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,174
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

119
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,642
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.

120
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,444
When you spend all day in a bio-lab,

121
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:18,113
watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize small rodents,

122
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:20,172
it really works up an appetite.

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,174
Flesh-eating bacteria.

124
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,176
And yet, I still want to kiss this woman.

125
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:26,510
What does that tell you?

126
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:28,512
That you'd be willing
to die a horrible death

127
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,414
on the off-chance you'd get to second base?

128
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,384
Oh, we're way past second base.

129
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:34,719
Right, Howard?

130
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:37,054
Well, we kind of disagree

131
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:40,057
about what the bases are.

132
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,959
How's your work going, Penny?

133
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:43,461
Any acting jobs?

134
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,630
Well, the last big thing
I did was this production

135
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:48,032
<i>of Diary of Anne Frank above
a bowling alley.</i>

136
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,602
But I think things might be
turning around pretty soon.

137
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,704
Great. How come?

138
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:55,906
Well, promise you won't make fun of me.

139
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:58,342
Of course, I would never make fun of you.

140
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,844
Okay.

141
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:02,847
Well, I went to this psychic who
told me that if I cut my hair,

142
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,915
I'm going to get a national commercial.

143
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,286
Wh... Seriously?

144
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:11,289
You're getting career advice from a psychic?

145
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:14,725
Good job not making fun of her.

146
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,894
She's not one of those phonies, okay.

147
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,397
She wrote a book and has her own Web site.

148
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,631
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

149
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,067
They don't let just anyone have a Web site.

150
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:25,569
Why are you being such a jerk?

151
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:26,871
You're surprised?

152
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,173
Your psychic tell you I
was going to be a jerk?

153
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,442
Bite me.

154
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,245
Come on, Penny.

155
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,913
Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

156
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:36,704
We're gonna make out back here.

157
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,310
I'm sliding into third.

158
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,816
Thanks for coming with me.

159
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,150
Thanks for giving me

160
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:52,353
<i>your limited edition Green Lantern
lantern.</i>

161
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,955
Did you really have to bring it in with you?

162
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,025
What if evil strikes and
my power ring runs low?

163
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:04,698
Come on, let's get a drink. I don't drink.

164
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,100
Yeah, well I do.

165
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,369
<i>And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern,</i>

166
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:09,970
I drink a lot.

167
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:11,972
I'll have a screwdriver, please.

168
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,375
Don't be chintzy with the screw.

169
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:17,077
I would like a root beer float.

170
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,047
Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.

171
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,882
They don't?

172
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,784
Well, apparently,
these people and I differ greatly

173
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,819
on the definition of "party."

174
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,155
He'll have a Shirley Temple.

175
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:30,224
And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

176
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,396
Okay,

177
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,064
let's check out the females.

178
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:38,399
All right.

179
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,334
There's a female.

180
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:41,869
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.

181
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,170
She's like 80 years old.

182
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,005
But she's female.

183
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,507
Isn't that the game? No.

184
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,075
I'm looking for a hookup.

185
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:49,910
Oh, yes.

186
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,412
So, the point of this exercise is

187
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,081
for you to find someone to copulate with?

188
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,582
Not so loud,

189
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,740
but ideally, yes.

190
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,043
Thanks.

191
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,845
Thank you.

192
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:05,181
And what is my function as "wingman?"

193
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,816
You help me run my game.

194
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:07,850
Okay.

195
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,387
What is your game?

196
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,589
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,

197
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,658
you nod and agree.

198
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,227
Hey, that's pretty cool.

199
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,362
What is it?

200
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:20,863
It's a limited edition

201
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,365
<i>Green Lantern lantern.</i>

202
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:26,202
My friend is looking for
someone to copulate with.

203
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,004
You're very funny.

204
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:29,038
I'm Abby.

205
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm Sheldon. How do you do?

206
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:33,042
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

207
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,710
Call me Raj. Hi, Raj.

208
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:36,045
Where are you from?

209
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:38,381
The mysterious subcontinent of India.

210
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:39,715
Ooh, India.

211
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:41,884
<i>You know India? I saw Slumdog
Millionaire.</i>

212
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,620
Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.

213
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:48,924
I thought your father was a gynecologist.

214
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,294
I'm sorry.

215
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,299
Martha, come here.

216
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:57,633
Meet Raj and Sheldon.

217
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:59,068
This is my friend, Martha. Hi.

218
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:00,336
Hello. Hello.

219
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,171
Is that the limited edition

220
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,839
<i>Green Lantern lantern?</i>

221
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:07,009
"In brightest day, in darkest night,

222
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:09,078
no evil shall escape my sight."

223
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:13,673
Oh, that is so awesome.

224
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,274
Thank you.

225
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:18,677
Have you chosen one to copulate with?

226
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:34,926
So, what should we talk about?

227
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,029
Well, we could always learn more

228
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:40,398
about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots.

229
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:41,733
Leonard?

230
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:47,005
Oh, we don't need to
talk about that anymore.

231
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:49,541
Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.

232
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,978
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

233
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:54,679
Right, and if you can't understand it,

234
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,314
it's not a fact.

235
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:59,484
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

236
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:00,485
Oh, got it.

237
00:10:00,553 --> 00:10:01,686
Thank you for educating me.

238
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:04,956
You're welcome.

239
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:06,091
How's your fish?

240
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,092
Amazing.

241
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,393
Would you like to try some?

242
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,561
Yeah, sure. Well, the fact is,

243
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:11,730
you can't.

244
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:14,533
Come on, Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.

245
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,867
Help me out here.

246
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,269
What do you think-- want to jump

247
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:18,537
right in the middle of
another couple's argument?

248
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:19,538
No, thank you.

249
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:20,906
Sorry.

250
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:25,243
Maybe we should just
stop talking about this.

251
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:28,246
Maybe some of us should
stop talking altogether.

252
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:30,248
How is everything tonight?

253
00:10:30,316 --> 00:10:32,417
Really uncomfortable.

254
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,045
You know, the best thing
about being in a committed,

255
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,013
monogamous, mutually supportive relationship

256
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:40,915
is that even if you have different ideas,

257
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:43,551
you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for,

258
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:45,787
even make love with...

259
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:50,458
Want your fish?

260
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:55,363
I knew you were going to do that.

261
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:56,931
Doesn't make me psychic!

262
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:02,303
Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse.

263
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,507
* American woman *

264
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:09,611
* Listen what I say... *

265
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,580
What's going on?

266
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:15,450
We scored.

267
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,653
I'm the wingman.

268
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,055
* American woman. *

269
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,364
Hey.

270
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,033
Laser. Had a great night last night.

271
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:34,202
I don't like to kiss and tell,

272
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,272
but somebody made it to eighth base.

273
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,442
What the hell is eighth base?

274
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,545
Seventh base with shirt off.

275
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,215
Well, my shirt.

276
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:48,550
How'd things go

277
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:49,551
with Penny?

278
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:51,219
Oh... couldn't be better.

279
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:57,180
Are we taking

280
00:11:57,248 --> 00:12:00,851
our relationship frustrations
out on innocent Cylons?

281
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,152
It's not just Cylons.

282
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,453
Superman's next.

283
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,824
All right, I was going to try to squeeze in

284
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:09,259
a little more mocking before lunch,

285
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:10,494
but I can come back later

286
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:13,130
when you don't have a high-powered weapon.

287
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:17,267
How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?

288
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,036
Hey, I once dated a girl

289
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,371
who believed she was abducted by aliens.

290
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,873
And that didn't bother you?

291
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:24,274
Au contraire.

292
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:27,210
It meant she was gullible and
open to a little probing.

293
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,513
What am I supposed to do,

294
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,115
pretend I believe something I
don't whenever I'm with Penny?

295
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:35,185
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things

296
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,721
when she's with you.

297
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:41,592
Do me a favor-- lean over,
put your head right here.

298
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:44,661
Let me show you another way to look at this.

299
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:48,665
Here we have the universe of all women.

300
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,800
These are the ones

301
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,168
you want to sleep with.

302
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:54,304
These are the women who believe
exactly what you believe.

303
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,040
These are the women who would
be willing to sleep with you.

304
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,979
And right there in the
little triple intersection...

305
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,413
is your ideal mate.

306
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:06,350
Odds are she's a short
physicist with low self-esteem

307
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:09,586
who lives in a government
research facility in China.

308
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,922
What's your point?

309
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,514
In order to keep having a
sexual relationship with Penny,

310
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,432
I have to give up everything I believe in--

311
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,167
my intellectual integrity, the very nature

312
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:19,869
of who I am?

313
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:21,938
I can't do that, Howard.

314
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:23,806
I respect that.

315
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:27,677
What is that?

316
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:28,878
Your new girlfriend.

317
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,414
Have fun tonight.

318
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:37,053
The dog...

319
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:40,156
<i>koira.</i>

320
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:42,692
The roof...

321
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,862
<i>katto.</i>

322
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:49,599
Grapes...

323
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,834
<i>ryp leet.</i>

324
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:56,439
One minute.

325
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:00,476
<i>Sis  n.</i>

326
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,745
What was that?

327
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,147
It means "come in."

328
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:05,448
It's taking forever to load

329
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:07,617
the new operating system on my computer.

330
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,952
I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom,

331
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,889
and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

332
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,393
That's Hindi for

333
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,061
"Whatever floats your boat."

334
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,231
Uh, listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby,

335
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,901
and she and her friend Martha
want to hang out with us again.

336
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:25,902
What do you say?

337
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:27,670
I don't say anything.

338
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:29,372
I merely offer you a facial expression

339
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,897
that suggests you've gone insane.

340
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,349
I don't get it.

341
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,424
You had a great time.

342
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,626
Yes, exactly, I had a great time.

343
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:39,728
That's done; I've moved on to other things.

344
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,363
For example, after I learn Finnish,

345
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:42,998
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.

346
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,401
Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy

347
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,304
far from home, and I want a girlfriend

348
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:50,739
and I want her to be Abby,

349
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,641
and she'll only come over
if she can bring Martha.

350
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,644
Raj, I highly doubt there is
any argument you can make,

351
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,914
threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy,

352
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,515
plea, invocation,

353
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,986
<i>supplication, or... vetoomus</i>

354
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:08,757
that you can employ that would
convince me to reconsider.

355
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:26,608
<i>My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan
Lee.</i>

356
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,411
Oh, my.

357
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,721
I've admired these for years.

358
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,590
So does that mean we can
go with the girls again?

359
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:56,760
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!

360
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:02,533
You can't wear the hands on the date.

361
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:07,838
Hulk sad.

362
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:12,543
Hey.

363
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:18,749
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

364
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:20,250
Not only is it courteous,

365
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:21,585
it's safety smart.

366
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:23,621
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused

367
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:27,558
by accidental dryer lint ignition.

368
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:28,626
Now you're supposed to say,

369
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:30,561
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

370
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,663
"Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.

371
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,765
I could never be mad at you."

372
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,334
Wow, that's all you got

373
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:39,136
after you were the most obnoxious person

374
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:43,140
on a double date that
included Howard Wolowitz?

375
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:45,943
No, I'm sorry.

376
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:47,611
I really am. It's not right

377
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,547
to mock what a person believes in.

378
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:51,749
Thank you.

379
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,617
Would you be willing to go to my psychic

380
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,219
and see what it's all about?

381
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,854
Would you be willing to read a book

382
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,723
that concisely explains how
all psychics are frauds?

383
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,092
I would not.

384
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:09,289
Okay, let's go see your psychic.

385
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:10,424
Really?

386
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,926
Well, yeah, one of us has
to keep an open mind.

387
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:14,194
You saying I don't have an open mind?

388
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:16,096
No, n-not at all.
Let me help you with this stuff.

389
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:19,800
You know, I believe in ghosts, too.

390
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,501
Great. And astrology.

391
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,505
I know, and pyramid power
and healing crystals.

392
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:29,009
Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.

393
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:32,012
Really, that's the line?

394
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,681
Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?

395
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,016
Oh, voodoo's real.

396
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:38,518
You don't want to mess with voodoo.

397
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:43,490
<i>Flatland is more than just a
mathematical essay.</i>

398
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,693
It is also a treatise on
Victorian social mores.

399
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,662
You know, I had never considered that.

400
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:54,401
Wow, that's going to

401
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:56,703
completely change my visits there.

402
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,948
Well, it's late.

403
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:09,149
Uh-huh.

404
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:10,717
Time for bed.

405
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:13,954
Okay.

406
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,357
Good night, puny human!

407
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,891
Sheldon?

408
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:39,198
Yes?

409
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,601
Listen, they're kind of

410
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,593
getting busy in the living room, and...

411
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:46,513
I was wondering if I could
hang out in here for a while.

412
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:49,482
Well, I suppose.

413
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,683
Come in.

414
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,457
I'll sleep in Leonard's room. Good night.

415
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:08,458
