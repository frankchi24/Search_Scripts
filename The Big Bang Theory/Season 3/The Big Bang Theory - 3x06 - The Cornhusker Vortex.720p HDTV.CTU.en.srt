1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,118
- Kites, ho!
- Kites, ho!

2
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:04,269
Kites, ho!

3
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,029
ALL:
Kites, ho!

4
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:08,383
Excuse me.

5
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,136
You're misusing the word "ho."

6
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,013
It's an interjection used
to call attention

7
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:16,512
to a destination, not an object,
as in, uh, "Land, ho!"

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,380
or, uh, "Westward, ho!"

9
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,748
ALL:
Kites, ho!

10
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:26,098
Hey, guys.
Whatcha doin'?

11
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,222
Going out to discover
electricity?

12
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:31,501
If you're referring to the
work of Benjamin Franklin,

13
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:33,432
he did not
"discover electricity,"

14
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:35,060
he merely used a
kite to determine

15
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,109
that lightning "consists"
of electricity.

16
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:39,220
He also invented the
Franklin stove,

17
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:41,452
bifocals and the flexible
urinary catheter.

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,023
Kites, ho.

19
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:49,235
We're heading out for
some kite fighting.

20
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:50,845
- "Kite fighting"?
- Oh, yeah.

21
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:53,701
It's an extremely competitive,
cutthroat sport.

22
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:57,913
Well, actually, the risk of
throat cutting is very low.

23
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,569
On the other hand, severe
string burn is a real

24
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:01,936
and ever-present danger.

25
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,098
You want to come watch?

26
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,998
Oh gee...

27
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:08,288
sounds amazing.

28
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,543
But, um, I've got some
friends coming over.

29
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:11,352
Not a big thing--
we're just

30
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:12,913
gonna watch the Nebraska game.

31
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:15,132
Oh. Football, sure.

32
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:16,463
Good guess.

33
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:21,118
I would've invited you, but I
know you're not a football fan.

34
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:23,745
No no, I'm not, so... great.

35
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,169
You've got plans

36
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,017
doing something you like,
I've got plans

37
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,855
doing something I
like, so it's good.

38
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,359
Well, maybe we'll
hang out later--

39
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:31,457
you know, after
everybody's gone.

40
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,484
Yeah, great.

41
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:34,533
See ya.

42
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,401
Well, this sucks.

43
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,375
I'm sorry, I got bored
and drifted off.

44
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,418
Where exactly in the interaction
did the sucking lie?

45
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:52,087
Leonard just realized that
Penny's been hiding him

46
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,981
from her friends because
he's a tiny, little man

47
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,114
who flies kites.

48
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,360
Oh, that certainly would suck.

was in a hot, dense state *

50

00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,220

The Big Bang Theory
Season 03 Episode 06
"The Cornhusker Vortex"

58
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:30,104
Wolowitz is trying
to outflank us.

59
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:32,130
Let out some string,
add altitude

60
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:33,542
and I'll go under
and cut his line.

61
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,397
Why wouldn't Penny want
her friends to meet me?

62
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,110
Focus, Leonard, focus!

63
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,732
The heat of battle is upon us.

64
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,181
The dogs of war are unleashed.

65
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:43,784
Maybe Koothrappali's right.

66
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,008
Maybe I embarrass her.

67
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,566
You're embarrassing
me right now.

68
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:49,200
A grown man worrying
about such nonsense

69
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:50,464
when in the middle
of flying kites.

70
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:53,793
Sorry.

71
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,255
Sorry won't bring
their kites down.

72
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:56,560
Ouch!

73
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:57,699
String burn!
String burn!

74
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:03,256
Oh, they think
we're flanking

75
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:04,459
they're playing
righ into our hands.

76
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,287
On the count of three, we
execute the flying scissor.

77
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,136
One, two...

78
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,234
Wow!

79
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:11,873
- Did you see that?
- See what?

80
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,527
That chick--
she smiled at me.

81
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:15,128
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.

82
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:16,490
Come on, scissors, scissors!

83
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:17,762
- Hold my line.
- Wait.

84
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:18,310
What are you doing?

85
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:21,169
I can't scissors by myself!
Howard! Come back!

86
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,818
SHELDON:
Victory!

87
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,446
Son of a bitch.

88
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:31,492
You're a sucky friend,
you know that?

89
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,965
A sucky, sucky friend.

90
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,371
What was I supposed to do?

91
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,401
She gave me that
"come-hither" look.

92
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:41,420
If she gave you any look at all.
It was a "you suck" look.

93
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:46,649
I would've caught up to her
if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

94
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,344
Oh, please, you
weigh 80 pounds.

95
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:49,560
You don't have a hammy.

96
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,736
So, Penny doesn't want
around her friends.

97
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,604
I embarrass her.
What else could it be?

98
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:56,711
Well, her actions

99
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:58,873
could be out of concern
for your feelings

100
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,271
perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings

101
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:03,262
because she's scouting
for a new mate

102
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:05,111
and doesn't want to do
it in front of you.

103
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:08,954
Oh... how kind of her.

104
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:10,254
Agreed.

105
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,803
Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

106
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,534
A female bonobo will copulate with
a new male in front of the old one

107
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,561
without so much as
a "how do you do?"

108
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,012
You always do
this, you know?

109
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,840
You ditch me for a woman
you don't have a shot with.

110
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,953
- I totally had a shot.
- With a woman

111
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,329
you were chasing
through a park--

112
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,473
that's not a shot,
that's a felony.

113
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:36,169
What's worse, it cost me my prized Patang
fighting kite. Sheldon, I don't suppose

114
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,410
there's any chance you
could give me my kite back?

115
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:41,001
I'm sorry, Raj, but the
rules of aerial warfare

116
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:43,609
dictate at the fallen
kite go to the victor.

117
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,409
And without rules, the
competition has no meaning.

118
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,679
And without meaning,

119
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,946
the following would
be an empty gesture.

120
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:52,993
I have your kite.
I have your kite.

121
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,006
(Knocking at door)

122
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,692
- Hey.
- Hi.

123
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:05,181
How was your football party?

124
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:07,282
- It was pretty good. We won.
- Oh, wow.

125
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,372
That's excellent.

126
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:10,455
It's a weird figure
of speech, isn't it

127
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,840
"we won" when you weren't
actually playing.

128
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:15,478
When we watch Star Wars,

129
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,136
we don't say, "we
defeated the Empire."

130
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:22,227
- I'm glad to hear it.
- Yeah.

131
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:23,866
Oh, hey, on a related subject,

132
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,829
are you embarrassed to have
me around your friends?

133
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:29,344
Oh, my god, no.

134
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,658
Why would you ask that?

135
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,467
Well, you know, I just noticed

136
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,397
- I haven't really met any of them.
- Sure you have.

137
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:38,216
Well, yeah, no, I met the
huge ex-boyfriend

138
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:43,153
and the-- smaller, yet still larger
than me ex-boyfriend. 

139
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,589
By the way, were they here today?

140
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,850
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

141
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,219
Why would they be?
Why would I ask?

142
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,973
Why am I rambling?
Why don't you stop me?

143
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:52,346
Leonard, look,

144
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,409
if you want to meet my friends,
that would be great.

145
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,250
I just, you know, I didn't
want you to be bored.

146
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,722
I wouldn't be bored.

147
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,727
- Why would I be bored?
- Well,

148
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,769
'cause they're not
genius scientists.

149
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:05,385
Penny, I like all
sorts of people.

150
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,915
Th-- some of my best
friends aren't geniuses.

151
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:10,430
Like who?

152
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,877
Okay, some of my Facebook
friends aren't geniuses.

153
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,393
My point is, if we're
going to be a couple,

154
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,424
I should be friends
with your friends.

155
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,060
Okay, great. Well,
then why don't you

156
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:26,115
come over next Saturday
and watch the game with us.

157
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:28,044
Another football game?

158
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,938
They have them every week.

159
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,050
Did not know that.

160
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:35,342
- You wanted to meet my friends.
- Sure.

161
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:37,723
Sure, just I don't know
much about football.

162
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,061
Oh, that's okay--
a lot of the guys'

163
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:40,125
girlfriends don't know football.

164
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,560
They just kind of drink
and talk in the kitchen.

165
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,299
Great.

166
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:50,698
(Football game playing on TV)

167
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,695
Okay, a complete pass.

168
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,200
First down, New England.

169
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,591
I think I'm starting
to get this.

170
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:00,640
Really?

171
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,133
The only thing I've learned
in the last two hours

172
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:04,259
is that American men
love drinking beer,

173
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:06,836
pee too often and have
trouble getting erections.

174
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:13,471
Focus on the game, not
the commercials, Raj.

175
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,588
I'm just saying, maybe if you
people cut back on the beer,

176
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:20,276
you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy
your women without pharmaceutical help.

177
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:24,820
Raj, what are you
doing here?

178
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,731
You were supposed to help me
pimp out my Vespa.

179
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,881
I'm sorry, are you under the impression
that we're still friends?

180
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:33,511
(Groans):
Oh come on.

181
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:36,260
You're not still grinding
on the kite thing, are you?

182
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,005
It's not just the kite thing.

183
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,364
Every time we go some place,
you think you can just dump me

184
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,665
whenever someone prettier
comes along,

185
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,186
even though you don't have
a shot with them.

186
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:45,693
I had a shot with that jogger.

187
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:49,000
Fine. Paint green flames
on your little scooter with her.

188
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,273
It's not a little scooter.

189
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,483
It's the second biggest
Vespa they make!

190
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:55,703
(Door closes)

191
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,473
Are you watching football?

192
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:01,381
There's no fooling you.

193
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:06,769
Now, what is this sacks
statistic they put up there?

194
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,528
All I know about Saks is,
my mother shops there.

195
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,252
Sacks, sacks...

196
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,891
SHELDON: It's football nomenclature

197
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,403
for when a quarterback is tackled

198
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,316
behind the line of scrimmage.

199
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:21,383
Huh...

200
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,288
Scrimmage.

201
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,173
SHELDON:
The line of scrimmage

202
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,946
is the imaginary transverse line

203
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:32,361
separating the offense
from the defense.

204
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:33,969
Oh.

205
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,266
Sheldon knows football?

206
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,170
Apparently.

207
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:41,920
I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?
(Quidditch: Harry Potter's game)

208
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,625
Sheldon, how do you
know this stuff?

209
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,127
I grew up in Texas.

210
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:49,999
Football is ubiquitous in Texas.

211
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,103
Pro football,
College football,

212
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,154
High school football,
Peewee football...

213
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:56,960
In fact, every form of football
except the original--

214
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,611
European football.

215
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:01,474
Which most Texans believe
to be a Commie plot.

216
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:05,016
Unbelievable.

217
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:07,396
If you're interested, I also
know all about frying meat

218
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,274
that isn't chicken
as if it were chicken.

219
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,186
So you could teach me?

220
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,341
Football or chicken-fried meats?

221
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:21,160
Football.

222
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,364
I'm going to Penny's on Saturday
to watch a game with her friends

223
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,908
And I don't want to look like
an idiot. I want to blend in.

224
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,681
If you want to blend in
with Penny's friends,

225
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,190
I'd think looking like an idiot
would be the perfect camouflage.

226
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,368
Come on, Sheldon, please teach
me football. It'll be fun.

227
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,768
That's exactly what
my father said.

228
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:39,289
"Come to the games.
Watch the games."

229
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,968
Week in and week out
from the time

230
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:43,206
I was five until I
went off to college.

231
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:45,501
Longest seven years of my life.

232
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,057
Please, I'm asking
you as a friend.

233
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:53,731
Are you making this a tier
one friendship request?

234
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:56,328
Yes

235
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,403
(Sighs)

236
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,672
Fine.

237
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:01,327
- I really appreciate this.
- Yeah, yeah.

238
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,816
All right, point dexter,
sit down, shut up and listen.

239
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,069
I'm sorry?

240
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,663
That's how my father
always began

241
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:10,036
our football conversations.

242
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:11,839
And if you'd like,

243
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:12,748
after the game,

244
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,140
I'll take outside and teach you how to shoot
close enough a racoon that did crap itself.

245
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,850
When are you going to stop
making Cylon toast?

246
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,682
When I have enough to destroy
all the human toast

247
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,655
on the Battlestar
known as Galactica.

248
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,872
Is that what you're wearing
to watch football at Penny's?

249
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,866
What's wrong with
a football jersey?

250
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,167
Nothing. That, however, appears
to be a football cocktail dress.

251
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,002
It's the smallest size they had,

252
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,518
except the one for dogs.

253
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:10,221
I can't believe they
had one for dogs.

254
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:11,537
Oh, yes.

255
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,108
Canine football fans are
a common sight in Texas.

256
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,256
Cats, however, refuse
to wear sporting apparel.

257
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,786
My sister found that
out the hard way.

258
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,205
Anyway, wish me luck.

259
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,617
Leonard, wait.

260
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,419
Am I correct in assuming that
your attempt to be accepted

261
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,270
by Penny's peers is based
on your desire

262
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:34,053
to ensure your continuing
mating privileges with her?

263
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:39,086
Well, I wouldn't put
it exactly that way.

264
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,434
How would you put it?

265
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,987
Yeah, okay, like you said.

266
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,484
Huh.

267
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,706
Seems like an awful lot of trouble
to go through for intercourse.

268
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,280
Don't you have access to women
who will do it for money?

269
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:57,785
By the way.

270
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,610
Another accepted usage
for the term "ho."

271
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:04,588
Good-bye, Sheldon.

272
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:06,865
Hold on.

273
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,572
I believe that
social convention

274
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,364
dictate you not arrive
empty-handed.

275
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,341
Would you like to bring
some Cylon toast?

276
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,618
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit
in, not get laughed at.

277
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,222
(Door closes)

278
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:23,156
What's funny about Cylon toast?

279
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,125
It's open.

280
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,263
Hey, pal.

281
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,219
What do you want?
(TV clicks off)

282
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:38,231
I brought you
a little gift.

283
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,895
New kite.

284
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,227
The kite you made me lose
was an authentic Patang,

285
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,376
an Indian fighting kite.

286
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:47,952
That my brother sent to me
from New Delhi.

287
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:50,516
It took me a day to put together
and two days to paint.

288
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:52,893
This is Hello Kitty.

289
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:58,706
Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.

290
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,222
Does a Patang?

291
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,486
Wow, you just don't
get it, do you?

292
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,090
Buying me something
pretty isn't going

293
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:08,009
to make our problem
just go away.

294
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,001
Look, I admit I
haven't always been

295
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,685
the best friend I could be.

296
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:16,061
You've been a sucky friend,
a sucky, sucky friend.

297
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,332
Stipulated.

298
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:19,861
And you do it
all the time.

299
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,774
Last week in the mall at
Radio Shack, we were looking

300
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,947
for a phone with giant
numbers for your mother,

301
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,516
and I suddenly realize
you're not even there.

302
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,389
- I know, I know...
- Then where were you?

303
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:31,471
Getting shot down by the
girl at hot dog on a stick.

304
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,658
But in my defense,
she was gorgeous!

305
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:37,118
And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade,

306
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,594
going up and down
and up and down.

307
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,300
It was like a
free pole dance

308
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:43,916
right in the middle
of the food court.

309
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,948
You're impossible.

310
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:49,200
Hey, at least I can
talk to women

311
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,823
without being drunk.

312
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,895
Excuse me, I have
selective mutism,

313
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,914
a recognized medical disorder.

314
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:56,725
You're just a douche.

315
00:13:58,612 --> 00:13:59,844
No. You know what?

316
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:01,949
Maybe that's what this
whole thing's about.

317
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:02,938
You're not mad at me,

318
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,247
you're mad at yourself.

319
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,570
No, I'm mad at you.

320
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,847
I hate myself,
but I'm mad at you.

321
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,324
Fine. You're mad at me.
I get it.

322
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:14,474
How about we go spend
the day together?

323
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,045
Just the two of us.

324
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:18,141
We'll go anywhere you want.

325
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:20,729
I don't know.

326
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,582
Come on.

327
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:25,738
Let me take you someplace nice.

328
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,853
I-I do enjoy the
La Brea Tar Pits.

329
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:37,751
Really, now? With the traffic
and the parking?

330
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:38,897
Okay, fine.

331
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,207
The Tar Pits.
Let's go.

332
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,668
Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

333
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:49,969
(Exclaims)

334
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:56,012
Go! Go! Go!

335
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,536
Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes!

336
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:58,876
Are you people watching this?

337
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:00,459
Is this amazing or what?

338
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,509
Sweetie, that's a highlight

339
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:04,534
from the '98
Championship game.

340
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,534
Did not know that.

341
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,691
- How much beer have you had?
- None, why?

342
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,229
Oh. I was just kind of
hoping you were drunk.

343
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,515
- Now we're back live.
- Okay, yeah.

344
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,884
I can see the difference.

345
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,508
Oh, where's the flag?
That's intentional grounding.

346
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,619
- Totally.
- That completely was

347
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:26,739
a forward pass, which they
threw intentionally incomplete

348
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:29,839
to avoid loss of yardage
or to conserve time

349
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,015
I can't believe they're not

350
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:34,098
being penalized with
the loss of a down

351
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:36,015
and by having to move
the line of scrimmage

352
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,801
back to the spot of the foul.

353
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,356
Here, have some pizza, sweetie.

354
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,120
Penny, you know I'm
lactose intolerant.

355
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,433
I know. I just need
you to stop talking.

356
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,369
(Knocking)
SHELDON:
Penny.

357
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,377
Penny. Penny.

358
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,984
- Sheldon, come in.
- Thank you.

359
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,455
I'd like to make a sandwich,
but I'm out of bread.

360
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,119
There's some
in the fridge.

361
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,570
You shouldn't keep your bread
in the refrigerator.

362
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,219
Staleness is caused
by crystallization

363
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,210
of the starch molecules,
which occurs faster

364
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,432
- at cool temperatures.
- On Earth,

365
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:11,977
we say "thank you."

366
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:16,010
So Leonard, how
goes the mimesis?

367
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:17,507
"Mimesis"?

368
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:20,177
You know. Mimesis.

369
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:24,506
An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties

370
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,276
of a specific object
or organism.

371
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,825
Mimesis.

372
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,711
What the hell are
you talking about?

373
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:35,767
I'm attempting to
communicate with you

374
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:39,075
without my meaning becoming
apparent to those around you.

375
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,359
Let me try again.

376
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:44,793
Have the indigenous fauna

377
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,301
accepted you as one
of their own?

378
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:50,644
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

379
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,516
Oh, I guess so.

380
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:55,819
Good. Oh, FYI.

381
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:58,459
After I eat my sandwich,
I'm taking Koothrappali's

382
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,256
Patang kite out
for a test run.

383
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:03,048
Would you like to get your
delta-wing raptor and join me?

384
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:04,571
I don't want to fly
kites, Sheldon.

385
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,265
We're watching football here.

386
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,055
I can see that.

387
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:10,315
I was providing you
with an alternative.

388
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,861
A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.

389
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,361
(Whistle blows on TV)

390
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:18,506
Oh, look at that.

391
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,521
The Oklahoma coach is
throwing down a red flag

392
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:22,842
indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.

393
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,984
I hope he's right, 'cause if
he's not, it'll cost him

394
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:26,700
one of his three time-outs.

395
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:34,112
You know, Leonard, honey,

396
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,602
I wouldn't mind if you wanted
to go fly kites with Sheldon.

397
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,030
No, I'll watch the
end of the game.

398
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,634
Besides, there's only
three minutes left.

399
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:43,090
Until halftime.

400
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:44,850
This is just half?

401
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:47,316
We've been here for hours.

402
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,048
And you're gonna be here
for a couple more.

403
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,754
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- No.

404
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,163
Nice meeting all of you.

405
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:57,828
So, yeah, anyway,
that's my boyfriend.

406
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,004
He is really smart.

407
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,506
I really like my
saber-toothed cat.

408
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:12,433
Thank you.

409
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:13,927
My pleasure.

410
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,988
Maybe after lunch, we can
go to Marie Callender's

411
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:18,661
and have some pie.

412
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:19,795
I'd like that.

413
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,728
(Takes deep breath)

414
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,778
This is turning out to
be a perfect Saturday.

415
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,849
Good. I'm glad.

416
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,821
Oh, man. Did you see the
way she smiled at me?

417
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,128
Fine. Go ahead.

418
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,676
No. This is our day.

419
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:39,028
If you want to
chase after her,

420
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,122
chase after her.

421
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:44,962
Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn't
have a shot with a girl like that.

422
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:46,159
Don't put yourself down.

423
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:47,601
You're a very attractive man.

424
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:49,471
- You think so?
- Yeah.

425
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,940
Absolutely.
It wouldn't kill you

426
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,773
to take a Pilates class
with me now and then,

427
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:55,028
but you have a certain
wiry appeal.

428
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,608
Yeah, well, it
doesn't matter

429
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,499
'cause she wasn't
really smiling at me.

430
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,851
Actually, in this case,
I think she was.

431
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:02,627
Really?

432
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:04,077
- Yeah.
- Bye.

433
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:08,359
What a douche.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
