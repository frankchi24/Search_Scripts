1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:01,915
Penny, hello.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:03,853
Hey, Sheldon.

3
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:05,639
What is shaking?

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,575
I'm sorry?

5
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:11,931
It's colloquial,
a conversation opener.

6
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:16,083
So, do you find
the weather satisfying?

7
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:19,850
Are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team?

8
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:23,443
What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

9
00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:26,756
I'm striking up a casual
conversation with you.

10
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:27,966
S'up?

11
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,959
Please don't do that.

12
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:38,241
All right, but I'm given to understand
that when you have something awkward

13
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,594
to discuss with someone,

14
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:42,044
it's more palatable to preface it
with banal chit chat.

15
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:46,187
So, this wasn't
the awkward part?

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,123
All right.

17
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:55,545
S'up?

18
00:00:57,644 --> 00:00:59,471
Oh, good, I used that right.

19
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:04,742
Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has
entered into a new romantic relationship

20
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,112
which includes a sexual component?

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,290
Okay, feeling the awkward now.

22
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,566
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett

23
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:18,956
and she is a highly distinguished
surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.

24
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:20,505
- Leonard told me.
- Good.

25
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:24,623
What he may have left out is how
important this relationship is to me.

26
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:27,882
To you?

27
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,951
See, of the handful of women
Leonard's been involved with,

28
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,921
she's the only one
I have ever found tolerable.

29
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,399
Well, what about me?

30
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:43,499
The statement stands for itself.

31
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,068
Aren't you sweet?

32
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:49,638
Anyway, should you have
any interaction with her,

33
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:53,184
it would be most helpful
that she not see you as a sexual rival.

34
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:57,856
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

35
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:01,152
You say that now,
but consider the following scenario:

36
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:04,216
You're sitting in your apartment,
it's late, you're alone.

37
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:08,110
Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup
of estrogen and progesterone

38
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:10,675
and suddenly even Leonard

39
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:13,177
seems like a viable
sexual candidate.

40
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:16,474
Or a "hookup"

41
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,244
as it's referred to
by today's urban youth.

42
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:22,187
- Really?
- Yes. Now, should that happen,

43
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,368
I would ask you to find
some way to suppress your libido.

44
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,590
I could think about you.

45
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:35,338
Fine, whatever works.

46
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,768
Always nice talking
to you, Sheldon.

47
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:41,137
Peace out!

48
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,581
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

49
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:18,897
This is very pleasant.

50
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,860
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

51
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:26,244
And you said there'd never be
enough pasta for the three of us.

52
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,201
I stand corrected.

53
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,171
You know, Italian housewives
have a rule of thumb.

54
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,052
A handful of dry pasta
about an inch in diameter

55
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,800
is sufficient for each person

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,270
as it doubles in volume
when cooked.

57
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,355
- That's very interesting.
- Thank you.

58
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:44,198
She doesn't mean it.
She's just being nice.

59
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:50,183
Well, since Leonard seems to be
dropping the conversational ball,

60
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:52,360
I guess I'll just have
to pick it up.

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,420
Have you ever witnessed
a violent crime?

62
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:06,407
- No.
- Good.

63
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,356
What's your favorite fruit?

64
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:11,003
Strawberries.

65
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:13,942
Technically not a fruit,
but all right.

66
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,469
Where did you do
your medical internship?

67
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,804
Lawrence Memorial
in Galveston, Texas.

68
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,973
Really? That's where I was born!

69
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:25,977
You're kidding!

70
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:28,848
I spent so much of my childhood
at that hospital.

71
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,149
When I was 12,
I got to ride there in a helicopter.

72
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,200
- Why, what happened?
- Radiation burns.

73
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:39,157
A little mishap while I was
building my own CAT scanner.

74
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,576
I'm sorry, you tried to build
your own CAT scanner?

75
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,704
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

76
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:47,215
In fact, I was briefly
able to see the inside

77
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:50,601
of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball,
before he caught fire.

78
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:53,773
It led to an interesting
expression in our house:

79
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,430
"Not a Snowball's chance
in a CAT scanner."

80
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,180
Excuse me.

81
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:04,640
When I come back, just for fun,

82
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:06,607
the subject will be
alternative history.

83
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:09,360
Specifically, how would
the Civil War have gone differently

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,148
if Lincoln had been a robot
sent from the future?

85
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,136
Look at that,
there's even pasta left over.

86
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,617
Do you understand
that this was supposed to be a date?

87
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,385
I do. Do you?
Because frankly,

88
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,582
you've been in a foul mood
since I sat down.

89
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:35,697
Okay, here's my question.
Why did you sit down?

90
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,280
To help.
Look, if you fail at this relationship,

91
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,136
and history suggests you will,

92
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:45,668
then we risk losing
the medical officer

93
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:48,173
that our landing party
has always needed.

94
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:52,515
What landing party?

95
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,696
You're Kirk, I'm Spock,
Wolowitz is Scotty,

96
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:59,612
Koothrappali is the guy
who always gets killed...

97
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,407
and now we've got McCoy.

98
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:14,877
So, we're all standing around
looking at the post-op X ray

99
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:18,447
and there it is, clear as day,
right in the guy's chest cavity...

100
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,155
one of my earrings.

101
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,048
Oh, my God, what did you do?

102
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:25,881
What do you think I did?

103
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,964
I discreetly slipped off
the other earring,

104
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:31,218
put it in my pocket
and then got the hell out of there!

105
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:34,302
I have a bone to pick with you, sir.

106
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:37,157
Hi, Sheldon.

107
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:38,908
Hi, Stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late,

108
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:42,378
but your companion left
the most indecipherable invitation.

109
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:44,281
What invitation?

110
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,047
"We're going to the movies."

111
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,572
What movie? What theater? What time?

112
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:54,552
If you were trying to make it
impossible to locate you,

113
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:56,768
you couldn't have done a better job.

114
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:58,574
Clearly I could have.

115
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:03,104
It took me nearly 20 minutes
to browse the history on your computer

116
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,426
to see what movie
times you looked up.

117
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,055
Wait here, I'll find us seats.

118
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,797
- We have seats.
- Not the right seats.

119
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:23,421
What is he doing?

120
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,891
He's finding
the acoustic sweet spot.

121
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,986
Does he always do this?

122
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:34,456
Sometimes he brings
a toy xylophone.

123
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,751
I am really sorry about this.

124
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,238
No, it's fine.
You know, he's sweet.

125
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,413
My apologies, you've been
sitting in it all along.

126
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,880
- You want to slide over one?
- No, just sit here.

127
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,424
Oh, yeah, this is it.

128
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:26,360
What, Sheldon?

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,472
What, Sheldon?! What, Sheldon?!

130
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,328
Tell me what you see here.

131
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:34,763
The blunt instrument that will be
the focus of my murder trial?

132
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,331
This is Stephanie's Facebook page.

133
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,522
Now, where it should say
"in a relationship," what does it say?

134
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:42,272
"Stephanie Barnett is single."

135
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,160
Furthermore, earlier this evening,

136
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,152
she threw a digital sheep
at some guy named Mike.

137
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:50,716
Who's Mike?!

138
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:53,494
Why does he get a digital sheep
and not you?

139
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,861
It's just her Facebook page

140
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,064
and we've only been going out
a couple of weeks.

141
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:00,647
You don't see it, do you?
We're losing her.

142
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:06,470
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

143
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,428
You are not in this relationship.

144
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:12,428
I am.

145
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:15,987
Ergo, you have no say

146
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,351
in anything that happens
between me and Stephanie.

147
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,653
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

148
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:26,299
Pursuant to Starfleet
General Order 104,

149
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,025
Section A: You are deemed unfit

150
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:30,591
and I hereby relieve you
of your command.

151
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,538
General Order 104, Section A
does not apply in this situation.

152
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:40,342
- Give me one good reason why not.
- Because this is not <i>Star Trek</i>!

153
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,407
What?

154
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,292
This is banana bread.

155
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,298
This is a door knob.

156
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,355
It's my understanding
that an unsolicited gift of food

157
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,758
can be a precursor
to an impromptu invitation

158
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:07,299
to come in and chat.

159
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,240
Would you like to come in?

160
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,908
I suppose I could spare
a few minutes.

161
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,183
Were you robbed?

162
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:25,944
How can you be sure?

163
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:28,390
What do you want?

164
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,211
I'm certain this will come
as no surprise to you,

165
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,093
but Leonard is failing
in yet another relationship.

166
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:37,366
- He's having problems with Stephanie?
- She's sending virtual livestock

167
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,224
to random men on the Internet.

168
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,644
If I have any hope of keeping
them together, I need data.

169
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,862
Specifically, I need to know exactly
what Leonard did

170
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:48,906
that caused you to pop
an emotional cap in his buttocks.

171
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,823
- What?
- Again, urban slang.

172
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:56,390
In which, I believe I'm gaining
remarkable fluency.

173
00:10:58,023 --> 00:11:00,216
So, what is the "down"
and the "low"?

174
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,760
And don't worry,
this is all entirely confidential,

175
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,029
so, you feel free to include
any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

176
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:09,099
We never got to the bedroom.

177
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:10,858
Because?

178
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:17,429
All right, you know what?
I'll tell you what happened.

179
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:20,501
We were young,

180
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,268
we were very much in love,

181
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:23,973
but we could only communicate

182
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:26,913
through a time-traveling mailbox
at my lake house.

183
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,735
It's not enough that you made me
watch that movie,

184
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:35,480
but now you mock me with it?

185
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,578
Gentlemen, I have a question

186
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:43,831
about dating and relationships.

187
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:52,005
You told me you were going
to have the talk with him.

188
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,749
I've been waiting for someone
to have the talk with me.

189
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,728
More to the point,
it's about finding a way

190
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,514
to keep Leonard
and Stephanie together.

191
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:01,932
I don't think you can.

192
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:03,151
Why not?

193
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:06,328
Look at Leonard's record.
27 days with Joyce Kim.

194
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,742
During which she defected
to North Korea.

195
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,236
Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.

196
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,112
For which she awarded him the nickname
"Speed of Light Leonard."

197
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,792
- And the three hour dinner with Penny.
- Which would have been two and a half

198
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,249
if they ordered the souffle
when they sat down.

199
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:24,653
Based on the geometric progression,

200
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:27,800
his relationship with Stephanie
should have ended after 20 minutes.

201
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,035
Yes, I'm aware of the math.
Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

202
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,755
The issue remains.

203
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:37,342
How do we circumvent
his inevitable rejection?

204
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,896
If you want to guarantee
his appeal to Stephanie,

205
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:43,131
your best bet would be to kill
all the other men on the planet.

206
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,952
Here's what you shouldn't do.
Don't shpritz him with that body spray

207
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:50,407
from the commercial where the women
undress when they smell it.

208
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:52,011
That doesn't work at all.

209
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,296
No matter how much you put on.

210
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:01,193
That's all you've got?
Apocalyptic genocide

211
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,858
and "go easy on the cologne"?

212
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,443
What?

213
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:26,612
Zucchini bread.

214
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:29,947
- Thank you.
- May I come in?

215
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:32,970
I see.

216
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,448
Apparently, my earlier inquiry
regarding you and Leonard

217
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:36,902
crossed some sort of line.

218
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:39,196
I apologize.

219
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,323
Well, thank you.

220
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,742
Have you and I returned
to a social equilibrium?

221
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,244
- Yes.
- Great.

222
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:46,414
New topic.

223
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:49,358
Where are you
in your menstrual cycle?

224
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:53,710
What?!

225
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:57,330
I've been doing some research online,
and apparently, female primates,

226
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,800
you know, apes,
chimpanzees, you...

227
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:04,763
They find their mate more desirable
when he's courted by another female.

228
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:08,333
Now, this effect is intensified
when the rival female is secreting

229
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:10,487
the pheromones
associated with ovulation.

230
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,942
Which brings me back to my question.
Where are you...

231
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,398
Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

232
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:24,904
All I'm saying is if they can cure
yellow fever and malaria,

233
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,701
why can't they do something
about lactose intolerance?

234
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:32,020
Leonard, you're going
to have to let this go.

235
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,459
You had a little cheese dip, you farted.
I thought it was cute.

236
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,625
- You want some more wine?
- Yeah, I mean...

237
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:45,846
I assume I'm not driving
anywhere tonight.

238
00:14:58,377 --> 00:14:59,657
What are you doing?

239
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:01,973
I have a craving
for white asparagus

240
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:04,367
that apparently is destined
to go unsatisfied.

241
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,461
Excuse me.

242
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:16,710
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm helping you with Stephanie.

243
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,089
By making constipated moose sounds?

244
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:22,709
When I fail to open this jar
and you succeed,

245
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:24,718
it will establish you
as the "alpha" male.

246
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,511
You see... when a female

247
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,767
witnesses an exhibition
of physical domination,

248
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,620
she produces the hormone oxytocin.

249
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,558
If the two of you
then engage in intercourse,

250
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,963
this will create
the biochemical reaction in the brain

251
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,837
which lay people naively interpret
as "falling in love."

252
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,622
Would it work if I just
punched you in the face?

253
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,762
Yes, actually it would,
but let's see how the lid goes.

254
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,789
I'm not strong enough, Leonard,
you'll have to do it.

255
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,053
- For God's sakes.
- Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

256
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:14,184
You want some help with that?

257
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,133
I got it.

258
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:20,588
He's got it,
and that's not surprising.

259
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,541
It's something I long ago
came to peace with

260
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,354
in my role as the beta male.

261
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:28,198
Open it.

262
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:38,041
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

263
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:40,178
- I'm bleeding.
- Like a gladiator!

264
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,298
- Honey, you're going to need stitches.
- Stitches? With a needle?

265
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,592
Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

266
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:51,096
Yeah, hang on a sec.

267
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,028
FYI, I was defrosting
a steak in there.

268
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,834
What a beautiful job Stephanie did.

269
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,351
I might have gone with a mattress suture
instead of a blanket stitch,

270
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:16,121
but you can't argue
with her results.

271
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:18,331
It's a shame it won't scar.

272
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:21,958
The war wound is a time-honored
badge of masculinity.

273
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:26,953
I can't remember a time
when you weren't talking.

274
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:31,577
Just for the record, my efforts
to establish you as the alpha male

275
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,630
were not aided by you
bursting into tears.

276
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,352
I did not burst into tears,

277
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,309
my eyes just got a little watery.

278
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,479
Watery?

279
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:41,403
She stuck a needle into my hand!

280
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,628
Hey, how's my big cry baby?

281
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:47,694
I didn't cry.

282
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,421
I'm just teasing you.

283
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,948
But, yeah, you did.

284
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,161
It's all good. What do you say
we get you home and put you to bed?

285
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,369
Are you still going
to spend the night?

286
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,957
No, I think that you probably
need to rest.

287
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:04,564
She's right. As long as you're vomiting,
coitus is contra-indicated.

288
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,086
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

289
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,746
You're welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.

290
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,470
Okay, I'm going to go
get your discharge papers.

291
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,602
What?

292
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,282
You seem like
a perfectly pleasant person.

293
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,759
I can't understand why women
have such a hard time loving you.

294
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,099
Can you open this for me?

295
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,785
- Can I see your stitches?
- Sure.

296
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,395
Answering the question
once and for all

297
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,710
why Wolowitz bailed out
of medical school.

298
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,511
- Leonard, congratulations.
- What for?

299
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:54,363
Your Facebook status update.

300
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,472
Leonard Hofstadter is
"in a relationship."

301
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,804
What? No, that's not right.

302
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:03,593
Oh, man, did you switch
your status before she did?

303
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,979
Speaking as an expert,
way to look needy.

304
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,085
Seriously? You went first,
after only two weeks?

305
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,790
That's bold...

306
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:16,149
It's not bold, it's a mistake.

307
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:18,098
I didn't change my status.

308
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,673
Well, then who did?

309
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:27,213
I had no choice.
He cried in front of her.

310
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,339
You hacked my Facebook account?

311
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:32,992
It's hardly hacking

312
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:36,018
when you use the same password
for everything, "Kal-El."

313
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:40,765
Are you insane?
Now she's going to think I'm desperate.

314
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:44,875
You've destroyed this relationship!
And you know what the worst part is?

315
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:47,229
You don't even understand
what you did wrong

316
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:50,817
because you can't conceive of something
that you are not an expert in!

317
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:54,114
- In which I am not an expert.
- Don't even!

318
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,576
I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

319
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,783
What's wrong, Lassie?
Timmy fall down the well?

320
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,173
She just updated
her Facebook status.

321
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,856
"Stephanie Barnett is
in a relationship

322
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,677
"with Leonard Hofstadter."

323
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:20,056
Really?

324
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:24,060
Look at that.

325
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,676
I have a girlfriend.

326
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,644
If I am permitted to speak again,

327
00:20:28,764 --> 00:20:31,207
Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
