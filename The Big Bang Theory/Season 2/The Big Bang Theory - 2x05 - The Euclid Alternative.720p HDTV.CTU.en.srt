1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,182
Good morning.

2
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:16,039
We're gonna have to stop
by Pottery Barn on the way to work.

3
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:18,398
I bought these <i>Star Wars</i> sheets, but,

4
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,486
they turned out to be
much too stimulating

5
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:23,109
to be compatible
with a good night's sleep.

6
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:27,532
I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

7
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:30,214
I'm not going to work.

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,991
Just because your career's
been stagnant for a few years,

9
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:34,876
that's no reason to give up.

10
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:38,742
I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser

11
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,918
for my X-ray
diffraction experiment.

12
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,921
Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?

13
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:45,050
No.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,991
Then you can drive. Let's go.

15
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:51,596
Ddn't I tell you
I'd be working nights and that

16
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:53,376
you'd have to make
other arrangements?

17
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,807
- You did.
- And?

18
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:56,202
I didn't.

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,810
Let's go.

20
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:01,388
Good night.

21
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,985
- But how am I going to get to work?
- Take the bus.

22
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:06,628
I can't take the bus anymore.
They don't have seat belts,

23
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:10,075
and they won't let you latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords.

24
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:13,610
You tried to latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,339
I didn't try. I succeeded.

26
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:19,040
But for some reason,
it alarmed the other passengers

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,731
and I was asked to de-bus.

28
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:23,685
You're a big boy.
You'll figure it out.

29
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,026
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

30
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:28,942
Now, take me to return
my Star Wars sheets!

31
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:37,602
What is it?

32
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:39,230
Leonard's asleep.

33
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:43,126
Thanks for the update.

34
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:44,526
No. Wait.

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,026
You have to drive me to work.

36
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,635
Yeah, I really don't think I do.

37
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,159
But I don't drive,
and I can't take the bus.

38
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,079
You'll be fine as long as you don't do
that bungee cord thing, okay?

39
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,624
Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?

40
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,699
Yes, Sheldon. We are friends.

41
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,537
Then I hereby invoke
what I'm given to understand

42
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,822
is an integral part
of the implied covenant of friendship.

43
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,070
The favor.

44
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,207
Oh, dear God.

45
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,806
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,146
When you're done, we'll go.

47
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,063
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

48
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,855
Thank you for driving me to work.

49
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,681
You know this is my day off?

50
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:00,267
Oh, good.
I'm not keeping you from anything.

51
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,894
Your "check engine" light is on.

52
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:11,011
Typically that's an indicator
to, you know, check your engine.

53
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,135
It's fine.
It's been on for, like, a month.

54
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,411
Actually, that would be
all the more reason to...

55
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,351
you know, check your engine.

56
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,854
Sheldon, it's fine.

57
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,869
If it were fine,
the light wouldn't be on.

58
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,683
That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

59
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,588
Maybe the light's broken.

60
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:33,896
Is there a "check the 'check
engine light' light"?

61
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:37,986
What?

62
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:40,236
Studies have shown
that performing tasks

63
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:43,622
such as eating, talking on a cell phone
or drinking coffee while driving

64
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:45,225
reduces one's reaction time

65
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:47,314
by the same factor
as an ounce of alcohol.

66
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,191
Do you have any alcohol?

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,287
- Of course not.
- Too bad.

68
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,603
You're going up Euclid Avenue?

69
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,689
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

70
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:01,567
Good for Leonard.

71
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:04,108
Euclid Avenue is shorter
as the crow flies,

72
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,686
but it has speed bumps,
which appreciably increase

73
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:09,419
point-to-point drive time,
making it the less efficient choice.

74
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:12,923
But you have the conn.

75
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:19,292
If you're not going
to slow down for the speed bumps,

76
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,473
I withdraw my previous objection.

77
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,726
Here's a fun question.

78
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,670
Do you know what the most
common street name is?

79
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,693
- No.
- The answer's tricky.

80
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,578
It's Second Street.

81
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:35,316
You'd think it would be First Street,
but in most towns,

82
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:37,578
First Street eventually
gets renamed to something else.

83
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:39,412
You know,
like Main Street,

84
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:40,963
Broad Street.

85
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,653
Michigan Avenue.

86
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:45,470
Leonard and I
often use our commute time

87
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,958
to exercise our minds
with brain-teasers like that.

88
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,910
We also play games.

89
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,557
- Would you like to play one?
- No.

90
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,074
Come on. It's fun.

91
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,075
Another bump.

92
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,921
Okay. I'll say an element,
and you say an element

93
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,385
whose name starts with the last letter
of the one I said, okay?

94
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:09,646
I'll start.

95
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,190
Helium.

96
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,279
Now, you could say "mercury."

97
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,947
That would give me a "y."
Very clever. That's a tough one.

98
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,608
So I go with "ytterbium,"
which gets you back to "m."

99
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:30,673
So you go "molybdenum,"
and I say "magnesium."

100
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:33,792
You say "manganese."
I say "europium,"

101
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,974
and, then, you're left
with "mendelevium,"

102
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:37,714
and... there are no more m's

103
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,491
because I believe that meitnerium
should still be called ekairidium.

104
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:42,387
So, congratulations. You win.

105
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,251
Do you wanna go again?

106
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,522
Why don't we just have
a little quiet time now?

107
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:54,149
All right.

108
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:02,220
I'm sorry.
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance

109
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,679
regarding the check-engine light
to be very troubling.

110
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,232
Get out.

111
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:15,174
I have to tell you that while I do have
a theoretical understanding

112
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:17,240
of the workings
of an internal combustion engine,

113
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,883
I'm not sure I'm capable
of performing diagnostics.

114
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,885
I said, "Get out."

115
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,803
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

116
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:41,778
There you are.
I'm ready to go home.

117
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:46,337
- I just got here.
- Good. Perfect timing.

118
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,230
I told you, I only have access
to the free-electron laser at night.

119
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,124
I can't drive you
for the next few weeks.

120
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:55,232
No, you said you couldn't
drive me to work.

121
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:56,645
This is from work.

122
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,736
Howard, help me out here.

123
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,783
No, just for the fun of it,
I'm gonna take his side.

124
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,304
Now,
how do you propose I get home?

125
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,682
How did you get here
in the first place?

126
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:09,862
Penny.

127
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,362
But I sense
that's no longer an option.

128
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:15,686
I need to get to the laser lab.

129
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:19,052
You're just gonna have
to find someone else to take you home.

130
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,511
Damn, I picked the wrong side.

131
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,766
God, not Euclid Avenue!

132
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:46,344
Why did Howard leave you
in the middle of the road anyway?

133
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:50,606
- We had a difference of opinion.
- Over what?

134
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,600
Whether or not
he was trying to kill me.

135
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,883
For the record,
I maintain he was.

136
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,983
Where are you going?
I'm taking you home.

137
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:02,536
But I'm not going home.
It's Wednesday.

138
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:06,286
Wednesday's new comic book day.
We have to go to the comic book store.

139
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:08,333
Then, we have to stop
at Souplantation;

140
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,097
it's creamy tomato soup day.

141
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:13,503
And Radio Shack.
There's a sale on triple-A batteries.

142
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,833
Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn
and return my Star Wars sheets.

143
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,960
I have a better idea.

144
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:22,335
You want to go
to Pottery Barn first?

145
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,974
Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?

146
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:45,231
Maybe if I turn off the night-light,
I can keep the sheets.

147
00:08:57,694 --> 00:08:58,828
Good morning.

148
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:01,781
Good morning.

149
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,094
Sheldon, sit down.

150
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,247
She's in my spot.

151
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,930
Don't look at me like that.
Everybody knows that's my spot.

152
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,019
You know that we care about you.

153
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:25,068
And it's because we care about you
that we've decided we have to speak up.

154
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,117
You're hurting the people
around you, sweetie.

155
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:35,522
So we made you an appointment,
and we want you to keep it.

156
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:40,621
Department of Motor Vehicles
New Driver Handbook?

157
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,540
But I don't have a problem.

158
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,510
Sheldon, you need
to learn how to drive.

159
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,629
This madness has to stop.

160
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,891
Penny's taking you to the DMV.
I'm going to bed.

161
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,943
- Why Penny?
- Because rock breaks scissors.

162
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,119
Good night.

163
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:04,731
- All right, come on, Sheldon.
- Hold on.

164
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:07,152
- I have one condition.
- What?

165
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:09,154
We have to stop at Pottery Barn.

166
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,632
And Radio Shack.

167
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:14,784
Fine.

168
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:18,211
- And the comic book store.
- All right!

169
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:20,874
I want to go
to the comic book store.

170
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:41,994
I like comic books.

171
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:49,470
I still don't see
why I need a driver's license.

172
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,423
Albert Einstein never had
a driver's license.

173
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,807
Yeah, but Albert Einstein
didn't make me wet myself

174
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:57,343
at 40 miles an hour.

175
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:01,413
Yeah, and I never wanted to kick
Albert Einstein in the nuts.

176
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:09,181
I gotta ask, why didn't you just get
a license at 16 like everybody else?

177
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,249
I was otherwise engaged.

178
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
Doing what?

179
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:18,056
Examing perturbative amplitudes
in N=4 supersymmetric theories

180
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,713
leading to a re-examination
of the ultraviolet properties

181
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,318
of multi-loop N=8 supergravity
using modern twistor theory.

182
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,208
Well, how about
when you were 17?

183
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:34,484
Take this to the testing area,
put your name at the top,

184
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:37,167
sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next.

185
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:44,456
Application?

186
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,575
I'm actually more of a theorist.

187
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:51,854
The application in your hand.

188
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,207
Give it to her.

189
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:59,799
Take this to the testing area,
put your name at the top,

190
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,516
sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next!

191
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,870
Excuse me, but I have some
concerns about these questions.

192
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:08,956
Look at that sign up there.

193
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,238
Does it say "I give a damn"?

194
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,436
That's because I don't.

195
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:20,867
Just look.
This first question makes no sense.

196
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:24,831
"How many car lengths should you leave
in front of you when driving?"

197
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:27,253
There's no possible way
to answer that.

198
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:30,336
A "car length" is not
a standardized unit of measure.

199
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,982
Look at the sign.

200
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:37,134
- It's "C." Just put down "C."
- I don't need your help, Penny.

201
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:40,053
Listen to that little girl, honey.
Put "C." Next!

202
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:41,349
Wait! Hang on.

203
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,933
- Look at this next question.
- Why are you arguing with the DMV?

204
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,506
How else are they going to learn?

205
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:52,387
Look... question two:

206
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:54,852
"When are roadways most slippery?"

207
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:57,404
Now, there are 3 answers,
none of which are correct.

208
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,153
The correct answer is
"when covered by a film of liquid

209
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:02,425
"sufficient to reduce
the coefficient of static friction

210
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:04,690
"between the tire and the road
to essentially zero,

211
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,696
"but not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

212
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:14,612
Here's your learner's permit.
Go away.

213
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,022
But I'm not done.

214
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:19,509
I have many additional concerns
about these questions.

215
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:21,928
- Don't make me climb over this counter.
- Come on.

216
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,695
Next!

217
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,567
Aced it.

218
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,566
That's... it.
Let's boot it up.

219
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:35,770
Booting.

220
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:38,545
This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

221
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:41,364
I adapted it from something
a friend of mine designed for the army.

222
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,681
Is that why I appear to be
in downtown Fallujah

223
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,880
behind the wheel
of an up-armored Humvee?

224
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,629
I haven't configured it yet.

225
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,531
Let's see...

226
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,003
Bradley tank...

227
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,211
transport truck...
Batmobile...

228
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,409
Here we go.
Red 2006 Ford Taurus

229
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:01,384
on the streets of Pasadena.

230
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:04,265
What?

231
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:06,473
Statistically, red cars
are stopped by police

232
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:08,405
far more often
than any other color.

233
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,817
I don't want any hassles
with the fuzz.

234
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:14,022
Fine, what color do you want?

235
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,290
You know the pale blue
of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?

236
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,760
Before it was digitally remastered?

237
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,575
Black, it is.

238
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:30,122
Okay, now, what you want to do first
is turn on the ignition

239
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,577
and shift into drive.

240
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,708
I haven't fastened
my seat belt yet.

241
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:37,838
Okay, fasten your seat belt.

242
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,831
- Now, are there air bags?
- You don't need air bags.

243
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,894
What if a simulated van
rear-ends me?

244
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,147
I'll hit you in the face
with a pillow.

245
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,047
Okay, now shift into drive.

246
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,702
Pull out slowly into traffic.

247
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,126
Watch out, watch, watch out
for the pedestrians!

248
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,961
Wait-- slow--
Hit the brakes! The brakes!

249
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:31,331
Thank you.

250
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:36,972
Sorry. Excuse me.

251
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,371
My bad.

252
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:44,727
Student driver.

253
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:48,557
How did you manage to get
on the 2d floor

254
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:50,207
of the Glendale Galleria?

255
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,631
I don't know.

256
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:55,294
I was on the Pasadena freeway.
I missed my exit,

257
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,333
flew off the overpass,
and one thing led to another.

258
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,256
Maybe you want to give it a rest
and try again tomorrow.

259
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:05,175
I quit.

260
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:15,670
The pet store...

261
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,681
Remind me to compliment Wolowitz
on the software.

262
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,388
It's amazingly detailed.

263
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:25,362
So wait, you're just
gonna give up?

264
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,086
No, I'm not giving up.

265
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:28,423
I never give up.

266
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:31,621
So, what is it you're doing?

267
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,267
I'm...

268
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,543
transcending the situation.

269
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:40,944
I'm clearly

270
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:43,217
too evolved for driving.

271
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,051
What does that mean?

272
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:52,903
Have you ever wondered
why my little toes and lateral incisors

273
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,651
are significantly smaller
than the average for someone of my size?

274
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,736
I wonder a lot of things about you.
But not-not that.

275
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,790
Well, those are indicators

276
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,976
that I'm farther along
the evolutionary scale

277
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:08,856
- than the average human.
- No kidding.

278
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:09,823
Hold on.

279
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,491
I'm not gonna go so far as to say

280
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:14,177
that I represent a distinct
new stage in humankind--

281
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:16,748
you know, a homo novus,
if you will.

282
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:20,208
That's for anthropologists to decide.

283
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:23,169
But I am convinced

284
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:26,322
that the reason I cannot master
the plebeian task of driving

285
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,258
is because I'm not meant to.

286
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:30,552
Yes, you are.
You're meant to learn how to drive.

287
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,095
Please learn how to drive!

288
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:35,123
I'm meant for greater things,

289
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:37,267
like unraveling the mysteries
of the universe,

290
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,877
not determing when it's safe

291
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:41,638
to pass a stopped school bus
on a country road.

292
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,735
- It's never safe.
- Yeah, well, I know that now.

293
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,804
Fine.

294
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,937
Assuming that everything
you say is true,

295
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:55,785
how does the biologically superior
homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?

296
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,914
Homo novus doesn't know.

297
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,201
Well, hang in there.

298
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:05,211
Maybe you'll evolve
into something with wings.

299
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,467
Good morning, gentlemen.

300
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:19,854
Good morning.

301
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:24,731
Is there some new kind of casual Friday
I don't know about?

302
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,941
No, he lives here now.

303
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,170
Really? Why?

304
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:32,118
Since he won't take the bus
and he's too evolved to drive,

305
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,272
he decided it would be easier
to sleep in his office

306
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,797
and shower in the radiation lab

307
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,702
until I'm finished
with my experiment.

308
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:41,273
But you finished your experiment
a week ago.

309
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:17,850
You saw nothing!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
