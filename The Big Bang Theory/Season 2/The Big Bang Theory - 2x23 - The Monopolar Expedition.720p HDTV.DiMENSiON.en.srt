1
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:04,208
Oh, boy.

2
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:07,340
What?

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,005
I can't comment
without violating our agreement

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,180
that I not criticize your work.

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,347
Then what was "Oh, boy"?

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,610
Great restraint on my part.

7
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,227
There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

8
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:24,550
Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say, "Science."

9
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:33,074
How's that?

10
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:35,825
You actually had it right
in the first place.

11
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:40,919
Once again, you've fallen
for one of my classic pranks.

12
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,775
Bazinga!

13
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,558
Now here's a peculiar e-mail.

14
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,808
The president of the university
wants me to meet him

15
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,827
at his office
tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

16
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:56,593
- Why?
- It doesn't say.

17
00:00:56,718 --> 00:00:58,226
It must be an emergency.

18
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,785
Everyone at the university
knows I eat breakfast at 8:00

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,760
and move my bowels at 8:20.

20
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,608
Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

21
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,579
I guess you'll find out
what it is in the morning.

22
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,572
That's 14 hours away.

23
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,521
For the next 840 minutes,

24
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,617
I'm effectively one
of Heisenberg's particles;

25
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:19,918
I know where I am
or I know how fast I'm going,

26
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:21,263
but I can't know both.

27
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:22,997
Yet how am I supposed to carry on

28
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:26,043
with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

29
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:27,919
I know the feeling.

30
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:50,896
Subtitles: The FW Team

31
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,162
Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

32
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,769
Why does everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

33
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:08,088
- Everybody?
- You, the president of the university,

34
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,641
his wife,
their sullen teenage daughter.

35
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,879
That entire family is fascinated
by what time it is

36
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,749
and whether people know it.

37
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,389
You went to President Seibert's house
in the middle of the night?

38
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,813
He didn't respond to my e-mail,
his phone number is unlisted.

39
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:25,019
Tell me what my other option was.

40
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,813
You could have waited until morning.

41
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,107
I know, look who I'm talking to.

42
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,966
Do you remember
the grant proposal I submitted

43
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,749
to the National Science Foundation

44
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:38,676
to detect slow-moving monopoles
at the magnetic North Pole?

45
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,511
Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

46
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:43,893
How nice.

47
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,052
Well, a space opened up

48
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:49,827
at the last minute on the NSF
expedition to the Arctic Circle.

49
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,315
Wait a minute.

50
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,510
He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

51
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,637
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

52
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,600
He said, "Frankly,
if I could send you tonight, I would."

53
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:07,551
Okay, well, do you want to go?

54
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:10,398
Of course not.
I'm a theoretical physicist.

55
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,838
A career I chose in no small part
because it's indoors,

56
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,687
but if I'm able to detect
slow-moving magnetic monopoles there,

57
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:21,408
I will be the scientis
to confirm string theory.

58
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,493
People will write books about me.

59
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,241
Third-graders will create
macaroni-art dioramas

60
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,392
depicting scenes from my life.

61
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:33,317
Sure, maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

62
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:35,756
Sarcasm?

63
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,568
Maybe.

64
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,188
I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

65
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:44,688
Can you imagine me, Sheldon
Cooper, at the North Pole?

66
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,226
Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.

67
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,421
I'm not good with cold.

68
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:53,067
How often have we had
to leave a movie theater

69
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,443
because I got a headache
from drinking the Icee too fast?

70
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,738
- I can't go.
- Then don't go.

71
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,717
How can you say that?

72
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,326
The scientific opportunity
of a lifetime

73
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,662
presents itself
and my best friend says "Don't go."

74
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,033
- All right, then go.
- Listen to you.

75
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,961
How can I possibly go?

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,386
What are the words
I can say right now

77
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:17,757
to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

78
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:22,222
Odd, President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

79
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,893
- How was it resolved?
- It wasn't.

80
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:30,478
His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

81
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:34,763
Just imagine.
If he says yes,

82
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:37,713
we'll have an entire summer
without Sheldon.

83
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,436
We could play outside.

84
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:45,410
We could sit
on the left side of the couch.

85
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,165
I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

86
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:54,919
Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

87
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,466
Good news, gentlemen,
I have tentatively accepted...

88
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,517
... the invitation to join
the Arctic Expedition.

89
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,353
It's not gonna be the same
without you.

90
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,512
Thank you,
but your sentiments may be premature.

91
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,360
I don't like where this is going.

92
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:21,487
I would like to propose...

93
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:24,568
that the three of you accompany me.

94
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:26,922
To the North Pole?

95
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,914
Is this just so we won't touch
your stuff while you're away?

96
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,784
I'll admit that was a concern.

97
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:38,343
But the fact is,
I'll need a support team.

98
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,715
And the three of you
are my first choice.

99
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,049
Really?

100
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,130
There are others
who might be more qualified,

101
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:47,049
but the thought of interviewing
them gave me a stomachache.

102
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,016
I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking.

103
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,101
So, why don't you take
a few moments to discuss it?

104
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:58,071
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

105
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm still within earshot!

106
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:04,154
You may want to wait
for my door to close.

107
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:08,658
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

108
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,328
Hang on. Let's talk about it.

109
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:13,121
This is a National Science
Foundation expedition.

110
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:14,874
I don't know how
we can turn it down.

111
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:19,045
Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we
don't want to go on an NSF expedition,"

112
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,755
say, "No, we don't want to spend

113
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,784
"three months stuck in a cabin in
the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag."

114
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,407
But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory,

115
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:32,917
we could drink for free
in any bar in any college town

116
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:36,192
with a university
that has a strong science program.

117
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,001
Howard, this is big science.

118
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,224
You could be the engineer
who builds the equipment

119
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,277
that puts us on the cover
of magazines.

120
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,443
I could also be the engineer

121
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:48,268
who builds the crossbow
that kills Sheldon.

122
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:54,336
You still might get on a magazine.

123
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,668
So you guys are seriously
considering this?

124
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,227
- You think you can put up with Sheldon?
- Well, I'm a Hindu.

125
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,762
My religion teaches
that if we suffer in this life

126
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:08,594
we are rewarded in the next.

127
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,805
Three months
at the North Pole with Sheldon,

128
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:14,273
and I'm reborn as a well-hung
billionaire with wings!

129
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,861
Well, gentlemen,
have you reached a decision?

130
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,823
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

131
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,034
Damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

132
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,728
Excellent.
Just an FYI,

133
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:37,668
as I am
the expedition's team leader,

134
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:40,522
protocol dictates
that be phrased, "Fine, sir."

135
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,723
But don't worry,
there will be a briefing.

136
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:15,590
What do you want?

137
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:18,623
I need access to the Cheesecake
Factory's walk-in freezer.

138
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,465
Honey, I already told you,

139
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,782
the hamburger meat is fresh
and stored at a safe temperature.

140
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:26,818
This is to train

141
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,717
for a three-month expedition
to the magnetic North Pole.

142
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:31,304
What?

143
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:35,056
I don't know how that sentence
could possibly confuse you...

144
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,449
but to elaborate,
I'm going to the Arctic Circle

145
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,478
with Leonard, Wolowitz
and Koothrappali.

146
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,439
- You're all going?
- Yes.

147
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,024
- For three months?
- Yes.

148
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Excuse me.

149
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,726
Is that a yes or a no
on the freezer?

150
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:55,041
That woman has
the attention span of a gnat.

151
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,080
Sheldon says you're going
to the North Pole.

152
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,539
Pretty cool, huh?

153
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,583
Yeah. I'm just a little surprised
you didn't tell me.

154
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,768
It all happened kind of fast.

155
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,505
And we had to get physicals
and buy thermal underwear

156
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,128
and study up on, you know,
snow and stuff.

157
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,553
Sorry, I was gonna tell you.

158
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,949
You don't have to apologize.
There's no reason you have to tell me.

159
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,006
I was just...
you know, surprised.

160
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,818
You were busy, you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

161
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,356
Now where do we stand
on the freezer?

162
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,638
- Is he serious?
- Actually, it would help.

163
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,516
All right, I'll see what I can do.

164
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,755
So, three months at the North Pole.

165
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,284
That is... awesome.

166
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:40,742
I'm sorry, but at what point
do you put this

167
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,308
"see what you can do" plan
into action?

168
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,671
Just a warning, Sheldon...

169
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,251
The freezer locks from the outside.

170
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,132
Did she seem upset to you?

171
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,306
Did she seem upset to you?

172
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,183
Good, I got it right.

173
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,139
Are you upset?

174
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:09,040
- A little bit.
- Two for two. I'm on fire.

175
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:14,128
I know she's not
my girlfriend or anything,

176
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:16,101
but wouldn't you think
she'd feel a little bad

177
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:18,289
that I'm going to be gone
for the whole summer?

178
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:20,661
That feels like a bonus question.

179
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:25,924
I'm going to stop here while I'm ahead,
but I've had a great time.

180
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,274
All right,

181
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,662
the purpose of this drill
is to acclimate us

182
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,806
to the use of tools
in extreme temperatures

183
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:45,853
such as we will face
in the Arctic Circle.

184
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,438
Where are your tools?

185
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,010
Right here.

186
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,389
All right, team,
open up your practice kits.

187
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:56,989
As the university did not permit me
to bring the actual equipment

188
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,886
we'll be using
to the Cheesecake Factory,

189
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:01,272
because apparently,
I'm "ridiculous,"

190
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:05,456
I've provided substitutes which
will exercise your fine motor skills.

191
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,791
Leonard, you will be doing a series

192
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,987
of complex mathematical problems

193
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:13,630
on a vintage Casio model
1175 calculator watch I received

194
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,683
when I won the Earth Science medal
in 3rd grade.

195
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,662
Treat it with respect.

196
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:24,975
Raj, you will be painting
sideburns and a Van Dyke

197
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:27,777
on a six-inch figurine
of Legolas the elf.

198
00:11:28,444 --> 00:11:32,149
Now, remember, a Van Dyke
is a goatee without a mustache.

199
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,631
Wolowitz, you will be completing

200
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:37,878
a series of delicate
surgical procedures

201
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:40,769
on the classic children's game
"Operation."

202
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:46,988
To begin with, you will

203
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:49,679
"remove funny bone
for two hundred dollars."

204
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,478
For this I went to MIT.

205
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:55,923
And begin.

206
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:03,516
I think I swallowed some paint!

207
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,168
I can't press
any of the buttons with my gloves.

208
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,123
Son of a bitch!

209
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,857
Adversity is to be expected.
Continue.

210
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,793
Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.

211
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,531
- Okay, I can't do this.
- Me either.

212
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,338
Gentlemen, use your imagination.
Innovate.

213
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:27,913
Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze
to death on the ice planet of Hoth?

214
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,105
He cut open a tauntaun

215
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,418
and used its internal body heat
to warm him up.

216
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,547
You heard the man.
Hold him down and I'll cut him open.

217
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:40,092
Hang on, I know I don't possess
the tools of leadership,

218
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,138
but why can't we assemble the equipment
inside the hut and then take it outside?

219
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,392
I hadn't thought of that.

220
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,586
I guess we're done here.

221
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:57,901
Here,

222
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,903
drink slash eat this.

223
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:03,657
- What is it?
- Hot chocolate with a stick of butter.

224
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:07,160
Okay, why?

225
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,186
In the frigid temperatures
in the Arctic,

226
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,480
we need to consume at least
5,000 calories a day

227
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:13,125
just to maintain our body weight.

228
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,961
You know I can't eat butter.
I'm lactose intolerant.

229
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,797
Way ahead of you, that's an
"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" stick.

230
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:23,093
But Mummy, all the other guys
are going to the North Pole.

231
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,429
<i>I don't care
what the other guys are doing.</i>

232
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,747
<i>If the other guys jumped
in the Bay of Bengal</i>

233
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:30,309
<i>and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,
would you follow them?</i>

234
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,338
If you were standing
behind me nagging, I might.

235
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:37,483
<i>Don't talk back to your mother.
This trip is much too dangerous.</i>

236
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:40,083
No, it's not. Howard, tell them.

237
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:44,781
Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali,
<i>namaste.</i>

238
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,609
I understand your concern,
but if it'll make you feel any better,

239
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:50,543
my mother is fine with me going,

240
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:54,525
and it's a woman who kept a safety rail
on my bed until I was 17.

241
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,931
<i>So, she has no problem
with her son being eaten by a walrus?</i>

242
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,463
That's very unlikely,
Mrs. Koothrappali.

243
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:02,716
If Raj dies,

244
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,614
it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn

245
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:08,844
or being ripped to shreds
by a 1,500 pound polar bear.

246
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,964
Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone
with Raj's parents.

247
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,418
Can you tell them that you're okay
with me going to the Arctic?

248
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:20,100
<i>Arctic?!
I thought you said Arkansas!</i>

249
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:25,007
I didn't say that.
You never listen to me!

250
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,818
<i>He doesn't tell me anything!</i>

251
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:29,755
<i>He lives a secret life
because he's ashamed!</i>

252
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,622
Can I talk to you for a sec?

253
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,161
Sure, but let's go out here

254
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,911
where there's a little
less yelling and guilt.

255
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,295
What's up?

256
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,797
Well, I got you
a little going away present.

257
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:46,176
- A blanket.
- No, not just a blanket.

258
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:48,322
See, it has sleeves.

259
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,606
So, you can be all snoodled up
while you do your science stuff.

260
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:02,535
Cool.

261
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,624
I'm gonna miss you.

262
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,497
- See you later.
- Bye.

263
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,380
<i>I told you no!
Why don't you believe me?</i>

264
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:26,221
<i>'Cause it doesn't make sense to me!</i>

265
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,405
<i>How can it be
that in the entire country of India,</i>

266
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,958
<i>there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?!</i>

267
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,397
I want a cookie, Meemaw.

268
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:48,363
It's me.

269
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,762
But Meemaw just made cookies.

270
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,953
I don't know if I can go
on the expedition.

271
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:56,935
What?

272
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,249
I don't think I can go
to the North Pole.

273
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:03,937
I know you're concerned
about disappointing me

274
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,646
but I want you to take comfort
from the knowledge

275
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,608
that my expectations
of you are very low.

276
00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:13,150
Yeah, that's very comforting.

277
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,436
Comforting is a part of leadership.

278
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:18,435
It's not a part I care for,
but such is my burden.

279
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:22,272
Terrific, it's just that...
I don't think Penny wants me to go.

280
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:26,568
Assuming that's a valid reason
not to go, which it isn't...

281
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:29,779
How do you know this?
Did she say it?

282
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:31,680
Not exactly.

283
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:34,993
But she said she was gonna miss me
and she gave me this.

284
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:40,749
- What is it?
- It's a blanket with sleeves.

285
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:42,881
That's clever.

286
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,589
Let me see
if I understand correctly.

287
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,306
Her missing you

288
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,926
is an emotional state
you find desirable?

289
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,262
Yes, obviously.

290
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:58,179
Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving,

291
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:01,054
logic dictates you must leave.

292
00:17:02,993 --> 00:17:05,929
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone
for three months.

293
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:09,194
What if she doesn't miss me that long
and she meets someone else?

294
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:12,682
She does have
a short attention span.

295
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:14,533
So, I can't go.

296
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:16,430
Leonard, you may be right.

297
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,030
It appears that Penny
secretly wants you in her life

298
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,790
in a very intimate
and carnal fashion.

299
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:25,359
- You really think so?
- Of course not.

300
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,772
Even in my sleep-deprived state,

301
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:33,040
I've managed to pull off
another one of my classic pranks.

302
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,289
Bazinga!

303
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,936
- What time is it?
- It's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early,

304
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:49,275
but we're leaving soon,
and I needed to talk to you.

305
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,489
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

306
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,653
I don't know.

307
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:00,226
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

308
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,626
What about this?
What does this mean?

309
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:09,649
Wine, credit card
and late night television

310
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:11,374
are a bad combination.

311
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:14,857
All right, fine.

312
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:18,054
What about that really long hug?
What did that mean?

313
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,599
That wasn't a long hug.

314
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:24,033
It was at least five Mississippis.

315
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:29,346
A standard hug is
two Mississippis tops.

316
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,654
Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.
It was just a hug.

317
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,907
- Glad we cleared that up.
- Yeah.

318
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:39,226
I guess I'll see you.

319
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,494
- Okay, have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

320
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,581
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

321
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:52,325
It means I wish you weren't going.

322
00:19:02,617 --> 00:19:04,309
- Damn it.
- What?

323
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:06,122
We're out of ice.

324
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,442
All right, we begin initial assembly
and deployment of the testing equipment

325
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,906
starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,

326
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:16,488
but until then,
you are all off duty.

327
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:19,662
I suggest you keep
the shenanigans to a minimum

328
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:22,953
as medical help is
18 hours away by dogsled.

329
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,155
- What are you working on?
- Crossbow.

330
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,295
Hey, guys, can I just say something?

331
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,298
How about we take a moment
to think about where we are right now?

332
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,436
This is literally
the top of the world.

333
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,953
Only a handful of people
in all of human history

334
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,179
will ever see
what we are going to see.

335
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:44,429
He's right.

336
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,161
It is remarkable.

337
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,322
So, who's up for a movie?

338
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,111
Good idea, what do you think?

339
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:55,937
<i>Ice Station Zebra</i>
or John Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i>?

340
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,040
- I say double feature.
- Dinner's ready!

341
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,800
- What are we having?
- Reconstituted Thai food.

342
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,455
Did you bring the dehydrated
low-sodium soy sauce?

343
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,069
- Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
- Check.

344
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:10,751
Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?

345
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:14,671
Sorry.

346
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,958
Not to worry.

347
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,137
I hid it.

348
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:20,880
Bazinga!

349
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,397
You're in my spot.

350
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,542
There's no time for a crossbow.
Find me an icicle.

351
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,823
Three months.
This is gonna be great.
