1
00:00:01,172 --> 00:00:02,319
That was close.

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:07,756
God, I love the smell
of paintballs in the morning.

3
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:10,260
Yeah, still funny.

4
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:14,639
We can't get to the ridge.

5
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:16,975
The Chemistry Department
has us completely cut off.

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,351
And the creek bed?

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,424
The Pharmacology Department
controls that,

8
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:23,227
and they're all hopped up
on experimental steroids.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,399
That's it then.
We're doomed.

10
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:27,897
The time has come to acknowledge
that we are paying the price

11
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:29,840
for some of us failing to attend

12
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,056
my Physics Department
paintball strategy meeting.

13
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:34,511
I told you my mom has spider veins.

14
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,394
I had to take her
to the laser clinic.

15
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:41,743
And I told you I wanted
to see a doctor's note.

16
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:44,284
We need a plan.

17
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,198
How about
Operation Hammer of the Gods?

18
00:00:46,323 --> 00:00:47,798
Which one is Hammer of the Gods?

19
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,976
We hide behind the dumpsters
in the parking lot

20
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,323
and ambush people
when they come to pee.

21
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,972
No go. The dumpsters are deep
in Astronomy Department territory.

22
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:58,470
That shouldn't be a problem.
Venus is up during the day.

23
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:00,810
They're probably just all
staring at the sky.

24
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,174
What we need now
is a tactical retreat.

25
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,270
Did you see
the episode of <i>Stargate</i>

26
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:07,500
where they found themselves
on a planet

27
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,399
with a culture based loosely
on Earth's Athens and Sparta?

28
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,254
Not important.

29
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,657
Leonard, Raj and I are going
to burst out the door and run away.

30
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:17,155
Howard will cover us.

31
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,101
Why don't I run away
and you cover me?

32
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:21,623
Because you chose
your mother's veins over victory.

33
00:01:22,878 --> 00:01:24,622
On three.
One, two, three, go!

34
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:31,491
I had to take her!
It's almost bathing suit weather!

35
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:40,433
I surrender! Don't shoot!
They went that way!

36
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:43,053
Howard, I'm on your team.

37
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:45,017
Leslie, thank God.

38
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,816
Where's the rest of your squad?

39
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:51,538
They left me here to die.

40
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,106
What about yours?

41
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:55,614
- Dead, all of them.
- Sorry.

42
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:57,167
Don't be.

43
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:59,087
It was friendly fire.

44
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,744
They just wouldn't listen.

45
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:06,304
Well, we're surrounded,

46
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,537
so I guess there's nothing
for us to do

47
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,153
but wait to be captured or killed.

48
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,643
That's the worst part, the waiting.

49
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:19,286
All the while knowing
that there's a paint pellet out there

50
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:21,006
with your name on it.

51
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:25,730
The big wet ball of death.

52
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:33,138
Kind of makes you feel
more alive, doesn't it?

53
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:35,507
It kind of does.

54
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,860
I say we make every moment count.

55
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:41,474
I agree.

56
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,831
How exactly do we do that?

57
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,502
Why aren't you covering us?!
We're getting slaughtered out here!

58
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,474
War is hell.

59
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:18,478
Subtitles: The FW Team

60
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:22,680
Did you guys see the budget nemo
that went out this morning?

61
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,107
More cutbacks.

62
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:26,454
Unacceptable.
It baffles me

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,516
why they don't simply
let some of you go

64
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,000
so that there's money available
for my research.

65
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,419
You know what baffles me?

66
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,147
Based on your academic record,
any number of things, I imagine.

67
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:40,134
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

68
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,679
I got the approval
for the rapid prototyper you wanted.

69
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,847
That's great, Leslie. Thanks.

70
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,455
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

71
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,827
What was all that about?

72
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,182
No big deal.

73
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:57,147
They gave Leslie control
of some unrestricted grant money.

74
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:01,453
Yeah, okay, but what's
with the back-scratching and the meow?

75
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:05,705
I believe the back-scratching
metaphor generally describes

76
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,395
a quid pro quo situation
where one party provides

77
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,250
goods or services to the second party
in compensation for a similar action.

78
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:14,828
- Thank you.
- The meow,

79
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,095
that sounded to me
like an African civet cat.

80
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,384
Are you done?

81
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:24,610
Despite what the name suggests,

82
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:27,759
the civet cat is not a true cat.

83
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:32,196
Now I'm done.

84
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,624
You know what I'm thinking?

85
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:37,222
I'm thinking Howard wasn't making
a back-scratching metaphor.

86
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:40,410
I'm thinking there was some
actual scratching involved.

87
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:44,950
What about it?

88
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,527
I didn't want to say anything

89
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,908
'cause I know
you and Leslie have a little history.

90
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,348
I don't care about that.

91
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:53,459
Great, I've been
dying to say something.

92
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:57,211
- You and Leslie?
- In the paintball shed! Twice!

93
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,546
Is that why you didn't cover our escape
and let us get cut down like animals?

94
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,219
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

95
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:10,251
My good man, dereliction of duty
in the face of the enemy

96
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,893
is a court-martial offense.

97
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:14,305
Court-martial, schmort-martial,

98
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,477
Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl
I've ever had sex with.

99
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:20,202
I mean, for free.

100
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,801
Plus, you got a rapid prototyper.

101
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,908
That's an expensive
piece of equipment.

102
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:29,176
And the rest of us have had
our budgets cut to the bone.

103
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,726
One way to look at this

104
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,122
is that I'm getting new equipment,
and you're not,

105
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:34,814
and that's unfair.

106
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:38,162
But a better way to look at this
is that I'm getting sex

107
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:40,588
and you're not,
and that's delightful.

108
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:45,838
The whole thing froze.
I don't know what happened.

109
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:48,215
- Calm down. We'll figure it out.
- How can I calm down?

110
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,290
I'm gonna lose
my whole shopping cart.

111
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,810
That's three hours of picking out shoes
just shot to hell.

112
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,978
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello, Sheldon.

113
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:57,665
You're in my spot.

114
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,564
- Are you planning on sitting here?
- No, I'm going to the comic book store.

115
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,364
- Then what difference does it make?
- What difference does it make?

116
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:06,694
Here we go.

117
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,063
That is my spot.

118
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:12,495
In an ever-changing world,
it is a single point of consistency.

119
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,742
If my life

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,556
were expressed as a function

121
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,098
on a four-dimensional Cartesian
coordinate system,

122
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,619
that spot at the moment
I first sat on it

123
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:22,820
would be zero-zero-zero-zero.

124
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:27,948
What?

125
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,088
Don't sit in his spot.

126
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:34,799
Fine.

127
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,595
- Happy?
- I'm not unhappy.

128
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,380
Boy, I love him, but he is one
serious wackadoodle.

129
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:48,150
Okay, that should do it.

130
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,159
Thank you. You are a lifesaver.

131
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:52,285
That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

132
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,501
Yeah, you know the sad thing is,
it's really not.

133
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,247
Is this one of those paintball guns?

134
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,667
You ought to come out
with us sometime.

135
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,333
No, thanks. I'm from Nebraska.

136
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,582
When we shoot things,
it's because we want to eat them

137
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:09,427
or make them leave
our boyfriends alone.

138
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,749
Boy, your heart's racing.
I must've really gotten you going.

139
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:32,588
Well, it's partly you,

140
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:35,437
partly my transient
idiopathic arrhythmia.

141
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,306
Sexy.

142
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:43,953
Can I assume that you've likewise
found the experience...

143
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:45,958
Satisfactory?

144
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,916
That wasn't quite the word
I was looking for,

145
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,191
but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.

146
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,990
Are you enjoying
that prototyper I got you?

147
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,446
It's great.

148
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:00,937
Everybody in the Engineering Department
is eating their hearts out.

149
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:04,957
Isn't it nice when your good fortune
makes others miserable?

150
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:09,315
You know, most people
don't get that.

151
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,381
<i>Howard, I'm home!</i>

152
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,829
- Oh, great.
- <i>Book club was cancelled!</i>

153
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,911
<i>That thing on Phyllis's neck
opened up again!</i>

154
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,463
I'm busy, Ma!

155
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,642
<i>Too busy to help your mother
with her zipper?!</i>

156
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,759
- Don't come in, Ma!
- <i>Why not?</i>

157
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:32,845
He's got company!

158
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,101
There's the arrhythmia.

159
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,940
<i>Is she Jewish?!</i>

160
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:46,989
Are you Jewish?

161
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:48,442
- No.
- Yes!

162
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,656
<i>Okay, then you kids have fun!</i>

163
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,877
<i>Use protection!</i>

164
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,502
You think he'll notice?

165
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,842
There's a chance.

166
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:14,469
What are we gonna do?

167
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:15,889
"We"?

168
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,430
No, you had your chance to be "we"

169
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:21,309
for, like, a year and a half now.

170
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,064
Right now, you are "you,"
and you are screwed.

171
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,820
- Why do we have to tell him I did it?
- We're not gonna tell him I did it.

172
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, okay, how about this?

173
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,221
We tell him somebody broke in.

174
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:43,275
Just to shoot the couch
with a paintball gun?

175
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,668
I'm sorry, I buy it.
All those people are on drugs.

176
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:51,548
We could tell him they wanted the couch
to stay away from their boyfriend.

177
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,317
Okay, fine.
What if we just flip it over?

178
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,595
There. Looks fine, right?

179
00:10:01,115 --> 00:10:02,257
Butt print.

180
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,469
There's no discernible butt print.

181
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,098
Oh, come on.

182
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:12,155
There, butt print.

183
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:14,248
It's too small and too...

184
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:15,502
perfect.

185
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,924
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

186
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:21,411
Act normal.

187
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,626
- How was the comic book store?
- Fine. The new issue of <i>Flash</i> is out.

188
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,306
Great, great.

189
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,964
Did you walk the whole way?
It's a little chilly.

190
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:36,217
- Koothrappali picked me up.
- Isn't that terrific?

191
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,103
He is such a good friend.

192
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,722
You know what the best thing
about friends is?

193
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,046
They don't talk incessantly
for no particular reason.

194
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,995
No, friends forgive
the little things.

195
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,608
- I gotta go home and wash my hair.
- Don't you dare, missy.

196
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,598
Hello, fastest man alive.

197
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,396
Want to see me read
your entire comic book?

198
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:01,919
Want to see it again?

199
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:23,089
Something's wrong.

200
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:27,362
- What do you mean?
- I'm not sure.

201
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,119
It doesn't feel right.

202
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,964
I don't know
what you're talking about.

203
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,669
Oh, that. Penny did that.

204
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,476
Excuse me.

205
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:35,045
Why don't you just eat
in your desk chair?

206
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,464
Why don't I just eat
in my desk chair?

207
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:38,880
Here we go.

208
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,780
That is my desk chair.
That is where I work.

209
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:44,765
I don't eat in my desk chair

210
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,614
and I don't work in my spot.

211
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:50,018
I work in my desk chair
and eat in my spot.

212
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:51,367
Wackadoodle.

213
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,071
You know, there's
kind of an obvious solution here.

214
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:56,196
Get up.

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,884
There. Problem solved.

216
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:07,119
Nobody cares where you're going to sit.
You're not crazy.

217
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,624
Excuse me,
but the problem is not solved.

218
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,725
If your head had been
accidentally amputated,

219
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,878
and we transplanted a dog's head
in its place,

220
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:19,881
would that be "problem solved"?

221
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,092
If it were your head, it would be.

222
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,481
I am really, really sorry,
but it's only for a week.

223
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,265
Can't you be a little bit flexible?

224
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,533
Yeah, sorry.
I didn't really think that through.

225
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,388
You claimed it's going to be a week,
but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.

226
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:39,294
Why not?

227
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,218
Did you notice
the sign on his counter?

228
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:43,413
He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

229
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,511
He also makes keys.

230
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,118
For God's sake, Sheldon.

231
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,536
Focus is important.

232
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,749
Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner
in between heart transplants?

233
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,045
Did Alexander Fleming moonlight
as a hairdresser?

234
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,710
"Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?"

235
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:06,734
Looks like I'm gonna
have sex tonight.

236
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:08,510
Hey, baby.

237
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,520
His right hand is calling him?

238
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,563
No, it's Leslie Winkle.
It's a long story.

239
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:23,207
I'll pick you up in ten minutes.

240
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:24,852
Gentlemen, <i>adieu</i>.

241
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,407
I thought we were going
to play Halo tonight.

242
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:29,092
What am I supposed to do?

243
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:32,115
There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

244
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,749
You understand, right?

245
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,289
No. Not at all.

246
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,108
Nevertheless, I must depart.
By the way, did I tell you?

247
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,656
Leslie pulled some strings
and got me on the research trip

248
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:48,178
to Geneva to check out
the CERN Supercollider.

249
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,597
That's not fair.
You're not even a physicist.

250
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,682
There are two ways
of looking at this...

251
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,268
- Get out.
- Bye.

252
00:14:58,472 --> 00:14:59,738
You're improving.

253
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:02,554
Thank you.

254
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:05,777
It helps when I get to practice
with a real woman.

255
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:08,952
Listen.

256
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:11,785
Saturday my sister's getting married.
I want you to come with me.

257
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:13,313
It's black tie.

258
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:15,116
Yeah, gee...

259
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,157
I'd really rather not.

260
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,917
Why not?

261
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,438
When I go to weddings,
it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

262
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,732
I don't know what I would do
with a date.

263
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,209
All right. I understand.

264
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:31,135
Thanks.

265
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,390
I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

266
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,470
- What about it?
- Didn't you hear?

267
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:41,662
I reduced the number of people going,
and you didn't make the cut.

268
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,420
When did that happen?

269
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,045
About 12 seconds ago.

270
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,710
Well, hold on.
Are you... saying

271
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:53,535
if I don't go to the wedding,
I can't go to Geneva?

272
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:56,184
Actually, I'm trying not to say it.

273
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,119
Okay, I'm sorry,

274
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,292
but that makes me
a little uncomfortable.

275
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,717
- How so?
- 'Cause it's like you're controlling me

276
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,713
with new equipment
and research trips.

277
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,599
If I weren't controlling you
with new equipment and research trips,

278
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:10,844
- then I'd be uncomfortable.
- How so?

279
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,811
'Cause we'd be in a real relationship
with feelings and all that crap.

280
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,060
So, bottom line, I'm just a...

281
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:22,380
bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

282
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,376
No, not at all.

283
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,133
You're also arm candy.

284
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:33,314
So?

285
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:34,846
What do you think?

286
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,473
Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!

287
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,306
<i>Right now?</i>

288
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,991
<i>What kind of sex
are you having up there?</i>

289
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,930
Why are you crouching there?

290
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:56,818
This is my spot.

291
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,101
Where else am I supposed to crouch?

292
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:03,511
I don't know. Texas?

293
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:09,350
Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners,
good as new.

294
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,840
Really? Great.
Sheldon, look. Good as new.

295
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,616
From that key maker,
I highly doubt it.

296
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,245
Come on, Sheldon.
Just give it a try.

297
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:21,264
All right.

298
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:27,796
There, nice and comfy cozy.
Zero, zero, zero.

299
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:30,311
There's one more zero.

300
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,760
You forgot the time parameter.

301
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:35,980
Sit on the damn couch.

302
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,897
What do you mean, "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

303
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:07,165
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

304
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:09,671
It's exactly the same...

305
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,299
Penny, I think I know what to do.

306
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,427
Sheldon, I have some bad news.

307
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:16,939
More?

308
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,173
I'm afraid so.

309
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,725
You know the cashew chicken
I get you Monday nights?

310
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,560
Yes. From Szechuan Palace.

311
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,439
Szechuan Palace
closed two years ago.

312
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:31,198
What?

313
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,864
Where did my cashew chicken
come from?

314
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:35,405
Golden Dragon.

315
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,303
No, this isn't right.

316
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:49,836
Our food always comes
in Szechuan Palace containers.

317
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:52,365
Yeah, well,
before they went out of business,

318
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,160
I bought 4,000 containers.

319
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,356
I keep them in the trunk of my car.

320
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,869
But...

321
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:03,927
This changes everything.

322
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,765
I thought that might take
his mind off the cushion.

323
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,741
What's real? What isn't?
How can I know?

324
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:17,197
- You did make that up, right?
- Oh, God, I wish I had.

325
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,867
- Leonard?
- Yeah, buddy?

326
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:22,786
I still don't like this cushion.

327
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:29,376
Okay, first of all,
Penny, thank you for coming.

328
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,916
Thanks for the shoes.

329
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:35,007
Penny is an amazing shot.
We have a real chance to win this week.

330
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,870
- What's the plan?
- Now, we all run out.

331
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:40,598
Sheldon and I will cut
to the left behind these trees.

332
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:43,639
Raj, Howard and Leslie flank
to the right behind the rocks.

333
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,980
We'll have a great view

334
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:47,311
as Penny runs out
and kills everyone else in sight.

335
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:51,190
- Just one thing before we start.
- What is it, Sheldon?

336
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,235
What the hell?!

337
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,523
That was for my cushion.

338
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,708
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

339
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,974
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:06,370
But revenge is a dish
best served cold.

341
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:09,847
Screw that.

342
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,378
She can't shoot me.
She's dead.

343
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,695
He's right. You can't.

344
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,643
Well, if we're going
to descend into anarchy...

345
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:31,939
See you.

346
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:37,621
- Where are you going?
- Surrender, then Denny's.
