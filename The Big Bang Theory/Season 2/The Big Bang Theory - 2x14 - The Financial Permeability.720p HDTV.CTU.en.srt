1
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,924
The problem appears
to be unsolvable.

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,207
Maybe we could run
some computer simulations.

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:10,595
There are too many variables.
It would take forever.

4
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:13,086
We've got to be missing something.

5
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:14,584
Let's start again.

6
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,659
The movie is playing here
at 7:20, here at 7:40,

7
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,436
here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,480
These theaters
have to be eliminated.

9
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:27,109
Why? They're state-of-the-art digital
projection, 20-channel surround sound.

10
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,483
Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,866
Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.

12
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:37,453
What about the multiplex here?
The seats are terrific.

13
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,356
They have Twizzlers
instead of Red Vines.

14
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,374
No amount of lumbar support
can compensate for that.

15
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:45,258
It's gonna take
at least an hour to eat,

16
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:47,289
and I don't see
a Sheldon-approved restaurant

17
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,628
proximate
to a Sheldon-approved theater.

18
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,330
- We could eat after the movie.
- Unacceptable.

19
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:56,013
The delay would result in tomorrow's
bowel movement occurring at work.

20
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,393
Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.

21
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,263
We smuggle Slurpees,
which are essentially Icees,

22
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:04,549
in under our coats,

23
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:07,691
after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.

24
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:11,733
I don't see how we missed that.

25
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,932
Excuse me, in what universe
are Slurpees Icees?

26
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:19,333
That's how we missed it.

27
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:22,546
Sheldon, would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis,

28
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:25,501
to create an emergency ad hoc
Slurpee-Icee equivalency?

29
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:28,747
You know I can't do that.

30
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:32,382
I guess we only have one option.

31
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:34,179
I don't see any way around it.

32
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:37,322
- Bye, Sheldon.
- See ya.

33
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,667
They're right,
it was the only option.

34
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:08,632
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

35
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:18,835
Shut the door!

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,552
- Why?
- Just do it!

37
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:28,190
- Get inside and shut the door.
- Well, you didn't specify.

38
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:34,654
- Is Leonard around?
- He went to the movies without me.

39
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,429
It was the only option.

40
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:48,988
I'm sorry, I don't understand
which social situation this is.

41
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:51,496
Could you give me some guidance
as to how to proceed?

42
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,370
The building manager's showing
an apartment downstairs,

43
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:56,868
- and I haven't paid my rent.
- Oh, I see.

44
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,616
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
harboring a fugitive

45
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:03,391
from the 2311 North
Los Robles Corporation.

46
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:06,672
It's no big deal.
I'm just a little behind on my bills

47
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:09,480
because they cut back my hours
at the restaurant and my car broke down.

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,549
If you recall, I pointed out
the "check engine" light

49
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:14,424
to you several months ago.

50
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,235
The "check engine" light is fine.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,110
It's still blinking away.

52
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:22,910
It's the stupid engine
that stopped working.

53
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:25,871
It cost me like $1,200 to fix it.

54
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:30,994
It occurs to me you could solve all
your problems by obtaining more money.

55
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:36,967
Yes, it occurs to me, too.

56
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,971
Hang on a moment.

57
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:51,742
Here. Take some.

58
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:54,054
Pay me back when you can.

59
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,974
- You got a lot of money in there.
- That's why it's guarded by snakes.

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,576
- Take some.
- Don't be silly.

61
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,119
I'm never silly.

62
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,123
- Here.
- No, I can't.

63
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,575
Don't you need money?

64
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:11,897
- Yeah, but...
- This is money I'm not using.

65
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:13,564
But what if you need it?

66
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:17,050
My expenses account for 46.9%
of my after-tax income.

67
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:19,884
The rest is divvied up between
a small savings account,

68
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:22,243
this deceptive container
of peanut brittle

69
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:25,616
and the hollowed-out buttocks
of a superhero action figure

70
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:28,691
who shall remain nameless
for his own protection.

71
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,433
Or her own protection.

72
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,737
- Take some.
- Really? I mean, are you sure?

73
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,816
I see no large upcoming expenditures

74
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,803
unless they develop
an affordable technology

75
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,781
to fuse my skeleton
with adamantium like Wolverine.

76
00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:50,347
Are they working on that?

77
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,457
I sincerely hope so.

78
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:57,866
Well, thank you.

79
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:22,737
No, I can't.

80
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,932
Honey, I don't want things
to be weird between us.

81
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,542
Won't it also be weird
if I have to say hello to you

82
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:31,554
every morning on my way to work
and you're living in a refrigerator box

83
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,707
and washing your hair
with rain water?

84
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:38,588
- I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
- Of course you will.

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,494
It's impossible to pay me back
sooner than you can.

86
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:46,518
Assuming you subscribe to a linear
understanding of time and causality.

87
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:50,112
I'm regretting this already.

88
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:57,031
I've given the matter some thought,
and...

89
00:05:57,161 --> 00:06:01,165
I think I'd be willing to be a house pet
to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

90
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,982
Interesting.

91
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:06,682
Ask me why.

92
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:09,525
Do I have to?

93
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:12,412
Of course. That's how
you move a conversation forward.

94
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:14,490
Why?

95
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,240
The learning opportunities
would be abundant.

96
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:20,215
Additionally, I like
having my belly scratched.

97
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,490
- Hey, Penny. How was work?
- Great.

98
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:29,387
I hope I'm a waitress at the
Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.

99
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,932
Was that sarcasm?

100
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:34,101
Was that sarcasm?

101
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:38,242
- Was that sar...
- Stop it!

102
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:43,862
- You appear to have a package here.
- Oh, thanks.

103
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,792
This must be the beret I ordered.

104
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,667
A couple of months ago.
It was back-ordered.

105
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:51,038
Did you know the beret is an example

106
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:54,756
of a piece of women's fashion
adapted from male military uniforms?

107
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,746
Another fascinating example
is the epaulet.

108
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,172
He's not lying.
He does find that fascinating.

109
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,044
Whatever. It's not like
I'm running up and down the streets

110
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,645
just buying myself berets.

111
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,970
I bought one a month ago,
and it was back-ordered.

112
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,433
- Look, it finally arrived, all right?
- All right.

113
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,907
Oh, my God, would you just
get off my case?!

114
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,516
- Weird.
- Good, that was an unusual interaction.

115
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,791
I wasn't sure.

116
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:28,078
- Did you guys have an argument?
- No.

117
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,338
You clearly did something
to aggravate her.

118
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,852
I'm at a loss.

119
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:36,455
If you like, you can review
my daily log of social interactions

120
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:39,834
and see if there's
a blunder I overlooked.

121
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:42,760
Here you go.

122
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:46,735
You owe me another two dollars.
The price of moo shu pork went up.

123
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,958
It's getting tougher and tougher
to be a bad Jew.

124
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:54,193
Here you go, Penny.
Shrimp with lobster sauce.

125
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:57,501
- Thank you. What's my share?
- Don't worry about it. It's my treat.

126
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,052
Really, how much?

127
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:00,603
Whatever. $10, $11.

128
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:02,481
Which is it, $10 or $11?

129
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,595
$14.50. But it's no biggie.

130
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:07,236
You'll get the next one.

131
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:11,283
What?

132
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,380
He was just wondering if he wore
skintight jeans and a tank top

133
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:18,055
if he'd get
his shrimp lo mein for free.

134
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:23,247
What are you saying?
That I'm using my body to get dinner?

135
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,713
That I'm some kind of Chinese
food prostitute?

136
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,799
Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?

137
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:33,871
Let me tell you something.
I pay my own way in this world, okay?

138
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:35,696
I don't rely on anybody!

139
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:42,932
What was that about?

140
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:46,007
He has a nervous bladder
when he's stressed out.

141
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,220
Kind of like a puppy.

142
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,532
Here, Leonard.
$10, $11, $12... $14.

143
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,703
It was $14.50, but it's okay.

144
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:00,785
Oh, good.
Dinner's here.

145
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,455
Yes, and I'm having some.
I'm having takeout food.

146
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,735
You're damn right it's okay. I've been
having leftovers at the restaurant

147
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,465
for like four days, and I wanted
something different. So sue me.

148
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:11,102
Forgive me, but that would be

149
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,880
the very definition
of a frivolous lawsuit.

150
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:18,306
I will pay you back as soon as I can.
You just have to give me more time.

151
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,360
- You lent her money?
- She need money.

152
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:22,905
You seem under pressure.

153
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,814
Did I not lend you a sufficient amount?
Because I can give you more.

154
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:29,553
You know, you would just
love that, wouldn't you?

155
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:34,739
You would just love to
open up your little snake can

156
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:38,238
and throw some money
at the girl who can't pay her bills.

157
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,205
- Where are you going?
- Going home,

158
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,992
where I won't be interrogated
like a criminal.

159
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:51,036
I forgot my fortune cookie.

160
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:57,680
In case either of you
have larceny in your heart,

161
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:01,542
you should know that I've moved
my money out of the snake can.

162
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:08,479
But if you're ever short, there's always
a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

163
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,069
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:22,060
A little mood lighting, huh?

165
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,083
When I didn't pay my bill,

166
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,473
the Department of Water and Power
thought I would enjoy the ambience.

167
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,546
Yeah, they're very considerate
that way.

168
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,798
I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.
Then I had like $14 left over.

169
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:38,718
$14, huh?

170
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:43,308
Put it back in your pocket,
or I'll find some other place to put it.

171
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:46,361
Back in the pocket it goes.

172
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:48,519
You do understand

173
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:51,027
Sheldon really doesn't care
when he gets the money back.

174
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,258
It's actually
one of the few idiosyncrasies

175
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:55,838
that doesn't make you
want to... kill him.

176
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:59,240
Yeah, well, that's not really
my big problem.

177
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,660
So you're a little behind on your bills.
Everybody gets behind on their bills.

178
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,996
I know, it's just...
This wasn't the plan.

179
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,667
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

180
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:09,417
What was the plan?

181
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,879
Waitress for six months
and then become a movie star.

182
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,386
- Was there a plan B?
- TV star.

183
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:23,824
It's probably not as bad as you think.
Let's take a look.

184
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,978
Maybe we can find
some corners to cut.

185
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,101
Here's something.

186
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:31,465
If you don't have electricity,
then you probably don't need cable.

187
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,660
Just a suggestion.

188
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:40,198
$170 dollars for acting classes?

189
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,821
No, I can't give up my acting classes.
I'm a professional actress.

190
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,203
You've had an acting job
where you got paid?

191
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:49,841
That is not the definition
of professional.

192
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,005
Actually, it kind of...
Let's keep looking.

193
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:03,862
What's $1,800 to the Los Angeles County
Superior Court?

194
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:05,828
That's nothing.

195
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:06,953
Nothing?

196
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:11,106
It sounds like you got caught speeding
going 4,000 miles an hour.

197
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:13,858
Remember Kurt?

198
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,568
Your ex-boyfriend?

199
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,572
He got arrested for taking
a whiz on a cop car.

200
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,497
- What?
- He was drunk.

201
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:22,851
I would hope so.

202
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:26,574
He had a bunch of outstanding tickets
and a bench warrant,

203
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,122
so I, you know, I paid his fines.

204
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,584
- Did he pay you back?
- No, but he will.

205
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:35,763
And that's based on the inherent
credit-worthiness of people

206
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,409
who get drunk and urinate
on police vehicles?

207
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,603
Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt
and ask him for money.

208
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,498
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know,

209
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:48,683
but I may have to find
a cheaper place to live.

210
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:54,147
You don't want to do that.

211
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:55,358
Why not?

212
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:58,008
Moving is a big deal.

213
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,134
You have to go to the supermarket
and get boxes,

214
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,091
and if they're not clean,
your books smell like melons,

215
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:06,284
and it's like...

216
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:10,206
Why don't you just get a roommate
and stay here?

217
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,236
Do you know anybody?

218
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:16,171
I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon
wouldn't mind moving in with you.

219
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:21,467
Leonard, honey,
if we started living together,

220
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,114
I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.

221
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:28,044
Really?

222
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,697
And you thought my acting lessons
were a waste of money.

223
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,630
This Moo Shu pork's burning
a hole through my duodenum.

224
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:45,844
Leviticus 11:3:

225
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,463
"Only that which parteth the hoof
and cheweth the cud

226
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,409
among the beasts shall ye eat."

227
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:55,436
Do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita

228
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:57,710
every time you scarf down a Whopper?

229
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,118
- What's going on?
- We're on a quest

230
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,344
through the Valley of Fire
to acquire the sacred crown.

231
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,965
You want the Valley of Fire?
It's right here.

232
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,184
You guys want to go
on a real live quest?

233
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:15,375
Outside? I just made cocoa.

234
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:19,150
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- What is it?

235
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:22,195
Do you guys remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

236
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:26,976
Yeah, that's him.

237
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:30,203
Turns out he owes Penny a lot of money,
and I'm gonna go get it from him.

238
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:32,779
Who's with me?

239
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:38,394
Double sixes.

240
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,379
Really? You're just gonna
let me go by myself?

241
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,315
Cool, I got a sword.

242
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:45,735
I could use some help.

243
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:47,255
Here.

244
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,708
You guys are unbelievable.

245
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,594
You play a game
to simulate adventure,

246
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,973
but when there's real adventure
out there in the real world,

247
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:56,352
you just wimp out.

248
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:59,546
Do you not recall
the last time we visited this gentleman,

249
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:01,721
we returned home without pants?

250
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:05,861
- I do.
- Are you sure?

251
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:08,281
Because your proposal
suggests that you don't.

252
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,500
- I'm not afraid of him.
- All right.

253
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,612
Leonard fairly calls the question:

254
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,798
Who is in favor
of abandoning our game

255
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:17,733
and confronting Penny's
steroid-infused ex-boyfriend

256
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,872
in a suicidal mission
to extract money from him?

257
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,162
Say hi to Kurt for us.

258
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,446
Excuse me.

259
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:31,137
When Frodo left the Shire
to take the one ring to Mordor,

260
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:33,419
didn't Samwise, Pippin
and Merry go with him?

261
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:34,640
- They did.
- Well?

262
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,860
They had a terrible time of it.

263
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:40,977
Plus, no one stole their pants.

264
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:43,525
Fine.

265
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,650
Enjoy your little game.
I'll make this quest on my own.

266
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:47,905
Wait.

267
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,183
Take a jacket.
It's shpritzing a little.

268
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:53,644
You guys suck.

269
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,973
Come on, please? He's so big.

270
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:04,134
Is everyone clear on the plan?

271
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,005
Koothrappali's going to wet himself,

272
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,022
I'm gonna throw up,
Sheldon's gonna run away,

273
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,610
and you're going to die.

274
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,797
Shall we synchronize our watches?

275
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:16,474
Guys, there are four of us
and one of him.

276
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:19,224
Which means his triumph
will be even larger.

277
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,601
Minstrels will write songs
about him.

278
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,041
How about this? I'll do the talking.

279
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,444
You just stand behind me
and try to look formidable.

280
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,345
I should've peed before we left.

281
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,254
- Hi, Kurt.
- Lenny, right?

282
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,672
I don't really go by Lenny,
but that's okay.

283
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,926
You remember
Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

284
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,634
- What do you want?
- You don't remember me?

285
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,851
- How could he not rember me?
- Not now.

286
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,131
I remember him.

287
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,355
Here it is.

288
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,684
Penny's in kind of a financial jam,
and the money that you owe her

289
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,775
would go a long way
to solving her problems.

290
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:09,610
She sent you to get it from me?

291
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,384
No, no, she's too proud
to ask for the money.

292
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:15,284
I, on the other hand, feel
you should honor your debt.

293
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:16,453
You do?

294
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,655
"Feel" is a kind of a...
it's a strong word.

295
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,878
I just think it would be
a nice gesture on your part.

296
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,783
She'll get it when she gets it.

297
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,708
Well, there you go.
Problem solved.

298
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:39,575
A successful quest. Now let's go find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

299
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,476
No, the problem isn't solved.

300
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,260
- He just blew us off.
- I've got it.

301
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,999
He didn't remember me
because the last time we met,

302
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,756
I was in a Halloween costume.

303
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,738
Come on, Leonard, let's go.

304
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:56,325
You can leave if you want to.
I'm gonna see this through.

305
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:06,459
I guess, technically,
that was my fault.

306
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,164
I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

307
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,949
What happened to your backup?

308
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,416
I don't need backup.

309
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,558
I have right on my side.

310
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,429
And I'm wearing cargo shorts
under my pants.

311
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:34,648
Congratulations.

312
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:36,903
You may not have succeed
in getting cash,

313
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:40,034
but you did secure
a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

314
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:47,996
Maybe we should have
your head notarized.

315
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:53,999
If anybody cares,
I still have to pee.

316
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,143
- Is Sheldon here?
- Hang on.

317
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:07,764
Nice hat.

318
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,371
It's kind of a fashionable look
these days.

319
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,440
Maybe if you're working
on a tuna boat.

320
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,572
- Hello, Penny.
- Sheldon, here is your money.

321
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,657
Thank you very much.
It helped a lot.

322
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,467
Sarcasm?

323
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,776
Darn. I can't seem
to get the hang of that.

324
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:31,169
I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

325
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,449
Well, I cut back my expenses
like you said

326
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,698
and picked up a few more hours
at the restaurant,

327
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:38,551
but the biggest thing was,
out of the blue, Kurt shows up

328
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,428
and gives me the money he owes me.

329
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,346
Really?

330
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:44,572
Did he say why?

331
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:49,520
He said he was feeling guilty
and wanted to do what was right.

332
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:53,801
That's it?

333
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:58,943
Did he give any reason
as to why he came

334
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:00,656
to this moral epiphany?

335
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:04,327
I just think he's really changed.

336
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,957
We're having dinner tomorrow night,
and I get to wear my new beret.

337
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:11,949
Bye, guys.

338
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,194
Well done, Leonard.

339
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,886
The true hero
doesn't seek adulation.

340
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:28,684
He fights for right and justice
simply because it's his nature.

341
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:31,720
Penny's hooking up
with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend,

342
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:34,234
and I have indelible ink
on my forehead!

343
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,237
That's your badge of honor...
your warrior's wound, if you will.

344
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:40,503
I was wrong.

345
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:43,358
Minstrels will write
songs about you.

346
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:47,161
Great.

347
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:50,396
<i>There once was a brave lad
named Leonard</i>

348
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,779
<i>With a fi-fi fiddle dee-dee</i>

349
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:57,247
<i>He faced a fearsome giant</i>

350
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,252
<i>While Raj just wanted to pee</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
