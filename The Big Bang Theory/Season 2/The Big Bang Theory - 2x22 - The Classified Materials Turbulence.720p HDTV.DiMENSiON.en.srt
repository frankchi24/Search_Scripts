1
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:07,811
Smell that?

2
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,394
That's the smell of new comic books.

3
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:18,267
They're on me today, boys.

4
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:19,639
You're paying?

5
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:21,983
Have you been selling
your sperm again?

6
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:24,804
No, I'm celebrating.

7
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,858
As we speak,
the space shuttle is docking

8
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,628
at the International Space Station

9
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:32,254
where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

10
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:36,368
Get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

11
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:41,195
Just think. Thanks to your hard work,
an international crew of astronauts

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,170
will "boldly go
where no man has gone before."

13
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,891
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.

14
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:49,823
The combination of
the <i>Star Trek</i> reference

15
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:52,782
and the play on words involving
the double-meaning of the verb "to go"

16
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:55,596
suggests that Leonard is mocking
your efforts in space plumbing.

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,975
Okay, make your little jokes,

18
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,171
but of the four of us,
I'm the only one making

19
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:04,479
any real-world contribution
to science and technology.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,314
He's right. This is an important
achievement, for two reasons.

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,615
Number one...

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,321
and, of course, number two!

23
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:14,508
Clever!

24
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,464
Playing on the use
of cardinal numbers

25
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:18,841
as euphemisms for bodily functions.

26
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:25,668
Here, Sheldon,
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.

27
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:27,238
It's mind-blowing.

28
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,812
Excuse me.

29
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:30,547
Spoiler alert.

30
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,884
I didn't spoil anything.

31
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,526
You told me it's mind-blowing.

32
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,679
So, my mind is going into it
pre-blown.

33
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,349
And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

34
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:41,851
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,062
Said the Grinch to Christmas.

36
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,330
- Can I talk to you about something?
- What's up?

37
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:53,069
Remember I went out with Penny,
a couple weeks ago?

38
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,345
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure you remember.

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,528
You went to the bar
and made a fool of yourself

40
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,371
trying to pick up strange women.

41
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,030
What about it?

42
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:08,211
The thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

43
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:10,402
Too bad.

44
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:14,222
I guess the thing to do now
is just pick yourself up,

45
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:16,301
dust yourself off,
forget it and move on.

46
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:18,860
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

47
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,154
'Cause we're going out
again tomorrow.

48
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:23,561
Excuse me, Stuart.

49
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,302
Have you read the new Flash?

50
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:27,998
Well, I have
and it will knock your socks off!

51
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,484
Good luck getting them back on.

52
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:39,242
This is probably my last shot with Penny
and I don't want to screw it up.

53
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,810
Nobody wants that.

54
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,463
So, here's my question:
It's the second date,

55
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,747
you think she'll be expecting things

56
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,882
to get physical?

57
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:52,377
Gee...

58
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,803
My initial reaction is "no,"

59
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,344
but let me think about it
and get back to you.

60
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,179
So, you'll give me a call?

61
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,431
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.

62
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,207
Or nobody calls anyone.

63
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,334
Interesting.

64
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,727
Penny's current suitor asking advice
from her former suitor.

65
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,403
You know, thanks
for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.

66
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,900
Hey, wanna make sure
he gets nowhere with Penny

67
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:20,657
without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,367
I'm listening.

69
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,723
Just tell him to do everything
you've done with her

70
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,538
for the last two years.

71
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,065
Subtitles: The FW Team

72
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:02,176
- How's it going?
- Good, good. You?

73
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:03,394
Fine.

74
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:05,703
Can I ask you something?

75
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:06,620
Sure.

76
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:09,101
You know your friend Stuart?

77
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,252
He asked me out again
and I said yes,

78
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,922
and then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

79
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:17,173
About what?

80
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,721
Does it bother you,
me going out with one of your friends?

81
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:22,220
'Cause you know, you and me...

82
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,041
No, that's the past.

83
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:27,735
I'm really more
of a "right now" kind of guy.

84
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,711
You know, living in the moment.

85
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:34,065
Although I do have to live a little
in the future, 'cause that's my job.

86
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,664
Of course, my fondness
for classic science fiction

87
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:38,507
does draw my attention backwards,

88
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:41,597
but those stories often
take place in the future.

89
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,077
In conclusion, no,
it doesn't bother me.

90
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:50,285
Okay, well,
that's really cool of you.

91
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:54,837
I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say... "That's Leonard!"

92
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,898
In that case,
do you mind giving me some advice?

93
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,173
About Stuart?

94
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,473
Love to.

95
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:03,467
He's very shy.

96
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:05,746
How do I make him feel
more comfortable around me?

97
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:08,930
First of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

98
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:11,445
Really?

99
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:13,284
Stuart thrives under pressure.

100
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,634
That's why he works in
a comic book store.

101
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,116
It's Stuart.

102
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:30,621
You're not going to answer it?

103
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,751
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't want to talk about Penny.

104
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:36,919
You're making an assumption.

105
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:40,631
Perhaps the comic book store
is on fire.

106
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:43,301
And he needs your assistance.

107
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,519
Why would he call me?

108
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:47,829
We don't know.

109
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,476
And if you don't answer the phone,
we can't know.

110
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:55,271
I'm not answering the phone.

111
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,444
Answer the phone, Leonard.

112
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,865
There, it went to voice mail.

113
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,499
Aren't you going to check
your messages?

114
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,587
You have to check your messages!

115
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,484
The living of a message
is one half of a social contract

116
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:25,384
which is completed by the
checking of the message.

117
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:28,179
If that contract breaks down,

118
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,537
then all social contracts break down
and we descend into anarchy.

119
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,002
It must be hell inside your head.

120
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:39,801
At times.

121
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,444
Guys, we have a code red.

122
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,455
"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert,
the computer worm,

123
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,784
or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

124
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:53,101
Look, I was going over the schematics
on my zero-G toilet,

125
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:54,618
and I made a teeny tiny mistake

126
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:56,581
on the specifications
for the diverter valve.

127
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,542
How teeny tiny?

128
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,585
It's gonna fail
after about ten flushes.

129
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:04,549
- But the mission is for six months.
- See, that's the code red.

130
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:07,300
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.

131
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:09,272
No one knows exactly when,
but at some point

132
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:12,138
something way worse than a puppet
is gonna pop out of that box.

133
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:15,977
Have you notified NASA?

134
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,791
Are you crazy?
What am I gonna say?

135
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,349
"I screwed up your toilet
and there's gonna be crap floating

136
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,525
"all over your nice
shiny space station"?

137
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,344
What are you gonna do?

138
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:27,113
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it,
then I'll tell them.

139
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,842
So, what do you need us for?

140
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,045
He can't figure out how to fix it.

141
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,619
You said you were
gonna be supportive.

142
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:37,372
I'm trying, but you have to admit
this is pretty damn funny.

143
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:39,751
I agree.

144
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,625
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech
nature of space exploration

145
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,687
against the banality
of a malfunctioning toilet

146
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,746
that provides the comic fodder here.

147
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,096
Check your messages.

148
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,359
All right,
this is an exact duplicate

149
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,579
of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Disposal System

150
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:03,608
as deployed on the
International Space Station.

151
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:08,069
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?

152
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:10,984
Good one.

153
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,874
It's hilarious. Now...

154
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,551
Here's an approximation

155
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:21,410
of the spare parts
available on the Space Station.

156
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,418
We gotta find a way,
using nothing but this,

157
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:26,547
to reinforce this so the waste material
avoids the spinning turbine.

158
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,975
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?

159
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:34,733
I have to say,

160
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:38,281
I thought the toilet humor would
get less funny with repetition.

161
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:39,910
Apparently, there is no law

162
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:42,479
of diminishing comedic returns
with space poop.

163
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,329
You busy?

164
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,573
Classified, Leonard.

165
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:55,533
Yeah, it's a regular
Manhattan Project.

166
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:57,745
What's up?

167
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,638
Tonight's my date with Penny

168
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,833
and since we haven't been able
to connect by phone...

169
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,459
I'm sorry, it's been broken.

170
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:06,475
- Or e-mail.
- Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.

171
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:10,006
Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.

172
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,853
All right, well,
off the top of my head,

173
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:18,098
I think the most important thing
with Penny is to go really slow.

174
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,281
I mean, glacial.

175
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:27,833
Guys come onto her all the time,
so, you need to set yourself apart.

176
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:29,688
Be a little shy,

177
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,797
don't make too much eye contact.

178
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,384
And, you know, treat her
with, like, cool detachment

179
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,774
and-and, you know, fear.

180
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,163
- Fear?
- Yeah, like,

181
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,922
you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

182
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:49,595
Well, that plays
right into my wheelhouse.

183
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,551
Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.

184
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,289
Thanks, Leonard.

185
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:56,970
What is that thing anyway?

186
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,557
You don't know what this is?

187
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,684
Good. Get out.

188
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,145
Be afraid of Penny.

189
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,898
Nice. Very crafty.

190
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:13,046
It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.

191
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:16,116
For what it's worth, my mother says

192
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,178
that when we deceive
for personal gain,

193
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:20,069
we make Jesus cry.

194
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:32,798
All right, what if we use
this two-inch PVC

195
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,717
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.

196
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,157
It might work for the Japanese
and the Americans,

197
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:41,431
but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

198
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:47,786
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

199
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,060
I feel terrible.

200
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,695
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

201
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:58,638
I deliberately tried
to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.

202
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:02,260
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.

203
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:04,872
You don't really believe
in that superstition, do you?

204
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,874
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.

205
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,877
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

206
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:13,881
Leonard pretends to be a friend
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

207
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,927
Therefore, he is reborn
as a banana slug.

208
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,726
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

209
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,890
Speaking of what goes around
comes around...

210
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,063
Okay, look.

211
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:34,018
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here,

212
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:36,653
what if we just ran another line,
bypass it entirely?

213
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:39,405
It won't work. The diameter
of the tubing is insufficient.

214
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,575
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

215
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,368
It won't work. No way to mount it.

216
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:45,968
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live

217
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:48,665
with my cousin and her husband, Avi,
in Israel?

218
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,088
That could work.

219
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:00,038
- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?

220
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,289
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a zero-gravity...

221
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:04,541
pasta maker.

222
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:08,935
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?

223
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,437
No, thanks. I have coffee.

224
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,981
Great. So how'd it go
with Stuart last night?

225
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:16,693
I really don't want
to talk about it.

226
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,602
Yeah. Right. Sure.

227
00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:20,817
The thing is,
before you guys went out,

228
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:22,129
I spoke to him and...

229
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:24,117
I said I don't want
to talk about it.

230
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:25,680
I just... I kind of...

231
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:28,067
What goes on between me and Stuart
is none of your business.

232
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:29,831
So just leave it alone, okay?

233
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:38,580
If you want to clean up your karma,
go get my freakin' latte.

234
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,369
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge

235
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,646
this little piece of PVC
behind the support rod.

236
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:54,815
You're overestimating
the tensile strength

237
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,483
of the substructure you're building.

238
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,360
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.

239
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,183
If you knew what you were doing,
there wouldn't be a space toilet

240
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:03,115
where my coffee table should be.

241
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,492
Howard, wait.

242
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:07,915
Why don't you use this
instead of the PVC

243
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,247
to keep the transverse
filter assembly in place?

244
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:13,130
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

245
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:14,922
This is the thing from the pizza box

246
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:17,713
that keeps the lid
from touching the cheese.

247
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:21,049
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.

248
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,875
Of course, we also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera,

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,639
so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

250
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:31,643
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.

251
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,066
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.

252
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:36,690
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store

253
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,151
when man can once again
safely poop in space.

254
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:41,445
Why does Leonard get to go?

255
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,733
'Cause he's upset
over his situation with Penny

256
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:46,867
and if I have to hear about it again,
I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.

257
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:51,370
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.

258
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,565
All right, I think we've got
a prototype ready to test.

259
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,918
Hand me that Tupperware.

260
00:13:58,293 --> 00:13:59,242
That's heavy.

261
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,548
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.

262
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,270
It's been testing toilets
for generations.

263
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:07,663
I must say,

264
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:11,303
I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances

265
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:13,769
might entitle you
to a refund on your master's degree.

266
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,995
Okay, simulated zero-gravity
human waste disposal test

267
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,901
with meat loaf analog in...

268
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:25,113
three, two, one.

269
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,626
Fascinating.

270
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,631
What do you think the problem is?

271
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:38,567
Not enough bread crumbs.

272
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,220
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.

273
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,945
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,

274
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,017
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.

275
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:56,603
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.

276
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:58,341
You're kidding.

277
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,622
Never worked for me.

278
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,565
Last night at dinner,
I did what you told me.

279
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:06,293
I went really slow,
I kept my distance,

280
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:08,907
and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out in my car.

281
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,485
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

282
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,414
It doesn't matter,
that's where it all went to hell.

283
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,965
During the kissing?

284
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,442
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

285
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:26,091
No, everything was good
and really hot.

286
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,968
And I said,

287
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,210
"Oh, Penny,"

288
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:32,503
and right where she was supposed to say,
"Oh, Stuart," she said...

289
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,808
your name.

290
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,065
That is your name, right?

291
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,572
I'm sorry. That must've been
the last thing you wanted to hear.

292
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:53,016
It beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

293
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,830
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

294
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,890
No doubt, no doubt.

295
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:06,370
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

296
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:07,632
Not your fault.

297
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,486
Yeah, how about that?

298
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,228
- See you soon.
- Sure.

299
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,948
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."

300
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,951
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.

301
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:36,869
What's classified?

302
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:40,121
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.

303
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:43,544
Well, they've deployed our solution.

304
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,539
Let's just all hope it works.

305
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,100
I don't see why I have to worry.

306
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:50,895
My career's not hanging
in the balance.

307
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:58,516
That was a joke.

308
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,490
It's funny,

309
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,580
because it's true.

310
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,218
Leonard, could you pass
the soy sauce, please?

311
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:10,945
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

312
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,052
Yeah, I said "Leonard."

313
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,092
Yes, you did, didn't you?

314
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,874
What the hell is that?

315
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:25,633
Meatloaf.

00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,005
What was it doing on the ceiling?

317
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,263
That's classified.

318
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:40,129
<i>Houston,
International Space Station.</i>

319
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:42,459
<i>We have a little situation up here.</i>

an unscheduled space walk.</i>

325
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,825
<i>Houston,
