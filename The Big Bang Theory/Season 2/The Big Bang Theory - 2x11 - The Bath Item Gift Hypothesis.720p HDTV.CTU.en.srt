1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,090
Your argument is lacking
on all scientific merit.

2
00:00:03,215 --> 00:00:06,619
And it is well established,
Superman cleans his uniform

3
00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:10,495
by flying into Earth yellow Sun,
which incinerate any contaminate matter

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,437
and leaves the unvulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

5
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,261
What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?

6
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:21,522
- Like what?
- I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

7
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:24,915
I think we can safely assume
that all Kryptonian condiments

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,892
were destroyed
when the planet Krypton exploded.

9
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:30,341
Or it turned
into mustard Kryptonite,

10
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:34,321
the only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.

11
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:37,850
Raj, please,
let's stay serious here.

12
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,749
Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

13
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,956
What about Kryptonian pit stains?

14
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,003
Superman doesn't sweat
on Earth.

15
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,817
He's invited for dinner
in the Bottle City of Kandor.

16
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:52,745
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city
where he loses his superpowers.

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,346
Before dinner, his host says,

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,621
"Who's up for a little
Kryptonian tetherball?"

19
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:59,380
Superman says "Sure," works up a sweat,
comes back to Earth,

20
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:02,520
his uniform now stained with
indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,193
Boo ya.

22
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,265
Superman would have
taken his uniform

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,391
to a Kandorian dry cleaner
before he left the Bottle.

24
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,950
"Kandorian dry cl..." I give up.

25
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:20,070
You can't have a rational
argument with this man.

26
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:25,277
Isn't that the guy who won
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

27
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,140
No, not all at once.

28
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:28,922
Then how?

29
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:30,318
Leonard.

30
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,253
Now, Raj.

31
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:36,859
Now, Sheldon.

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,181
I didn't get a good look.
Can I go again?

33
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,979
- It's David Underhill. So what?
- So what?

34
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,672
His observation of high-energy positrons
has provided

35
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:50,944
the first conclusive evidence for
the existence of galactic dark matter.

36
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,644
I have two words for you.
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

37
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:56,341
It is a big whoop.

38
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,910
It made almost all the work
you've done completely useless.

39
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,535
- Did not.
- Did, too.

40
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,408
Okay, maybe some of it, but...

41
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:06,296
The guy was just in the right place,
at the right time

42
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,082
with the right paradigm-shifting
reinterpretation of the universe.

43
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,689
He got lucky.

44
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,074
In more ways than one.

45
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,170
He's a very handsome man.

46
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:18,326
Doesn't do anything for me.
If I was gonna go that way,

47
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm more of a Zac Efron kinda guy.

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,895
Yeah, like you have
a shot with Zac Efron.

49
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,024
Excuse me...
Are you Leonard Hofstadter?

50
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,138
I'm David Underhill.

51
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,295
Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted
to set something up

52
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,515
in the photomultiplier lab,
that you'd be able to give me a hand?

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,955
- You want to work with me?
- If you have a little time.

54
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,457
Sure.

55
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,276
Yeah, no problem.

56
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,878
Here's my home number.
Here's my cell.

57
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,880
Here's my office.

58
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,743
Here's my parents' number
up in New Jersey.

59
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,015
They always know how to reach me.

60
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,239
Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant,
by the way. Big fan.

61
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:03,057
Thanks. I'll call you.

62
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:14,416
What are you looking at?
You've never seen a hypocrite before?

63
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:34,543
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

64
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:41,887
Trailing badly,
Wolowitz needs a strike

65
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,348
if he has any hopes of catching up
with Sheldon Cooper,

66
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,428
who is dominating in the ninth frame
with a career-best 68.

67
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,250
Hey, guys!

68
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,950
That doesn't count.
Do over! Do over!

69
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,452
There are no do-overs
in Wii bowling.

70
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:09,536
There are always do-overs
when my people play sports.

71
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,464
Where were you that's more important
than Wii bowling night?

72
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,225
- Actually...
- It's rhetorical.

73
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,413
There is nothing more important
than Wii bowling night.

74
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,719
Come on, it's just a video game.
And we suck at it.

75
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:25,514
Nice motivational speech
from the team captain.

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,143
- Where were you?
- I was working with Dave Underhill.

77
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:33,024
"Dave." Sounds like
Leonard's got a new BFF.

78
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:38,168
Actually, he's pretty cool.
Not only is he a brilliant scientist,

79
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,446
but it turns out
he's a Black Diamond skier.

80
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:43,699
He collects vintage motorcycles.
He plays in a rock band.

81
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,364
So? We're in a rock band.

82
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:47,489
No...

83
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,416
We play Rock Band
on our X-Box.

84
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,881
Nice motivational speech
from our lead guitarist.

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,466
He's funny, too.

86
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,510
He does this hysterical impersonation
of Stephen Hawking having phone sex.

87
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:03,994
What are you wearing?

88
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,688
That's not... He does it better.

89
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,416
He said he was gonna
take me to the gym tomorrow,

90
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,644
so I'm gonna go practice my situps.

91
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,690
Humongous man crush,
dude.

92
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:19,647
Yeah.
It's officially a bro-mance.

93
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,697
Are you and Leonard
putting up a Christmas tree?

94
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,485
No, because we don't celebrate

95
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,951
the ancient pagan festival
of Saturnalia.

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,181
- Saturnalia?
- Gather round, kids,

97
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:35,150
it's time for Sheldon's
beloved Christmas special.

98
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,836
In the pre-Christian era,

99
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:41,299
as the winter solstice
approached and the plants died,

100
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,880
pagans brought evergreen boughs
into their homes

101
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,719
as an act of sympathetic magic,

102
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,639
intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.

103
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,567
This custom was later appropriated
by Northern Europeans

104
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:54,394
and eventually it becomes
the so-called Christmas tree.

105
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,861
And that, Charlie Brown,
is what boredom is all about.

106
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,316
Thank you for that,
but I got you and Leonard

107
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:07,032
a few silly neighbor gifts,
so I'll just put them under my tree.

108
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,910
Wait!
You bought me a present?

109
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,121
Why would you do such a thing?

110
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:15,791
'Cause it's Christmas?

111
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,741
I know you think
you're being generous,

112
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:21,479
but the foundation
of gift-giving is reciprocity.

113
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:25,104
You haven't given me a gift.
You've given me an obligation.

114
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,737
Don't feel bad, Penny,
it's a classic rookie mistake.

115
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:32,766
My first Hanukah with Sheldon,
he yelled at me for eight nights.

116
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,271
You don't have
to get me anything in return.

117
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,875
Of course I do.
The essence of the custom

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,110
is that I now have to go out and
purchase a gift of commensurate value

119
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,611
and representing the same
perceived level of friendship

120
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:48,240
as that represented
by the gift you've given me.

121
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:51,869
It's no wonder suicide rates
skyrocket this time of year.

122
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,872
Forget it.
I'm not giving you a present.

123
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,764
It's too late. I see it.
That elf sticker says, "To Sheldon."

124
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,587
The die has been cast.
The moving finger has writ,

125
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:04,707
Hannibal has crossed the Alps.

126
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:08,971
I know. It's funny
when it's not happening to us.

127
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,099
Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.

128
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,100
No, I brought this on myself

129
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:19,271
by being such an endearing
and important part of your life.

130
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,816
I'm going to need
a ride to the mall.

131
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,828
It's happening to us.

132
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,536
- Are you gonna make it?
- Yeah, I guess.

133
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:38,532
Thanks for letting me try out
your motorcycle.

134
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,042
No problem.

135
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:42,480
I had no idea it was so heavy.

136
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:46,126
The thing just fell right
over on me, didn't it?

137
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,601
Yeah.
Lucky for you it wasn't moving.

138
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,678
Hey, Leonard. Are you okay?

139
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:54,181
It's just a little
motorcycle accident.

140
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,058
My God, how fast were you going?

141
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,571
I don't know. It's all such a blur.

142
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,189
Good one.
He couldn't even get it started.

143
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,691
- Hi. Dave.
- Hi.

144
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,902
Penny.
So it's your motorcycle?

145
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,655
- Is it okay?
- It's fine.

146
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,487
Lucky for the bike
it landed on my leg.

147
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:17,037
You mind giving me a hand
with Speed Racer here?

148
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,491
- How do you know Leonard?
- I'm a physicist.

149
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:22,926
No, you're not.

150
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,185
Why is that so surprising?

151
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,204
Well, it's just that
the physicists I know

152
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:31,217
are indoorsy and pale.

153
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:35,381
I'm not indoorsy.
I just wear the appropriate sun block

154
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:38,001
because I don't take
melanoma lightly.

155
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:40,758
So, are you and Leonard
working on an experiment together?

156
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:43,431
- Actually we are.
- We're examining the radiation levels

157
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,219
of photomultiplier tubes
for a new dark matter detector.

158
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:48,555
Sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking.

159
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:51,583
You know, I love science.

160
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,520
- Since when?
- Since always.

161
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,233
Call me a geek, but I am just nuts

162
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:58,953
for the whole subatomic
particle thing.

163
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,559
The last thing I would
ever call you is a geek.

164
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:04,587
Well, that's what I am...
queen of the nerds.

165
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,726
If you like, I could show you
the lab we're working in.

166
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,300
We've got some cool toys,
you know, lasers and stuff.

167
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,877
You know, I have always wanted
to see a big science lab.

168
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,820
- Since when?
- Since always.

169
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:18,974
Leonard, are you okay here?

170
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:21,226
- I guess.
- How about we go see it now?

171
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:24,563
Maybe afterwards we take the bike,
we grab a little bite to eat...

172
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,976
Yeah, that sounds great.
Let me just get my jacket.

173
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:33,751
Boy, she'll do, huh?

174
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,282
Yeah, if you like that type.

175
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:39,572
So, you and her...?

176
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,215
- No, just neighbors.
- Really?

177
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,550
I don't know how you live
next door to that

178
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,297
without doing something about it.

179
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,881
Actually...

180
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,336
science is my lady.

181
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,094
- Okay. Let's go.
- All right.

182
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,294
- See you tomorrow, Leonard.
- See ya.

183
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:00,775
Have fun.

184
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,122
Did you forget your key?

185
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,989
I don't see anything in here
a woman would want.

186
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,163
You're kidding.

187
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,974
You've got lotions
and bath oils and soaps.

188
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:38,775
That's the estrogen hat trick.

189
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,959
What it is is a cacophonous assault

190
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:45,979
of eucalyptus, bayberry,
cinnamon and vanilla.

191
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:50,222
It's as if my head were trapped
in the pajamas of a sultan.

192
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:54,974
If you don't like this stuff,
let's go next door and build her a bear.

193
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,978
I told you before,
bears are terrifying.

194
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,107
Come on,

195
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,081
bath stuff. It's perfect!

196
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:05,946
You got a scented candle,
a cleansing buff,

197
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:08,657
spearmint and green tea scented
bath oil, promotes relaxation.

198
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,574
That presupposes Penny is tense.

199
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:13,769
She knows you. She's tense.
We all are. Buy a basket!

200
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:16,451
- Excuse me, we're ready.
- No, we're not.

201
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:20,422
Let's say for a moment that I accept
the bath item gift hypothesis,

202
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,921
I now lay the following
conundrum at your feet:

203
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:24,106
Which size?

204
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,476
This one. Let's go.

205
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:29,221
- You put no thought into that.
- I'm sorry.

206
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,400
This one. Let's go!

207
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:36,072
I have insufficient data to proceed.

208
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,436
Excuse me, miss?

209
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:40,981
If I were to give you
this gift basket,

210
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:43,521
based on that action alone
and no other data,

211
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:46,380
infer and describe
the hypothetical relationship

212
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,155
that exists between us.

213
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,111
Excuse me?

214
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,294
Here.

215
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,531
Now, are we friends?

216
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:57,353
Colleagues? Lovers?

217
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,459
Are you my grandmother?

218
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,619
I don't understand
what you're talking about

219
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,881
and you're making me
a little uncomfortable.

220
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,302
See? Sounds just like you and Penny.
We'll take it.

221
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:18,185
- Leonard. Come, join us.
- Hey, Dave.

222
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:20,519
And Penny, what a surprise.

223
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:23,958
Dave was just showing me
around the university.

224
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,567
This place is unbelievable!

225
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,875
I know, I've been offering to show
you around for a year and a half.

226
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,240
You always said you had yoga.

227
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,933
- I never said that.
- Maybe I heard you wrong.

228
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,093
A lot of words sound like "yoga."

229
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,917
This is an amazing woman.
She has a curious and agile mind,

230
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,003
not to mention being curious and agile
in other respects.

231
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:46,841
Shut up!

232
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:48,917
Yes, please shut up.

233
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,219
So... Dave,

234
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,830
don't you think you and I
should get back to the lab?

235
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,981
You know, that dark matter
isn't going to detect itself.

236
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,498
Actually, I was thinking about
taking the afternoon off

237
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:05,672
so I could work on another
experiment with Penny.

238
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:07,631
Really? We're going
to do an experiment?

239
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,262
We're going to explore
the effects of tequila shots

240
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:12,406
on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

241
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:15,743
It's not an experiment!
You saw what happened last night.

242
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,082
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

243
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:21,596
- Can I drive the motorcycle?
- Yeah, why not?

244
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,596
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

245
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,170
That's funny.

246
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:31,863
By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

247
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,892
Great news, Leonard.

248
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:59,114
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

249
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,588
Yippee.

250
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:04,672
You see, the danger was
that I might under or over-reciprocate,

251
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,543
but I have devised a foolproof plan.

252
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,463
See, I will open
her gift to me first

253
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:12,614
and then excuse myself,
feigning digestive distress.

254
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:13,758
Then...

255
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:15,851
I'll look up the price
of her gift online,

256
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:17,805
choose the basket
closest to that value,

257
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:19,431
give it to her

258
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,617
and then I'll return the others
for a full refund.

259
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,320
Brilliant.

260
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,256
It is, isn't it?

261
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:30,575
Is it okay if I hide them
in your room?

262
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,881
The smell makes me nauseated.

263
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,068
- Do whatever you want.
- Thank you, that's very gracious.

264
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:40,504
Gentlemen.

265
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,504
Why couldn't you have just done
what Leonard did

266
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,625
and get Penny a new boyfriend?

267
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:55,683
My leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

268
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,260
I have just one question for you.

269
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:12,543
While I am perfectly happy with the way
things are between us,

270
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:14,420
you said you didn't want
to go out with me

271
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:16,213
because I was too smart for you!

272
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,042
News flash, lady:

273
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,617
David Underhill is
ten times smarter than me!

274
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:22,963
You'd have to drive
a railroad spike into his brain

275
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,991
for me to beat him at checkers!

276
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:28,511
Next to him, I'm like one
of those sign-language gorillas

277
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,711
who knows how to ask for grapes!

278
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,330
So, my question is...

279
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:35,836
What's up with that?!

280
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,220
Why are you yelling at me?

281
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,757
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

282
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:44,532
Never mind, we're cool.

283
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,728
Dave is not smarter than you.
He's an idiot.

284
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,949
Really? Why would you say that?

285
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,597
Because a smart guy takes
the nude photos of his wife

286
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:57,024
off his cell phone
before he tries to take nude photos

287
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:58,491
of his girlfriend.

288
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:03,314
He tried to take nude photos of you?

289
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:05,763
That's what you took from that?!

290
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,112
The guy is married!

291
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:14,673
I'm so... Oh, that's terrible.

292
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:18,146
And you, if you are so okay
with the way things are between us,

293
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,593
why are you so jealous?

294
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,743
The important thing is
he's married and that's terrible!

295
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,031
Nice save, genius.

296
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:32,609
Eggnog?

297
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:33,734
Lactose.

298
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:38,779
It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog
like half an hour ago.

299
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:45,659
Smooth.

300
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,362
Smoother than you.

301
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,393
Come on, it's Christmas,
just give me this one.

302
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:58,399
Merry Christmas.

303
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,633
By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

304
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:17,401
Merry Christmas.
How's your leg?

305
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:19,936
Very good, thanks for asking.
Come on in.

306
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,783
Good, Penny,
you're here to exchange gifts.

307
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,944
You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared
for whatever you have to offer.

308
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:34,292
Okay, here.

309
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:41,453
I should note I'm having
some digestive distress,

310
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:47,277
so, if I excuse myself abruptly,
don't be alarmed.

311
00:17:57,296 --> 00:17:58,376
A napkin.

312
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,695
Turn it over.

313
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:09,745

"live long and prosper.

315
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,541
"Leonard Nimoy."

316
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,664
He came into the restaurant.

317
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:23,334
Sorry the napkin's dirty.
He wiped his mouth with it.

318
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:31,925
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!

319
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,320
Yeah, I guess.
But look, he signed it.

320
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,856
Do you realize what this means?!

321
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,329
All I need is a healthy ovum

322
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:52,804
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!

323
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:01,304
All I'm giving you
is the napkin, Sheldon.

324
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,429

327
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,346
- Very thoughtful.
- Yeah, and I checked.

328
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:24,753
Not letting the bike fall on you
while standing still

329
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:26,122
is lesson one.

330
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:30,538

00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,980
Sheldon! What did you do?!

334
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:01,964
I know!

335
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,026
It's not enough, is it?

336
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:09,075
Here.

337
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,615
Leonard, look!
Sheldon's hugging me.

338
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:28,938
