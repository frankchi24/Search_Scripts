1
00:00:00,419 --> 00:00:02,672
Let's see,
Raj was the kung pao–chicken.

2
00:00:02,947 --> 00:00:05,080
- I'm the dumplings.
- Yes, you are.

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,119
Creepy, Howard.

4
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,263
Creepy good or creepy bad?

5
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:13,647
Who was the shrimp
with lobster sauce?

6
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:17,167
That would be me.
Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

7
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:21,274
I'm not necessarily
talking to the food.

8
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:28,213
Sit over there.

9
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,588
Sit over there.

10
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:45,513
Baby wipe?

11
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:48,635
- Why do you have...
- No, don't ask! Don't!

12
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:51,504
I'll tell you why.

13
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:54,944
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university

14
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:58,102
replaced the paper towels
in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.

15
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,277
I thought the blowers
were more sanitary.

16
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:01,898
- Really, don't.
- Why...?

17
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:05,072
Hot air blowers
are incubators and spewers

18
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,973
of bacteria and pestilence.

19
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:08,593
Frankly, it'd be more hygienic

20
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:11,703
if they had a plague-infested gibbon
sneeze my hands dry.

21
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:15,135
Hey, guys, I just got
the most amazing news...

22
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:21,584
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

23
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:25,823
Okay, I'll just,

24
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,381
go eat by myself.

25
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,883
You don't have to do that.

26
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:32,095
It's okay, between him not talking,
him talking and him...

27
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,536
I'm better off alone.

28
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:39,435
Good-bye, you poor,
strange little man.

29
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:45,976
She's so considerate.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,516
What's your news?

31
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:50,379
Remember that little planetary object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper Belt?

32
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:52,678
Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ Sub-17.

33
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,087
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

34
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:59,011
Anyway, because of my discovery,
<i>People magazine </i>is naming me

35
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,999
one of their 30 under 30 to watch.

36
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,834
Congratulations.

37
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:04,458
That's incredible.

38
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:05,578
Excuse me,

39
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,648
30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

40
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,479
30 visionaries under 30 years of age

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,883
to watch as they challenge
the preconceptions of their fields.

42
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:19,510
If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

43
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:23,777
They've got me in with a guy who's doing
something about hunger in Indonesia,

44
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:26,862
and a psychotherapist who's using
dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners,

45
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,312
and Ellen Page,

46
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:30,909
star of the charming
independent film, <i>Juno</i>.

47
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,806
I'd so do her.

48
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:37,991
You'd do the dolphins.

49
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,289
Do I get an honorable
mention for designing

50
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,416
the telescope camera
mounting bracket you used?

51
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:46,628
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative

52
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,963
in which a humble boy from New Delhi

53
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,754
overcame poverty and prejudice

54
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,525
and journeyed to America
to reach for the stars.

55
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,729
Poverty?
Your father's a gynecologist.

56
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,256
He drives a Bentley.

57
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,641
It's a lease.

58
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,261
I'm confused.

59
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:06,979
Was there some sort
of peer review committee

60
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,275
to determine which scientists
would be included?

61
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,431
Peer review?
It's <i>People magazine</i>.

62
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,837
<i>People</i> picked me.

63
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:16,581
- What people?
- The people from <i>People</i>.

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,517
But exactly who are these people?
What are their credentials?

65
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,059
How are they qualified?

66
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,714
What makes accidentally
noticing a hunk of rock

67
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,855
that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years

68
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,825
more noteworthy than any other
scientific accomplishment

69
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,382
made by someone under 30?

70
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:36,302
Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

71
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,698
Are you proud of yourself?

72
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,521
In general, yes.

73
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,040
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

74
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,719
There's my missing neutrino.

75
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:20,623
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge,

76
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:23,220
weren't you,
you little sub-atomic dickens?

77
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,103
Hey, look,
I found my missing neutrino.

78
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:29,897
Oh good, we can take it
off the milk carton.

79
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:34,323
We're going to apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

80
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:35,987
Apologize for what?

81
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,616
He came over last night
with some pretty good news

82
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,325
and we weren't very supportive.

83
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:43,911
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

84
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:46,569
You were a colossal asshat.

85
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,924
No, I beg to differ.

86
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,005
Of the three of us, I was by far
the most supportive.

87
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:55,705
Really? Do tell.

88
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:59,635
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

89
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:01,512
When I was 11,

90
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:04,586
my sister bought our father
a "World's Greatest Dad" coffee mug

91
00:05:04,706 --> 00:05:07,593
and, frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

92
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:10,883
Okay, let's try it this way.

93
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:14,025
What if this <i>People magazine</i> thing
is the best he's ever gonna achieve?

94
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,236
I had not considered that.

95
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:18,738
Come on.

96
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,998
I often forget
other people have limitations.

97
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,462
It's so sad.

98
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:27,163
- He can feel sadness?
- Not really.

99
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:29,373
It's what you and I
would call condescension.

100
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:34,403
Now when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

101
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:35,615
But I'm not.

102
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:39,050
Well, then fake it.

103
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:41,413
Look at me.
I could be grinding on the fact

104
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,735
that without my stabilizing
telescope mount

105
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:47,725
he never would have found that stupid,
little clump of cosmic schmutz.

106
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:51,396
But I'm bigger than that.

107
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,523
Fine.
What do you want me to do?

108
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,399
Smile.

109
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,172
Crap, that's terrifying.

110
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:10,748
We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

111
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:14,668
Try less teeth.

112
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:21,755
Close enough.
Come on.

113
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,264
- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

114
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:28,558
We just wanted
to invite you out to dinner.

115
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:31,195
To celebrate your
"30 under 30" thing.

116
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:32,472
Right, Sheldon?

117
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:38,526
That's very nice of you.
I would like that.

118
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:40,350
Hello, boys.
Dr. Gablehauser.

119
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,090
- Dr. Koothrappali.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

120
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,839
- Dr. Hofstader.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

121
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,406
- Dr. Cooper.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

122
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:46,721
Mr. Wolowitz.

123
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:51,164
Boys, I've got a question for you:
Who in this room

124
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:52,725
discovered a star?

125
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,501
Actually, 2008-NQ Sub-17
is a planetary body.

126
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:58,184
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

127
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:00,537
You, my exotic young friend,

128
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:02,149
are my star.

129
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:06,114
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here,

130
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,930
much like he did
with 2008-NQ Sub-17.

131
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,100
Sorry.

132
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,511
Boy, we've got to get you
into a better office.

133
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,441
Something more suited
to your status.

134
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,189
You don't have to go to any trouble.

135
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,111
How about Von Gerlich's old office?

136
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,598
I'd rather have Fishbein's.
It's bigger.

137
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,548
Wait a minute,
I called dibs on Fishbein's office

138
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:30,616
the day he started showing up
at work in his bathrobe.

139
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:34,624
He gets a new office, I can't even get
paper towels in the men's room?

140
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,335
Damn, this is hard.

141
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:45,103
Let me ask you something.

142
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,939
What do you think
the business of this place is?

143
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,602
- Science?
- Money.

144
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:55,728
Told you.

145
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:59,534
And this boy's picture
in <i>People magazine</i>

146
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,817
is gonna raise us a pile
of money taller than...

147
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:04,320
well, taller than you.

148
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:07,782
I have a Master's degree.

149
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:09,204
Who doesn't?

150
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,384
Have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

151
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:17,008
I didn't even know there was
a president's dining room.

152
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:19,737
It's the same food
as the cafeteria, only fresh.

153
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,879
- Come on, little buddy.
- Okay, big buddy.

154
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,029
See you tonight, guys.

155
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,684
You can stop smiling now.

156
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,336
So anyway, after a fantastic lunch,

157
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:36,991
I was whisked off
to the <i>People magazine</i> photo shoot...

158
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,517
Have any of you boys
ever been to a photo shoot?

159
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,107
It's fantastic.

160
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,106
Apparently,
the camera loves me and I, it.

161
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:50,004
They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this.

162
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:58,092
They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

163
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:00,876
They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

164
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,231
Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

165
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:10,086
Excuse me.
Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

166
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,584
Go for Koothrappali.

167
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,097
They gave him an assistant?

168
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:17,609
If I want a new pen, I have to go
to the bank with wire cutters.

169
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:21,010
Have we at this point
met our social obligations?

170
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,023
Not yet.

171
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:23,776
Okay, just put it on my calendar,

172
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,903
but start thinking of a reason
why I can't go.

173
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,867
All righty?
Koothrappali out.

174
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:31,223
God bless that boy.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

175
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:32,992
You just got him this afternoon.

176
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:36,064
Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

177
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:38,245
A lackey?

178
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,071
I'm sorry.
Is that politically incorrect?

179
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,578
In India, we just call them
untouchables.

180
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:45,117
- Now?
- Almost.

181
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:49,180
Speaking of untouchables,
I've got great news for you guys.

182
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:52,760
<i>People magazine</i> is having
a reception this Saturday

183
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,555
and I managed to get you invited.

184
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,181
- Gee, thanks.
- You're welcome.

185
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:59,995
Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section

186
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:01,740
because, you know, that's for VIPs

187
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,122
and you guys are just,
you know... P's.

188
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:08,832
There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea

189
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:11,138
where, when a hunter
flaunts his success

190
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:13,483
to the rest of the village,
they kill him

191
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:16,636
and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

192
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,371
Superstious nonsense, of course,

193
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:20,394
but one can see their point.

194
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:31,007
Here you go, Raj.
You might want to drink this one slowly.

195
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:34,136
So, Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

196
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:37,515
Gee, I'd love to, Raj,
but I can't make it.

197
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,257
No, I could...

198
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:48,689
I can make it. But I won't.

199
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:51,205
What are you talking about?

200
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,940
There's a reception
for my magazine article on Saturday.

201
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,569
And you guys aren't going?

202
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:59,147
I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment

203
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,341
and you're not even going
to support him?

204
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:04,671
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered

205
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,878
were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

206
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:12,098
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

207
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,838
Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in <i>People magazine</i>,

208
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,181
and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

209
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,942
Would you like to go with me?

210
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,395
Of course I would.
I would be honored.

211
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:25,938
Really? Cool.

212
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:27,970
Shame on you guys.

213
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,453
Look at that,
I got a date with Penny.

214
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:36,449
I can't believe
it took you a whole year.

215
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,741
- Now?
- Now.

216
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,670
Hey, buddy,

217
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,669
I'm going to be
in <i>People magazine</i>.

218
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,070
Yeah, call me
when you're on the cover.

219
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,318
Raj, look at you!

220
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,822
I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

221
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:13,151
Yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

222
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,694
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo.

223
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:18,181
I have a limo.
I just love saying "limo."

224
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,994
- Sip on it while you're getting ready.
- I'm ready.

225
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,663
That's what you're wearing?

226
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,417
Why, what's wrong with it?

227
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,933
Nothing. I was just hoping
for something a little more, you know,

228
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,522
ridonkulous.

229
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,085
Yeah. Well, this is all the donkulous
you're gonna get tonight.

230
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:47,306
Okey-dokey, let's roll.

231
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,648
All right, it's time
to raise the roof!

232
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,527
- Hey, Leonard.
- Dude.

233
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,130
You look very nice.

234
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,406
Thank you.

235
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,234
- Come on. Good night.
- Good night.

236
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,829
Hey, Leonard, do you
see my limo downstairs?

237
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,541
It's bigger than the house
my grandfather grew up in.

238
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,252
- Terrific.
- It has more food, too.

239
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,218
Come on. Come on.

240
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:28,226
Good news. You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

241
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:32,057
There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

242
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,666
Anything-for-a-greencard.com?

243
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:41,493
I'll lend you my user name.
It's "Wealthy Big Penis."

244
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,604
You're joking.

245
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,688
You gotta make it easy for 'em.
They're just learning English.

246
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:50,297
Pass.

247
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,418
So you're just gonna
sit around here and mope

248
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:55,700
while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E Mart?

249
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,508
It's not a date,
and that's racist.

250
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,926
It can't be racist.

251
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,226
He's a beloved character
on <i>The Simpsons</i>.

252
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:07,080
Let's just eat
so I can get to bed.

253
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,499
With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

254
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,801
Did you ask for the chicken
with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?

255
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,008
Even though the menu description
specifies "shredded"?

256
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:21,583
Brown rice, not white?

257
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:24,132
Did you stop at the Korean grocery
and get the good hot mustard?

258
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:26,428
Did you pick up the low sodium
soy sauce from the market?

259
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:28,370
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

260
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,425
What took you so long?

261
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,171
- Just sit down and eat.
- Fine.

262
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,550
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

263
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,163
I want you to check
before you accept the order.

264
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,283
Sorry.

265
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:49,026
Were you distracted by the possibility
that Koothrappali

266
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,352
might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

267
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:56,171
He's not going to have
intercourse with Penny.

268
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,615
Then there's no excuse
for this chicken.

269
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,748
You know, this situation
with Koothrappali

270
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,157
brings to mind
a story from my childhood.

271
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:08,174
Oh, goody, more tales
from the panhandle.

272
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,868
That's northwest Texas.
I'm from east Texas,

273
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:14,001
the Gulf region,
home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

274
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:17,169
Do the shrimpers feature
in your story?

275
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:22,861
Anyway,
when I was eight,

276
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:27,072
a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat Lucky.

277
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,016
- Lucky?
- Yes, Lucky.

278
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,653
He's irony-impaired.
Just move on.

279
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,691
Dead cat named Lucky.
Continue.

280
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,567
While others mourned Lucky,

281
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,612
I realized his untimely demise

282
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,012
provided me with the opportunity
to replace him

283
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,240
with something more suited
to my pet needs:

284
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,517
a faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night,

285
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:52,972
yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

286
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:56,629
So not a puppy?

287
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,253
Please, nothing so pedestrian.

288
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,429
I wanted a griffin.

289
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:04,337
A griffin?

290
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,760
Yes, half eagle, half lion.

291
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:09,276
And mythological.

292
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,099
Irrelevant.

293
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,853
I was studying
recombinant DNA technology,

294
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,987
and I was confidant I could create one,
but my parents were unwilling

295
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:21,804
to secure the necessary
eagle eggs and lion semen.

296
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:27,549
Of course, my sister got swimming
lessons when she wanted them.

297
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:34,094
Not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion semen story,

298
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:38,370
- but what's your point?
- My point is

299
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,129
if Koothrappali is moving on

300
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,344
to a new life
of shallow undeserved fame,

301
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:46,467
perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

302
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:49,016
You want to breed a new friend?

303
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,723
That's one option,
but who has the time?

304
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:56,435
But consider this--
the Japanese are doing

305
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,717
some wonderful work
with artificial intelligence.

306
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,224
Now, you combine that
with some animatronics

307
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,050
from the imagineers over at Disney,

308
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,965
next thing you know,
we're playing Halo

309
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:06,930
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

310
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,251
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

311
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,628
That may well be, but the fact is

312
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,789
it wouldn't kill us
to meet some new people.

313
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,875
For the record, it could kill us
to meet new people.

314
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:25,348
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

315
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,705
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

316
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:35,765
If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.

317
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:38,904
- A guy who has your back.
- And he should have a lot of money

318
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,147
and live in a cool place by the beach
where we could throw parties.

319
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:45,662
- And share our love of technology.
- And he should know a lot of women.

320
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,793
Let's see, money,
women, technology.

321
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:52,324
Okay, we're agreed.
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

322
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,070
Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

323
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:05,921
It's very nice.
Good night.

324
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,132
- Wait. The evening's not over.
- Yes, it is.

325
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:11,433
No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

326
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:15,305
Is the evening over?

327
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:16,871
Wait, wait, wait!

328
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:19,077
That's my mommy and daddy
calling from India.

329
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,062
- I want you to meet my parents.
- Wait. Meet them?

330
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,859
Hello, Mommy, Daddy.
Good to see you.

331
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,814
How are you?
I'm not drunk.

332
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,146
- <i>Why would you say that?</i>
- Just making conversation.

333
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:36,368
Mommy, Daddy, I want you
to meet my new squeeze, Penny.

334
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,073
I'm not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

335
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:42,124
<i>I can't see her.
Center her in the frame.</i>

336
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,029
Here you go. Cute, huh?

337
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:46,818
<i>She's not Indian.</i>

338
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:50,244
<i>So she's not Indian.
The boy is just sowing some wild oats.</i>

339
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,426
There's no sowing, no squeezing
and no sucking face.

340
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:56,367
<i>What if he gets her pregnant?</i>

341
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:59,765
<i>Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?</i>

342
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,978
What right do you have to pick
with whom I can have children with?

343
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,509
<i>Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America.</i>

344
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,603
<i>You want to try
the "local cuisine."</i>

345
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:11,709
<i>Trust me.
You don't want it for a steady diet.</i>

346
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:15,074
Now you listen to me.
I am no longer a child

347
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,187
and I will not be
spoken to like one.

348
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,786
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

349
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,666
- <i>What's wrong with him?</i>
- I don't know.

350
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:26,716
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

351
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:34,969
Well, it's nice to meet you.

352
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,055
I'm just gonna
set you on down over here.

353
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,098
And I'm gonna leave, so...

354
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:41,404
<i>namaste.</i>

355
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,052
And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

356
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:51,963
She's feisty.

357
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,738
I like that.

358
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,061
Raj, what are you doing?

359
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,381
No notes. If you have
something to say to me, say it.

360
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:28,892
Sorry.

361
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,360
Sweetie, it's okay.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
