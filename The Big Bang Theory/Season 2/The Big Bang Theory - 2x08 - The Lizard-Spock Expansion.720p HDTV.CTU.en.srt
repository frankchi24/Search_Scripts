1
00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:01,943
Oh, look,
<i>Saturn 3</i> is on.

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:04,806
I don't want to watch <i>Saturn 3</i>.
<i>Deep Space Nine</i> is better.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,261
How is <i>Deep Space Nine</i>
better than <i>Saturn 3</i>?

4
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:11,973
Simple subtraction
will tell you it's six better.

5
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,001
Compromise. Watch <i>Babylon 5</i>.

6
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:19,940
In what sense is that a compromise?

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,359
Well, five is partway
between three... Never mind.

8
00:00:24,897 --> 00:00:27,280
I'll tell you what.
How about we go rock-paper-scissors?

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,997
I don't think so.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,239
Anecdotal evidence suggests
that in the game of rock-paper-scissors,

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,898
players familiar with each other
will tie 75 to 80% of the time

12
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:38,041
due to the limited number
of outcomes.

13
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:41,430
I suggest
rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.

14
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,426
- What?
- It's very simple.

15
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,669
Scissors cuts paper.
Paper covers rock.

16
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,164
Rock crushes lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock.

17
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:54,222
Spock smashes scissors.
Scissors decapitates lizard.

18
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,570
Lizard eats paper.
Paper disproves Spock.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,127
Spock vaporizes rock.

20
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:01,171
And as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

21
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,811
Okay, I think I got it.

22
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:10,376
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock!

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,623
Hello, boys.

24
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:22,266
Ahoy, matey.

25
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:25,466
Noticed the eye patch, did you?

26
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,173
It's all part of a technique
I've been studying for picking up women.

27
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:30,969
You employ a visual display

28
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:34,765
designed to make yourself
distinctive and memorable.

29
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:38,879
Oh, yes, like the male peacock
with brilliant plumage

30
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,701
or the rutting baboon
with engorged hindquarters.

31
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,752
Or in this case,
the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.

32
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,906
Mock me if you will,
but it works.

33
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,077
You show up at a club
in something distinctive,

34
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:53,294
scope out your target
and toss out some negs.

35
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,846
- What are negs?
- A neg is a negative compliment

36
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,829
that throws a pretty woman
off her game,

37
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,221
like "Normally,
I'm not turned on by big teeth,

38
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,877
but on you, they work."

39
00:02:04,547 --> 00:02:07,255
I got a whole list of 'em.
Who wants to be my wingman?

40
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:11,036
You're not gonna need a wingman.
You're gonna need a paramedic.

41
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:14,008
Your scooter's blocking my car.

42
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,555
Did you get pinkeye again?

43
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,228
Step one:
she notices the eye patch.

44
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:23,814
May I say, Penny,

45
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:26,119
not a lot of women
could look as hot as you do

46
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,729
with such greasy hair?

47
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:37,389
Just move your stupid scooter

48
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,081
before I pick it up
and throw it in the dumpster.

49
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:05,313
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

50
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,383
I'm sorry, but I'm not going
to watch <i>The Clone Wars</i> TV series

51
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:17,691
until I've seen
<i>The Clone Wars</i> movie.

52
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:23,053
I prefer to let George Lucas
disappoint me in the order he intended.

53
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,375
I want to watch it now.

54
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:29,468
Then I believe we've arrived
at another quintessential

55
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:31,960
rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock moment.

56
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,338
Watch whatever you want.

57
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,132
I saw what you did there.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,310
What'd I do?

59
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,324
What's wrong?

60
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,583
- Okay, we'll be right there.
- What happened?

61
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:00,160
Howard's at the Mars Rover lab.
He says he's in trouble.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,351
Defcon 5.

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,613
Defcon 5?

64
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,772
Well, there's no need to rush.

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,362
- What?
- Defcon 5 means "no danger."

66
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,933
Defcon 1 is a crisis.

67
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,421
How can 5
not be worse than 1?

68
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:14,423
<i>Star Trek V</i> worse than <i>I</i>.

69
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,690
First of all, that's a comparison
of quality, not intensity.

70
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,624
Secondly, <i>Star Trek I</i>
is orders-of-magnitude worse

71
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:24,087
than <i>Star Trek V</i>.

72
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:26,780
Are you joking?
<i>Star Trek V</i> is the standard

73
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
against which all badness
is measured.

74
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,940
No, no.

75
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:33,762
<i>Star Trek V</i> has specific failures
in writing and direction,

76
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,764
while <i>Star Trek I</i>
fails across the board:

77
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:38,500
art direction, costuming,
music, sound editing.

78
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:41,807
Can we just forget I said Defcon
and go?

79
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,745
<i>Star Trek V</i>.

80
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:49,184
Will you at least stipulate

81
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:52,410
that <i>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</i>
is inarguably the best?

82
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,756
I have three words for you:
Wrath of Khan.

83
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:58,969
- Thank God, you're here.
- What's the emergency?

84
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,538
I got the Mars Rover
stuck in a ditch.

85
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,538
Where?

86
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:05,973
On a dusty highway
just outside Bakersfield.

87
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,900
Where do you think?
On Mars!

88
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:10,189
Is everything okay?

89
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,417
Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.

90
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,862
You brought a girl
to the Mars Rover control room?

91
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,630
Yeah, I picked her up in the bar.
She's a doctor.

92
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,078
One free barium enema,

93
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:23,410
and my mother won't care
she's not Jewish.

94
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:27,539
Wait a minute.
So the eye patch and the insults worked?

95
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:31,168
No, there were three other guys
with eye patches. It was a fiasco.

96
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,715
What did work was, "How'd you like
to visit a secret government facility?"

97
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:38,873
So what exactly
do you want us to do?

98
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,053
You and Raj help me
get the Rover out of the ditch

99
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,461
and you get Stephanie out
before somebody notices her.

100
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:45,512
- She doesn't exactly have clearance.
- Really?

101
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:47,642
They don't let strange
women from honky-tonks

102
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:51,188
come in and play with $200 million
government projects on distant planets?

103
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,036
Yes, I was bad.
Maybe she'll spank me.

104
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:55,399
Can we please move on?

105
00:05:57,496 --> 00:06:00,821
It's getting late,
so do I get to drive this thing or what?

106
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,801
No. I'm sorry,
but something's come up.

107
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,489
Kind of a Mars Rover...

108
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:08,817
Mars Rover
can Howard come over...

109
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,876
situation.

110
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,546
So my friend Leonard
is gonna take you home.

111
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:20,216
Okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.

112
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:24,485
- I'll call ya.
- So are you a scientist like Howard?

113
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,897
No one's a scientist like Howard.

114
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,629
My mother is so gonna love her.

115
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:34,775
How nice. Maybe they can carpool
when they visit you in federal prison.

116
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:44,156
I'm sorry.
I totally interrupted you.

117
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:45,532
What were you saying?

118
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,715
Just said Howard's a terrific guy.

119
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,636
He's got a great sense of humor.

120
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,025
He loves his mother...

121
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,249
a lot.

122
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:56,962
People say "too much."

123
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,880
I really like
that you're such a loyal friend.

124
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:01,702
Yeah, I am loyal.

125
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,426
If you look at the big picture.

126
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:12,519
Out of curiosity,
did he ever have a shot with you?

127
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,579
Are you insane?
The guy was wearing an eye patch.

128
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,859
Then why did you...?

129
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,512
He said that I could drive a car...
on Mars.

130
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,068
Got it.

131
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:26,821
So, can I see you again?

132
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,392
You're not gonna see me now.

133
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:33,588
Cool.

134
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:40,879
Anything?

135
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:44,238
Actually, I was just
checking my e-mail.

136
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,860
But, no,
the Rover is not responding.

137
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,790
I believe the appropriate metaphor here
involves a river of excrement

138
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,452
and a Native American water vessel
without any means of propulsion.

139
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:58,497
Hang on.
There's got to be other options.

140
00:07:58,714 --> 00:08:00,458
You could try calling Triple-A.

141
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:04,820
But based on NASA's latest timetable,
they won't get there for 35 years.

142
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,898
Plus I understand
you have to be standing

143
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:10,596
next to the vehicle
with your card when they arrive.

144
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Oh, snap.

145
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:14,529
Snap what?

146
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,502
- I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
- What's Plan B?

147
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:20,462
Erase hard drives,
scrap surveillance tapes,

148
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:23,178
wipe our fingerprints
off every surface and run.

149
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:25,088
Why wasn't that Plan A?

150
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:31,041
<i>A NASA spokesman states
that due to the loss of data,</i>

151
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,983
<i>they will most likely be unable
to determine the cause</i>

152
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,057
<i>of the Mars Rover's malfunction.</i>

153
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:40,877
Thank God for Plan B.

154
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:45,454
Didn't you say
you worked on the Mars Rover?

155
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:46,954
No, you're mistaken.

156
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,424
When we first met,

157
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:52,326
you said that if I went out with you,
I could drive a car on Mars.

158
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,331
I don't know
what you're talking about.

159
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:03,403
Will you all excuse me?
Leonard is subtly signaling

160
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,923
that he'd like
to talk to me in private.

161
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,794
No. I remember specifically.

162
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,965
You started by asking
if I was from Mars

163
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,272
because my ass
was out of this world.

164
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,561
That does sound like me,
but no.

165
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,491
Is there some problem?

166
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:26,193
Listen, I have to kinda
sneak out for a while.

167
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:28,951
- All right, good-bye.
- No, wait!

168
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,541
If anyone asks you where I went,
you don't know.

169
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,475
- Where are you going?
- I can't tell you that.

170
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:37,774
Who would ask me?

171
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,019
I can't tell you that, either.

172
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:45,087
You brought me in here to inform me
you can't tell me where you're going

173
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:47,627
and you can't tell me
who might ask?

174
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:52,081
Yeah, I really didn't
think this through.

175
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:56,135
- Leonard, a moment.
- What?

176
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:58,813
If someone, and of course,
we don't know who this would be,

177
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,270
does ask where you've gone,
what should I say?

178
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:03,689
I don't know.
Just tell 'em I went to the office.

179
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,607
- Are you going to the office?
- No.

180
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,609
Then how can I say it convincingly?

181
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,987
Just say,
"Leonard went to the office."

182
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:13,395
All right.
Leonard went to the office.

183
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,124
What is...? No, not like that!

184
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,994
- Just, "Leonard went to the office."
- It would've worked out a lot better

185
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,336
if you'd just told me
you were going to the office.

186
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,450
I'm going to the office.

187
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,467
See? Why don't I believe you?

188
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm going out for a while.

189
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:51,069
Doesn't anyone want to know
where he's going?

190
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:54,406
Okay, where is he going?

191
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:56,796
Leonard is going to the office.

192
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,433
- So how was work today?
- Busy.

193
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:15,552
I removed an appendix,
a gall bladder

194
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,819
and about a foot
and a half of bowel.

195
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:21,692
I'm hoping that was
three different guys.

196
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:24,568
No, just the one.

197
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:27,562
He didn't make it.

198
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,859
So, how was your day?

199
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:34,967
You know, I'm a physicist, so...
I thought about stuff.

200
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:37,908
That's it?

201
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,514
I wrote some of it down.

202
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:43,861
- Are you done eating?
- Yeah.

203
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,288
Good.

204
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,997
If I knew you were waiting,
I would've swallowed that lasagna whole.

205
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:58,120
<i>You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.
Leave a message.</i>

206
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,219
<i>It's me again, Howard.</i>

207
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,580
<i>If you're free Friday,</i>

208
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,118
<i>maybe we could have
a little something to eat at my place.</i>

209
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,155
<i>My mom cooks a hell of a brisket.</i>

210
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:10,177

00:12:10,603 --> 00:12:11,676
<i>It's Howard.</i>

212
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,196
I've had her brisket.
Melts in your mouth.

213
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,873
Maybe we should think
about going to the bedroom.

214
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:25,247
Good idea.

215
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:28,450
There's a bed in there,
and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.

216

<i>You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,768

00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:55,492
<i>It's Howard.</i>

225
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,990
Don't you think we should tell him
you're not interested?

226
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:03,835
Do you want me to stop
and call him back right now?

227
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,202
Dear God, no!

235

<i>We're not going

236
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,927
<i>Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.</i>

239
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,348
- New shirts?
- Yeah, a couple.

240
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:02,808
- Nice.
- Thank you.

241
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:04,534
So, who's the girl?

242
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,558
I'm sorry?

243
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:10,519
Well, last time you bought a new shirt
was when we were dating.

244
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,915
So what we did
was in fact dating?

245
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,359
Well, yeah, we did have a date.

246
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,861
Exactly. Thank you.

247
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,240
Do me a favor, tell Koothrappali that
next time you see him.

248
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,368
So, who is she?

249
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,845
- She's a doctor.
- Nice.

250
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,586
A doctor doctor,
or a you kind of doctor?

251
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:34,744
Doctor doctor.

252
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,177
Surgical resident.

253
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:37,760
Smart, pretty.

254
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:42,076
Let me ask you something.

255
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:45,638
If your friend thinks
he's dating someone,

256
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,346
but he's not because, in fact,
you're dating her,

257
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,225
does that make you a bad person?

258
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:52,436
- That depends.
- On what?

259
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,424
Is that friend Wolowitz?

260
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:58,609
Screw him. You're fine.

261
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,696
Are you sure?

262
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,990
Well, have you slept
with her yet?

263
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,138
You dog!

264
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:11,497
Good for you.

265
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,048
- Does that change things?
- No.

266
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:17,503
- So why'd you ask?
- I'm nosy.

267
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,099
See ya.

268
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,937
Howard, get the door!

269
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:31,324
Really? Is that what you do
when someone knocks?!

270
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:33,375
Thank you. I had no idea!

271
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:39,691
Hey, buddy. What brings you
to my little slice of hell?

272
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:41,945
Who is it?!

273
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:43,779
It's Leonard!

274
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,473
You're gonna have to play outside!

275
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:48,978
I'm not dressed to receive!

276
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,081
No one cares, Ma!

277
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:53,685
So, what's up?

278
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,459
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

279
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,422
Momentito.

280
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:03,465
Yello.

281
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:07,136
Thanks for calling me back.
I was worried...

282
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:21,323
No, I understand.

283
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:23,359
Sure, we can be friends.
Absolutely.

284
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,822
Thanks for calling.

285
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:27,199
You have a nice day, too.

286
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:30,451
You are dead to me.

287
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:38,702
Who gets the extra dumpling?

288
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,966
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.

289
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:52,157
Okay, one of us is going to have
to stop putting up Spock.

290
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:53,891
How do we decide that?

291
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:01,649
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

292
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:04,068
Hi, Howard.

293
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,582
Howard is employing
a schoolyard paradigm

294
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:15,639
in which you are,
for all intents and purposes, deceased.

295
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,877
He intends to act on this
by not speaking to you,

296
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,230
feigning an inability to hear you
when you speak

297
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,139
and otherwise refusing
to acknowledge your existence.

298
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,425
That's just ridiculous.
Why are you cooperating with him?

299
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:30,928
I don't make the rules, Leonard.

300
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:35,099
Howard, come on.
I didn't plan on this.

301
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:36,660
These things just happen.

302
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,117
Usually not to me,
but they do happen.

303
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:43,067
Did someone just feel
a cold breeze?

304
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:46,610
I believe this is an extension
of the death metaphor.

305
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:50,172
The cold breeze is the so-called
ectoplasmic issue

306
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,116
of a disembodied soul passing by.

307
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:55,910
Screw it.
I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.

308
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,252
- Come on in.
- Is this a bad time?

309
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,547
Yes, but I don't see
a better one on the horizon.

310
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:10,538
If it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.

311
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,633
I'm sorry, you violated
the terms of your metaphor

312
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:18,847
by acknowledging her existence.
I'm out.

313
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:22,551
He just won't listen to me.

314
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:25,466
Okay, I guess it'll just be
the three of us then.

315
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,941
Lisa's gonna be disappointed.

316
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:29,676
Lisa?

317
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:33,206
My roommate. She just went through
a really bad breakup,

318
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:36,035
I thought she might like
to meet somebody fun like you.

319
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,393
Leonard, Stephanie,
you're alive!

320
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:40,710
It's a miracle!

321
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,534
So, anyway, Lisa,
I just wanted to tell you again

322
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:48,496
how much I enjoyed the other night,

323
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:50,841
and again,
I'm sorry for how it ended.

324
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,517
But again, if you could
let me know about Friday.

325
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:57,058
My mother needs a head count

326
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,292
so she can know
how big a brisket to get.

327
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:01,893
Howard, look at this.

328
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,158
Anyway, call me.

329
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:04,519
It's Howard.

330
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:09,444
<i>It's unclear how the Mars Rover
got into the crevice,</i>

331
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,356
<i>but one thing's certain:</i>

332
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:12,989
<i>the data which it has sent back</i>

333
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:15,303
<i>contain the first clear indications</i>

334
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:17,652
<i>that there may have been
life on Mars.</i>

335
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:21,287
<i>It's a scientific discovery</i>

336
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,149
<i>that has staggering implications
for all mankind.</i>

337
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,783
<i>Unfortunately, we'll never know
who's responsible.</i>

338
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,842
Son of a bitch.
