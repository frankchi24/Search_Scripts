1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,273
Knight to queen's bishop-five.

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,737
Very nice.
What's Leonard going to do?

3
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:08,092
Give up the pawn
or give up the position?

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,410
Let's find out.

5
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:11,301
Ready?

6
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:12,952
Ready.

7
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:14,705
Go.

8
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,333
Damn it. I slipped.

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,258
Too bad. You know the rules
of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess.

10
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,529
Leonard died again,
Sheldon. You're up.

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,545
Despite my deep love of chess,
lasers and aerosol disinfectant,

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,719
I must forfeit.

13
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,721
- Why?
- Because it's almost 11:00.

14
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,051
So?

15
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,514
Penny has a "don't knock
on my door before 11:00

16
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:01,853
or I punch you in the throat" rule.

17
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:08,024
You know what'd be a great idea?

18
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:12,135
We get some girls over here
and play Laser Optical Strip Chess.

19
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,835
Believe me, any girl
who would be willing to play that,

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,860
you don't want to see naked.

21
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,325
You underestimate me.

22
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:33,981
Hey, Sheldon.

23
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:38,504
- It's 11:00 a.m.
- I know. You're safe.

24
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:41,392
This package came
while you were at work.

25
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,227
Great, my rhinestones.
Thank you.

26
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,592
- Excuse me.
- What?

27
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,317
You have to sign this.

28
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:49,333
- What is it?
- When I signed for the package,

29
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,893
I was deputized
by the United Parcel Service

30
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,781
and entrusted with its final delivery.
I now need you to acknowledge

31
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,862
receipt of the package so that I'm
fully indemnified and no longer liable.

32
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,643
It's just a box of rhinestones.

33
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,776
The contents are irrelevant.
A legal bailment has been created.

34
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:06,541
Does that mean nothing to you?

35
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,212
It means nothing to anybody.

36
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:14,132
- Let me show you what I'm doing.
- "Bailment" describes a relationship

37
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,322
in common law where a physical
possession of personal property,

38
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:20,214
or "chattels," is transferred
from one person, the bailor,

39
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:21,933
to another person, the bailee...

40
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,352
Look, look!
I started a business.

41
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,209
Obviously, not a cleaning business.

42
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,394
No, I'm making flower barrettes.
See?

43
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,026
I call them Penny Blossoms.

44
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,530
I made one for myself,
then all the girls at work wanted one.

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,825
I showed some to this lady
who runs a shop in Old Town.

46
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,723
She sells cards and homemade jewelry.
She said she wanted to sell them.

47
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:44,600
I said, "Okay."
And in one week, I made a $156.

48
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:46,835
Good for you. Sign here.

49
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,551
Don't you get it? If this takes off,
I won't have to be a waitress anymore.

50
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:57,175
But then who will bring me
my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,290
- Another waitress.
- What's her name?

52
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:01,848
I don't know.

53
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,017
And you're going to let her
handle my food?

54
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,006
Nancy. Her name is Nancy.

55
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,104
I think you're just making that up.

56
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:10,905
I'm sorry about your hamburger.

57
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,526
I just don't want to be a waitress
for the rest of my life.

58
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:15,611
Cheeseburger.
I get a cheeseburger.

59
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:19,335
- Fine, cheeseburger.
- Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.

60
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:23,286
So, what do you think?
I mean, this could be a business, right?

61
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,653
How many of these
can you make a day?

62
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:27,874
About 20.

63
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:31,349
And how much profit do you make per...
Penny Blossom?

64
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,880
Like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.

65
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,298
Of course you're not.
All right...

66
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,385
Ten dollars a day
times five days a week

67
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,481
times 52 weeks a year is $2,600.

68
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,427
- That's all?
- Before taxes.

69
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:48,518
I don't have to pay taxes
on this stuff.

70
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,439
I believe the Internal Revenue Service
would strongly disagree.

71
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,026
But, if you took advantage
of modern marketing techniques,

72
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,330
and you optimized
your manufacturing process,

73
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,406
you might be able to make
this a viable business.

74
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,325
And you know about that stuff?

75
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,389
I'm a physicist.
I have a working knowledge

76
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:13,773
of the entire universe
and everything it contains.

77
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:18,049
Who's Radiohead?

78
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:34,631
I have a working knowledge
of the important things in the universe.

79
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,117
- Good luck.
- Sheldon, hold on.

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,364
Could you maybe show me how
to make more money with this?

81
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,684
Of course I could.

82
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:45,654
Wait!

83
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,620
Will you?

84
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,443
Just to be clear here,

85
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,795
you're asking for my assistance.

86
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:00,924
And you understand that will involve
me telling you what to do?

87
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,494
I understand.

88
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,224
And you're not allowed to be sarcastic
or snide to me while I'm doing so.

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Good.

90
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:15,871
Let's begin with the premise

91
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,191
that everything you've done
up to this point is wrong.

92
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:22,822
- Oh, imagine that.
- Sarcasm. Good-bye.

93
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,948
No, sorry. Wait!
Please come back!

94
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,219
Subtitles: The FW Team

95
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:53,978
- There. Done.
- All right.

96
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,898
12 minutes and 17 seconds.

97
00:05:57,262 --> 00:06:00,345
- Pretty good, right?
- That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour.

98
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,448
Based on your cost of materials
and your wholesale selling price,

99
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:07,278
you'll effectively be paying yourself...
$5.19 a day.

100
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:09,911
"A day"?

101
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,080
There are children in a sneaker factory
in Indonesia who outearn you.

102
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:16,833
That just can't be right.

103
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,587
- You're questioning my math?
- No, sorry.

104
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:22,048
- Want me to show my work?
- God, no.

105
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,393
Please tell me what to do about it.

106
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,999
All right. Are you familiar
with the development

107
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:31,118
that resulted from Honoré Blanc's
1778 use of interchangeable parts?

108
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:37,968
The assembly line, of course.

109
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:42,151
If I'm not allowed to be snide,
you're not allowed to be condescending.

110
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:45,696
That wasn't a part of our original
agreement, and I don't agree to it now.

111
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:47,335
Fine.

112
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,701
How are we supposed to set up machines
and conveyor belts in my apartment?

113
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,659
You're thinking of the moving
assembly line,

114
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:55,498
an understandable
but not excusable mistake.

115
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,457
The moving assembly line, that
was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908.

116
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,936
That innovation is what made possible
our modern consumer culture

117
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,772
by enabling a low-unit cost
for manufactured goods.

118
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:10,697
I guess that isn't one of the topics
discussed on your Radiohead.

119
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,733
Let's go. We're going to miss
the coming attractions.

120
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,302
What's the matter?

121
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:26,647
I think I bruised a testicle
capturing that last pawn.

122
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,327
<i>Please pay attention
and listen to me</i>

123
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:36,998
<i>Give me some time
to blow the man down</i>

124
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:40,042
<i>I'm a deepwater sailor
just come from Hong Kong</i>

125
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:43,152
<i>To me way, hey,
blow the man down</i>

126
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:46,338
<i>If you give me some whiskey
I'll sing you a song</i>

127
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,176
<i>Give me some time
to blow the man down.</i>

128
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:50,344
Hello?

129
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,098
Hello.

130
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,058
<i>Come quickly lay aft
To the break of the poop</i>

131
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:59,418
<i>To me way, hey,
blow the man down</i>

132
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:02,231
<i>Or I'll help you along
with the toe of my boot</i>

133
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:05,659
<i>Give me some time
to blow the man down.</i>

134
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:06,902
What's going on?

135
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:09,601
I assume you're referring
to the sea shanty.

136
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:12,598
It's a rhythmic work song
designed to increase productivity.

137
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,333
It's crazy, but it totally works.

138
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,121
We made this Penny Blossom
in under three minutes.

139
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,399
Terrific, but that kind of raises
more questions than it answers.

140
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,118
Penny's making hair accessories.

141
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,536
I'm helping her optimize
her manufacturing process.

142
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:27,697
Break's over.

143
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:30,479
<i>Pay attention to orders
now you one and all...</i>

144
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:32,720
Hold on. What are you
using as a bonding agent?

145
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:34,634
- Hot glue.
- You're kidding.

146
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,099
Any of the cyanoacrylates
would do a better job.

147
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,641
The flower's too porous.

148
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,131
What if we infused the bottom layer

149
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:43,564
with silicone-RTV to provide
a better mounting surface?

150
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,091
Intriguing.

151
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:48,568
What are your marketing
and distribution channels?

152
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:52,087
There are the waitresses at my work,
and this cute, little shop in Old Town.

153
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,862
Virtually non-existent.

154
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,731
I'm thinking that we set her up with
a hosted e-commerce system to start.

155
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,414
Why not eliminate the middle man?

156
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,666
We could install a small server farm
with a static IP in her bedroom.

157
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,419
With an industrial cooling system.

158
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,731
Of course, but before we set up
marketing and distribution,

159
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:11,299
we should finish optimizing
the manufacturing process.

160
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:13,711
To start with,
she has a terrible problem

161
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:16,136
with moisture-induced glitter clump.

162
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:18,849
Yeah, it's a bitch.

163
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:23,486
I've seen this before.

164
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:27,321
- Where?
- It's a common stripper problem.

165
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:32,422
They dance, they sweat, they clump.

166
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,620
Are you thinking about adding
a desiccant like calcium sulfate?

167
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:43,624
Actually, I'm thinking
about this one stripper named Vega.

168
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:49,074
But sure, calcium sulfate
could work.

169
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,543
Let's think
out of the box for a moment.

170
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,468
How about a molecular sieve?

171
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,206
I've got a spaghetti strainer
in the kitchen.

172
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:10,484
We could liberate some micro-porous
charcoal from the chem lab.

173
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:11,799
Great.

174
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:14,151
Raj, why don't you and Howard,
go get the charcoal?

175
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:17,052
Leonard, why don't you start working
on some preliminary Web site designs.

176
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:18,659
I'll make some space

177
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,162
in our apartment so we can move
the manufacturing process.

178
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,044
What's wrong with my apartment?

179
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,747
It's not my apartment.

180
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,749
Wait, what am I going to do?

181
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,503
It's your business.
Do whatever you want.

182
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:33,087
Okay, cool.

183
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,253
I'm going to take a nap.

184
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:42,869
I'm still tweaking things
a little bit,

185
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,654
but this will give you
the general idea of the Web site.

186
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:52,340
So, what do you guys think?

187
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:57,806
Pretty much any way I say that
is going to hurt his feelings.

188
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,746
- Okay, what's wrong with it?
- What's wrong with it?

189
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:05,623
Not you. I wasn't asking you.

190
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:10,702
Well, it's a little juvenile.

191
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,465
It kind of looks like the MySpace page
of a 13-year-old girl.

192
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:16,696
No, it doesn't.

193
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:20,607
Please. <i>Dateline</i> could use it
to attract predators.

194
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,746
This is your enterprise,
so it's ultimately your decision,

195
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,611
but based on the quality
of his work,

196
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:32,456
I'd strongly recommend
that we let Leonard go.

197
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,610
You want to fire me?

198
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:37,837
What I want is irrelevant.
This is Penny's decision.

199
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,744
Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job
then why do we already have orders?

200
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,956
We do?

201
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,141
Look.

202
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,801
Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville,
Alabama has ordered two.

203
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:52,617
No kidding. Two?

204
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:54,797
Look at the comments.

205
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,805
"Thank you, Penny Blossoms.

206
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,967
"These will be perfect
to cover my bald spot."

207
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:03,690
That is so sweet.

208
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:05,333
Camouflaging bald spots.

209
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,283
That's primarily a male concern.

210
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,622
Perhaps we could expand our market.

211
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:13,107
How are flower barrettes
going to appeal to men?

212
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,212
We add Bluetooth!

213
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,157
Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.

214
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:25,807
Wait a minute, you want to make
a hair barrette with Bluetooth?

215
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:29,289
Everything is better with Bluetooth.

216
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,089
Holy crap. Someone just ordered
a thousand Penny Blossoms.

217
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,269
Get out!

218
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:40,836
Who needs a thousand
sparkly flower barrettes

219
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,136
with rhinestones?

220
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,127
"The Fifth Annual East
Rutherford, New Jersey,

221
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:48,335
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual
and Transgender Alliance Luau."

222
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,911
Another market to expand into...
balding gay men.

223
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,600
And I'll bet lesbians
love Bluetooth.

224
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,334
We should get to work.

225
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,363
Wait, why does it say
"one-day rush"?

226
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,615
Since when do we offer
a one-day rush?

227
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,747
Amazon offers one-day rush.

228
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,704
Yeah, but they don't have
to glue the books together.

229
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,837
How the hell are we going to make
a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?

230
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:16,327
Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing.
I'm just Web design.

231
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,881
I'm gonna have to call them
and cancel the order.

232
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,090
Excuse me,

233
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,212
but was this not your goal?

234
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,565
Financial independence

235
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,992
through entrepreneurial
brilliance and innovation?

236
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:29,171
My brilliance and innovation,
of course, but still.

237
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:32,662
I just don't see
how we can pull this off.

238
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:36,010
That, right there,
that equivocation and self-doubt,

239
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,232
that is not the American spirit.

240
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,525
Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?
Did Jim Bowie?

241
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,556
They didn't quit.
They were massacred...

242
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:50,201
by like a gazillion angry Mexicans.

243
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,215
Let me put it this way.

244
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,465
Your gross receipts
on this one order

245
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,296
will be over $3,000
for one night's work.

246
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,353
You guys get started.

247
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:06,445
- What are you doing?
- Going online to buy shoes!

248
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,970
<i>She'll be coming round the mountain
when she comes</i>

249
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:15,395
<i>She'll be coming round the mountain
when she comes</i>

250
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,026
<i>She'll be coming round the mountain</i>

251
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:22,251
You know, if I wanted to spend
my Saturday nights doing this,

252
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:24,169
I could have stayed in India.

253
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,966
Stop with the fake third world crap.

254
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:32,120
Your father's a gynecologist.
And you had a house full of servants.

255
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,120
We only had four servants.

256
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:35,833
And two of them were children.

257
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,003
How we doing?

258
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,923
We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms
ready to ship.

259
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:45,092
We're never gonna finish in time.

260
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,345
Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?

261
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,680
I believe I'm hearing some negativity
on the factory floor.

262
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:55,776
- So?
- Penny.

263
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:59,216
The labor force is a living organism
that must be carefully nurtured.

264
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,717
Any counterproductive grumbling
must be skillfully

265
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:03,757
headed off by management.
Observe.

266
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,123
Less talk, more work!

267
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,366
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

268
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,918
You hear any union talk,
you let me know.

269
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:20,692
<i>Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah...</i>

270
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:27,516
<i>Someone's in the kitchen
I know-ow-ow-ow</i>

271
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,953
<i>Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah...</i>

272
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:38,059
<i>'Cause I sold my soul
to the company store</i>

273
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:44,782
- Honey, do you want some coffee?
- I don't drink coffee.

274
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:47,529
But if you don't stay awake
we'll never finish in time.

275
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,349
Sorry, coffee's out of the question.
When I moved to California,

276
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:53,035
I promised my mother
that I wouldn't start doing drugs.

277
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:54,703
Leonard, help.

278
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,705
Sheldon, we still have 380
of these things to make.

279
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,848
I have complete faith
that you will make them.

280
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:00,973
Good night.

281
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,847
But, Sheldon,
without your insight and leadership,

282
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:07,622
this entire enterprise
will surely fail.

283
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,539
You're right, of course.

284
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,398
Here, this will help.

285
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:18,474
Very well,

286
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:21,976
but if this leads to opiates
or hallucinogenics,

287
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:24,597
you're going to have
to answer to my mother.

288
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:28,538
Look at Planck's Constant.

289
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,787
People say it's arbitrary.
It could not be less arbitrary.

290
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:34,976
If it varied slightly,
life as we know it would not exist.

291
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,319
Bam!

292
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,347
Now, now, let's reconsider
the entire argument,

293
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:43,960
but with entropy reversed

294
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,671
and effect preceding cause.

295
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:49,424
So you are thinking of a universe
that's not expanding from the center.

296
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,716
No, it is retreating from a...
from a possibility space.

297
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,976
This is a space
where we are all essentially

298
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,101
Alice through the looking glass,
standing in front of the Red Queen,

299
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:05,167
and we're being offered
a cracker to quench our thirst.

300
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:11,466
Of course, in another universe,
let's call it universe prime...

301
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,999
We should have let him go to bed.

302
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,141
I can't believe we actually did it.

303
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:25,595
1,000 friggin' Penny Blossoms.

304
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,945
I just want you guys to know
I am really grateful for your help.

305
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,385
And for ever dollar I make,
I'm going to give you 20 cents.

306
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,138
That's your entire profit margin.

307
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:38,967
Then never mind.

308
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,695
I'll print out the shipping label.

309
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:48,387
What?

310
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:50,972
We got an e-mail
from the East Rutherford, New Jersey,

311
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:54,181
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual
and Transgender Alliance.

312
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:58,197
They want
another thousand Penny Blossoms.

313
00:17:58,781 --> 00:17:59,781
Really?

314
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:01,400
One-day rush.

315
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:05,516
I really need
to take that off the Web site.

316
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,713
Guess we'd better get started.

317
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:11,631
You can't be serious.

318
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:13,721
Come on.

319
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,511
What about the living organism
of the workforce

320
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,649
and the American spirit?!

321
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:21,351
And Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?!

322
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:26,410
Davy Crockett.
Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.

323
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,275
Yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired.
I've had like 18 cups of coffee.

324
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,546
The point is,
if we just pull together...

325
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,072
We can do this.
Who's with me?

326
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,225
Although you may
find it hard to believe,

327
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,775
we do have lives.

328
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,864
Sorry.

329
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:58,011
My apologies to the gay community
of East Rutherford, New Jersey.

330
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:11,178
Where's the coffee?!

331
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,068
We're all out.

332
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:16,604
No problem.

333
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:20,408
I'll be back
before this banana hits the ground.

334
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:56,107
Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent
Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.
