1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,939
Time!
All right, Klingons, pencils down.

2
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:15,740
Okay, I have:

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,453
- Have it.
- Got it.

4
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:19,824
Have it.

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,117
- Have it.
- Got it.

6
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:23,988
- I have...
- Got it.

7
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,304
And "kreplach."

8
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,407
Hold on a second. "Kreplach?"

9
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,494
It isn't Klingon;
it's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.

10
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,456
Well, as it turns out,
it's also a Klingon word.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,915
Really? Define it.

12
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:40,546
"Kreplach":
A hearty Klingon... dumpling.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,425
- Judge's ruling?
- <i>Bilurrrbe.</i>

14
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,574
Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.

15
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:51,104
- What's wrong with your TV?
- I don't know. It just died.

16
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:54,102
- I'm getting a bunch of static.
- Did you pay your cable bill?

17
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:56,742
You sound just
like the cable company.

18
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:59,155
All right, shh!
Tyra Banks is about to kick

19
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:01,222
someone off
America's Next Top Model.

20
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:03,567
- Excuse me, but we're...
- Don't tell her.

21
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:05,309
... playing Klingon Boggle.

22
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:09,895
What do you mean, "Aw"?
Like she didn't know we were nerds?

23
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:11,495
All right, if you must watch,

24
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,619
then mute it
with closed captions, please.

25
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:14,911
Fine.

26
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:21,017
All right, Boggle warriors...

27
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,465
Look at those women.

28
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:33,722
They're gorgeous.

29
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:37,177
Nice!
Too bad that's a proper noun.

30
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,095
Look, there's
the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

31
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:44,549
No, wait, that's
the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

32
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,144
With her head in the lap of...

33
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:49,037
What a coincidence.
It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

34
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:52,533
Yeah, and they can all move in
with you and your mother.

35
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,508
The current Mrs. Wolowitz.

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,495
Is "..." spelled
with a "..." or a "..."?

37
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,602
Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?

38
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:10,038
That's Anais. None of the other girls
in the house like her.

39
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,548
House? What house?

40
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:15,764
- They all live in a house together.
- A house, where?

41
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:18,457
I don't know.
Somewhere in L.A.

42
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:20,140
Wait a minute.

43
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,709
You're telling me
that I'm within driving distance

44
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,798
of a house filled
with aspiring supermodels?

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Yeah, I guess.

46
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,314
And they live together
and shower together and...

47
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,294
have naked pillow fights?

48
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:46,267
- Where are you going?
- To pay my cable bill.

49
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,130
All right, pencils down!

50
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:52,238
I have...

51
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:56,096
and...
Anybody got those?

52
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:18,702
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,687
Did I miss anything?
Did they kick Giselle off?

54
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:34,582
Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot
was an embarrassment.

55
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:38,893
Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz
is sensitive to chlorine.

56
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:44,337
Lucky for her I like my fashion models
pruny and bug-eyed.

57
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,665
Sheldon, the food's here.

58
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,381
There's the house.
Freeze frame, freeze frame.

59
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:57,531
What are you doing?

60
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,802
Marking the star positions
and physical landmarks

61
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,337
so we can find the house
of the supermodels.

62
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,959
- Why?
- Isn't it obvious?

63
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,149
Every week,
they kick out a beautiful girl,

64
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,021
making her feel unwanted
and without self-esteem.

65
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,818
A.K.A. the future
Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.

66
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,192
Is my hamburger medium well?

67
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:20,597
Dill slices, not sweet?

68
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,166
Individual relish packets?

69
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:23,175
Onion rings?

70
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:24,656
- Extra breading?
- I asked.

71
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,311
What did they say?
Did you protest?

72
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,835
- Yes.
- Vociferously?

73
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:29,691
Then what took you so long?

74
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:32,868
Just eat.

75
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:35,237
Hey, guys, what'd I miss?

76
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,531
Giselle's hanging by a thread.

77
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,113
Oh, good, I hate her.

78
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,602
Then you're not invited
to our wedding.

79
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:45,586
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

80
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:46,889
Do we have to suffer

81
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,837
through this transparently
manipulative pseudo-reality again?

82
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,608
You and I have
a standing TV schedule,

83
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:56,121
which is the result of extensive
debate and compromise.

84
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,312
Any alterations
except for breaking news

85
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,887
have to be pre-approved
at the weekly roommate meeting.

86
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,348
Put it on the agenda.

87
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,562
You have to make a motion
to put it on the agenda.

88
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:08,345
I'll make a motion,
but you're not going to like it.

89
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,585
Fine.
Mock Parliamentary procedure.

90
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,024
At least put it on mute.

91
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,237
Giselle's not getting
kicked off.

92
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,877
It's totally going to be Summer.

93
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,494
- What?
- Sheldon's onion ring. Put it back!

94
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,204
It's one onion ring.

95
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:28,326
Just put it back before he comes!

96
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,276
- No, I don't think that's where it was.
- Here he comes. Deny, deny, people.

97
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:33,618
Wall of silence.

98
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,099
- Who touched my...
- Penny! Penny did it.

99
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,094
Why would you do that?

100
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:47,559
I don't know. I was hungry?
What's the big deal?

101
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:51,104
The big deal is that nobody
touches food on my plate.

102
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,981
All right. I didn't know, I'm sorry.

103
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,948
Well, I'm sorry,
but that is your second strike.

104
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,155
What?

105
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,739
You have two strikes.

106
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,368
Three strikes and you're out.

107
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,791
It's a sports metaphor.

108
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,422
- A sports metaphor?
- Yes, baseball.

109
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:16,952
All right, I'll play along.
What was my first strike?

110
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:18,201
March 18th.

111
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:21,392
You violated my rule
about forwarding email humor.

112
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,265
I did?

113
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:26,681
The photo of the cat who
wants to "has cheezeburger"?

114
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,656
Come on.
Everybody loves "LOL cats."

115
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:33,197
They're cute and they can't spell

116
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,282
'cause they're cats.

117
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,276
I trusted you with my email address,

118
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:41,230
and you betrayed that trust
by sending me Internet banality:

119
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,239
strike one.

120
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,992
Touching my food: strike two.

121
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:50,330
Don't worry. They only stay
on your record for a year.

122
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,846
You can get them removed early,
but you have to take his class.

123
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,839
Come on,
I touched one onion ring.

124
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,297
And then you put it back,

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,526
compromising the integrity
of all the other onion rings.

126
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:07,891
Honey, the buses don't go
where you live, do they?

127
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,189
I wish I could be
more lenient with you,

128
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:15,754
but since you've become a permanent
member of our social group,

129
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:18,630
I have to hold you to the same
standards as everybody else.

130
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,287
Congratulations.
You're officially one of us.

131
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,177
One of us, one of us.

132
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,094
Well, what a thrill.

133
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,120
You're sitting in my spot.

134
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,439
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Leonard, she's in my spot.

135
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:36,778
See, here's the thing.

136
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,907
After you leave,
I still have to live with him.

137
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,743
I don't care.
I'm taking a stand.

138
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:45,593
Metaphorically.

139
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:49,598
All right, that's it.
Strike three.

140
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,524
Strike three.

141
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:54,561
I'm banished?

142
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,702
What the hell kind of crap is that?

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,025
- Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
- Yeah, you do that.

144
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:03,250
Just so I know, would you be open
to taking his class?

145
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:09,144
You can do it online!

146
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,121
So based on our triangulation,

147
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,165
we've narrowed down
the location of the house

148
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,876
to three square miles
in the Hollywood Hills.

149
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:20,403
Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.

150
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,676
When we find it,
you want to go with us?

151
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:24,924
To do what?

152
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,182
Party with the pretty girls, dude!

153
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:30,546
Are you insane?
You're not going to party with them.

154
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,986
You're not even going to get
anywhere near that place.

155
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:35,881
That's what they said to Neil Armstrong
about the moon.

156
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,929
No one said anything of the kind
to Neil Armstrong.

157
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,905
The entire nation dedicated
a decade of effort and treasure

158
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,360
to put a man on the moon.

159
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,985
Well, my fellow Americans,
before this year is out,

160
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:49,041
we will put a Wolowitz
on one of America's top models.

161
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,329
And a large number of people
will believe it never happened.

162
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,287
Okay, let me guess.

163
00:08:57,407 --> 00:09:00,377
A quesadilla with soy cheese
for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.

164
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:03,036
- Thank you.
- Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds

165
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:06,049
for the highly allergic
kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard.

166
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,290
And for our suddenly
"back on the Hindu wagon" Raj,

167
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,971
the meatlover's pizza, no meat.

168
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,724
- Coming right up.
- Wait. Excuse me.

169
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,260
You forgot my barbecue
bacon cheeseburger,

170
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,647
barbecue sauce,
bacon and cheese on the side.

171
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:25,277
I didn't tell you? You're banished
from the Cheesecake Factory.

172
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,419
Why?

173
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:29,156
Well, you have three strikes.

174
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,024
One: coming in.
Two: sitting down.

175
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:34,388
And three:
I don't like your attitude.

176
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,110
You can't do that.

177
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:38,486
Not only is it a violation
of California state law,

178
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:41,501
it flies directly in the face
of Cheesecake Factory policy.

179
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:45,007
Yeah, no, there's a new policy:
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

180
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:49,925
I bet we could sell that sign
all over Pasadena.

181
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:54,014
Can I talk to you for a minute?

182
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,104
Here's the thing.
I talked to Sheldon

183
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:03,129
and he feels terrible

184
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:07,192
and he agrees that he was
unreasonable and out of line.

185
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,820
Really? That's great.

186
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,865
So just apologize to him, okay?

187
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:15,301
What? I'm not going to apologize
to that nutcase.

188
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,300
Come on. It's easy.
He'll even tell you what to say.

189
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,183
Don't you get it? If you guys
keep going along with his insanity,

190
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:25,054
- you're just encouraging him.
- We're not encouraging.

191
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:27,437
It's more like...
knuckling under.

192
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,281
I like hanging out with you,

193
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:32,691
but I'm not gonna apologize
for something I didn't do.

194
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:35,722
Well, actually, technically,
you did do it.

195
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:38,884
That's strike one, Leonard.

196
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:42,732
There you go: quesadilla.

197
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:44,248
Salad.

198
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,834
There's your pizza.

199
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:49,069
And thanks to Sheldon's
heated discussion with my manager

200
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,347
one barbecue bacon cheeseburger,
barbecue sauce,

201
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,407
bacon and cheese on the side.

202
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:54,783
Thank you.

203
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,411
Go ahead. Eat it.

204
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,887
I dare you.

205
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:16,516
That's it. There's the house.
I found America's top models!

206
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,157
- Are you sure?
- Look, on the roof.

207
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,578
Anais and Giselle are sunbathing.

208
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:24,232
European-style.

209
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:27,774
You can recognize people
on Google Earth?

210
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:31,913
Of course not. I got a buddy of mine
at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

211
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,865
NORAD?
You're using military aircraft?

212
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,831
It was already targeted
to poke around

213
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,645
a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

214
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,246
I took it an hour
out of its way, tops.

215
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,291
Where is he?

216
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,835
Sheldon? I just dropped him off
at the comic book store. Why?

217
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,309
Here. Try and go online.

218
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,987
- Problem with the WiFi?
- Just try.

219
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,802
<i>Greetings, hamburger toucher.</i>

220
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:58,932
<i>You are probably wondering</i>

221
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,095
<i>why you cannot IM

222
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:03,720
<i>about how much
you "heart" various things.</i>

223
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:08,999

224
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,859

225
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:14,205

226
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,289

227
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,475

228
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,034

229
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,375
I reiterate: knuckle under.

230
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:29,894
No, no. It is on.

231
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,255
I am gonna introduce
your friend to a world of hurt.

232
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,962
You don't want to get into it
with Sheldon.

233
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:38,208
The guy is one lab accident away
from being a supervillain.

234
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:44,077
I don't care. I was in junior rodeo.
I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 s.

235
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:47,939
No need to neuter the nerd.

236
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,814
I can get you back online.

237
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:52,274
There, see? Problem solved.

238
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:55,773
<i>Voilà.</i>

239
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,825
<i>Hello, puny insects.</i>

240
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:02,884
<i>As a consequence of your efforts
to circumvent my will,</i>

241
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:05,926
<i>everyone is awarded
one additional strike.</i>

242
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,584
Thanks a lot.

243
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:13,071
What are you complaining about?
I have to take the class again.

244
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:28,352
Time to do your laundry, huh?

245
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,468
It's Saturday night.

246
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,315
Saturday is laundry night.

247
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:33,929
I know.

248
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:36,757
Every Saturday at 8:15.

249
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:38,874
Easy to anticipate.

250
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,554
What are you implying?

251
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:46,048
I'm implying
that you're a creature of habit.

252
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,360
And if something were to prevent you
from doing your laundry

253
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,792
on Saturday at 8:15,

254
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,656
you might find it...

255
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:54,501
unpleasant.

256
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,706
Knuckle under? My ass.

257
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:14,302
Are all the machines taken?

258
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,447
What are you gonna do?

259
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:21,069
No problem.

260
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:22,477
I'll just...

261
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,546
do my laundry another night.

262
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:28,431
Another night?
Well, I guess you can try, but...

263
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,287
deep inside your heart,

264
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:34,164
you'll know that laundry night
is always Saturday night.

265
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:42,248
Woman, you are playing
with forces beyond your ken.

266
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:45,759
Yeah, well, your ken
can kiss my Barbie.

267
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,725
- Where are my clothes?
- Your clothes?

268
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:05,867
I left them in the washers
and when I went down, they were gone.

269
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,027
Really?

270
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:11,174
Despite the sign that says
"Do not leave laundry unattended"?

271
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,875
Where are my clothes?

272
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:18,168
You know, I do recall seeing
some female undergarments.

273
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:19,288
Where was that?

274
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:22,462
Earlier this evening,

275
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:24,723
I happened to gaze out the window

276
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:26,766
and a brassiere caught my eye.

277
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,974
Do those look familiar?

278
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,402
How the hell did you get them up
on that telephone wire?

279
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,064
When you understand
the laws of physics,

280
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:37,670
anything is possible.

281
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,369
And may I add: mwuh-ha-ha.

282
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,153
- Get them down.
- Apologize.

283
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:47,761
- Never.
- Then may I suggest

284
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,078
you get a very long stick
and play panty piñata.

285
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:55,043
Wait, Sheldon,
this has gotten out of hand, okay?

286
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,720
I've done some stupid things.
You've done some stupid things.

287
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,088
How about we call it even
and move on with our lives?

288
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:01,756
I've done no stupid things.

289
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,493
- You gotta meet me halfway here.
- I am meeting you halfway,

290
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:07,303
I'm willing to concede
that you've done stupid things.

291
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,892
You guys are talking again.
Good.

292
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:16,764
What happened?

293
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,442
Remember when I said it was on?

294
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,346
Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

295
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,369
Not junior rodeo.

296
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:28,741
What did you do?

297
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:31,876
I had no choice, Leonard.
She ruined laundry night.

298
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,594
Mwuh-ha-ha.

299
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:51,869
Telephone wires can't electrocute you,
can they?

300
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:54,934
Look, this has to stop.

301
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,979
- No, no. It is just beginning.
- All right.

302
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:01,096
I really didn't
want to do this, but...

303
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,485
here.

304
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,320
What's this?

305
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,099
Sheldon's Kryptonite.

306
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:13,640
Oh, my God.

307
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,707
He can never know
that I gave that to you.

308
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:20,400
Look, I said
I wanted to hurt him, but...

309
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,053
but this?

310
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,051
It'll shorten the war by five years
and save millions of lives.

311
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,390
Pause it.
That's it. Confirmed.

312
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:37,595
We now have the address
of the Top Model house.

313
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,231
God bless you,
Google Street View registered trademark.

314
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,153
For the record,
what you're doing is really creepy.

315
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:48,952
You know what? If it's "creepy"

316
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:52,597
to use the Internet, military
satellites, and robot aircraft

317
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,737
to find a house full
of gorgeous young models

318
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:56,821
so that I can drop in
on them unexpectedly,

319
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,626
then fine, I'm "creepy."

320
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:08,901
Hold on a second, I'll get him.
Sheldon, it's for you.

321
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:10,676
- Who is it?
- Your mother.

322
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,114
Oh, good.

323
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:15,129
Hi, Mom. How are you?

324
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,401
But, Mom...

325
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:22,312
she keeps sitting in my spot.

326
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,347
And she touched my food.

327
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:30,717
Okay, yes, I took her clothes,
but she started it...

328
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,083
No, that's not fair.

329
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,744
Why should I have to apologize?

330
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,541
I don't think this is the kind of thing
Jesus concerns himself with.

331
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:44,304
No, you're right.

332
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,645
I don't really know
what Jesus thinks about.

333
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,045
All right, good-bye.

334
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:54,220
Did you tell on me?

335
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,223
Are you kidding me?
I already have two strikes.

336
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:13,416
I am very, very sorry
for what I have done.

337
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,449
Here's your laundry.
I rescind your strikes

338
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:18,659
and you are no longer banished.

339
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,831
Can I sit wherever I want?

340
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:27,112
Never mind, never mind.
That's not important.

341
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,996
Sheldon, this was big of you.

342
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:32,465
- Thank you. I really appreciate it.
- Thank you.

343
00:19:37,664 --> 00:19:38,755
Well played.

344
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,274
- Thank you.
- Just remember:

345
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:47,328
with great power
comes great responsibility.

346
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,612
Understood.

347
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,710
Can I help you?

348
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,248
We're here to fix the cable.

349
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,243
I think we have satellite.

350
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,340
That's what I meant.

351
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,180
Come on in.

352
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:29,076
She's taller than all the women
in my family combined.

353
00:20:31,476 --> 00:20:32,802
What do we do now?

354
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,409
Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
