1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:03,301
All right, that's the last servo.

2
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:06,670
Behold the Mobile
Omnidirectional Neutralization

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,645
and Termination Eradicator.

4
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:10,044
Or...

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:11,169
MONTE.

6
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:15,555
Featuring one articulated
razor-sharp killing saw,

7
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,814
one polycarbonate grinding
and flipping wheel,

8
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:19,938
steel-armor plate exoskeleton
top and bottom,

9
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:22,978
and enough horsepower to drive
a 110 pounds of mechanized death

10
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:25,810
from zero to holy crap
in 4.8 seconds.

11
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:30,139
Is it wrong to say
I love our killer robot?

12
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:33,957
As with my father,
I both love and fear it.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,660
All right, enough chitchat.
Let's destroy something.

14
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:40,047
One, two, three.

15
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:43,295
What shall be first to taste
the wrath of MONTE?

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,163
Maybe we should start small.

17
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:47,749
Perhaps today is the day

18
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:50,823
we finally find out
what's inside the Magic Eight Ball.

19
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:53,371
Did it when I was four.

20
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:56,637
It's an icosahedral die
floating in tinted blue water.

21
00:00:57,353 --> 00:01:00,803
Man, call "spoiler alert"
before you say things like that.

22
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,269
How about the toaster oven?

23
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,412
What did the toaster oven
ever do to you?

24
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:07,975
What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins
in the third grade?

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,776
He still punched me in the face
with my own fists.

26
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:12,974
Sorry, little nerd,

27
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,171
you were just in the wrong boys' room
at the wrong time.

28
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:18,334
Gentlemen, goggles.

29
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,044
This is an auspicious moment.

30
00:01:21,169 --> 00:01:24,070
Like Robert Oppenheimer
or Neil Armstrong,

31
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:27,840
we need the appropriate words
to mark this historic scientific event.

32
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:31,755
How about "Die, toaster, die"?

33
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:34,838
That'll do it.

34
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,377
All right, what's next?

35
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,835
No, I think I'm just going
to stay in tonight and do laundry.

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,280
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

37
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,307
This door got the full MONTE.

38
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,047
What the hell?

39
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,838
Killer robot.
We built it.

40
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,101
Yeah, well, it almost killed me.

41
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,963
If it wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

42
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,131
So, who exactly
does it want to kill?

43
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:57,581
I'm sorry, are you
unaware of the upcoming

44
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:59,616
Southern California
Robot Fighting League

45
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,491
Round Robin Invitational?

46
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:06,602
You know, since I moved last year,
not all my mail has been forwarded.

47
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,421
It's a big deal.

48
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,859
There's an awards banquet
and a dance afterward.

49
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,857
Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

50
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:21,925
I know the other fellas would be
really excited to see a girl there.

51
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:25,477
How is it supposed to be a dance
if I'm the only girl?

52
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:28,325
Well, that may be
a slight exaggeration.

53
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,666
You'd be the only doable girl.

54
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:34,976
You are a pig, Howard.

55
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:38,919
How is "doable" anything
but a compliment?

56
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,724
- Why don't we just work on the robot?
- Please, not now.

57
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,999
Once again, Penny and I
have begun our little tango.

58
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,721
Our tango?

59
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,854
The carnal repartee,
the erotic to and fro.

60
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:54,346
But as delicious
as the appetizer might be,

61
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:56,993
at some point
we will have to succumb

62
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:59,663
and eat the entrée
while it's still...

63
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:07,397
... hot.

64
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:12,941
I'm begging you, stop talking.

65
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:16,584
Look, normally
I can just ignore you.

66
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,388
I get it... you're a little peculiar.
Like Sheldon.

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,126
Excuse me, Penny, but in this room,
you're the one who's peculiar.

68
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,878
You might be right.

69
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,190
But back to you.
I know you think you're some sort

70
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:32,550
of smooth-talking ladies' man,
but the truth is,

71
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,649
you are just pathetic and creepy.

72
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:39,367
So what are you saying?

73
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,840
I am saying it is not a compliment
to call me "doable."

74
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,353
It's not sexy to stare
at my ass and say,

75
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,687
"It must be jelly 'cause
jam don't shake like that."

76
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,520
And most important,
we are not dancing a tango,

77
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:54,168
we're not to'ing and fro'ing.

78
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,754
Nothing is ever going
to happen between us. Ever.

79
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,491
Wait a minute.

80
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,085
This isn't flirting.
You're serious.

81
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,324
Flirting?
You think I'm flirting with you?

82
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,492
I am not flirting with you.
No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.

83
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:10,991
You're just gonna
grow old and die alone.

84
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,928
Thanks for the heads up.

85
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,135
Where you going?

86
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,437
I'm going home to live
my creepy, pathetic life.

87
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:30,285
Someone had to say it.

88
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:35,999
What?

89
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:40,485
He said maybe we should enter you
in the killer robot competition.

90
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,441
Howard, the phone is ringing!

91
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:02,950
Here's a crazy idea, Ma: Answer it!

92
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,469
All right, hold on.

93
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,346
It's your friend, Leonard!

94
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,645
He wants to know why
you're not at school today!

95
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,254
I don't go to school, Ma.

96
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,162
I work at a university.

97
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,935
That's a school!
Now pick up the phone!

98
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,297
I don't want to talk to anybody.

99
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:28,551
Should I ask Leonard to bring
over your homework?!

100
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:31,504
I don't have homework.

101
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,938
I'm a grown man with a master's
degree in engineering!

102
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:37,793
Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants.

103
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,906
Want me to get you a Popsicle?

104
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,494
Cherry, please!

105
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,633
I ate the cherry.
All that's left is green.

106
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,953
You make me want to kill myself.

107
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,857
- What's going on?
- I don't know,

108
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:56,121
now they're just yelling
about Popsicles.

109
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:01,282
- Sounds like Penny really got to him.
- I'm not surprised.

110
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:04,254
Despite his hard and crusty shell,
Howard is a very sensitive man.

111
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,297
Do you know he writes poetry?

112
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:10,787
Mostly about men from Nantucket
and hermits named Dave,

113
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,891
but he does it
with real sensitivity.

114
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,576
Hey, Hofstadter.

115
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,518
Word around the pwasma wab
is you built a wobot?

116
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,133
- Yes, we did, Kripke.
- His name is MONTE.

117
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:24,594
Well, if you have any dewusions
about entering him

118
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,586
against my wobot,
the Kwipke Kwippler

119
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,806
in the Southern California
Robot Fighting League

120
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,924
Wound Wobin Invitational,
aka the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.,

121
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,609
his name is gonna be Scwap Metal.

122
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:37,621
Come on, is that really necessary?

123
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,431
Leonard, I believe it is.

124
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:40,902
This is trash talk,

125
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:44,794
and trash talk is a traditional
component in all sporting events.

126
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,396
Kripke,

127
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,466
your robot is inferior

128
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,218
and it will be defeated by ours

129
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,740
because ours exceeds yours
in both design and execution.

130
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,809
Also, I'm given to understand
that your mother is overweight.

131
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:04,005
Oh, snap.

132
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,570
Of course, if that is the result
of a glandular condition

133
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,341
and not sloth and gluttony,
I withdraw that comment.

134
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:12,989
What difference does it make?
Fat is fat.

135
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:14,927
There are boundaries.

136
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:18,217
Tell you what,
forget the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.

137
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,995
Wet's settle this woboto a woboto.

138
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,334
What do you mean?

139
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:26,793
There's no guarantee
we're gonna go against each other

140
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:29,129
in the Wound Wobin,
so let's throw down.

141
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:30,131
You know,

142
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:31,834
unless you're afwaid.

143
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:35,762
We accept your challenge.
Name a time and place.

144
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,421
- Tomorrow, 3:00, the kinetics wab.
- Make it so.

145
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:40,050
No, don't make it so.

146
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:43,436
Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow.
Our engineer is incapacitated.

147
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:44,896
What's wrong with him?

148
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,657
He's depressed because he's pathetic
and creepy and can't get girls.

149
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,037
We're all pathetic and cweepy
and can't get girls.

150
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,451
That's why we fight wobots.

151
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,980
If you're not there,
you'll be exposed to widicule.

152
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:07,456
I'm curious, what part of America
is that accent from?

153
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,910
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, come on in.

154
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:17,198
What's up?

155
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,958
- I need you to apologize to How...
- Get out.

156
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:24,728
Come on. He won't come out of his house
and we need him for a robot battle.

157
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,177
Well, then have the robot
go and get him.

158
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,940
The robot didn't hurt his feelings.

159
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,888
His feelings needed to be hurt.

160
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,945
He's been in bed for two days.

161
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,076
Probably with a blow-up doll.

162
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,105
He's not with a...

163
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,182
Does it really matter
who or what he's with?

164
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:42,897
The guy is devastated.

165
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,582
Please, how could I possibly
devastate Howard?

166
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,705
Okay, don't take this as a criticism,
but you kind of have

167
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,797
that overexposed-to-gamma-rays
thing going on.

168
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,417
What does that mean?

169
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,788
You know, like, most of the time,
you're the easygoing Bruce Banner,

170
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:01,463
but then, when you get angry,
you kind of turn into, like, you know?

171
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,114
I turn into a bear?

172
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,177
Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?
You didn't get The Incredible Hulk?

173
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:14,919
Never mind.
Just, please go talk to him.

174
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:15,987
And say what?

175
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,073
That I didn't mean it,
because I meant it.

176
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,915
Maybe you can go at it
from a different angle,

177
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,942
like, you see a
glimmer of goodness in him

178
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:27,131
and you only said what you said
because you want to

179
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:29,292
nurture it and make it shine.

180
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,182
Okay, let's try it this way.

181
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,281
Remember the day
we met and you asked me

182
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:41,407
to go to your boyfriend's
apartment to get your TV back

183
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:45,382
and he was nine feet tall and he took
my pants off and you said...

184
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,907
What was that?
What did you say?

185
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,718
Oh, yes.
You said you owed me one.

186
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,901
Okay, come on, that's not fair.

187
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,892
I came home with no pants.

188
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,741
Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.

189
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,530
Thank you.

190
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:07,498
I should probably give you
a heads up about his mother.

191
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,053
What about her?

192
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:11,986
She's a delightful woman.
You'll love her.

193
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:22,012
<i>Howard, there's a blonde girl,
Patsy, here to see you!</i>

194
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:24,231
Who?

195
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,309
<i>Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.</i>

196
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:29,771
I don't wanna talk to her.

197
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,126
Ma!

198
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:33,957
<i>She ran past me.</i>

199
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:36,130
<i>Was I supposed to tackle her?</i>

200
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:41,407
So, I just came by
to see how you were doing.

201
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,919
I'm fine.

202
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:45,105
Good.

203
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,497
Your mom seems nice.

204
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:50,996
People move away from her
on the bus.

205
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,915
What do you want?

206
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,958
I just want to apologize.

207
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:06,693
For some things that I have said.

208
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:10,604
About you.

209
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,525
I've been informed
that you have feelings.

210
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:20,739
And apparently, I have hurt them.

211
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:24,075
So, I'm sorry.

212
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,103
Fine. You're sorry.
Good-bye.

213
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,337
So... you're okay?

214
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,354
Hey, I'm a big boy.

215
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,269
I'm not traumatized
by some random comment

216
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,979
from some random woman.

217
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:44,743
I mean, get over yourself.

218
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:51,098
Bye.

219
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,419
So close.

220
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,391
Oh, my God.
That's Kripke's robot?

221
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,421
<i>As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing
the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.</i>

222
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,879
I can't watch anymore.

223
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,472
Sheldon, we have to call it off.

224
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:20,882
We don't have that option.

225
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:24,135
We've accepted the challenge.
We can't run away from a fight.

226
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,652
Please, we've spent our whole lives
running away from fights.

227
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:31,017
Personally, I can squeeze
through a hole in a fence half my size.

228
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:35,491
Impressive as that may be,
MONTE is not us.

229
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,549
MONTE has no fear.

230
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,693
Didn't we watch the same video?

231
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:43,876
Kripke's robot just had angry sex
with a mid-sized automobile.

232
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,512
You are overlooking the fact
we know what we're up against

233
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,976
and we can modify MONTE
so that he's prepared.

234
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,352
You wanna prepare him?

235
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:54,582
Install a bladder and a pair of shorts
so he can wet himself.

236
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:58,461
Excuse me, but how are we gonna make
any modifications without Wolowitz?

237
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,877
- Have you heard from Penny?
- Not yet.

238
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,537
Have faith, gentlemen.
We don't need Wolowitz.

239
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:07,112
Engineering is merely
the slow younger brother of physics.

240
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,627
Watch and learn.

241
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:16,438
Do either of you know
how to open the toolbox?

242
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,278
And then, when I was 14,

243
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,630
I met Marcy Grossman.

244
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,088
She was so beautiful.

245
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:30,322
She just got her braces off

246
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,685
but they left a little
of the overbite.

247
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,740
It was so hot.

248
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,876
Like a sexy little chipmunk.

249
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:46,931
I didn't have the courage

250
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:48,844
to ask her out,

251
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:50,907
but I dedicated a song to her

252
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:53,266
at the ninth grade talent show.

253
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,219
That sounds sweet.

254
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:58,244
<i>Marcy Grossman is sunshine</i>

255
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,527
<i>On a cloudy day</i>

256
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:05,542
<i>When it's cold outside</i>

257
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:08,864
<i>Marcy Grossman is the month of May</i>

258
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,259
It's cute.

259
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:11,993
<i>I guess</i>

260
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,562
<i>You'd say</i>

261
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:19,096
<i>What can make me feel this way</i>

262
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:22,868
<i>Marcy Grossman,
Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman</i>

263
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>Talkin' 'bout Marcy</i>

264
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,474
That's great.

265
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,301
<i>... Grossman.</i>

266
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:29,949
It's fun.

267
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:34,582
And then she came up
with that sexy little chipmunk mouth

268
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:36,830
and spit in my hair.

269
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:43,586
Which brings us to tenth grade.

270
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,777
Do you think maybe sometimes

271
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,656
you try too hard?

272
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:52,971
Look at me.

273
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:57,303
What chance do I have
if I don't try too hard?

274
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:01,185
You'd have a terrific chance.

275
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,096
I mean, you're smart, you're funny.
You have a cool job.

276
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,921
You build stuff
that goes into outer space.

277
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:07,847
I guess.

278
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:10,220
I'm telling you,
I've known you for a year and a half

279
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,554
and this is the first time
I feel like I'm talking

280
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,073
to a real person.

281
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:16,558
And you know what? I like him.

282
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:18,522
He's a nice guy.

283
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,354
You really think so?

284
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,808
I don't know.

285
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,886
I do.

286
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,624
Nice little bot you've got here.

287
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:46,784
I'm aware.

288
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:49,731
What's this do, spin?

289
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:52,176
Yep. At 3400 RPM.

290
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,182
It can cut through steel
like it was wubber.

291
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:58,221
Neat.

292
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:00,894
Good work.

293
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:03,313
Sheldon, we've gotta call this off.

294
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,906
No, Leonard.

295
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:07,399
For years,
merciless thugs like Kripke

296
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:09,594
have made my life
a series of painful noogies

297
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,417
and humiliating wedgies

298
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:14,115
and the insensitively named
Indian burns.

299
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,743
That stops now.

300
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,219
But we don't have a chance.

301
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:20,285
The only improvement
you were able to make

302
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,707
was to put fresh batteries
in the remote.

303
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,419
What you fail to realize is
Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:

304
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:29,184
overconfidence
from his robot's massive size

305
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,965
and its overwhelming power.

306
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,792
That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.

307
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,845
Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare.

308
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,192
Observe.

309
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:45,970
I would ask if your robot
is prepared to meet its maker,

310
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:49,025
but as you are its maker,
clearly the two of you have met.

311
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,534
What is his pwoblem?

312
00:17:57,674 --> 00:18:00,203
Way to bust out
the Jedi mind tricks, dude.

313
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:03,738
I just wanna make sure
we're all clear.

314
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:06,702
Standard robotic fighting
league rules apply.

315
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,078
Are you cwazy?

316
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:11,157
This is a stweet fight.
The stweet has no rules.

317
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,300
He's right, Leonard.
The paradigm is to the death.

318
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,510
I will, however,

319
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,342
give you the opportunity
to concede my superiority now

320
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,267
and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

321
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,278
Never.

322
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,687
I'd rather see MONTE dead
than in your hands.

323
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,857
That could be easily arranged.

324
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:29,691
Ready, set, go?

325
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,151
- Do it.
- All right then.

326
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,782
Weady. Set. Go.

327
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:41,947
- Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
- Indeed.

328
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:44,330
We are prepared for anything
he can throw at us.

329
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:53,152
That's new.

330
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,009
Run, MONTE, run!

331
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,342
Run, MONTE!

332
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,263
Go, go, go, go!

333
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:06,067
Don't hurt us, don't hurt us,
don't hurt us!

334
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,693
Well, so much for making up

335
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,367
for the emotional wounds
of childhood.

336
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:22,103
I did this.

337
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,707
MONTE was killed
by my hubris and my pride.

338
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,201
No matter what anybody says,
this is my fault.

339
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:30,426
No one's arguing with you, dude.

340
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,415
I got your text. How bad is...

341
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,134
Forget the robot.
What happened to you?

342
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,368
- He slipped and fell.
- Yes,

343
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:43,097
I slipped and fell.

344
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:44,626
In the bathroom.

345
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,755
Bounced right off the tub.

346
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:50,294
Now he knows what bathtubs
are capable of doing

347
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:52,273
when you don't treat them
with respect.

348
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:57,444
They sucker punch you
when your eyes are closed.

349
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,236
So what do you think, Howard?

350
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,200
It's not that bad, right?

351
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,745
A little electrical tape,
some solder...

352
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,262
Are you insane?

353
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,406
I've seen space probes
that crashed into the desert

354
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:13,210
that were in better shape than this.

355
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:15,914
You're right.

356
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,412
MONTE's gone.

357
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:21,010
We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

358
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,863
Leonard, you'll play your cello.

359
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:26,888
Honey, aren't you getting
a little carried away?

360
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:28,934
I mean, it's just a toy robot.

361
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:33,230
"Just a toy robot"?

362
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:41,864
I know, I got it.

363
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:45,346
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

364
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,957
Don't get the wrong idea.

365
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,771
The way I see it,
I'm halfway to pity sex.
