1
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:29,237
Fellas, please.

2
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,430
Penny, come on.
We were just finding our sound.

3
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:35,253
You found it.

4
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:38,371
It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

5
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:41,631
I'm really very busy.

6
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,536
Is there any way
that we can put this off

7
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:45,718
until I have more time to prepare?

8
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:49,048
Of course.
But, you understand my trepidation.

9
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:51,081
- What's that about?
- Not a clue.

10
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:53,617
Can't we just postpone it
till the spring?

11
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,138
Maybe next summer?

12
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,053
This should be fairly
easy to deduce.

13
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,187
He's holding the phone
to his left ear.

14
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:02,051
Ears do not cross hemispheres,
so he's using the analytical

15
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:04,242
rather than the emotional side
of the brain,

16
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:07,679
suggesting that he has no personal
relationship with the caller.

17
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,404
No, I didn't realize
it had been so long.

18
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:14,116
Sure, I guess there's no other choice
but to just go ahead and do it.

19
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,451
He's referring to an activity
he has done before.

20
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,669
It's unpleasant
and needs to be repeated.

21
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:21,302
This suggests some sort
of invasive medical test,

22
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:23,831
like perhaps a colonoscopy.

23
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:27,184
Aren't there any other options?
There's not a lot of room.

24
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,589
- It's gonna be uncomfortable.
- Yes, yes.

25
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:32,484
I'm definitely going
with colonoscopy.

26
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,923
Okay, bye.

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,998
My mother's coming to visit.

28
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:44,576
How about that, you were right.

29
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,217

30
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,276
It's out of order.

31
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:21,051
Yes, I can read the sign.
I'm just pondering the implications.

32
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,904
I think it implies
that the elevator doesn't work.

33
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:29,440
Again, I can read the sign.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,776
But the sign and the tape
are covered with a layer of dust,

35
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,383
which indicates that the elevator
has been nonfunctional

36
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:37,179
for a significant amount of time.

37
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:39,513
Which suggests
either a remarkable passivity

38
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:40,953
among the, I assume,

39
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:43,370
24 to 36 residents of this building,

40
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,133
based on the number of mailboxes

41
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:47,715
and given typical
urban population density

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,680
or a shared delusion
of functionality.

43
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,589
You must be Leonard's mother.

44
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,525
I don't know if I must be, but yes.

45
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,606
I'm Penny.
I'm his neighbor.

46
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:02,348
Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

47
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:04,058
Nice to meet you.

48
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:06,805
You're a hand shaker.
Interesting.

49
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,316
Come with me.
I'll walk you to the apartment.

50
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,486
Would you like to exchange
pleasantries on the way?

51
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,322
- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- All right, you start.

52
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:23,049
I've always been curious. What was
Leonard like when he was little?

53
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:26,124
I think you mean young.
He's always been little.

54
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,187
Right.
What was he like when he was young?

55
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,412
You'll have to be more specific.

56
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:34,380
Okay, like, five or six.

57
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,233
Five.

58
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:43,411
At that age, he was well enmeshed

59
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:46,789
in what Freud would call the phallic
stage of psychosexual development.

60
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:49,373
An outmoded theory, of course,
but the boy did spend

61
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:52,793
most of his waking hours
with a tight grasp on his penis.

62
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,911
Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.

63
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,586
That is one of my degrees.
My primary field is neuroscience.

64
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,533
Well, I'm an actress.

65
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:08,446
Why?

66
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:11,500
What do you mean why?

67
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:14,237
There are studies that
suggest that many who go into

68
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:17,881
the performing arts suffer from
an external locus of identity.

69
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,567
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

70
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:28,213
It means you value yourself
only as others value you,

71
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,049
which is often the result
of unmet childhood emotional needs.

72
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:35,899
I had a wonderful childhood.

73
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,943
Tell me about it.

74
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:41,608
I know my dad wanted a boy.

75
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,360
I tried being good at sports,
but I hated getting dirty!

76
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:54,418
And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.

77
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,687
He called me Slugger
until I got my first training bra.

78
00:04:57,812 --> 00:05:00,712
And then he just stopped
playing catch with me.

79
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,887
I wasn't Slugger anymore.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,442
Your mother's here!

81
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,901
If you want
to have intercourse with that girl,

82
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:18,876
find out what kind of cologne
her father wore.

83
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,941
Good to see you, Mother.

84
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,985
Here's your tea, Mother.

85
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,046
Oolong?

86
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,359
Loose, not bagged?

87
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:31,731
Steeped three minutes?

88
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,044
Two-percent milk?

89
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,414
Warmed separately?

90
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:35,799
One teaspoon sugar?

91
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:36,960
Raw sugar?

92
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:40,668
It's cold.

93
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:45,962
I'll start again.

94
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:50,015
I have the same problem with him.

95
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,659
My theory is that his lack of focus
stems from an over-developed sex drive.

96
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,593
I don't know
where he would've gotten that.

97
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:03,371
Aside from a pro forma
consummation of our marriage,

98
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,452
his father and I only had intercourse
for the purposes of reproduction.

99
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:11,307
That seems a fairly efficient
arrangement.

100
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:14,289
Yes, we think so.
We've both done papers on it.

101
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,834
Mine from the neuroscientific
point of view

102
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,102
and his from an anthropological.

103
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:22,124
Mine, of course,
was the onlyne worth reading.

104
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:23,340
Of course.

105
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,745
I would very much like to read
about your sex life.

106
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:31,807
It's all online or you can order it
from the Princeton University Press.

107
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:33,947
Here's your tea, Mother.

108
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,562
So, what are you guys talking about?

109
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:40,087
The frequency with which
your parents had intercourse.

110
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,522
Swell.

111
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,156
If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you
the PowerPoint presentation.

112
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,552
I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.

113
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,107
So, Mother...

114
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:56,244
- what's new?
- You'll have to be more specific.

115
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,210
All right.
What's new with you?

116
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Well, I've been having some fascinating
menopausal symptoms recently.

117
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,450
Maybe something less personal.

118
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:11,356
Your Uncle Floyd died.

119
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,390
Oh, my God.
What happened?

120
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,433
His heart stopped beating.

121
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,419
I have to urinate.

122
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,831
What a remarkable woman.

123
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,934
Yeah, I-I thought you guys
might hit it off.

124
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,049
I envy you your childhood.

125
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,926
I hate to tell you,
but the only warm memories

126
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:39,051
I have of my childhood
are of my Uncle Floyd.

127
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:42,294
You're clearly misremembering.
Your mother is brilliant,

128
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,195
analytical, insightful.

129
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,251
And I'm betting
she never hit you with a Bible

130
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:48,758
because you wouldn't eat
your Brussels sprouts.

131
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,675
You don't give your mother
enough credit.

132
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,605
She's warm, she's loving,

133
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,653
she doesn't glue electrodes
to your head

134
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:58,778
to measure your brain waves
while potty training.

135
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,790
You were lucky.
When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,

136
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,025
I had to attach my own electrodes.

137
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:11,078
So, Dr. Hofstadter,
Leonard rarely talks

138
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:14,117
about his incredibly successful
brother and sister.

139
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,836
Please, don't go there.

140
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,371
I understand that,

141
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,533
unlike Leonard, they're at the top
of their respective fields.

142
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:24,858
Boy, you suck.

143
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:29,550
Leonard's younger brother, Michael,
is a tenured law professor at Harvard,

144
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,670
and his sister just
successfully grew

145
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,227
a human pancreas
in an adolescent gibbon.

146
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,433
So, she's close to curing diabetes?

147
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:41,687
Why else would you grow
a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

148
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,607
You must be very proud.

149
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:47,150
Why?
They're not my accomplishments.

150
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,167
I have to urinate.

151
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:56,464
- Why are you doing this?
- You know the rules.

152
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,489
You brought your mom to work...
you must suffer.

153
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,876
I had no idea your siblings
were so much more successful than you.

154
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,535
You're like the Jar Jar Binks
of the Hofstadter family.

155
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,809
Oh, mesa think
yousa lookin' so so sad.

156
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,541
Rather than mock me,
my friends might realize

157
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,311
that this is difficult
and try to help me through it.

158
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,689
Nope, I think mocking you
is more fun.

159
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:30,281
Next time, don't yousa
bring mama to work. Okee-day?

160
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:34,906
- That was fast.
- The middle stall was occupied.

161
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:36,533
I'll have to try again later.

162
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,796
That's totally understandable.
In bladder voiding, as in real estate,

163
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,164
it's location, location, location.

164
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,415
- So, where were we?
- Howard lives with his mother

165
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,363
and Raj can't speak to women
unless he's drunk. Go.

166
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:56,386
That's fascinating.
Selective mutism is quite rare.

167
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,513
On the other hand, an adult Jewish male
living with his mother is so common

168
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:03,026
it borders on sociological cliché.

169
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,272
It's just temporary; I pay rent.

170
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,900
He lives in the same room
where his bassinet was.

171
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,609
Both selective mutism

172
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,030
and an inability
to separate from one's mother

173
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,406
can stem from a pathological
fear of women.

174
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,892
It might explain why the two of you have
created an ersatz homosexual marriage

175
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:23,027
to satisfy your need for intimacy.

176
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,274
Say what?

177
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:36,089
That's basically what I just said.

178
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:39,429
You brought your husband to work.
You know the rules.

179
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,184
Mesa thinking yousa looking
pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.

180
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,439
Leonard, it's 1:00. Weren't you going
to show me your laboratory at 1:00?

181
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,567
There's no hurry. Tell them more
about their secret love for each other.

182
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,704
But it's 1:00. You were going
to show me your laboratory at 1:00.

183
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,293
Her reasoning is unassailable.
It is 1:00.

184
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,453
Fine. Let's go.

185
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:07,213
I think you'll find my work
pretty interesting.

186
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:09,507
I'm attempting to replicate
the dark matter signal

187
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,170
found in sodium iodide
crystals by the Italians.

188
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,005
So, no original research?

189
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,142
What's the point of my seeing it?

190
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,882
I could just read the paper
the Italians wrote.

191
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:26,864
Just for the record, we're not
in an ersatz homosexual relationship.

192
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,827
- Then why didn't you say that to her?
- Why is it always my responsibility?

193
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:33,078
It's not always your responsibility.

194
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:36,592
I swear, this is the same thing you did
at the comic book store last week.

195
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,283
I can't believe
you're bringing that up.

196
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:47,393
- I didn't bring it up. You did.
- We'll talk about this later.

197
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:49,971
You always say that,
but you never do.

198
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:58,508
You went to the comic book store
without me?

199
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,977
- You got alcohol?
- Your mom still here?

200
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,660
Come on in.

201
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,108
Wait, she's not gonna come here
looking for you, is she?

202
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,278
Relax. She took Sheldon
to the hospital to get a brain scan.

203
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,280
Oh, my God. What happened?

204
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:21,248
Nothing.
Mother likes looking at brains

205
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,781
and Sheldon likes getting
his brain scanned.

206
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,954
Geez, what a fun couple.

207
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,493
She's only been here a day and a half

208
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:32,894
and I'm seriously considering alcoholism
as a new career path.

209
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:37,715
I talked to her for 5 minutes yesterday
and I've been half bombed ever since.

210
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:40,676
You can't let her
get into your head.

211
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,429
- My head, what about yours?
- It's too late for me.

212
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,473
My head is her summer house.

213
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:49,543
She was right.

214
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,688
The locus of my identity
is totally exterior to me.

215
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:54,627
Yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.

216
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,706
Do you know where I was all morning?

217
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:01,447
Auditioning with 50 other blondes

218
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,991
for some stupid
antidepressant commercial.

219
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,130
And for what?

220
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:07,615
So I'll finally get
my daddy's approval?

221
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:12,682
- Did you get the part?
- No, they said I was too perky.

222
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:19,724
You want to talk
about not getting love from a parent.

223
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:21,663
You know what I used to do
when I was little

224
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:23,678
to have some sensation
of human contact?

225
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:26,179
Yeah, you grabbed your penis
and wouldn't let go.

226
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:33,058
Your mother told me.

227
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:36,357
Of course she did.
That's not what I was gonna say.

228
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:39,573
When I was ten years old,
I built a hugging machine.

229
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:42,649
A hugging machine?

230
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,736
I got a dressmaker's mannequin,

231
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:47,288
I stuffed it with an electric blanket
so it would be warm,

232
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:49,221
and built two radio-controlled arms

233
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,419
that would hug me and pat my back.

234
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:54,540
That is so sad.

235
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:58,810
You know what the saddest part was?
My father used to borrow it.

236
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,730
Your scan data will be very helpful
to my research.

237
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:07,733
You have a remarkable brain.

238
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:08,858
I know.

239
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,222
Although I've always hated

240
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:14,830
how my right frontal lobe
looks in pictures.

241
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,729
Common complaint among men.

242
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:19,378
Nothing's ever big enough.

243
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,736
Except when they get a tumor.
Then you never hear the end of it.

244
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:28,160
I'd love to see
a scan of your brain sometime.

245
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,412
I'll send you a link, but its physiology
is fairly unimpressive.

246
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:33,414
I can't believe that.

247
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:35,720
Your unwillingness to accept
empirical evidence

248
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,916
suggests an attempt at flattery.

249
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:41,305
My apologies.

250
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:45,201
I've been living with your son too long.
Gotten into some bad habits.

251
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,344
Understandable.

252
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,749
- Can I make you a cup of tea?
- I doubt it,

253
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:53,244
but if anyone has a chance,
it's probably you.

254
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,605
I feel very comfortable around you.

255
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:03,110
I feel very comfortable
around you, too.

256
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,819
It's surprising

257
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,325
because I generally
don't feel comfortable around...

258
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:08,799
well, anyone.

259
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,784
Nor I.

260
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:15,133
What are the odds
that two individuals

261
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:17,745
as unique as ourselves
would be connected

262
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,636
by someone as comparatively
workaday as your son?

263
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:26,399
Is that a rhetorical point
or would you like to do the math?

264
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,558
I'd like to do the math.

265
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:33,934
I'd like that, too.

266
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:52,859
Now this time,

267
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,855
you're gonna lick the salt...

268
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,066
off my neck...

269
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:01,653
do the shot...

270
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,128
and then...

271
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,641
bite the lime.

272
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,198
I'm sorry, I didn't hear
anything after "lick."

273
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,400
Neck, shot, lime.

274
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:28,969
- Shot, lime.
- Right.

275
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,412
Where's the lime?

276
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,525
We're sharing.

277
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,218
So, what do you think?

278
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:05,858
I'm very tempted.

279
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:10,062
I'm just not sure it's appropriate
with my son's roommate.

280
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,510
Normally, I'd feel the same way.

281
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:16,264
But based on everything
I've observed about us,

282
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:19,468
I can't help but speculate
we'd be very good together.

283
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,708
True. I've had
a similar observation.

284
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,117
It's certainly something
I could never do with my husband.

285
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:31,945
I was hesitant
the first time I tried it,

286
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:34,651
but I experienced an unanticipated

287
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:37,705
and remarkable release
of endorphins.

288
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,228
It's quite satisfying.

289
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:43,666
I see what you're doing.

290
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:47,407
You're appealing
to the neuroscientific researcher in me.

291
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,460
You see right through me, don't you?

292
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,678
Only when you're in a CAT scanner.

293
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,500
This is actually gonna happen.

294
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:09,755
Honey, shush, shush.

295
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,515
You shush, I'm happy.
I want to talk about it.

296
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,524
You know what my mother would say?
She would say

297
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,719
because you weren't loved by your father
and I was not loved by my mother,

298
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:21,006
that having sex is our way
of making up for the intimacy

299
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,839
we didn't get as children.

300
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,579
Why would you bring that up
right now?

301
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:27,970
I don't know.

302
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:29,024
Foreplay?

303
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,015
So you're saying
you're not having sex with me,

304
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,905
you're having sex with your mother?

305
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,398
I'm gonna go with "no."

306
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,277
That is the sickest thing
I've ever heard.

307
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,164
Come on,

308
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,459
you're trying to have sex
with your father and I'm okay with that.

309
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:50,331
Get out!

310
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,506
She said shush.
I should have shushed.

311
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,374
All right, Mother.

312
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,289
Have a nice flight.

313
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,587
That's not really
in my control, is it?

00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:47,518
- Good morning.
- Morning.

315
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,697
- I was just coming over to talk to you.
- You don't have to.

316
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:52,075
Ever.

317
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:54,088
Gotcha.

318
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:56,987
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Good-bye.

319
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,296
So, Slugger, shall we pick up
where we left off last time?

320
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,086
I mean, my mom could've just said,

321
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:06,787
"Bob, get over it,
she's a girl, move on."

322
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,752
- But she didn't. Not one word.
- Interesting.

323
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,827
Would you be willing to fly
to New Jersey

324
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:17,154
and discuss your relationship
with your parents during a brain scan?

325
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:21,780
- Would it help?
- Well, it would help me.
