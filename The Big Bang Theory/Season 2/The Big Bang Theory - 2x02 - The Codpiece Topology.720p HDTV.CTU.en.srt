1
00:00:01,757 --> 00:00:04,631
Worst. Renaissance. Fair. Ever.

2
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:08,683
Please let it go, Sheldon.

3
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:11,765
It was rife
with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:14,542
For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.

5
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:16,839
Her costume
was obviously Germanic.

6
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,572
But in 1487,

7
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:21,274
the Bavarian purity laws,
or <i>Reinheitsgebot</i>,

8
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:23,898
severely limited
the availability of mead.

9
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:26,308
At best, they would have had
some sort of spiced wine.

10
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:28,508
- You're nitpicking.
- Oh, really?

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,117
Well, here's another nit for you:
the flagons

12
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,743
would not have been made
of polypropylene.

13
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:37,109
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

14
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:39,951
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's

15
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,901
and lacing them up
in corsets so tight

16
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,399
their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."

17
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,417
Bosoms would not have said
"howdy" in the 15th century.

18
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:50,929
If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,178
I don't care
what the bosoms say.

20
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:55,755
I just want to be part
of the conversation.

21
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:57,788
Hi, guys.

22
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,244
Looks like you've been
to the renaissance fair...

23
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:01,368
I'm hoping.

24
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:05,932
Renaissance fair? More of a medieval,
slash, Age of Enlightenment,

25
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:08,626
slash, any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece
fair.

26
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:12,074
Okay, fine, whatever.
This is my friend Eric.

27
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:13,742
- Hello.
- Hey.

28
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,702
So, yeah, good to see you.

29
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:22,919
It's good to see you, too.

30
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:26,792
We should probably go.
Bye, guys.

31
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:29,037
I like your hat.

32
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,112
Thanks, my mom made it.

33
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,299
Penny with a new guy,
<i>très</i> awkward.

34
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,366
It wasn't awkward.

35
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,528
It wasn't fun.

36
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,866
Besides, what's the big deal?

37
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:49,135
We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.

38
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:51,894
By moving on, do you mean
she's going out with other men

39
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:55,509
and you spent the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

40
00:01:56,653 --> 00:02:00,055
That was not 15th century soap.
My God, those people need to learn

41
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:02,585
you can't just put "ye olde"
in front of anything you want

42
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,330
and expect to get away with it.

43
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,457
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

44
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,801
You're wearing modern underwear?

45
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:13,872
Relatively modern.

46
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,805
What are you wearing?

47
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:20,261
I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

48
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,386
You bought linen?

49
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:25,526
Don't be silly...
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

50
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:29,341
Borrowed?

51
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,918
Subtitles:
sub-way.fr / forom.com / seriessub.com

52
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:54,970
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

53
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,065
It gives me the freedom
to move on myself.

54
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,851
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,594
Of course.
Out of respect.

56
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,267
So, how do you explain
the ten years before Penny?

57
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,812
Who were you respecting then?

58
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,006
Well, I've dated plenty of women.

59
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,960
There was Joyce Kim...

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,486
Leslie Winkle...

61
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:22,437
Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary.

62
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:25,283
The word "plenty" has been
redefined to mean "two."

63
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:29,772
What about that girl
last year at Comic-Con?

64
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:31,414
- Doesn't count.
- Why not?

65
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:34,758
What happens in costume
at Comic-Con stays at Comic-Con.

66
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,942
You're saying that
because of what happened to you.

67
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,549
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.

68
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:42,554
It wasn't your fault.

69
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,221
He was dressed as a green
Orion slave girl.

70
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:47,958
How did we get on me?!

71
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,984
We were mocking Leonard
for not moving on.

72
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,178
Dude, you have totally not moved on.

73
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,616
Yes, I have.

74
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:56,565
It's just a matter of actually
making a date with someone.

75
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:57,901
Like who?

76
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,122
Well... there's Joyce Kim.

77
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:03,511
But she defected
back to North Korea, so...

78
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:07,117
it's a little
geographically undesirable.

79
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,136
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,711
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy,

81
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,475
she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity,

82
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,795
and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.

83
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,841
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.

84
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,033
You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

85
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:30,056
Mud.

86
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,565
I like Leslie, but she's not interested
in dating

87
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:37,391
as much as using men
as tools for stress release.

88
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,216
Yeah, so? Be a tool.

89
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:44,029
Go get yourself a little rebound
"stress release."

90
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,508
Technically, it would only
be rebound if he and Penny

91
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,522
had actually engaged
in physical intimacy.

92
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:51,157
Like you and Richard the slave girl?

93
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:55,796
I bought him dinner
and we kissed once! That was it.

94
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,270
And he told me
his name was Kimberly.

95
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:06,583
You know how I know
we're not in the matrix?

96
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,068
How?

97
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:15,257
If we were,
the food would be better.

98
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,294
Hey, Leonard.

99
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,184
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.

100
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:22,700
Hello, to you...

101
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,895
insufficiently intelligent person.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,156
Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.

103
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:33,834
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

104
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,209
- Sure.
- If you'll excuse me,

105
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:37,977
I'm going to go do work

106
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:41,595
that promises significant results,
as opposed to what you do...

107
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,473
which does not.

108
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,663
Yeah, you heard me.

109
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,386
So, I heard your relationship
with Penny crashed to the ground

110
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:07,162
like blue ice falling out
of an airplane lavatory.

111
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,444
Where did you hear that?

112
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:11,781
Actually, I read it.
Wolowitz texted me.

113
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:16,453
"Like blue ice falling out
of an airplane lavatory," yeah.

114
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:19,646
I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an LOL.

115
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,730
Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached,

116
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,348
maybe we can revisit
our previous attachment.

117
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:29,449
Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

118
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:32,708
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
From now on, I'm fully committed

119
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:34,688
to the traditional
relationship paradigm.

120
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,853
- Really? What changed?
- It's hard to say.

121
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:38,937
I guess there's a time
in every woman's life

122
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:41,100
when she gets tired
of waking up on a strange futon

123
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,046
with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

124
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,173
Yeah, I can see how that would--
a bunch of people?

125
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:50,493
Anyway, I figure it's time
to slow things down and,

126
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,408
who better to slow things down
with than you?

127
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:55,634
I'm flattered.

128
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,589
So,

129
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,294
how do you suggest we proceed?

130
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:02,729
Your place, we'll order Chinese,
you'll rent a movie--

131
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,592
artsy, but accessible--
then light petting, no coitus.

132
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:08,726
Sounds fun.

133
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:13,152
I'll leave the details up to you.
It's better if you assume the male role.

134
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,390
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

135
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,037
Great.

136
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:20,988
Call me.

137
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,780
Great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

138
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:35,901
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?

139
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,355
Break out the Red Bull,
it's time to rock Mario, old school.

140
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,336
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.

141
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:46,113
Friday's always vintage game night.

142
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,261
Look, Mom included the memory card.

143
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,412
We can pick up right
where I left off in 1999

144
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:52,362
when I had pernicious anemia.

145
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,769
The thing is, someone's coming over.

146
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:58,209
No problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

147
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,096
It's a date.
I have a date coming over.

148
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:05,950
You can't blame me for not
jumping to that conclusion.

149
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,568
Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

150
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,262
- Statistically speaking...
- All right, all right.

151
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:16,873
Nevertheless, I have one now
and I'd appreciate it if you would,

152
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,250
make yourself scarce.

153
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:21,558
I'm a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates

154
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:24,214
and an IQ which can't be accurely
measured by normal tests.

155
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:26,254
How much scarcer could I be?

156
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,304
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

157
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,508
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.

158
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,193
You mean, just go
someplace else and be...

159
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:37,541
someplace else?

160
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,313
Yes.

161
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,441
Why should I leave?
This is my apartment, too.

162
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:42,331
I know,

163
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:44,964
and if science ever discovers
a second member of your species

164
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,756
and you two would like some privacy,

165
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,982
I'd be more than happy
to get out of your way.

166
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,421
Well, all right then.

167
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,587
What are you doing?

168
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,164
Playing Super Mario

169
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:04,325
on a poorly coded
Nintendo 64 emulator.

170
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,500
Why are you doing it on the stairs?

171
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:11,584
I am a modern day Napoleon
exiled to the Elba of the staircase

172
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:14,188
because Leonard, get this,
has a date.

173
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:18,101
Good for him.

174
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:22,565
Why are you sitting here? Why don't you
just go to a movie or something?

175
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:23,757
Alone?

176
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,247
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?

177
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,439
Who will administer
the Heimlich maneuver?

178
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:31,740
Then don't order popcorn.

179
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,826
No popcorn at the mo...
listen to yourself.

180
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:38,152
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.

181
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,915
They have other things.

182
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:42,074
What do they have?

183
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,113
You know, cookies, pastries...

184
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,289
Pastries such as bear claws?

185
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,912
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't like bear claws.

186
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,596
Hey, Penny.

187
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,716
Dumbass.

188
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,421
Leslie Winkle.

189
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:00,201
Of all the overrated physicists
in all the labs in all the world,

190
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,559
why does it have to be
Leslie Winkle?

191
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,518
They have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.

192
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,705
Oh, please. The only way she could make
a contribution to science

193
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,350
would be if they resumed
sending chimps into space.

194
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,528
Okay, well, I have a date, too,
so I'll see ya.

195
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:21,107
Everybody has a date.

196
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,045
Even you, Mario,
going after Princess Peach.

197
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:29,090
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.

198
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,677
- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.

199
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:36,250
- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.

200
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,449
- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.

201
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,439
So,

202
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,185
how many children
do you think we should have?

203
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,793
I'm sorry.
That was a little abrupt.

204
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:50,735
A little?

205
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,946
There are so many things to talk about
before we discuss reproduction.

206
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:55,303
I sure hope so.

207
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:00,703
Besides shortness, what genetic
weaknesses run in your family?

208
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,144
Sorry to interrupt.

209
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,914
Battery's dying. Continue.

210
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,561
Genetic weakness, right.

211
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,588
There's the lactose intolerance.

212
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,940
Don't forget
the male-pattern baldness.

213
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:15,838
When his uncles sit around
the dinner table,

214
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,907
they look like a half carton of eggs.

215
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,711
Okay, my uncles are bald,

216
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,767
but my Aunt Edna is one
of the hairiest women you'll ever meet.

217
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:45,438
Sweet lady.

218
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:47,488
Always tickles when she hugs me.

219
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:54,864
- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.

220
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,722
I'm sorry
about all of Sheldon's interruptions.

221
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,601
He can be a bit of an eccentric.

222
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:08,064
If by "eccentric"
you mean passive-aggressive

223
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:09,897
East Texas blowhole, I agree.

224
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,651
I think tonight was a very good start.

225
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:14,814
Me, too.

226
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:17,120
You sure you're okay
postponing intercourse

227
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,907
until our relationship is past
the initial viability test?

228
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:23,411
No problem, I'm very skilled
at postponing intercourse.

229
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:28,499
I guess I'll call you
and we'll arrange another evening.

230
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,348
I believe protocol dictates you wait
a minimum of 18 hours before you call

231
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,964
so I'm not repulsed
by your cloying eagerness.

232
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,048
Sure.

233
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:38,426
Again, it's your decision.
You're the man.

234
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,109
It wasn't my cat.

235
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:43,169
It was an experiment
designed by this guy named Schroedinger.

236
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:47,601
From the Charlie Brown cartoons?

237
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:51,750
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.

238
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:54,191
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hello.

239
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,701
- Leslie.
- Hi.

240
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,338
Okay, well... good night.

241
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,661
Okay, good night.

242
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:10,993
That ain't gonna make your point.

243
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:25,600
That's enough.

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,060
Call me.

245
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,130
Right.

246
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,566
Okay, good night.

247
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,913
- What?
- Had a great time. Ciao.

248
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:43,738
I'm sorry, I am not going back
to the Renaissance fair.

249
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:45,396
Come on,

250
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:48,635
there's so few places
I can wear my jester costume.

251
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,389
I don't care.

252
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,168
There are far too many
historical anomalies for my comfort.

253
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,927
Okay, how about this?

254
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,740
You can go dressed
as a Star Trek science officer

255
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,806
exploring a planet similar
to Earth in the 1500s.

256
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,695
You mean, like Spock?

257
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,550
Sure.

258
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:08,277
Fascinating.

259
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:12,861
Hey, fellow scientists...

260
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,651
Why don't we all move over there
so Leslie can join us?

261
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:19,944
Let's do it.

262
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,824
If you're having trouble
deciding where to sit,

263
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,678
may I suggest one potato, two potato?

264
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:33,166
Or as I call it, "the Leslie Winkle
experimental methodology."

265
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,838
- Don't make this hard for me.
- It's not hard.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,889
It's simple.

267
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:42,719
You can either sit with me,
your friend, colleague and roommate

268
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,928
or with an overrated scientist
you might have sex with.

269
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,533
You're right, it is simple.

270
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,149
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Penny.

271
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,664
Third floor tonight...
mixing it up?

272
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:06,954
I still don't understand why you don't
go to dinner or something.

273
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:09,777
All right,
let's say I go to dinner alone,

274
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:12,162
and during the meal,
I have to use the restroom.

275
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,791
How do I know
someone's not touching my food?

276
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:20,102
Good night, Sheldon.

277
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,142
Penny, hold on.

278
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,885
Are you sure things can't
work out with you and Leonard?

279
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:27,080
Excuse me?

280
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,304
I'm just wondering

281
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,721
if you really gave it
the old college try.

282
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,951
Or in your case,
the old community college try.

283
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:39,398
Okay, where is this coming from?

284
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:42,840
Leonard is upstairs right now
with my archenemy.

285
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:44,757
Your archenemy?

286
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,682
The Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.

287
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:51,785
The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man,
the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.

288
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:52,948
I get it.

289
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,790
It's amazing how many supervillains
have advanced degrees.

290
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:01,795
Graduate school should do a better job
of screening those people out.

291
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,839
Sheldon, come back.
You're losing me.

292
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:05,689
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.

293
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,384
She belittles my research.

294
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,770
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

295
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,700
She called me "dumbass."

296
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,350
I know. I heard.

297
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,098
Given this situation,

298
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,852
I have no choice but to withdraw
my previous objections

299
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:21,740
to your ill-considered
relationship with Leonard.

300
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:25,168
Gee, well, thank you for that.

301
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,808
But I think for now,

302
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:28,739
Leonard and I are just gonna
stay friends.

303
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:31,202
No, that response
is unacceptable to me.

304
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:35,078
Sheldon, you are
a smart guy...

305
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:36,330
I'm "smart"?

306
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,886
I'd have to lose 60 IQ points
to be classified as "smart."

307
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,170
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.

308
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,661
You must know that if Leonard
and Leslie want to be together,

309
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:48,708
nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

310
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:52,213
You continue to underestimate
my capabilities, madam.

311
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:56,707
Let me put it this way.
If you're really Leonard's friend,

312
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:59,656
you will support him
no matter who he wants to be with.

313
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:03,357
Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?

314
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:07,056
If Leonard's really my friend,
why doesn't he have to support me

315
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:09,196
and my hatred of Leslie Winkle?

316
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:13,370
Because love trumps hate.

317
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:16,389
Now you're just making stuff up.

318
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,188
Okay, good night, Sheldon.

319
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,785
Mario...

320
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:26,348
If only I could control everyone
the way I control you.

321
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,231
Hop, you little plumber,
hop, hop, hop.

322
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,572
When the two of you reach
a natural stopping point,

323
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,286
I'd like to have a word.

324
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,439
If the word is "pee-pee,"
just do it.

325
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,719
Leonard, you're my friend,

326
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:54,074
and friends support
their friends... apparently.

327
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,481
So I'm withdrawing my objection

328
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:58,871
to your desire
to have a relationship with Leslie.

329
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:01,915
- Thank you.
- I will graciously

330
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:03,984
overlook the fact
that she is an arrogant,

331
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:07,541
subpar scientist who actually
believes loop quantum gravity

332
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:10,051
better unites quantum mechanics
with general relativity

333
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,579
than does string theory.

334
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:14,182
You kids have fun.

335
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:16,389
Hang on a second.

336
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:20,684
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more
testable predictions than string theory.

337
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:23,088
I'm listening. Amuse me.

338
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,910
For one thing, we expect
quantized space-time to manifest itself

339
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,825
as minute differences in the speed
of light for different colors.

340
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:34,248
Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

341
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:38,779
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

342
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:46,380
Okay, well, there is a lot
of merit to both theories.

343
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,446
No, there isn't.
Only loop quantum gravity

344
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,297
calculates the entropy of black holes.

345
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:56,679
Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.

346
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:59,473
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.

347
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:01,781
You agree with me, right?

348
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:04,311
Loop quantum gravity
is the future of physics.

349
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:08,497
Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer
my space stringy, not loopy.

350
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:13,112
I'm glad I found out the truth about you
before this went any further.

351
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:14,931
Truth? What truth?

352
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:18,158
We're talking about untested hypothes.
It's no big deal.

353
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:19,406
It isn't? Really?

354
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,791
Tell me,
how will we raise the children?

355
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:29,278
I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.

356
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,589
We can't let them choose.
They're children!

357
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:35,175
Where are you going?

358
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:38,031
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:41,743
I could have accepted our kids being
genetically unable to eat ice cream

360
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:44,017
or ever get a good view of a parade.

361
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:46,514
But this?

362
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:48,353
This is a deal breaker.

363
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,213
Look on the bright side.

364
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:06,123
What's the bright side?

365
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:08,689
Only nine more months
to Comic-con.

366
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:25,165
Captain, I'm getting
an unusual reading.

367
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,397
That's great.
You guys want corn dogs?

368
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:31,901
That's a temporal anomaly.

369
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:36,771
Corn dog's didn't come into existence
till the first half of the 20th century.
