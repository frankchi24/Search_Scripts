1
00:00:00,-209 --> 00:00:02,001
Okay, it's done. Look, guys,

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,794
for the future, I don't mind
killing the big spiders,

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:07,969
but you have to at least try
with the little ones.

4
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:12,412
Please. We're facing a far more
serious problem than stray arachnids.

5
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,171
It's not so bad.

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,541
Not bad? It's horrible.

7
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,311
You hear stories about this things,
but you never think it'll happen to you.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,595
So they steamed your dumplings.
Get over it.

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,188
- New topic, please.
- All right, Penny.

10
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:30,993
Let me take this
opportunity to point out

11
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,168
that you are looking
particularly ravishing today.

12
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:38,463
Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.

13
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,557
So, there is a number.

14
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,486
Okay, new topic, please.

15
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:49,495
Did you hear the people
upstairs in 5A are moving out?

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,550
What?!

17
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,470
- The people upstairs are moving out.
- No!

18
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,497
The horror...

19
00:00:58,415 --> 00:01:00,851
Why would you just say
something like that?

20
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,872
- How else was I supposed to say it?
- Slowly.

21
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:10,319
Like putting a new fish in a tank.
You don't just drop it in.

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,690
You let the bag sit
in the water a while.

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,210
The horror...

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,006
- I'm sure it's going to be fine.
- No, it's not going to be fine.

25
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:24,231
Change is never fine.
They say it is, but it's not.

26
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,836
Honey, did you even know
the people that are moving out?

27
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:29,401
I never met them.

28
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:31,552
That's what made them perfect.

29
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,059
There were no awkward
"hellos" in the halls.

30
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:37,584
There's no clickety-clacking
of high heel shoes on hardwood floors.

31
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,614
They may as well have
been a family of cats

32
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,289
just jumping around
from drape to drape.

33
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,578
Without that annoying
ammonia urine smell.

34
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,690
I'm sure the new people
will be just as quiet.

35
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:52,693
You can't know that.
How can you possibly know that?

36
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,528
You're right, I can't. You know what?
Anyone could rent that apartment now:

37
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:59,410
an opera singer,
the cast of <i>Stomp</i>...

38
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,623
Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate
with a wooden leg.

39
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,890
Why are you making it worse?

40
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,838
I tried making it better.
He wouldn't go for it.

41
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:13,923
You're right!
That's a great idea.

42
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:15,994
- What?
- I'll take the apartment upstairs.

43
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,977
I can finally get
away from my mother

44
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:21,060
and we can all spend
some more time together.

45
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:22,785
If you catch my drift.

46
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:26,964
The horror...

47
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:49,862
Subtitles: The FWT Team

48
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:56,592
Hold on. You honestly expect me
to believe that social protocol

49
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,052
dictates we break our backs
helping Wolowitz move,

50
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:01,577
and then he only
need buy us a pizza?

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm sorry, that really is
how it works.

52
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,648
You're tricking me.

53
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:11,464
You tell me the truth,
what do we get?

54
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:13,567
Help me out here.

55
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,835
You get to choose between
a mountain bike or a PS3.

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
I knew it!

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,346
PS3, definitely PS3.

58
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,095
Who would pick a mountain bike?

59
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:27,646
Enough with the guilt, Ma.

60
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,291
We'll still see each other.

61
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,756
I'll come over every night
and have dinner with you.

62
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:33,448
The hell you will!

63
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:37,815
What am I running here,
a fancy restaurant?

64
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:41,512
Does this look like Olive Garden?!

65
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,366
Okay, I get it, you're angry.

66
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,680
You don't want to see
your little bird leave the nest.

67
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,005
"Little bird"?

68
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,480
You're almost 30!

69
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:54,635
Fly, for God's sake!

70
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:56,878
Fine, I'll stay!

71
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,532
Ya happy, crazy lady?
I sure as hell hope so,

72
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,406
because you're ruining my life!

73
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:07,336
Hey, Penny? Good news,
you can take your head out of the oven.

74
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,082
I guess I won't be needing this.

75
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:20,885
The new ones.

76
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,002
They're here.

77
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,808
Stay calm. We don't know
anything about them yet.

78
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:36,041
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking for musical instruments.

79
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:39,672
Does that sound
like castanets to you?

80
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:41,488
The box says "kitchen."

81
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:45,284
So? Do cocaine smugglers
write "cocaine" on the box?

82
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:49,079
Hello?

83
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:50,789
- Hello.
- Hello.

84
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,379
I'm Alicia.
I'm moving in upstairs.

85
00:04:57,829 --> 00:04:59,179
That is so great.

86
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,233
Oh, I'm Leonard.
I live downstairs.

87
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:05,362
Upstairs from here, but under you.

88
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,803
Not under you per se, but...

89
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,352
under your apartment.

90
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,358
- That's nice.
- Yeah, it is.

91
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:18,986
If that concludes
your faltering attempt to mate...

92
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:29,756
On a scale
of one to ten, how light of foot

93
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:33,144
would you describe yourself,
with one being not cat-like at all,

94
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,369
and ten being freakishly feline?

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,628
"Freakishly feline"?

96
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:41,673
Is that your answer or do you
not understand the question?

97
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,741
We'll come back to that one.

98
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:46,652
Hang on. Are you now
or have you ever been

99
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:49,448
a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?

100
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:54,532
- You're making her uncomfortable.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

101
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:58,357
If it helps you feel any better,
you're doing very well so far.

102
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,714
Next question: are you fertile?

103
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:02,986
What?!

104
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,365
I'm trying to determine whether crying
infants above my head are a possibility.

105
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,170
- I have no immediate plans.
- If that changes, let me know.

106
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,372
And finally, area rugs, pro or con?

107
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,253
- Pro?
- Alicia?

108
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:17,578
- Yes?
- Welcome to the building.

109
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,425
Thanks so much for helping me.

110
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:32,856
Thank you so much for giving
me the opportunity to help.

111
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:35,445
Hey, guys.

112
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,521
This is Alicia, our new neighbor.

113
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,032
- Hi.
- Hi.

114
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:40,923
I'm helping.

115
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:43,456
I can see.

116
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:47,112
Alicia's non-musical,
childless and pro-rug.

117
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:52,364
She's still on probation, of course,
but I like her.

118
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,845
Cool T-shirt.

119
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:57,582
Oh, I don't usually dress like this.
I'm going jogging.

120
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,950
- You don't jog.
- I can start.

121
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:05,090
True, but the more likely explanation is
that you're out of clean clothes again.

122
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,551
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome, Penny.

123
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,972
Please, you look cute.
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

124
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:15,576
I think you look fantastic.

125
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:18,106
This one's a player, huh?

126
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:19,955
Yeah, be careful.

127
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:22,669
Thanks for the warning.

128
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:24,944
- I'll see you around.
- See ya.

129
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:30,739
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

130
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,534
Oh, mimicry.

131
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,810
I enjoy mimicry.

132
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:37,080
I've been working on Admiral Ackbar
from <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.

133
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:39,766
"It's a trap."

134
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,630
You have to imagine me
with a giant squid head.

135
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,826
"It's a trap."

136
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:27,744
Come.

137
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:32,257
Congratulations,
I see you did your laundry.

138
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:34,930
- Sort of.
- How does one "sort of..."

139
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,015
I bought new clothes, okay?

140
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,366
- Is Leonard around?
- He's upstairs at Alicia's.

141
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:42,965
Oh. All right,
that's cool, no biggie.

142
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:46,600
He said he'd help me set up my printer,
but I guess I can wait.

143
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,516
What exactly is he doing up there?

144
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,691
In what I can only perceive
as a tactical move to destroy me,

145
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:55,200
he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali
setting up her stereo.

146
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,703
Oh, they're all up there?
Typical.

147
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,040
It's axiomatically atypical.

148
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:05,159
Up until recently,
they did not know her,

149
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:07,546
and had no encounters with her
in a previous location.

150
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:09,965
They never went upstairs
to visit the former tenants.

151
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:14,106
Your characterization of their behavior
as "typical" is demonstrably fallacious.

152
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,588
Now I see the giant squid head.

153
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:30,088
Oh, great!
Now, I have to start all over again.

154
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,823
Yeah, I thought about renting
this apartment,

155
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:38,191
but I'm really more of a
"downtown loft" kind of guy.

156
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:40,579
Cool. So are you in a loft now?

157
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:44,434
Oh, actually, I'm,
living with a woman in Altadena.

158
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,838
Purely platonic.
She's also my maid.

159
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,423
- Sounds like a sweet deal.
- I won't lie. It's pretty dope.

160
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,809
I just wanted to bring you
a little housewarming gift.

161
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,398
That is so sweet.

162
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,645
- Come on in. Let's open it.
- Great.

163
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,831
Nice dress.

164
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,392
This? I'm dressed like a slob today.

165
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:12,110
The guys have been helping me
set up my sound system.

166
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:14,779
I've never had
such good-looking technical support.

167
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,325
Pish-posh.

168
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:22,095
I don't know, it means shucks.

169
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,580
"Shucks" means shucks.
Let one go once in a while.

170
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:30,086
You want to hear something awesome?

171
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:33,048
Alicia is an actress, just like you.

172
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:35,578
That is so awesome.

173
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,346
Well, trying to be,
but it's so hard.

174
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:41,989
- I know, tell me about it.
- I've been out here 3 months,

175
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:44,243
and all I've gotten
is a couple of national commercials

176
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:46,143
and this recurring thing on a soap.

177
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,930
That's why I work
at the Cheesecake Factory.

178
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:52,609
I'm holding out for the right part.

179
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:01,326
What do you want as your default setting
for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?

180
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,995
Whatever you think is best, cutie.

181
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,666
Well, DTS has more low end, so...

182
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:18,277
Hey, guys, guys,
you will really appreciate this.

183
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:19,928
I read the best science joke.

184
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:22,138
You won't get it,
but it's right up their alley.

185
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:23,723
Anyway,

186
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:26,434
this physicist goes
into an ice cream parlor every week

187
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,324
and orders an ice cream sundae
for himself,

188
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,897
and then offers one
to the empty stool sitting next to him.

189
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,900
This goes on for a while until the owner
finally asks him what he's doing.

190
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,572
The man says,
"Well, I'm a physicist,

191
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:40,031
"and quantum mechanics... teaches us

192
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:43,845
"that it is possible
for the matter above this stool

193
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,184
"to spontaneously turn
into a beautiful woman

194
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,373
"who might accept my offer
and fall in love with me."

195
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:52,048
The owner then says, "Lots of single,
beautiful women come in here ever day.

196
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:55,360
"Buy an ice cream for one of them,
and they might fall in love with you."

197
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:56,774
And the physicist says,

198
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,559
"Yeah, but what are the odds
of that happening?"

199
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,392
It's a little insulting,
don't you think?

200
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,729
How would I know?
I'm not even sure I get it.

201
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:13,440
Leonard?

202
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:17,110
If you're done with the DVD player,
can you set up my printer?

203
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,570
Yeah, I'd love to.

204
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,991
Maybe when you're done with her printer,
you could set up mine.

205
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:25,493
You know, like you promised...
a week ago.

206
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:27,454
Yeah, I'll get to it. Don't nag me.

207
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,526
Hello there.

208
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:51,887
Who is it?

209
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:57,383
Hello, Penny.
It's open... Come in.

210
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:01,823
Sarcasm.

211
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,951
- Well, they're all still up there.
- You think I can't hear them?

212
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:09,633
Listen to that: stomp, stomp, stomp.

213
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,548
That's Wolowitz
in his stacked heels that fool no one.

214
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,045
I don't even know why I care.
I don't care.

215
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:22,017
Enough to memorize that stupid joke,
but that's all I care.

216
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,357
You know, Penny,

217
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,514
there's something
that occurs in beehives

218
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,013
you might find interesting.

219
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:29,603
Occasionally,

220
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,266
a new queen will arrive

221
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,393
while the old queen
is still in power.

222
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:35,146
When this happens,

223
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:38,003
the old queen must either locate
to a new hive

224
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,703
or engage in a battle to the death

225
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:43,179
until only one queen remains.

226
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:48,497
What are you saying,
that I'm threatened by Alicia?

227
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:51,328
I'm like the old queen of the hive
and it's just time for me to go?

228
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:54,683
I'm just talking about bees.

229
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:57,676
They're on The Discovery Channel.

230
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,850
What are you talking about?

231
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:04,018
Bees.

232
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,399
I just got that physicist joke.

233
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:16,937
Gee, Penny,
thanks for buying us dinner.

234
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:19,169
- Yeah, what's the occasion?
- No occasion.

235
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:22,218
Just felt like
getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.

236
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:26,892
Did you remember to ask for the chicken
to be diced, not shredded?

237
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:29,088
Even though the menu description
specifies shredded?

238
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:30,431
Brown rice, not white?

239
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,602
Did you stop at the grocery
for the good hot mustard?

240
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,788
And pick up the low-sodium soy sauce
from the market?

241
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:35,958
Good.

242
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:39,835
See how it's done?

243
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,710
What do we got going on tonight?

244
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:48,477
Playing Halo, watching <i>Battlestar</i>,
drop some Mentos in Diet Coke?

245
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,560
- You want to watch <i>Battlestar</i>?
- What can I say?

246
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:54,310
I got my geek on, boys.

247
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:00,378
No, PMS is different.

248
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:05,819
- Thank God you're home. I need help.
- What's wrong?

249
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:09,490
I got a callback to audition for <i>CSI</i>
to play a hooker who gets killed.

250
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,404
I'd watch that.

251
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:14,540
But my car is in the shop,

252
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,789
and I have to be
at Universal in 45 minutes.

253
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,998
I'll take you.

254
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,019
You're a lifesaver.

255
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,503
- I'll run lines with you in the car.
- Great.

256
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:25,339
And afterward,
I'll take you all out for Chinese.

257
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,007
Actually, we already have...

258
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:28,371
Starving.

259
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,904
... Chinese food right here.

260
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,518
They're gone, Penny.
They can't hear you.

261
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,665
I cannot believe they're letting her
just use them like that.

262
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,003
Anything she wants, they go
panting after her like trained dogs.

263
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:48,477
You know last week,
she had Howard drive all the way

264
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,156
to her uncle's house in Orange County
to pick up her TV?

265
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,806
You once had Leonard
and me get your television

266
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,480
from your ex-boyfriend.

267
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,372
Apples and oranges here, Sheldon.

268
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,919
I'm telling you, that girl is a user,
skating through life on her looks,

269
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,878
taking advantage of weak-willed men,

270
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,516
getting auditions
for stupid network shows.

271
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,629
It just creams my corn.

272
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,764
- May I interject something here?
- Please.

273
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,558
You got the wrong mustard.

274
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,287
Guess what?

275
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:26,900
I got the part on <i>CSI</i>.

276
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,530
Oh, boy.

277
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:31,405
Something wrong?

278
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:35,802
No, you know, congratulations.
I think you'll make a great hooker.

279
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,579
Thank you.

280
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,970
I got to ask you something.

281
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,043
How much do physicists make?

282
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,131
I don't know. I don't think a lot.

283
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:50,924
Yeah, that's what I figured.

284
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,084
Well, got to run.

285
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,251
The guys promised
to set up my satellite dish

286
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,785
and paint my bedroom.

287
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,187
Can I talk to you
about that for a second?

288
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,933
About what?

289
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,776
You know, it's just that Leonard
and Howard and Raj,

290
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,969
they aren't like other guys.

291
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,404
They're special.

292
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,491
Okay, they're special... and?

293
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:18,542
Let's see. How can I explain this?

294
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:21,455
They don't know
how to use their shields.

295
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:24,048
- Shields?
- Yeah, like in <i>Star Trek</i>,

296
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,573
when you're in battle
and you raise the shields?

297
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:33,384
Where the hell'd that come from?

298
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,680
Anyways, you know
how guys like this are, so...

299
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,798
please don't take advantage of them.

300
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:45,311
Who says
I'm taking advantage of them?

301
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,327
Come on.
They're doing everything for you,

302
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:50,025
because you're leading them on.

303
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,115
So I let them do stuff for me.

304
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,820
They're happy. I get stuff.

305
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,114
Who cares?

306
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,757
And how's it any different
from what you do?

307
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:00,802
Excuse me?

308
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:03,366
I've seen you around them.

309
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:06,385
Are you pretending
like you don't do the exact same thing?

310
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:07,781
Okay, lady,

311
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:09,903
you are way out of line.

312
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm out of line?

313
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:14,842
Yeah, you're out of line.

314
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,059
What are you going to do about it,

315
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,054
bitch?

316
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,030
I like Green Lantern.

317
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:26,522
I'm just saying it's pretty lame
that he can be defeated

318
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,122
by the color yellow.

319
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,775
Only the modern Green Lantern
is vulnerable to yellow.

320
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:34,367
Golden age Green Lantern
was vulnerable to wood.

321
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:37,573
Great, so I can take them both out
with a number-two pencil?

322
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,805
Oh, my God! Girl fight!

323
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,249
- What are you doing?
- I know you.

324
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:51,086
You're stupid enough to break it up.

325
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:05,373
May I say you look
very comely tonight?

326
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:07,615
Thank you.

327
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,602
You're right,
this filly's been broken.

328
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,854
You set it on DTS, didn't you?

329
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:22,759
I had to.

330
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,830
She called me "cutie."

331
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,615
According to Alicia's Facebook page,

332
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,670
she's hooking up
with one of the producers on <i>CSI</i>.

333
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:35,136
Dead whore on TV,
live one in real life.

334
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,851
Great.

335
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,088
Now she's jumping
up and down on the bed.
