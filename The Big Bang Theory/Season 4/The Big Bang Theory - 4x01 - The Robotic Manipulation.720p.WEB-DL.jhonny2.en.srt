1
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:08,270
And now the kung pao chicken.

2
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,509
Smooth.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,723
And finally,

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:13,904
my moo shu pork.

5
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,673
Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,442
And it only took 28 minutes...

7
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:29,320
Impressive, but we must be cautious.

8
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,196
Why?

9
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,582
Today, it's a Chinese food
retrieval robot.

10
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:37,584
Tomorrow, it travels back in time
and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

11
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:40,498
I don't think so.

12
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,459
No one ever does.
That's why it happens.

13
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,076
Is the food here?
What's that?

14
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:51,580
That, dear lady,
is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand,

15
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:55,513
designed for extravehicular repairs
on the International Space Station.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,098
Cool.

17
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,891
Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

18
00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:01,485
Does that come up much
on the space station?

19
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,552
Mostly with Asian
and Jewish astronauts.

20
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:07,038
All right. Pass the soy sauce.

21
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,317
Coming up.

22
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,413
So how's work?

23
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:21,960
It's not bad.

24
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:23,457
Kind of hungry.

25
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,638
We all are.

26
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,091
Just wait.

27
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,225
You realize that the technology
that went into this arm

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,033
will one day make unskilled food servers
such as yourself obsolete.

29
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,305
They're going to make a robot
that spits on your hamburger?

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,227
I thought you broke up.
Why is she here?

31
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:48,024
Here we go.
Passing the soy sauce.

32
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:51,069
Put out your hand.

33
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,284
Amazing.

34
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,834
I wouldn't say amazing.

35
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,088
At best, it's a modest leap forward

36
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:05,587
from the basic technology
that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.

37
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,471
Peace?

38
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,982
No, not peace.
Hang on.

39
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,285

Does NASA know you're using that thing
as a napkin holder?

44
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,632
You kidding? They still think
it's in a secure locker at JPL.

45
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,884
You stole it?

46
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,152
Borrowed.

47
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:00,638
The trick is to carry it out
like you own it.

48
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:04,767
Excuse me.

49
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,262
Amy's at the dry cleaners,

50
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:11,665
and she's made a very amusing pun.

51
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,444
"I don't care for perchloroethylene,

52
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,322
"and I don't like glycol ether."

53
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:26,417
Get it?
She doesn't like glycol ether.

54
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,627
Sounds like "either."

55
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,217
"LOL."

56
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:40,178
- Who's Amy?
- His girlfriend.

57
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:42,460
- Sheldon has a girlfriend?
- She's not.

58
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,162
- For how long?
- Four months.

59
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:45,730
She's not my girlfriend.

60
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,346
For the past four months
I have been asking you, "What's new?"

61
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:50,688
and you never told
"Sheldon has a girlfriend"?

62
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:53,236
She's not my girlfriend.

63
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,235
How did they meet?

64
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,180
Raj and I entered
Sheldon's information on a dating site,

65
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,031
and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.

66
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:02,325
Sheldon and Amy.

67
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,118
Or, as we call them, "Shamy."

68
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,947
Shamy.
I am so digging the Shamy.

69
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,793
All right, everyone pay attention.

70
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,411
Yes, I have a friend
named Amy Farrah Fowler.

71
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:15,812
Yes, she is female.

72
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:18,115
Yes, we communicate
on a daily basis,

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,426
but no, she is not my girlfriend.

74
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,354
What do you communicate about?

75
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,347
My work in physics,

76
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:27,028
her work in neurobiology,

77
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:30,978
and most recently, the possibility
of having a child together.

78
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,740
Wait a minute, a child?

79
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,331
You never see this girl.
You just e-mail and text and Twitter.

80
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:48,079
Now think about having a baby?

81
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:50,951
Amy pointed out
that between the two of us,

82
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:53,134
our genetic material
has the potential

83
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,373
of producing the first
in a line of intellectually superior,

84
00:04:56,498 --> 00:05:00,591
benign overlords to guide humanity
to a brighter tomorrow.

85
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,562
I'm guessing that future historians
will condemn us

86
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,236
for not taking
this opportunity to kill Sheldon.

87
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,155
I have a question.

88
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:15,011
You don't even like
people touching you.

89
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:16,793
How are you going to have sex?

90
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,861
Why on Earth would we have sex?

91
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,011
Honey, did your mom
not have the talk with you?

92
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,939
You know,
when your private parts started growing?

93
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:31,761
I'm quite aware
of the way humans usually reproduce,

94
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:33,736
which is messy, unsanitary,

95
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,948
and based on living next to you
for three years,

96
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:39,184
involves loud and unnecessary appeals
to a deity.

97
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,199
Yes, exactly.

98
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:49,674
Consequently, if Amy and I
choose to bring new life in this world,

99
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,510
it will be accomplished clinically,

100
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:54,604
with fertility experts in a lab
with petri dishes.

101
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:58,762
Which reminds me, you have broad hips
and a certain corn-fed vigor.

102
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:01,087
Is your womb available for rental?

103
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,334
Still digging the Shamy?

104
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:10,161
Look, before you race off
to the fertility clinic,

105
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,512
you might want to think about...
Gee, I don't know...

106
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:15,082
maybe actually spending some time
with her.

107
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:16,209
Dating?

108
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:18,169
I can't.

109
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:20,546
- Why not?
- She's not my girlfriend.

110
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,887
Don't think of it
as dating a girlfriend.

111
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:26,511
Think of it as getting to know
the future mother of your child.

112
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,699
I hadn't considered that.

113
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,546
I suppose she will have
to have access to our progeny.

114
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,394
And you don't think I can achieve

115
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,147
the required intimacy
via text messaging?

116
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:39,315
Probably not.

117
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,347
It'd appear as if the phone companies
have been lying to me.

118
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:55,322
You do realize
I stand on the other side of the door

119
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:57,880
waiting for you
to finish knocking three times.

120
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:01,436
I know. I can see
the shadow of your feet under the door.

121
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,590
My point is it's a waste of time.

122
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:07,138
If you're looking for an example
of a waste of time,

123
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,887
I would refer you to the conversation
we're having right now.

124
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:11,514
What do you want?

125
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,242
I've decided to take your advice

126
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,935
and have arranged
to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.

127
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:17,881
That's great.
Have fun.

128
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,772
Wait.
You have to drive me.

129
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:20,690
What?

130
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:22,233
You know I don't drive.

131
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,734
- Go ask Leonard.
- I did.

132
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,013
He said, and I quote:
"Ask Penny, it was her cockamamy idea."

133
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,867
He said "cockamamy"?

134
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:32,607
Actually, I'm paraphrasing.

135
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:34,690
I've been raised
in a Christian household,

136
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:36,818
I'm uncomfortable
with the language he used.

137
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,377
And to be honest,
I'm not comfortable with "cockamamy."

138
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,046
- Fine. When's the date?
- Now.

139
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,089
Now?

140
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,008
Hurry. We're going to be late.

141
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,804
Sheldon, did it ever occur to you
that I might have other plans?

142
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:54,265
I'm sorry.
Do you have other plans?

143
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,563
Well, no, not per se, but...

144
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:05,240
So this conversation is as pointless
as your door-knocking soliloquy?

145
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,691
Let me get my cockamamy keys.

146
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,660
That feels so good.

147
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:22,990
That's the spot.

148
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,011
Dinner's ready!

149
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,841
I'll eat later.

150
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,010
I'm busy!

151
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,066
Just like a real hand.

152
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,234
Thank you for driving me.

153
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,466
You're welcome.

154
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,678
I wish
you weren't wearing flip-flops.

155
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,116
It's dangerous
to drive in flip-flops.

156
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:02,151
I just don't want
to be yet another flip-flop fatality.

157
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:06,671
Can I ask you a question?

158
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,036
Given
your community college education,

159
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:11,968
I encourage you
to ask me as many as possible.

160
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:17,558
Well, my question is,
and I'm pretty sure I know the answer,

161
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:19,642
is this your first date?

162
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,409
That depends.

163
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,172
Does square-dancing with my sister

164
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,817
at a Teens for Jesus
Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?

165
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:31,471
Then, this is my first date.

166
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,632
Well, then, there's a couple of things
you should probably know.

167
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:39,245
I have a master's degree
and two doctorates.

168
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:41,930
The things I should know, I do know.

169
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:46,794
My point is,
I know more about dating than you,

170
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,923
and if you were as smart as this,
you would listen to me.

171
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:53,971
If you know so much,
how come I have a date tonight

172
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,470
and you have nothing better to do
than drive me to it?

173
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:00,725
Fair point.

174
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:07,398
There's something
I've always wondered about Aquaman.

175
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:10,124
Where does he poop?

176
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:13,696
What?

177
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,122
What would a toilet look like
in Atlantis?

178
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,189
How would you flush it?
And when you did flush it,

179
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,104
where would the poop go?

180
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,482
Hold that thought.

181
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:28,919
What's up?

182
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,502
What...

183
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,828
Hold on.
Howard, slow down.

184
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,066
The robot hand
is stuck on your what?

185
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,025
You're not gonna believe this.

186
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,561
So Amy,
Sheldon tells me you're a neuro...

187
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,084
something-or-other.

188
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:04,119
Neurobiologist.

189
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,768
Your "check engine" light is on.

190
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:10,400
It's okay.

191
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,951
- But the light indicates...
- Don't bother.

192
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:16,683
I've wasted many an hour
tilting at that particular windmill.

193
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:22,306
What is that scent you're wearing?
It smells great.

194
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:24,184
Dandruff shampoo.

195
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:27,649
I have dry scalp.

196
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:31,700
Your hair looks very nice.

197
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:34,059
Are you a homosexual?

198
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,513
I'm just giving you a compliment.

199
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,971
Would have been more flattered
if you were a homosexual.

200
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,540
How about some music?

201
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,626
I wouldn't care for that.

202
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:55,049
Uncomfortable silence it is.

203
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,432
Have you told Amy
what it was like growing up in Texas?

204
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:09,830
Why don't you tell her?

205
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,916
All right.

206
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:13,482
It was hell.

207
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:17,528
Any follow up?

208
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,152
I grew up in Nebraska.

209
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,081
Small town outside of Omaha.

210
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,980
A nice place, mostly family farms,
a few meth labs.

211
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:37,757
I'm sorry, how is this better
than uncomfortable silence?

212
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,818
I don't know.
I was just trying something.

213
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:42,887
Muggles.

214
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:54,023
You slipped and fell
into a robot hand?

215
00:12:58,952 --> 00:12:59,975
Penis first?

216
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:05,785
Now, help me!

217
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:09,245
I'd suggest a lubricant, but I guess
you fell on some of that as well.

218
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:12,208
Not funny.

219
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,255
Really?

220
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,223
A robot hand's
got a death grip on your junk.

221
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:16,665
That's funny, ask anyone.

222
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:20,800
Before my mother walks in,
get this off me!

223
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:21,820
Let's see.

224
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:23,803
Don't touch, the program is paused.

225
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,304
Let's un-pause it.

226
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:28,271
I loaded the wrong program
it thinks it's holding a screwdriver.

227
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:30,136
If you continue, it's gonna start...

228
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:31,451
twisting.

229
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,027
All right.

230
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:36,267
How about this?

231
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:40,396
When Winnie the Pooh
got his head stuck in the honey tree,

232
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:44,019
his friends all grabbed onto him
and pulled and pulled.

233
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,078
You do what you want,
I wont touch another man's honey tree.

234
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,280
All right, forget pulling.

235
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,750
How about we get an electric saw
and cut it off?

236
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,778
What?
No saws!

237
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,471
One circumcision was enough.

238
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,926
How about an acetylene torch?

239
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:06,196
I can't believe
this needs to be said.

240
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,682
No pulling, no saws, no torches.

241
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,225
What do we do?

242
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:14,758
Howard, I made cookies
for you and your little friends!

243
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,399
That's great, Mom, thanks!

244
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,385
I'll bring them up
with some Hawaiian Punch!

245
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,696
Don't come up here!

246
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:24,747
Why not?
Are you ashamed of your mother?

247
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:26,752
Yes, but that's not the point!

248
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:29,327
Get me out.

249
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,378
You have any ideas, Raj?

250
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:34,171
All I can think about
is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

251
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:45,533
Here's another possible
topic of conversation.

252
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,554
This is a big night for Sheldon.

253
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,680
Right?

254
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:51,382
Big night?

255
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:54,810
The winter solstice is a big night.

256
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,356
It's over 14 hours
in Southern California.

257
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,567
That's an amusing factoid.

258
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,026
My point is,
tonight's Sheldon's first official date.

259
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,077
Discuss.

260
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,788
It's true?

261
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:19,094
A semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus
Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count.

262
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,798
So, Amy, what about you?
Do you date much?

263
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,107
Once a year.

264
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:28,252
A deal I made with my mother
for her silence on the matter,

265
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,548
as well
as the use of her George Foreman Grill

266
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,745
that seals in the flavor
without the fat.

267
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,770
How about you?
Do you go on many dates?

268
00:15:38,242 --> 00:15:40,731
I wouldn't say many. A few.

269
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:45,978
What's...

270
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:51,242
Your characterization of approximately
171 different men as "a few."

271
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,368
What...

272
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,122
Where did you get 171 men?

273
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,757
Simple extrapolation.

274
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,002
In the three years that I've known you,
you were single for two.

275
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,963
During that time,
I saw 17 different suitors.

276
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:07,450
If we work backwards,
correcting for observation bias

277
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,975
and postulate an initial
dating age of 15...

278
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,348
Wait.
I did not start dating at 15.

279
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,683
- I'm sorry. Sixteen?
- Fourteen.

280
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:18,653
My mistake.

281
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,282
Assuming the left side of a bell curve
peaking around the present,

282
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:25,818
that would bring
the total up to 193 men.

283
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,237
Plus or minus 8 men.

284
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,240
Remarkable.

285
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,701
Did you have sexual intercourse
with all of these men?

286
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,704
Although that number
would be fairly easy to calculate.

287
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,043
Based on the number of encounters
with strange men leaving her apartment

288
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:44,327
at the morning,
plus the number of times

289
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,839
she's returned home
wearing the same clothes.

290
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,889
I think you've made your point.

291
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:53,888
So we multiply 193 minus 21 men
before the loss of virginity

292
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:58,301
so 172 times 0.18 gives us...

293
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,644
30.96 sexual partners.

294
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:03,439
Let's round that up to 31.

295
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:09,361
You are so wrong.
It's not even close to the real number.

296
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,275
I'm gonna need a drink over here.

297
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,368
This is very interesting.
Cultural perceptions are subjective.

298
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,578
Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?

299
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:27,363
Let's just all finish our dinners.

300
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,215
This is an interesting topic.

301
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,759
How many sexual encounters
have you had?

302
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:35,356
Does volunteering for a experiment
in which orgasm was achieved

303
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,474
by electronically stimulating
the pleasure centers of the brain count?

304
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,978
I should think so.

305
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,104
Then 128.

306
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:54,362
Come on.

307
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,658
Almost there.

308
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:04,375
Don't tug. No tugging.

309
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,252
Next time, take your own advice.

310
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,115
Excuse me, could you help us out?

311
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:13,425
What do we have here?

312
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:18,389
- I slipped and fell.
- We get that a lot.

313
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,226
What is this?

314
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,394
It's a robot arm.

315
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,939
Where's the rest of the robot?

316
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,107
I only built the arm.

317
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,211
'Cause that's all you needed, right?

318
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,739
Can you please just help me?!

319
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:37,823
All right.
Hang on, stay calm.

320
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:43,914
<i>I need an orderly with a wheelchair.
Robot hand grasping a man's penis here.</i>

321
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,860
You could be a little more discreet?

322
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,715
I'm sorry, we don't have a code for
"robot hand grasping a man's penis."

323
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:57,136
- Why is it hooked up to a computer?
- It's what controls the arm.

324
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,178
It's frozen.

325
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:01,015
Did you try turning it off
and back on again?

326
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,851
You see,
it's more complicated than that.

327
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
No, wait!

328
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,002
Winnie the Pooh
is out of the honey tree.

329
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,639
Now can we have cookies
and Hawaiian Punch?

330
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:24,973
You were right.

331
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,651
This was a very productive evening.

332
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:31,046
I saw a whole new side
of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

333
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:34,062
I did not have sex with 31 guys.

334
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:39,070
I'll be happy to check the math,
but numbers don't lie, Penny.

335
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:45,239
In any event. Now that Amy and I
have spent quality time together,

336
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:49,265
I feel much more confident
proceeding to the next stage.

337
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,423
And that is?

338
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,293
Using in vitro fertilization

339
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:55,898
and a surrogate uterus
to gift humanity with our progeny.

340
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,969
You're still on that?

341
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:03,583
In these uncertain times,
doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

342
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,809
You know what?
I'm gonna come at this in a new way.

343
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:11,878
If you try to make a baby with Amy
in a petri dish,

344
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,705
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

345
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,033
That's no threat.

346
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:18,910
- Mother's always wanted a grandchild.
- Really?

347
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,260
Your deeply religious
born-again Christian mother

348
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,514
wants a test-tube grandbaby
born out of wedlock?

349
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:28,836
Curses.

350
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:33,442
If I'd thought of that in the 1st place,
I could've saved this whole night.

351
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:37,321
Well, it's not that late.
You could still look for number 32.

352
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:43,361
Good night.

353
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:45,937
Howard, what's up?

354
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,590
I've decided not to procreate.

355
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:49,931
Great.

356
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,338
Howard, slow down.
What do you mean it happened again?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
