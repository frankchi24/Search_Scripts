1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,590
You know who's got to
be the bravest person

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,680
in the Marvel Universe?

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,490
Whoever has to give
She-Hulk a bikini wax.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,970
You want to talk brave,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,290
how about Captain America's
undocumented Mexican gardener?

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,640
He's not braver than

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,770
whoever uses the
bathroom after the thing?

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,410
As usual, you're all wrong.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,290
The bravest person
in the Marvel Universe

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,730
is the doctor who gives
wolverine his prostate exam.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,900
How about the guy who gets

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,200
a prostate exam from wolverine?

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,210
Now you just being silly.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,200
Wolverine's never displayed

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,740
the slightest interest in helping others

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,560
prevent prostate cancer.

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,590
Hello.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,330
Yes, the elevator's out of order£¬

19
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,210
you'll have to use the stairs.

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,560
Of course you can.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,080
Pizza dates back to the 16th century,

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,300
while the first elevator
was not installed until 1852.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,930
That means that for over 300 years,

24
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,970
people carried pizzas up stairs.

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,660
Be part of that proud tradition.

26
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll go get Penny while
that guy spits on our food.

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,640
Do you think they gave
wolverine an Adamantium prostate?

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,800
That's a stupid question.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,950
We're having a conversation about

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,330
probing the heinies of superheroes.

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,440
There are no stupid questions.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,800
Yes?

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,480
Oh, um, is Penny here?

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,640
You're Leonard, right?

35
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,940
Yeah.

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,850
Damn, it's good to
finally meet you, son.

37
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,860
Okay, I think a bit of
context here might help.

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,690
Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.

39
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,170
Oh, good.

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,240
Context.

41
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,680
Come on in, buddy.

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,540
Take a load off.

43
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,910
Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can't stay.

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,390
He just dropped by to say hello.

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,600
Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,780
I'll see you later.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,690
Bye.

48
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,440
That was odd.

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,930
Are you sure you have enough comics?

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,540
You're going to be monitoring
the telescope for 12 hours,

51
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,340
and by my estimate, you've only selected

52
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,290
seven hours of reading material.

53
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,460
That's even factoring in

54
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,860
your difficulty in parsing
American comic book idioms

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,360
Is that racist?

57
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,580
It feels racist.

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,310
Don't be oversensitive.

59
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,750
He's calling you
illiterate, not your race.

60
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,910
Oh, okay. Good.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,070
I don't need more comics.

62
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,430
Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,780
intergalactic battleship
and Indian Monopoly.

64
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,140
I don't care for novelty
editions of Monopoly.

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,680
I prefer the classics
regular and Klingon.

66
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,020
Actually, Indian Monopoly's

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,410
just like regular, except
the money's in Rupees,

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,780
instead of hotels you
build call centers,

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,520
and when you pick a chance
card, you might die of dysentery.

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,830
Just FYI,

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,150
that was racist.

72
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,720
You'll never guess what just happened.

73
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,220
You went out in the hallway,

74
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,660
Stumbled into an interdimensional portal

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,170
which brought you 5,000
years into the future,

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,160
where you took advantage
of the advanced technology

77
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,450
to build a time machine,
and now you're back

78
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,840
to bring us all with
you to the year 7010

79
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,040
where we are transported
to work at the thinkatorium

80
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,830
by telepathically
controlled flying dolphins?

81
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,850
No.

82
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,820
Aw.

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,110
Penny kissed me.

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,950
Well, who would ever guess that?

85
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,580
What... what kind of a kiss?

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,620
A big kiss. On the mouth.

87
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,890
Is it possible that she
was going for your cheek

88
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,500
and you moved and she
accidentally got lip?

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,070
That happens with me
and my mom all the time.

90
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,560
She introduced me to her father,

91
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,840
kissed me and then shut
the door in my face.

92
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,950
Maybe she was trying
to send you a message.

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,690
You think?

94
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,050
Yeah. "This man is not my father.

95
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,130
I'm being held hostage.

96
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,200
So I'm going to do

97
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,260
something insane in the hopes

98
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,740
that you'll call 911."

99
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,430
Penny kissing me is not insane.

100
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,920
She used to kiss me all the time.

101
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,800
Einstein defined insanity
as "doing the same thing

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,170
over and over again and
expecting different results. "

103
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,670
By that standard,

104
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,810
Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

105
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,540
I'm just saying,

106
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,620
it felt like it may
have meant something.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
Ah, this takes me back.

108
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,280
Leonard obsessing about Penny.

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,450
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love your new stuff,

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,120
but once in a while it's
nice to hear the hits.

111
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,790
Ooh, ooh!

112
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,610
Do "Our babies will be
smart and beautiful. "

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,120
That one always makes me laugh.

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
Why do I bother talking to you people?

115
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,010
If it'll make you feel
better, we rarely listen.

116
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,410
Hey, can I talk to
you out here for a sec?

117
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,470
Yeah, sure.

118
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,250
I'm starting to think we're
never going to see that pizza.

119
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,940
So you're probably wondering
what that was all about.

120
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,900
What, uh, the kissing and everything?

121
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,200
Nah, women do that to me all the time.

122
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,680
Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of

123
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,350
told my father we got
back together again.

124
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,730
What? Why?

125
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,080
Well, you're the first guy

126
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,520
he's ever really approved of, you know?

127
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,120
You're a scientist who went to college

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,830
and you don't have a neck tattoo

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
or outstanding warrants or... or a baby.

130
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,770
What kind of guys did
you used to go out with?

131
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,010
Just guys.

132
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,560
Anyway, when I told him we
split up, he was heartbroken,

133
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,470
and he kept bugging me: "How's Leonard?

134
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
why can't you get back
together with Leonard?

135
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,120
I bet Leonard never tipped
a cow over on himself. "

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,780
So to get him off my back,

137
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,390
I told him we worked things out.

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,610
Really?

139
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,680
How... how'd we manage that?

140
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,380
What?

141
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,670
I mean, did you apologize?

142
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,170
Did you have to woo me?

143
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,340
Get over yourself.

144
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,020
I whistled, you came running.

145
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,270
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

146
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,450
Okay, why are you arguing about this?

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,170
I'm just saying,

148
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,200
if we fake got back together,

149
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,910
that's totally not how it fake happened.

150
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,620
Oh...

151
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,900
Okay, whatever.

152
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,970
Will you please just play
along until my dad leaves?

153
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,270
Hold on, you actually want me

154
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,430
to deceive your father with some sort of

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,180
sham playacting and kissing?

156
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,620
Cause I'm good with that.

157
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,350
Penny, you out here?

158
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,900
Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.

159
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,950
Relax, I've seen you do a
lot worse with a lot stupider.

160
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,680
See?

161
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,730
He doesn't mind.

162
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,960
So, Leonard, I'm taking your gal out

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,500
for a steak dinner, you want to join us?

164
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,710
Oh, dad, that's nice,
but Leonard has to work.

165
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,590
Right, Leonard?

166
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,090
Uh, I do, I have to work.

167
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,750
But I'm gonna blow that
off to spend the evening

168
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,290
with my sweetie and her
father, 'cause, you know,

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,030
just the kind of boyfriend I am.

170
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
Oh.

171
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,290
Come here, you.

172
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,410
C-7.

173
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,320
Miss.

174
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,260
How could that be a miss?

175
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,210
C-6 was a hit,
c-8 was a hit.

176
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,460
Part of your starship has to be on c-7.

177
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,510
Not if it has a hole in the middle.

178
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,020
What kind of spaceship
has a hole in the middle?

179
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,900
A romulan battle bagel?

180
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,430
Knock-knock.

181
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,760
Oh, great, you made it.

182
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,930
Come on in.

183
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,070
I invited her.

184
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,960
So where's the telescope?

185
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,730
It's in hawaii, but Raj
controls it from here.

186
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,690
He's hoping to see epsilon
eridani dim, which would be

187
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,940
evidence of a planet orbiting it.

188
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,860
So we just sit and stare at the screen,

189
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,660
waiting for something to happen?

190
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,160
I did it with you when
we rented "The Notebook".

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,010
Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure.

192
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,660
You'd better open up that bottle of wine

193
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,700
or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.

194
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,350
Excuse me.

195
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,210
I can't be drinking, I'm about to make

196
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,970
an important scientific discovery here.

197
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,430
What? Galileo did his best
work while drinking wine.

198
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,440
How do you know that?

199
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,800
Well, he was Italian.

200
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,820
It's a reasonable assumption.

201
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,810
Dude, can you even open your mouth

202
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,820
without spewing a cultural stereotype?

203
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,750
Oh, I... I'm sorry,
Galileo drank diet sprite.

204
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,260
Look, you're my best
friend, she's my girlfriend,

205
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,530
you should bond.

206
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,410
You know, like you and my mom did.

207
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,050
Your mom creeps the hell out of me.

208
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,940
Yes, but she's stopped calling
you slumdog millionaire.

209
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,630
I do appreciate that.

210
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,810
Here we go.

211
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,490
I'd like to propose a toast.

212
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,860
To science and friendship.

213
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Hold on. Wait.

214
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,110
No, it's okay, go ahead.

215
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,700
What?

216
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, I was working with

217
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,980
Penicillin-resistant
gonorrhea in the lab today

218
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,220
and I was just trying to
remember if I washed my hands.

219
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,340
Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.

220
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,660
My pleasure.

221
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,520
It's nice to have dinner
with a boyfriend of Penny's

222
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,320
that knows how to use a napkin.

223
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,680
So not funny, dad.

224
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,560
Let me tell you about this one
genius she was going out with,

225
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,950
This... this fella Donnie.

226
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh, will you please let it go?

227
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,660
Donnie was gonna make
millions turning farm waste

228
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,050
into biofuel and selling
it to the government.

229
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,300
A lot of people are doing that.

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,090
Oh, see?

231
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,060
Yeah, but all Donnie did was
mix pig poop with a little water

232
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,270
and pump it into his mom's Camry.

233
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,640
Yeah, that's great.

234
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,380
It's a funny story. Moving on.

235
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,520
And Donnie was a rocket
scientist compared to that boy

236
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,670
who wanted to get beer
pong into the olympics.

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,920
What was his name, sweetheart?

238
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,330
Curtis, and I'm pretty
sure he was joking.

239
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,220
I don't know.

240
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,200
That petition looked real to me.

241
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,340
Yeah, okay, I think this ends

242
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,420
the ex-boyfriend
portion of our evening.

243
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,160
Well, I'm just glad you
finally found yourself a keeper.

244
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,530
Thanks, wyatt.

245
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,300
I'm a keeper.

246
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,430
Leonard, you want to
come in for a nightcap?

247
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,650
Oh, gee, dad, he'd love to,

248
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,420
but Leonard has to work in the morning.

249
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,330
Maybe I could go in a little late.

250
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,610
No, no, no, you can't.

251
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,660
Your career is far too important.

252
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,800
Behind every great
man is a nagging woman

253
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,580
who won't let him have any
fun, am I right, Leonard?

254
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,710
Don't I know it.

255
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,950
Well, good night, son.

256
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,010
Good night, Wyatt.

257
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,500
Oh, good night, honey.

258
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,570
Good night.

259
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,950
I love you.

260
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,780
Love you, too.

261
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
Oh, friggety-frak.

262
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,290
Not this again.

263
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,230
Three, four, five... pass
go, get 2,000 Rupees...

264
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,390
Six, seven.

265
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,800
Whoops. Can't go any further.
There's a sacred cow in my way.

266
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,710
Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend

267
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
to cool it with the cow jokes.

268
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,880
It won't help.

269
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,430
Once he finds a joke he
likes, he sticks with it.

270
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,360
Yeah.

271
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,990
Like his haircut material.

272
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,970
Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?

273
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,950
"No. I got them all cut. "

274
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,880
Which is still so funny.

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,120
And when you go to a Chinese restaurant,

276
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,680
he always gets the same
fortune in his fortune cookie.

277
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,240
Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner

278
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,730
in a Chinese fortune cookie factory. "

279
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,280
Okay, I think that's enough about me.

280
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,880
He's right. Let's
make fun of his mother.

281
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,760
"Howard, come rub my feet!

282
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,990
My corns are killing me!"

283
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,030
"Howard, help me out of the tub!

284
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,030
I'm stuck again!"

285
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:06,990
Coming.

286
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,520
Hey, lovebug.

287
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,550
Shut up.

288
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,030
You know what I've been
doing for the last hour?

289
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,850
Mm, dreamily doodling
"Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

290
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,300
in a notebook?

291
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,590
Listening to my father go on and on

292
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,190
about what a great guy you are.

293
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,790
You got to admit, I
am... I'm delightful.

294
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,200
Why are you making this so difficult?

295
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,260
It's not difficult for me.

296
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,830
I'm having fun.

297
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,650
Leonard.

298
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,480
What do you want me to
do? You started this.

299
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,300
Do you want to go over and
tell him we're broken up?

300
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,630
No.
- Well, then, what do you want?

301
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,450
I don't know.

302
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,810
Don't you think that's
something you should

303
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,950
have figured out before
you stomped over here?

304
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,240
Maybe.

305
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,490
Leonard, Penny, excellent.

306
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,310
I'd like to say I'm very happy
that you're back together,

307
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,290
and if I can figure out a way to do so

308
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,410
and sound sincere, I will.

309
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,390
In the meantime,

310
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,240
I'd like to go over
some proposed changes

311
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,710
to the roommate agreement
specifically to address

312
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
Penny's annoying personal habits.

313
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,420
Oh, my God.

314
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,230
What personal habits?
- I have a list.

315
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,580
FYI, overuse of the phrase
"oh, my god" is number 12.

316
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,890
Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this

317
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,730
because Leonard and I
are not... - Ba-ba-ba-ba.

318
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,510
Are you sure you want
to include him in this?

319
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,090
Include me in what?

320
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,510
Is there a plot afoot?

321
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,220
I'll have no truck with plots.

322
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,370
No, you're right.

323
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,870
No, there's... There's no
plots, no trucks, no feet.

324
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,670
So what other annoying
habits shall we discuss?

325
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,940
Uh, we don't discuss anything.

326
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,710
Leonard is the signatory
to the Roommate Agreement.

327
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,430
As such, he bears responsibility

328
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,290
for all your infractions
and must pay all fines.

329
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,460
Fines?
- Yes.

330
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,040
If Penny's going to be
spending nights here again,

331
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,370
you'll need to set up an escrow account.

332
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,590
Sign here.

333
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,610
Hello, Hawaii.

334
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,160
This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena.

335
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,780
I'd like you to reposition
the telescope, please.

336
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,580
Scarlett Johansson's house!

337
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,370
I'm kidding, Hawaii.

338
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,660
Mahalo.

339
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,570
Whoo!

340
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,700
It might have been a mistake

341
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,020
to open that second bottle of wine.

342
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,960
Well, live and learn.

343
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,830
So, Raj, do you think this
planet you're looking for

344
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,130
could have an atmosphere
that supports life?

345
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,160
Maybe.

346
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,450
If it did, I'd be famous.

347
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,140
I'd be on the cover of magazines.

348
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,850
And then, instead of living alone

349
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,410
in my tiny apartment,
I'd have a big mansion.

350
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,480
That sounds great.

351
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,390
It is.

352
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,050
If you like wandering
around a big, empty house

353
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,050
with no one to love you.

354
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,170
We'd come visit you.
- No, you wouldn't.

355
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,900
You'd be intimidated
by my wealth and fame.

356
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,620
My only friends would be

357
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,540
my genetically engineered monkey butler.

358
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,480
And the little people I hired
to be my living chess set.

359
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,730
He's taking a turn to
the dark side, isn't he?

360
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,500
Hold on. He could come back.

361
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,150
Oh, what's the point of everything?

362
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,490
Nope. He's gone.

363
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,530
You know it's been more than a year

364
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,530
since i've even kissed a girl?

365
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,150
What about that hookup at
Comic-Con you told me about?

366
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,400
Oh, grow up. I was lying.

367
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,020
I lie all the time.
Nobody wants to kiss me.

368
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,760
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

369
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,610
Raj, you have to know
you're a wonderful man.

370
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,340
There are a lot of girls out
there who'll want to kiss you.

371
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,840
Where?

372
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,490
You just have to look.

373
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,080
No!

374
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,900
Well, this was fun.

375
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,810
Oh! I think I got a nibble.

376
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,270
Oh, be careful.

377
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,710
Give him some line.

378
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,270
Okay, now reel him in.

379
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,630
Oh, look at that baby.

380
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,040
They're really biting, huh?

381
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,440
Yeah. They do that
when you set it on easy.

382
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,340
Oh, that's me.

383
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,000
Hello.

384
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,400
Oh, hi, sweetie.

385
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,440
Yeah, I got up early and
didn't want to wake you,

386
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,560
so I went out for coffee and
ran into Leonard on the way back.

387
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,560
Guess what... We're fishing.

388
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,530
Yeah. Right here on his couch.

389
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,320
Hey, baby. I love you!

390
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,320
That's Leonard

391
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,840
says he loves you.

392
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,680
What?

393
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,360
I see.

394
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,750
The whole thing's bull squirt, huh?

395
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,890
Well, that's very disappointing.

396
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Bye.

397
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,730
Oh, hey.

398
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,170
There's been something I've
been meaning to tell you.

399
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,130
I can't believe you
would lie to me like that.

400
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,860
Just for the record, I did
not want to be a part of this.

401
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,250
I'll get to you in a minute.

402
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,710
No hurry.

403
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,090
That my own daughter thinks
I don't love her enough

404
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,040
To support her no matter
what choices she makes...

405
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,470
Well, that hurts me deeply.

406
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,490
I'm sorry, daddy...
- Let me finish.

407
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,350
Oh.

408
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,680
I thought we were past the days

409
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,010
when you would try to
pull the wool over my eyes.

410
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,370
Telling me the baggie in your
underwear drawer is potpourri?

411
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,330
And the pee stick in your bathroom

412
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,910
Is to check for diabetes?

413
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,850
You know, I'm sorry.

414
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,670
You're a grown woman,
and I respect your right

415
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,380
To make your own
decisions, but all I ask

416
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,010
is you respect me enough
to be honest about them.

417
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,720
You're right. Look, from now
on, I will tell you the truth.

418
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,290
Thank you. Now, why don't
you go and put some clothes on

419
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,450
and we'll grab a bite to eat
before I head for the airport.

420
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,890
Now you.
- Daddy, he had nothing to do...

421
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,370
Keep walking.
- Okay.

422
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,010
Please, please, please
don't give up on her.

423
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,440
What?

424
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,150
I can't go back to
the skateboard idiots,

425
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,640
the white rappers and all those

426
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,600
Sweaty dumb-asses with
their backwards hats.

427
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,080
Gee, I don't know if
it's in the cards, sir.

428
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,560
Then, stack the deck.

429
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,060
Cheat.

430
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,160
Lie. I don't care.

431
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,890
I want grandkids before I die,

432
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,140
and I want them to grow up
in a house without wheels.

433
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,590
I'll give it a shot.

434
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,540
Thank you.

435
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,370
Now I'm going to do something
here to help you along.

436
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,960
Excuse me?
- Just don't panic.

437
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,880
Now, get your sorry,
lying ass out of my face

438
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,040
and make sure I never see it again!

439
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,550
Oh, the reverse psychology thing.

440
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,640
I see. That's very clever.

441
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,240
Don't yap. Just get out.

442
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
I'll friend you on Facebook.

443
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,030
Oh, there you are.

444
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,200
Just so you know, I was up all night,

445
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,910
but I have finally completed

446
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,190
The Penny-specific section
of the new roommate agreement.

447
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,010
Yeah, well, not necessary.

448
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,740
We broke up again.

449
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,430
Do you even think about
other people, leonard?

450
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,030
Do you?

451
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,870
Hey.
- Oh, how'd it go last night?

452
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,790
Oh, you know.

453
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,600
Same old, same old.

454
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,210
Looked through a
telescope, saw some stars.

455
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,230
Big whoop.

456
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,080
Really?

457
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,970
You waited months for
time with that telescope.

458
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,630
What happened?

459
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,640
Why? You writing a book?

460
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,820
I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

461
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,540
Last night, Raj
accidentally made contact

462
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,350
With an alien civilization

463
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,330
and has been ordered by
the United States government

464
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,090
To keep it a secret.

465
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,780
Nothing happened.

466
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,400
Can we please just change the subject?

467
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,160
That sounds rehearsed.

468
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,040
We are not alone.

469
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,440
Hey.

470
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,860
Hey.
- Hello.

471
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,200
Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,150
You get to play with raj's
big telescope last night?

473
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,090
Whoa.

474
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,370
Where did that come from?

475
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,730
He never touched my telescope.

476
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,560
Way to go shutting up.

477
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,830
I did shut up. Now you shut up.

478
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,460
Fine.
- Thank you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
