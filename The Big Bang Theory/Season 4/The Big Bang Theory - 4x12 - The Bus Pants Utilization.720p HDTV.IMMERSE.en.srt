1
00:00:02,141 --> 00:00:03,624
Ma, Ma, calm down.

2
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:04,585
Listen to me.

3
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,419
I know it says click
with the mouse,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,089
but on a laptop,
the trackpad is the mouse.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,624
Now, put your finger on it.

6
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,260
Doesn't matter which finger.

7
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,296
Good choice.

8
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:20,200
Now move it down
to your e-mail icon.

9
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:22,068
Yeah, the little envelope.

10
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,504
What do you mean,
"What does it look like?"

11
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,573
It looks like an envelope!

12
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,241
Fine, you don't like
the computer,

13
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:30,043
don't use it!

14
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:33,580
Sure, we can exchange it
for a salad spinner. Good-bye!

15
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,082
(sighs)

16
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,919
That's a Hanukkah present
you're regretting, huh?

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,489
I won't say that
all senior citizens

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,159
who can't master technology
should be publicly flogged,

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,661
but if we made an
example of one or two,

20
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,097
it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,134
I had a great idea.

22
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:55,602
You know how
we're always having

23
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,504
to stop and solve
differential equations,

24
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:59,356
like when you're doing
Fourier analysis,

25
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,674
or using the
Schrodinger equation?

26
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,893
Howard doesn't.
He's only an engineer.

27
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:08,381
I was thinking,
we could write a little app

28
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,083
that would use
handwriting recognition,

29
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,352
and then run it through a
symbolic evaluation engine.

30
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:13,653
You just use your smartphone,

31
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,823
take a picture
of the equation and bam!

32
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:20,927
You know what's a great app?
The one that makes fart noises.

33
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,733
You know, Leonard,

34
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,501
that's actually
a valid idea.

35
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:29,936
Very good.

36
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:33,440
Can you say that and not
make it sound like I'm a cat

37
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,176
who learned
how to use the toilet?

38
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,044
No.

39
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:40,013
The two achievements
are equally surprising

40
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,481
and equally admirable,

41
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,782
though if pressed,

42
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:45,218
I'd have to give
a slight edge to the cat.

43
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,020
I'll save you the pain
and nervousness

44
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,388
of waiting for the answer.

45
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:52,525
I agree to be part of
your project. Congratulations.

46
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:54,594
Oh, yay for me.

47
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:57,280
What about you guys?

48
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,415
I can't promise anything,

49
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,700
but people do make money
off stuff like this.

50
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,118
A few extra bucks
would be nice.

51
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,070
I could finally move out
of my mother's house.

52
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,338
Where would you go?

53
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,941
I always dreamed about building
a little place of my own

54
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,809
over the garage.

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,313
You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off from work

56
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,248
and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

57
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:16,483
What's that?

58
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,818
Some weird sex thing?

59
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,320
No.

60
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,988
You take pretty girls underwater

61
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,257
in your private submarine,
and you show them fish.

62
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,961
Why does everything
have to be dirty with you?

63
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:30,363
I was thinking we could work
on this at night,

64
00:02:30,364 --> 00:02:32,332
and then maybe
in a couple of weeks,

65
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,033
we'll have ourselves an app
to sell.

66
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,301
Sounds like
we're in business.

67
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,904
I think we should take a picture
to capture this moment.

68
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,706
Yeah.
Oh!

69
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,408
(passing gas)

70
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:48,281

handwriting-recognition

What?

86
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,690
You have so few good ideas,
Leonard.

87
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,592
And you're just going
to spill the beans

00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,195

89
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,235
Who, me?

90
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:41,454

Whatever your secret is,

I'm sure it's boring,
so I'm not interested.

102
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,695
It's not boring at all.

103
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,296
You see,
in higher order mathematics,

104
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:08,498
there are certain sets

105
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,266
of equations that...
Bored.

106
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,318
Satisfied?

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,636
Hardly.

108
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:16,339
Consider this unlikely
but very plausible scenario.

109
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,075
A young woman alone
in the big city.

110
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,476
Her ridiculous dream

111
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:23,279
of becoming an actress
lies shattered about her.

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,847
Hey, wait a minute.

113
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,816
Well, hang on. Let's
see where he's going.

114
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,251
Then it hits her.

115
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,019
How is she going to survive?

116
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,539
I mean, she has no prospects,
no marketable skills.

117
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,007
And then one day,

118
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,126
she meets a group of geniuses

119
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,061
and their friend Howard.

120
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,932
Hey, I...

121
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,901
Hang on.
Let's see where he's going.

122
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,638
She befriends them,
and then lies in wait

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,274
until they reveal
a marketable idea,

124
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:54,210
which she steals
and sells to the highest bidder.

125
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,345
- That is ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

126
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:57,947
Let's see you come up
with an explanation

127
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:00,650
as to why this woman hangs out
with us all the time.

128
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:05,988
Oh, great. You know what?

129
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:07,573
I've already mooched
dinner off you guys.

130
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,925
I don't need to listen to this.

131
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,527
There's your answer--
free food.

132
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,745
(door closes)

133
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,330
All right,
I've taken the liberty

134
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,265
of drafting
these workflow charts

135
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,968
which outline our various duties
and the path we will follow

136
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:21,304
as we develop
our ground-breaking new app.

137
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,875
Hey, why am I in charge
of phone support?

138
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,946
Seems a bit racist.

139
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,714
A customer service
representative

140
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,250
with an Indian accent
will create the impression

141
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,852
we're a vast enterprise that
uses overseas call centers.

142
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,487
Oh.

143
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,822
Very clever.

144
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,891
But still racist.

145
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:45,928
Duly noted, Steve
from Wichita.

146
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,565
Why am I listed as your
executive assistant?

147
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,335
Because the word "secretary"
has fallen into disrepute.

148
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:55,237
FYI, my mother's
birthday is coming up.

149
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm going to need you
to pick up a present.

150
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:01,460
Okay, we need
to stop for a minute.

151
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,012
Leonard, please,
we can talk during our break.

152
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:04,480
We have one coming up
at midnight.

153
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,649
We'll need snacks.

154
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,950
Sheldon, you're not in charge.

155
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,802
It's my idea.
I'm in charge.

156
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,053
Oh, of course you are.

157
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,388
Look at the organizational
chart.

158
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,889
You're clearly listed
as founder.

159
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,025
Well, yes, and you're listed

160
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,060
as Chief Executive Officer,

161
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,830
Chief Financial Officer
and Chief Operating Officer.

162
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,448
You missed
Chief Science Officer,

163
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,334
Chairman of the Board, and Head
of the Secret Santa Committee.

164
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:27,370
Okay.

165
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:30,122
You need to get clear
on this right now.

166
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,174
I am in charge of this project.

167
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:37,797
Ooh. Leonard's going all
alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass...

168
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,282
All right. All right,
I'm not going to argue with you.

169
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,468
Sheldon Cooper is nothing
if not a team player.

170
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,953
Dr. Hofstadter,
you have the conn.

171
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,891
Thank you.

172
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,159
I thought we might start

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,844
by talking
about the user interface.

174
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,396
Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.

175
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,833
So this button here

176
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,135
will allow you
to scan a new equation,

177
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,704
but over here,
you can press this,

178
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,240
and just substitute new values
for the coefficients.

179
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,993
Good one, boss.

180
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:10,780
What?

181
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,148
This diagram.

182
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:14,617
I assume
you were opening with a joke.

183
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:18,688
It certainly buoyed up
this employee's esprit de corps.

184
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,924
It's not a joke.
It's the real design.

185
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:24,993
In that case, may I offer
27 little tweaks

186
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:27,296
to make it
slightly less embarrassing?

187
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:29,331
Sheldon, I think
this will work.

188
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:30,933
Let's just try it my way.

189
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,435
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

190
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:33,686
I assumed that you wanted

191
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,771
candid truth-telling
from your employees,

192
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:38,240
but I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering

193
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,876
of complacent
yes-men.

194
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,111
Are you done?

195
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,046
If you say so, boss.

196
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:48,084
So right now,
this button-press event

197
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,052
is just triggering
a dummy procedure call...

198
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,088
How about this
for the app name?

199
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:54,890
The Surprisingly
Helpful Equation-Linked

200
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,410
Differential
Optimized Numerator.

201
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,964
So it spells "Sheldon."

202
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,083
Does it?

203
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,168
A happy accident.

204
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,905
We're not doing
names now. Howard?

205
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,924
Like I was saying, right now
it's just a dummy procedure,

206
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,242
but eventually,
it will drop us into...

207
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,343
SHELDON:
All right, fine.

208
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:15,878
If we're not going
to give it a name,

209
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,046
can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

210
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:20,049
- No.
- Hear me out.

211
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,418
The atomic bomb
was The Manhattan Project.

212
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,271
Windows 95 was originally
Project Chicago.

213
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:29,759
For our app, I would humbly
suggest Project Nodlehs.

214
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,195
That's just
"Sheldon" backwards.

215
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,197
Another happy accident.

216
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,934
We're not wasting time
with names right now.

217
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,569
I see.

218
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,238
Is that decision open
for discussion?

219
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,756
No.

220
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,609
Is the decision to not
discuss it open for discussion?

221
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,777
No.

222
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,261
HOWARD: Again,

223
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,180
right now it's just
a dummy procedure,

224
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:53,616
but eventually,
it will drop us into...

225
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,301
I call for a vote
of no confidence

226
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,685
and an immediate change
in leadership.

227
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,087
Sheldon, stop it.

228
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,189
When in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary

229
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,440
to dissolve the bonds

230
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,192
that tie three competent
scientists together...

231
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:05,093
That's enough, Sheldon.
All right, let's get right to the vote.

232
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:06,979
Show of hands--
all those opposed

233
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,798
to Leonard
and his reign of tyranny.

234
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,735
Okay, that's it, you're fired.

235
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,703
Really?

236
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,672
Why?

237
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,910
Because you're impossible
to work with.

238
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:22,628
I see.

239
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,717
And is that open
for discussion?

240
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:35,391
What are you doing?

241
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:38,360
Oh. Good morning, shoemaker.

242
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,596
I think you'll be pleased

243
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,565
with what the elves were up to
last night.

244
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,466
I fired you.

245
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,735
Oh, I know. I'm now
an independent contractor.

246
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:50,156
No, you are
now nothing.

247
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,108
You have no connection
to this project whatsoever.

248
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,544
But I made it better.

249
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,780
I don't want it better.
I want it my way.

250
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:01,217
Well, that speaks volumes,
doesn't it?

251
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:05,120
All right, I suppose
I'll go put on my bus pants.

252
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,373
What the hell are bus pants?

253
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,825
They are pants one wears
over one's regular pants

254
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,327
when one sits on bus seats

255
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,696
that other people
have previously sat on.

256
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,183
But perhaps
from your lofty heights

257
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,101
atop the corporate ladder,
you've lost touch

258
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,137
with the struggles
of the common man.

259
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:25,007
Look, I'm still happy
to drive you to work.

260
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:26,842
Nothing's changed
in that regard.

261
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,812
We're still roommates,
we're still friends.

262
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:32,248
Except you identified me,
your best friend,

263
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:34,750
as a gangrenous limb
that needed to be severed

264
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,368
from the organism
and tossed away.

265
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,321
The desperate act
of a little man

266
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,790
with a big Napoleon complex.

267
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,627
You know what?

268
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,929
Go put on your bus pants.

269
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:54,483
Mm. Last night,
I had a dream

270
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,097
we got so rich from the app,

271
00:10:56,098 --> 00:10:58,500
you and I bought matching
side-by-side mansions.

272
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,302
But...

273
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:01,753
there was a secret tunnel

274
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:04,840
connecting your front yard
to my back yard.

275
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,279
What do you think that means?

276
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:16,401
It means after we play handball,
I'm showering at home.

277
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,623
Good morning, Friend Howard.

278
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:22,924
Friend Raj.

279
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,460
I see you gentlemen
are enjoying beverages.

280
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:28,864
Perhaps they would taste better
out of these.

281
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,200
"World's Greatest
Astrophysicist"?

282
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,769
Don't thank me. You earned it.

283
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:39,207
"Howard Wolowitz."

284
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:43,278
Why not
"World's Greatest Engineer"?

285
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,379
I'm sorry.

286
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,114
I typed that
into the label maker,

287
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,449
but I just couldn't press enter.

288
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,634
Now down to business.

289
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:52,821
What would it take for you
to abandon Leonard

290
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:54,356
and join me in a rival company?

291
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:56,525
Unless, of course,
the mugs are sufficient,

292
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:59,060
in which case, welcome aboard.

293
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:01,229
We're not quitting on Leonard.

294
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,065
I understand.
Your loyalty is admirable.

295
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:07,702
But what if I were
to up the ante?

296
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:09,871
What are you talking about?

297
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:12,407
Monogrammed key chains

298
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:15,210
with a built-in laser pointer.

299
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:19,915
No?

300
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,801
How about can cozies

301
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:26,421
emblazoned
with our university mascot?

302
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:29,224
Go, Beavers.

303
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,260
I'll be back.

304
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:37,098
Okay, let's try this one.

305
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,336
"Spherical Hankel function."

306
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:42,904
Hold on.

307
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:44,072
That's it!

308
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:45,273
Eureka!

309
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,108
Hey, we agreed when
it was "Eureka" time,

310
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:49,110
we were all gonna
say it together.

311
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:50,311
Fine.

312
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,312
Let's say it together.

313
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,348
No. The moment
has passed.

314
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,051
Greetings, gentlemen.

315
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:58,086
How goes your
little project?

316
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:01,322
You mean,
"Project Lenwoloppali"?

317
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,626
Ah, a combination
of all your names.

318
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:05,710
Very clever.

319
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,496
I assume "Koothranardowitz"
was taken?

320
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,833
We're actually
scanning equations

321
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,201
and getting good results.

322
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:15,520
Oh, well then,
by all means, carry on.

323
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,439
I wouldn't want
to impede your progress.

324
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,941
Howard, did you solve
the install time problem yet?

325
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,476
No. It's a little tricky.

326
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,445
I'm gonna try having it pick up
the libraries dyn...

327
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:27,449
(theremin whirring)

328
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:32,320
What are you doing?!

329
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,124
Playing the theremin.

330
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,895
No. I mean, what are you
doing with a theremin?

331
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:43,431
Playing it.

332
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:46,668
I've loved the theremin
from the first moment

333
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,803
I heard the original
<i>Star Trek</i> theme.

334
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:50,271
And it's been killing me

335
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:53,241
that it just sits in my closet,
gathering dust.

336
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:56,177
(playing phrases from
<i>Star Trek</i> theme)

337
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,524
Sheldon!
We're working here!

338
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,792
That's all right.

339
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:14,663
I can barely hear you
over my theremin.

340
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,401
(theremin squeaks off)

341
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:22,971
Well, that was a
little uncalled for.

342
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,939
No, that was
completely called for.

343
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,291
We need quiet.

344
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,643
So, your project is more
important than mine?

345
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:32,881
Well, seeing as your project
is to sabotage my project, yes.

346
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:34,449
Don't beat around the bush,
Leonard.

347
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,483
If you don't want me here,

348
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:37,418
just say the word,
and I'll leave.

349
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,359
Could have beaten
around the bush a little.

362
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,635
Leonard kicked me out
of my own apartment.

363
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,837
And his app team.

364
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:30,972
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

365
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,857
He wouldn't drive me
to work today.

366
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,026
I had to wear
my bus pants.

367
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,945
- Is that so?
- Yes.

368
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,346
And they're
still sticky.

369
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:39,514
Aw...

370
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:41,616
Probably going to have
to throw them away.

371
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:43,718
(sad, squeaky note)

372
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:46,154
Hey, you don't need
Leonard and his app.

373
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,422
You can make one with me.

374
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:49,190
With you?

375
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,759
(squeaky note plays)

376
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,261
Seriously,
I have a great idea for one.

377
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,797
Is it better than your idea
to move to Los Angeles

378
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:57,499
and become a famous actress?

379
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:00,645
Okay, look...

380
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,540
when you see someone
wearing shoes you like,

381
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,925
you just snap a picture of them,

382
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,460
and the app goes on the Internet

383
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,994
to find out
where you can buy them.

384
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:09,297
That's your app idea?

385
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:10,231
Well, you don't like it?

386
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:12,333
I didn't say that.
But no, I don't.

387
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,869
Why not?

388
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,371
Oh, Penny,
where do I begin?

389
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:18,839
The simple-mindedness
of your idea

390
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,443
is exceeded only by its
crass consumerism and banality.

391
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:24,345
And Leonard didn't want
to work with you?

392
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:25,980
Imagine that.

393
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:27,782
I know, it's baffling.

Sheldon, I'm gonna
make some cocoa.

397
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,460
Do you want some?

398
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,229
Do you make it
with milk or water?

399
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,897
- Milk.
- Real cocoa?

400
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:44,966
That's what it says
on the packet.

401
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,168
Do you have
those little marshmallows?

402
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,136
No, sorry.

403
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,571
Well, I suppose
it's appropriate.

404
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:51,673
What does that mean?

405
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:55,476
A disappointing drink
for a disappointing day.

406
00:16:58,314 --> 00:16:59,580
Hey, look at this.

407
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:01,616
20 people from the university
have already signed up

408
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,117
for our private beta.

409
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:04,385
I'm telling you,

410
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:06,454
the Lenwoloppali
Differential Equation Scanner

411
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:09,324
meets a real need.
We've got a hit.

412
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,792
What do you think we
should sell it for?

413
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,394
Well, based on the fact
that our potential market

414
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,430
is about 70 or 80 guys,

415
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:16,564
and you want a submarine,

416
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:18,399
I'd say about a
million dollars a pop.

417
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,703
Well, what if we put out a lite
version for half a million?

418
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:23,504
You know,
get the word of mouth going.

419
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,708
Hi. I'm sorry
to bother you guys,

420
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,509
but you've got to come
take your Sheldon back.

421
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,311
What's he doing
in your apartment?

422
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:32,747
Well, he was moping down in the
lobby, so I invited him over.

423
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:34,015
Now I regret it.

424
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:36,634
Why do you regret...
Uh, never mind, stupid question.

425
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:39,020
Look, can't you just let him
play with you until bedtime?

426
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:42,106
We're not playing.

427
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:43,291
This is real work.

428
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,460
We're going to
be hundred-aires.

429
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,162
Okay. What if I got him
to apologize

430
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:49,530
and promise to behave?

431
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,603
Then I guess we would
let him back on the app team,

432
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:57,905
and while we're doing that,
you could take an aerial tour

433
00:17:57,906 --> 00:18:01,075
of L.A. on your flying pig.

434
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:03,211
Okay. Wait right here.

435
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,479
(door closes)

436
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,914
I'll tell you one thing.
If I get rich enough,

437
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:10,118
that's the kind of girl I want
to take on a submarine ride.

438
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:14,222
And yes, that time,
I meant it to be dirty.

439
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,959
Really?

440
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,594
Leonard wants me back?

441
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:22,730
Oh, yes. He says they
are lost without you.

442
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:26,401
Well, we sure saw that coming.

443
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:27,852
That's right.

444
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:29,137
You know what
I'm going to do?

445
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:32,640
I am going to sit here
and just let them stew.

446
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:36,611
(playing sustained notes)

447
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:37,612
No, no, no. You know,

448
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,247
they have
suffered enough.

449
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,716
Everybody's
suffered enough.

450
00:18:41,717 --> 00:18:44,886
The thing is, you're going
to have to offer him

451
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,921
a face-saving
way out of this.

452
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,089
How?

453
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,290
Say you're sorry.

454
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,925
Oh, no.

455
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:54,429
Mrs. Mary Cooper
didn't raise her no liars.

456
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,532
Okay. Um...

457
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,333
How about this? You know
how you're always trying

458
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,535
to learn about sarcasm?

459
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:02,303
No.
No?

460
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:03,971
I was being sarcastic.

461
00:19:05,073 --> 00:19:07,308
Oh. Good for you.

462
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,710
So all you have to do here
is say you're sorry to Leonard,

463
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,446
but say it
sarcastically.

464
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,648
Of course.

465
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,584
He will hear it as an attempt
to mend fences,

466
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:18,953
as opposed
to the withering condemnation

467
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:20,721
you and I will know it to be.

468
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:23,241
Yeah. Yeah, that
was my plan.

469
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,492
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

470
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,026
Oh, by the way,
thank you

471
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:27,895
for the delicious cocoa.

472
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:28,896
Oh, you're welcome.

473
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:30,698
Boy, I'm getting
good at this.

474
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:36,370
Okay, now that you're
back on the team,

475
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:37,371
let's get you caught up.

476
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,874
Before you begin,
let me say again

477
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,944
how deeply sorry I am
for my earlier behavior

478
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:47,181
and how much I respect
and admire your leadership.

479
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:50,985
Thank you.

480
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,457
So as you can see,

481
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,293
not only can you store
your favorite equations,

482
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:01,496
but you can forward them
to your friends

483
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:04,799
or post them on Facebook
right from the app.

484
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,868
Well, I must say,
I am impressed.

485
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:07,952
Thanks.

486
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:10,204
You all have clearly put
in a lot of hard work.

487
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,372
We have.

488
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:12,607
As a result,
you have taken

489
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,742
the most important step
on the road to success:

490
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:16,427
learning what not to do.

491
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:18,245
Now, let's start fresh.

492
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:20,848
Howard, we're going
to need some tea.

493
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,070
Okay, these are Uggs.

494
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,773
These are Crocs.

495
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,142
These are knockoff
Manolo Blahniks.

496
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:36,710
Bored.

497
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:39,696
Look, you said it yourself,
we have to create a database

498
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,815
before you can write
an alga-thingy.

499
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:43,216
Algorithm.

500
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:45,619
You see, Penny, Alan Turing
defined an algorithm...

501
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,387
Bored.

502
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:48,388
Okay.

503
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:50,190
These are Steve Maddens.

504
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:52,092
These are Nine West.

505
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:55,596
These are Target. Oh, but don't
they look like Chanel?

506
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:56,797
These are
Michael Kors...

507
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,165
