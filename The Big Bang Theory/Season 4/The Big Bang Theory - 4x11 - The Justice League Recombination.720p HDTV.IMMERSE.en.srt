1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,192
Water Demon.

2
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:11,502
Ice Dragon.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,673
Lesser Warlord
of Ka'a.

4
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:18,709
Not so fast.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,477
Infinite Sheldon.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,614
Infinite Sheldon?

7
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:26,317
Yes, Infinite Sheldon
defeats all other cards

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,903
and does not violate the
rule against homemade cards

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,821
because I made
it at work.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,659
Do you understand why people
don't want to play with you?

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,261
No...

12
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:40,698
although it's a question I've
been pondering since preschool.

13
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:42,750
Hey.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,717
Hey.

15
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:45,469
Hey.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,421
Hey, your copy of <i>Science</i>
magazine was in my mailbox.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,340
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,575
Check it out--
all about planets this month.

19
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:53,611
That's an atom.

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,081
Agree to disagree.

21
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,450
That's what I love
about science--

22
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:02,152
there's no
one right answer.

23
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:07,224
So...

24
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,826
you and Zack again, huh?

25
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:10,761
Yeah, yeah, me
and Zack again.

26
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:12,363
Were we here earlier?

27
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,199
Okay, we should,
we should go.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,250
Ah, not yet.

29
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,619
I want to talk science
with the science dudes.

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,406
Oh, and the science dudes want
to talk science with you.

31
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:24,875
What do you want
to talk about--

32
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:29,013
rocks, dinosaurs, our
friend the beaver?

33
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:32,516
You know, I saw this great thing
on the Discovery Channel.

34
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,385
Turns out
that if you kill a starfish,

35
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,553
it'll just come back to life.

36
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:40,224
Was the starfish
wearing boxer shorts?

37
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,493
Because you might have
been watching Nickelodeon.

38
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:48,899
No, I'm almost sure that
it was the Discovery Channel.

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,167
It was a great show.

40
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,336
They also said dolphins
might be smarter than people.

41
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:55,940
They might be smarter
than <i>some</i> people.

42
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,661
Maybe we can do an
experiment to find out.

43
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,112
That's easy enough.

44
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:05,215
We'd need a large tank of
water, a hoop to jump through,

45
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:07,651
and a bucket of whatever
bite-sized treats

46
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:09,787
you find tasty.

47
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:18,162
I don't get it.

48
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:19,596
A dolphin might.

49
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,201
Oh, I see.

50
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:26,337
You guys are inferring
that I'm stupid.

51
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,604
That's not correct.

52
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,491
We were implying it.

53
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:32,710
You then inferred it.

54
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:38,682
Let's go.

55
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:41,652
You know, for a group of guys

56
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:44,288
who claim they spent most
of their lives being bullied,

57
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,839
you can be real jerks.

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,658
Shame on all of you.

59
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,329
What the hell did I do?

60
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,831
You laughed.

71
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,927
Do you think
Penny's right?

72
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,657
Were we bullying Zack?

73
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:26,408
No,

74
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:27,863
I know bullying.

75
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:31,700
He left here unswirlied and his
ass crack was underpants-free.

76
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,737
And nobody drew
a penis on his forehead.

77
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,874
That happened to you?

78
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,543
First day of cricket camp.

79
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:44,980
They drew it
so the testicles were my eyes.

80
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,953
I don't know, I think
we might owe the guy an apology.

81
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:53,422
So go apologize.
Why me?

82
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:56,592
You started it,
we just piled on.

83
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,560
What would I even say?

84
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,263
Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

85
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,534
Have a Milk Dud.

86
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,404
A Milk Dud?
Yeah,

87
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,839
Milk Duds,
with their self-deprecating name

88
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,541
and remarkably mild flavor,

89
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:16,512
are the most apologetic
of the boxed candies.

90
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:17,913
I got a better idea.

91
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:18,881
We're all responsible.

92
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:20,082
I say we all go.

93
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,287
Come on, who's with me?

94
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:30,392
Free comic books
to anyone who comes with me.

95
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,562
I might get punched.
You really want to miss that?

96
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:41,170
Junior Mints are
pretty apologetic.

97
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,338
You're embarrassing
yourself.

98
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:49,778
Penny.

99
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,417
What?
Yeah,

100
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:57,119
we came to talk to Zack.
Hey, Zack.

101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
What do you want?

102
00:04:58,321 --> 00:04:59,688
Listen,

103
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,789
the stuff
we were saying before--

104
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,357
we were just kidding around.

105
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:03,292
No, you weren't.

106
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:04,960
You were making fun
of me.

107
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,595
Come on, that's what we do.

108
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,697
We give each other a hard time.

109
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:09,898
Hey, Sheldon,

110
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,101
you look
like a praying mantis.

111
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:15,003
That's very hurtful.

112
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,306
See?

113
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:20,142
I don't know,
it still wasn't very nice.

114
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:22,644
Milk Dud?

115
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,413
Oh, I love Milk Duds.

116
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:28,083
Okay, we're cool.

117
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,755
Junior Mints.

118
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:34,323
You guys want to come in
and have a beer?

119
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:36,125
Uh, we're on our way
to the comic book store.

120
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,826
Leonard's buying.

121
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:38,861
Really?

122
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:40,062
I haven't been
to a comic book store

123
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,630
in literally
a million years.

124
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,232
Literally?

125
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,568
Literally a
million years?

126
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:48,270
Don't.

127
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:49,538
You want to go with 'em?
No.

128
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:50,939
Okay, see you later.
Wait,

129
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,711
w-w-w-wait, you're ditching me
to go look at comic books?

130
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:56,912
Are you mad at me?

131
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,648
I'm not happy.

132
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:02,718
Milk Dud?

133
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,457
Wow, this place
is awesome.

134
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,759
Where do they keep
the <i>Archies?</i>

135
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,129
In the bedrooms of ten-year-
old girls, where they belong.

136
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,015
Oh, no, you're thinking
old-school <i>Archie.</i>

137
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:18,834
It's much more
sophisticated now.

138
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:19,935
Like, there's
two universes,

139
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,870
and Archie's married
to Betty in one

140
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:22,938
and Veronica
in the other.

141
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,240
Midge is even breaking
up with Moose.

142
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,142
No.

143
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,844
About time, right?

144
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:30,345
Hey.

145
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:33,816
Hey.
You guys finally chip in
for a bodyguard?

146
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,885
Uh, no. Oh,
this is Zack.

147
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:38,287
He's a friend
of ours.

148
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:39,188
Zack, this is Stuart.

149
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,023
He owns
the store.

150
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:42,624
Wow, lucky you.

151
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,360
Yeah, I work
70 hours a week

152
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:48,230
and average
$1.65 an hour.

153
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,566
Sweet.

154
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:53,735
Is that sarcasm?

155
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:57,372
No, it's an indictment of the
American education system.

156
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,142
The <i>Archies</i> are over here.

157
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:02,094
Yippee.

158
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,615
So are you guys coming to
my New Year's Eve costume party?

159
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:07,883
Of course.

160
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:09,902
We're coming as the
Justice League of America.

161
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,019
Switching it up from last year

162
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,939
when we came as
the Justice League of America.

163
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,190
To that point,

164
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:18,961
it occurs to me that we
might have an opportunity

165
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:21,463
to finally snare
Best Group Costume

166
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:23,899
if we shore up
our weak link,

167
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,702
which is clearly
Leonard as Superman.

168
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,638
Hey, I got
new boots this year.

169
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,007
Guaranteed to add
three inches.

170
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,877
That's sad.

171
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,948
Is there anyone we know

172
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,486
who would make a more manly
and convincing son of Krypton?

173
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:46,788
Than Leonard
in high-heeled boots?

174
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:50,926
Howard's mother
in high-heeled boots?

175
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,999
I was thinking specifically
of the gentleman over there

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,700
moving his lips
as he enjoys

177
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,003
the latest exploits
of Betty and Veronica.

178
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,975
Zack?

179
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:10,612
He is the only person we know
with actual muscles.

180
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:13,715
You can't replace
me with Zack.

181
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:16,451
Why not?
Penny did it.

182
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,387
Yeah, she seems happier.

183
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:19,788
Why wouldn't we be?

184
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:21,189
Score.

185
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,158
I got an <i>Archie,
Betty and Veronica,</i>

186
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,459
and a <i>Jughead.</i>

187
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,629
All set
for my weekend number twos.

188
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:30,666
Congratulations.

189
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:34,303
Zack, how would you
like to be Superman?

190
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:37,506
I don't know, sounds like
a lot of responsibility.

191
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:43,545
Fine, if Zack's going
to be Superman,

192
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:44,947
I want to be
Green Lantern.

193
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:45,914
But I'm Green Lantern.

194
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,332
You can be Aquaman.

195
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,667
I don't want to be Aquaman.

196
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:50,869
He sucks.

197
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:53,989
He sucks
underwater.

198
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:57,793
He sucks
fish pee.

199
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:58,961
Excuse me,

200
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:02,364
I believe Aquaman uses
his telepathic powers

201
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:06,668
to request the fish do
their business elsewhere.

202
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,270
Hey, babe.

203
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:09,354
I'm still mad at you.

204
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:10,339
Well, you won't be

205
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,440
when you hear the great news.

206
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:12,474
What great news?

207
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,076
We're going to
a costume party

208
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:16,611
at the comic book store
on New Year's Eve,

209
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:19,381
and you get to
be Wonder Woman.

210
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,885
Complete with bulletproof
bracelets and lasso of truth.

211
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,655
Invisible plane sold separately.

212
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,957
Wait, why me?

213
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,959
Wh-Why can't your girlfriend
be Wonder Woman?

214
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,528
She and her lab team
are under quarantine.

215
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,098
Seems at the Christmas party
they were doing Jell-O shots

216
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:40,168
out of petri dishes that used
to contain yellow fever.

217
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:44,206
Okay, what about
your friend Amy?

218
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:47,309
Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't
believe in wearing costumes.

219
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,379
She isn't the free spirit I am.

220
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:54,049
Okay, well, forget it.

221
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,717
I'm not spending
my New Year's Eve

222
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:58,553
at a comic book store
wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

223
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,859
He says he'll wear it
if you'll be Aquaman.

224
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:23,990
What are you doing?

225
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:25,862
We're going
to be late.

226
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:28,481
I'm pacing nervously.

227
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:29,716
You're jogging.

228
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:33,052
This is how the
Flash paces.

229
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:35,722
Just chill out, Sheldon.

230
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:38,658
I'm not Sheldon.
I'm the Flash.

231
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,260
And now I'm going
to the Grand Canyon

232
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:41,561
to scream in frustration.

233
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,796
I'm back.

234
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,569
I'm Batman.

235
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:51,771
Oh, I hardly think so.

236
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:54,307
The real caped crusader calls
his crime-fighting cohorts

237
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:55,408
when he's running late.

238
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,810
I had to walk.

239
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,880
I couldn't get Raj
on the back of my scooter.

240
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:10,723
I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

241
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:13,893
Aquaman sucks.

242
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:16,462
Look up in the sky.
It's a bird. It's a plane.

243
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,067
I forget the rest.

244
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:26,039
All right. Let's get
this thing over with.

245
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,740
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:30,576
But in what universe
is Wonder Woman blonde?

247
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:33,546
Relax. No one's going to
be looking at her hair.

248
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,751
Ow!

249
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:40,587
I mean,

250
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:42,755
ow.

251
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:44,958
Hold on. The costume came

252
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,092
with a black wig.
Where is it, babe?

253
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:48,127
No. I'm not wearing
it. It looks stupid.

254
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:49,729
Come on. We're trying
to win a contest here.

255
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,997
Forget it. I'm not
wearing the wig.

256
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:55,134
Honey, there's no "I"
in "Justice League."

257
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,656
Well, actually...

258
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,175
Don't.
He's making our case.

259
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,043
Okay, babe. Uh...

260
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:07,213
Kind of embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

261
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:08,948
Okay.
You know what?

262
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:10,950
I changed my mind.
I'm not going.

263
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,637
Looks like someone
else is going

264
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:17,056
to have to be Wonder Woman.

265
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:23,096
Babe, open up.

266
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:24,630
I'm not talking to you.

267
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:26,833
Then who are you talking to?

268
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:32,805
Babe?

269
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:35,675
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny,

270
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,477
Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

271
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:39,846
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny

272
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,080
Penny, Penny...

273
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:44,000
What the hell
is wrong with you?

274
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,184
I'm the Flash.

275
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,886
I just knocked 30,000 times.

276
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,038
Okay. What do you
want, Sheldon?

277
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,858
I understand
why you're upset.

278
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:53,259
Really?

279
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,627
Yes.

280
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,930
You're afraid that costume
makes you look fat.

281
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,267
No.

282
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,435
Wh-What...

283
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:04,470
Does it?

284
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:05,838
Don't worry.

285
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,373
Wonder Woman
was an Amazon.

286
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:12,078
And Amazons tend to
be very beefy gals.

287
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:17,033
Good-bye, Sheldon.

288
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:22,188
But they're not blonde,
so put on your wig.

289
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,359
Hello?

290
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,473
Stupid Aquaman.

291
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:43,609
If it makes you
feel any better,

292
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,844
when I was dating Penny,

293
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,412
she used to flip out
on me all the time.

294
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,648
Whoa. You dated Penny?

295
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,018
She didn't tell you?

296
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,253
She told me she dated
a guy named Leonard.

297
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:56,389
Who would have
thought it was you?

298
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,058
Who else would it be?

299
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,861
I don't know. Somebody
bigger and...

300
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:04,464
Yeah, sure.
Why not you?

301
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:10,403
I may have failed.

302
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:14,040
Okay, I guess we just go
without a Wonder Woman.

303
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,374
I don't want to go
without Penny.

304
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,078
Oh, great. No Superman,
no Wonder Woman?

305
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,514
All we've got is a skinny Flash,

306
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:22,949
an Indian Aquaman,

307
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,950
a nearsighted
Green Lantern,

308
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,185
and a teeny, tiny
Dark Knight.

309
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:31,691
Obviously, we're no longer
a Justice League.

310
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:35,928
We have no choice but to switch
to our Muppet Baby costumes.

311
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,732
Ooh, I call Kermit.

312
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,768
I'm Kermit.
You're Scooter.

313
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,171
Oh, man.
Scooter sucks.

314
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:48,975
He's the Aquaman
of the Muppet Babies.

315
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:52,712
No, we can still
make this work.

316
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,280
Leonard,
you talk to Penny.

317
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:56,282
What makes you think
I can convince her?

318
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:58,117
You got her
to have sex with you.

319
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:01,170
Obviously, your superpower
is brainwashing.

320
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,059
Okay, let me see
if I understand this.

321
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,295
You want me
to convince my ex-girlfriend

322
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:12,064
to go to a costume party
with her new boyfriend

323
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:14,133
just so we can win
a stupid prize?

324
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:16,903
Yes. And make her wear
the black wig. Good luck.

325
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:20,773
Go away, Sheldon.

326
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,074
It's Leonard.

327
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:23,409
Oh.

328
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,661
Go away, Leonard.

329
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:27,880
Come on, let me
just talk to you.

330
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:30,082
It's open.

331
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,884
Hey.

332
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:33,653
I'm not going
to that party, Leonard.

333
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:36,122
Okay, listen.
You don't have to wear the wig.

334
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:38,124
At this party,
we're gonna win first prize

335
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,226
just by showing up with a girl.

336
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:43,329
It's not the wig.

337
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,097
Did I do something?

338
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:46,799
I mean, I tried to be
friends with Zack,

339
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,302
like you said, which believe me,
was difficult,

340
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,671
given how you and me
used to be...

341
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:53,272
you know, "you and
me," and now you

342
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,775
and him are
"you and him."

343
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:58,911
Okay, look.
We're not really "me and him."

344
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:00,546
Then what are you?

345
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,514
I don't know.

346
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:04,750
I only started seeing Zack again

347
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,786
so I wouldn't be alone
on New Year's Eve.

348
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:09,021
How pathetic is that?

349
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:11,557
Not as pathetic
as dressing up like this

350
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:14,627
and going to a comic book store
on New Year's Eve.

351
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:17,296
You make a cute Green Arrow.

352
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:24,370
Green Lantern.

353
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:27,473
Like there's a difference.

354
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,442
There's a big difference.

355
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,477
Arrow.

356
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,579
Lantern.

357
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,284
Whatever. Look,
if Zack and I had just gone

358
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:40,719
to a regular club or a party,
it would have been fine,

359
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,721
but this, with the costumes,
and you...

360
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:44,156
What about me?

361
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,694
Nothing.

362
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:50,780
Let's go to the party.

363
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:53,732
How do I look?

364
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:00,640
Um...

365
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:03,075
I guarantee you'll be
the prettiest girl there.

366
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:07,480
Okay, the good news is,
we have a Wonder Woman.

367
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:08,598
Oh.
Yes.

368
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,715
What's the bad news?

369
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,050
Superman probably isn't

370
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:12,919
getting laid tonight.

371
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:17,773
Aw, damn.

372
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,027
And the award

373
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:23,529
for best group costume
goes to...

374
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:26,532
Justice League of America...

375
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:33,205
Number three!

376
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:39,679
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

377
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,548
Okay. Okay, ten
seconds to midnight.

378
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:43,683
Ten, nine, eight...

379
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,134
No, wait!

380
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,485
I have a speech.

381
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,054
Seven, six...
Stop counting!

382
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:50,790
Five, four, three...
This is my moment, dag nab it!

383
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,091
Two, one!

384
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:56,145
Happy New Year!

385
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,475
I'm not going
to say another word

386
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,844
until you people settle down.

387
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:16,816
I'm waiting.

388
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:22,088
That was a
great party.

389
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,674
We should dress like
this all the time.

390
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:27,510
Are you high?

391
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:29,628
You're being
a bully.

392
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,800
Check it out.

393
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,335
Those guys are breaking
into that car.

394
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:38,371
What should we do?

395
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,106
We're the Justice League
of America.

396
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:42,808
There's only one thing
we can do.

397
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,244
Turn around
and slowly walk away.

398
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:55,404
Nah.

399
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:57,573
Hold up.

400
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:05,543
Look, I know our winter
thermostat setting

401
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,295
is 72 degrees,
but I'm a little warm,

402
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,830
so I'm going
to turn it down.

403
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,923
Good Lord,

404
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:39,494
how you frustrate me,
Leonard Hofstadter!

405
