1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,411
Hey. So you guys ready
to order?

2
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:06,814
Since we come in
every Tuesday night at 6:00

3
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,585
And order the same exact thing,
and it's now 6:08,

4
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,987
I believe your question
not only answers itself

5
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:16,090
But also stands alongside
such other nonsensical queries

6
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:21,129
As "who let the dogs out?"
and, uh, "how are they hanging""

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,431
Okay.

8
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:26,134
So, the usual, with extra spit
on sheldon's hamburger.

9
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:28,836
Penny, a moment?

10
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:30,371
Do you have plans
this weekend?

11
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:31,573
Oh, gee, amy, I'm sorry,

12
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,874
I'm actually pretty busy
this weekend.

13
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,643
Probably serving food
that was ordered today.

14
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,980
That's too bad. I was hoping
you could be my plus-one

15
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,149
At the institute
of interdisciplinary studies'

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,184
Symposium on the impact
of current scientific research

17
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,519
On societal interactions.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,522
The what?

19
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:50,625
It's an annual
science conference.

20
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:51,993
We've all been invited to speak.

21
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:55,230
Oh! Oh, okay, well, you know,
like I said, I have plans, so...

22
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,031
Shame. Since you're
my best friend,

23
00:00:57,032 --> 00:00:59,100
I thought it would be
a good bonding opportunity.

24
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,869
I'm your best friend?

25
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,605
Don't you read my blog?

26
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,373
Oh, don't feel bad.

27
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:07,976
I never read leonard's, and
I used to sleep with him.

28
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,147
Do you know anybody else
who would appreciate

29
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:14,582
An all-expense-paid spa weekend

30
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,050
At a four-star resort
in big sur?

31
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,953
No, I really-- I'm sorry,
free what? Sorry, what, what?

32
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,022
I think her weekend
just opened up.

33
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:24,225
Wait, wait, just to be clear,
when you guys say "spa,"

34
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:27,462
Does that mean the same thing
as when regular people say it?

35
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,730
Pretty much.

36
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,466
Except we keep
our shirts on in the sauna.

37
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,901
You know, it is going
to be difficult,

38
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:37,038
But I'm going to cancel my plans
so I can do this for my bestie.

39
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,873
Please don't touch my breasts.

40
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,442
I... I wasn't going to.

41
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:44,145
All right. I just want
to establish boundaries.

42
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,848
Boy, this is great. I haven't
had a vacation in ages.

43
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:50,218
In order to take a vacation,
one first has to work.

44
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,153
You know, for a smart guy,

45
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,355
You really seem to have a
hard time grasping the concept

46
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:57,692
"don't piss off the people
who handle the things you eat."

47
00:01:57,693 --> 00:02:00,828
That does seem to be
a valid principle.

48
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,064
I trust penny will adhere to

49
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:04,866
The "official california
restaurant workers'

50
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:07,201
Solemn oath of ethics
and cleanliness."

51
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:09,604
I don't believe
there's any such thing.

52
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,374
You lied to me?

53
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:17,011
 our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state 

54
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,348
 then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! 

55
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,983
 the earth began to cool 

56
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:24,519
 the autotrophs began to drool,
neanderthals developed tools 

57
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,188
 we built the wall 
 <i>we built the pyramids</i> 

58
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,857
 math, science, history,
unraveling the mystery 

59
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,759
 that all started
with a big bang 

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,728
 <i>bang!</i> 

61
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,252
<i>Good morning.</i>

62
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:43,087
If I could have everyone's
attention, please?

63
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:46,490
I know we're all eager
to get on the road to big sur,

64
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:49,060
So if we focus, I'm sure we can
get through this orientation

65
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:50,561
In under a half an hour.

66
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,998
Then it's just q&a,
quiz, safety drills,

67
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:57,168
Pose for commemorative
group photo and we're off.

68
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:59,970
Don't worry. Just sit
next to me during the quiz,

69
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,273
And you can copy my answers.

70
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:03,474
Sheldon:
Raj?

71
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,675
What are you doing?

72
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,178
I don't think so.

73
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,947
You've had your allotted
six ounces.

74
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:13,084
The first bathroom break
isn't until the denny's

75
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,920
Located near bakersfield,

76
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:18,889
Which is approximately
two and half hours away.

77
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,827
Remember, people, we're only as
strong as our weakest bladder.

78
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:28,232
Nobody cares about
your kegel exercises.

79
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:32,336
All right. We have
seven people, and two cars.

80
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,639
In the lead car,
driven by leonard,

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,876
Will be... Myself,

82
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:41,112
Amy farrah fowler,

83
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:43,047
And penny.

84
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,749
Yes!

85
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,120
He had you in the other car,
but I got you upgraded.

86
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,789
Yay!

87
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,657
She made the case
that if we break down

88
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:56,494
In the middle of nowhere,
your nebraska backwoods skills

89
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,562
And brawny hands
will give us the best chance

90
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,564
To survive in the wild.

91
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,933
Brawny?

92
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:05,469
They're bigger
than mine.

93
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:09,473
Red leader to red five,
come in.

94
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,512
Red leader to red five,
come in.

95
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,714
Howard, you promised.

96
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:20,618
Wolowitz (on radio):
Fine. Red five to red leader.

97
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,186
What do you want now?

98
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:27,792
It's 11:15. I'm requesting your
quarter-hourly location update.

99
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:29,460
Still right behind you.

100
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:32,496
Copy that, red five.

101
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,098
Radio contact is sufficient.

102
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,033
No need to extend
your middle finger.

103
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:40,337
So, amy, I've
been wondering,

104
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:43,073
Are you and sheldon going
to be sharing a room?

105
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,975
No, we discussed it.

106
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,077
We decided we didn't want
to jeopardize our relationship

107
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,913
By getting to know
each other too well.

108
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:52,583
Indeed. Nothing sours
a friendship more

109
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,387
Than over-familiarity
with someone's toilet routine.

110
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:58,088
I can vouch for that.

111
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,424
Hey.
Not you, him.

112
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,859
Oh. Thanks.

113
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,429
Although yours
was an eye-opener.

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,299
Don't worry, penny.

115
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,601
You're my plus-one.
You'll bunk with me.

116
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,937
And fyi, travel
makes me constipated,

117
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,606
So I'm the ideal
hotel roommate.

118
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,975
Terrific.

119
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:20,411
Are we there yet?

120
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,748
I hope we get there in time
to see the keynote address.

121
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:27,151
Really? You want to see
the keynote?

122
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,286
Yeah, it sounds fun.

123
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,654
"super bacteria:

124
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:34,058
Global apocalypse or
exciting research opportunity?"

125
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:37,595
Actually, I was thinking we
could go straight to the room

126
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:39,763
And... Take a nap.

127
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,131
Really?

128
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,700
And miss the keynote?

129
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,202
We can watch it later on c-span.

130
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:47,972
Besides, I was really
looking forward to you and me...

131
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,640
Napping together in the hotel.

132
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,575
Honey, if you're
that tired,

133
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:54,078
Why don't you just take
a nap here in the car?

134
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,713
No, see, it's not...
(cell phone ringing)

135
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:57,615
Hang on.
It's leonard.

136
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,650
Hi, leonard.

137
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,453
Leonard (on speaker):
Yeah, hi. Listen, I just
got a text from raj.

138
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:03,687
He wanted me to tell you

139
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:05,956
That when howard says "nap,"
he means "sex."

140
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:10,661
Thank you, raj.

141
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:15,966
Are you... An element
in the actinoid series?

142
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:17,234
No.

143
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:18,435
Amy?

144
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:21,505
Are you usually radioactive
when found in nature?

145
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,640
No.

146
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,241
Are you in the
lanthanoid series?

147
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:26,176
Amy, it's penny's turn.

148
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,113
Penny?

149
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,348
Uh, I don't know...

150
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,716
Are you food?

151
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,588
That's not apropos.

152
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,658
We've already established
I'm found in the periodic table.

153
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,359
Well, it's a table, right?

154
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,895
I mean, why can't there
be food on it?

155
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:48,065
I knew she wasn't
lead car materiel.

156
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:50,734
Who elected you
road trip god?

157
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,736
Leonard.

158
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:55,372
It was a late-night vote.

159
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,808
We were all exhausted,

160
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:59,810
And he was threatening
to filibuster.

161
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:01,979
It's not technically
"road trip god""

162
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,414
It's travel supervisor.

163
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:07,484
Although road trip god
does have a certain ring to it.

164
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:09,153
I don't understand
why you people

165
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,688
Just let him bully
you like this.

166
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,056
Someone should
stand up to him.

167
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,024
What's he going to do?

168
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,163
I can't believe you let him
kick me out of the car.

169
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:22,533
What could we do?
He's the travel supervisor.

170
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,769
Don't worry, penny.
This is a better car anyway.

171
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,738
Yeah. It's the love car.

172
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:30,407
Should I ask?

173
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:34,745
 they say we're young
and we don't know 

174
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:39,783
 we won't find out
until we grow 

175
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:42,820
 well, I don't know
if all that's true 

176
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:47,691
 'cause you got me,
and, baby, I got you 

177
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:50,461
 babe 
 mm da-da,
da-da, da-da 

178
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,596
Both:
 I got you, babe 

179
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,164
Red leader, I'm really sorry.

180
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,600
Both:
 I got you, babe. 

181
00:07:57,736 --> 00:08:02,973
Wolowitz and bernadette:
 I got you, babe... 

182
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,747
I missed you.

183
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:13,584
You know what?
I missed you, too.

184
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,552
Bernadette?

185
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:17,755
Oh, my god, glenn!

186
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:19,356
Great to see you!

187
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,325
Are you here
for the conference?

188
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,260
Yeah, I'm doing
a global warming panel.

189
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,328
Oh, good for you.

190
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,764
Uh, glenn,
this is my boyfriend howard.

191
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:29,266
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

192
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,868
Ow. Hi.

193
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,670
You're a lucky man.

194
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:34,405
Bernie's
a great gal.

195
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:37,775
Yes. "bernie" sure is.

196
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,943
Well, I got to run.
The panel's tomorrow morning.

197
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:42,413
It's called, "remembering snow:
A look back."

198
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:45,115
I'll try to catch it.

199
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,517
Oh, great.

200
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,085
Bye.
Bye.

201
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:53,257
Hey... Bernie?

202
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,425
Yeah?

203
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:57,828
Please tell me he's
your gay cousin.

204
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,631
No.

205
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,633
He was one of my professors
in college.

206
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:05,436
Oh! That's a relief.

207
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,004
Then we went out
for a year.

208
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:11,175
Come on, let's check in,
so we can take that nap.

209
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,847
No, it's not necessarily
proportional...

210
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,115
Shut up!

211
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,881
That green bag
is dr. Cooper's.

212
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,749
Here's an extra five.
Make him wait.

213
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,388
Oh.

214
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:35,024
Right to the nap, huh? Okay?

215
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,160
Uh, so, this glenn guy.

216
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,930
You say you went out with
him for, like, a year.

217
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,965
Do we really need to talk
about my old boyfriend now?

218
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:45,301
No. I guess not.

219
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,805
What is he, like,
six-four, six-five?

220
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,574
Six-seven.

221
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:55,778
Probably has a hard time
finding a suit that fits.

222
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,281
Is something
bothering you?

223
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:00,616
No. It's just...
What?

224
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:01,918
I'm just thinking.

225
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,452
If you had sex with that guy,

226
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:05,388
I mean, there's nothing
I can do here

227
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:10,526
That will make
any kind of... Impact.

228
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,194
Howard, it's not a contest.

229
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,063
I love you.
I want to be with you.

230
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,699
Yeah, great, love you, too,
but...

231
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,102
If it were a contest,

232
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:22,605
I wouldn't have a chance, right?

233
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:23,839
You can't think
that way.

234
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,041
Yep.

235
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,243
Loser.

236
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:30,913
Howard, stop it.

237
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,648
Sorry. I just
never figured that

238
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,884
A guy like me going out
with a girl like you

239
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,520
Would ever have to compete
with a guy like that.

240
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,857
Wait a minute, "a girl like me"?
What's that mean?

241
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,097
I'm... I...

242
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:49,966
Are you saying you
don't think I'm hot enough

243
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,567
To go out with a guy like glenn?

244
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,537
No! No, I'm saying
exactly the opposite.

245
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm <i>too</i> hot to go out
with a guy like glenn?

246
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,377
Yeah, let's go with that.

247
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,847
(toilet flushes)

248
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:11,020
Still nothing.

249
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:14,423
Remind me to try again
in an hour.

250
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,625
Will do.

251
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:20,396
So...

252
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,031
Girl talk?

253
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,966
Um, sure.

254
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,668
What do you got in mind?

255
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:29,205
Do you subscribe to the freudian
theory of penis envy?

256
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:33,542
Um, I never really
thought about it.

257
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:34,810
Why?

258
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,713
Sometimes I think it might be
nice to have one.

259
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:38,981
Really?

260
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:41,550
Not for sex, for convenience.

261
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:44,053
You can't deny that,
by comparison,

262
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:46,689
Our internal plumbing
is extremely high maintenance.

263
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,793
Again, I've never given
it much thought.

264
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,561
We have time now.

265
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:53,796
Think about it.

266
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,598
(knocking on door)

267
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,433
Oh, good.

268
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,471
Hey.

269
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,606
Can I stay here tonight?

270
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:04,573
Yeah. Why, what happened?

271
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:07,243
Howard's a complete
and total ass.

272
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:09,078
Oh, yeah, that.
Come on in.

273
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:12,648
Thanks. I'll sleep
on the floor.

274
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,016
Not necessary.

275
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:16,385
Penny and I are perfectly
comfortable sharing a bed.

276
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,487
We are?

277
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,023
Of course, we're best friends.

278
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:24,193
Oh, right, right, the blog.

279
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,294
Word of warning, though.

280
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,662
I'm prone to night terrors,

281
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,964
So when I wake up kicking
and screaming, don't panic.

282
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,967
Just pin me down and stroke
my hair, and I'll be fine.

283
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:40,109
Hey, can I stay here tonight?
Shh-shh-shh.

284
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,044
Sheldon's asleep.

285
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,212
What's going on?

286
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,147
Well, howard's a complete
and total ass,

287
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:46,582
Bernadette's in my bed,

288
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,086
And no matter how much you
stroke amy's hair, she bites.

289
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,487
What?
Never mind.

290
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:52,988
Can I stay here or not?

291
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,457
Uh, sure.
All right.

292
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,131
So, how do you want
to do this?

293
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,700
Well, I'm not getting
in bed with <i>him.</i>

294
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,603
Yeah, it is
a little like

295
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:08,904
Getting into
dracula's coffin.

296
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:12,775
We're just gonna have
to make the best of this.

297
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:15,945
Okay, when you say
"make the best of it..."

298
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:17,580
Sleep.
Right.

299
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:22,051
So we'll just call
the middle here

300
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,319
The neutral zone.

301
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,987
The what?

302
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:27,456
<i>Star trek.</i>

303
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,924
You know, the
neutral zone

304
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:31,227
Between the federation
and the romulan empire.

305
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,862
Oh, okay.

306
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:35,798
Just like old times.

307
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:42,238
Of course,

308
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,407
Sometimes the federation
and the romulans

309
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,276
Would enter
the neutral zone

310
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,411
To negotiate a
temporary truce.

311
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,349
Sweetie, let me
put this in a way
you'll understand:

312
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,252
From the waist down,
my shields are up.

313
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,054
Got it, got it.

314
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:04,226
We can do all
kinds of stuff

315
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:06,795
From the waist up,
you know?

316
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,631
Go to sleep.
Good night.

317
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:17,940
Please tell me
you're not having coitus.

318
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,811
We are not having coitus.

319
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,446
Can you guarantee
that it won't happen

320
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,648
At any time during the night?

321
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:27,983
Yes.
No.

322
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,555
(humming)

323
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:43,666
Announcer (on tv):
Next on turner classic movies,
<i>bridget jones's diary.</i>

324
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:47,503
Oh, my god, I'm crying already.

325
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:48,804
(knocking on door)

326
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,440
Sheldon:
Raj? Raj?

327
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,942
Raj?

328
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,181
I need to sleep
here tonight.

329
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,549
Why?

330
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,518
Howard is a complete
and total ass,

331
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,820
Bernadette is in penny's
bed, amy bites,

332
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,257
And penny may or may not
have coitus with leonard.

333
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:10,693
Okay. Come on in.

334
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:16,498
(whispers):
Leonard, are you asleep?

335
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,766
No.

336
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,502
I really appreciate you letting
me stay here tonight.

337
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,804
Sure, no problem.

338
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,606
I know it's kinda weird.

339
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:25,407
True dat.

340
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,977
"true dat"?

341
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:31,447
I've gotten a lot more street
since we broke up.

342
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:34,083
(chuckles)

343
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,252
Right.

344
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:38,153
Still mad at me about that?

345
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,389
No. No, I understand.

346
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,826
I got too intense,
you had to back off.

347
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:46,428
Thank you.

348
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,465
I've gotten a lot better
at that, you know.

349
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,035
I've dated four different women
since we broke up

350
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,537
And I didn't tell any of them
that I loved them

351
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,306
And wanted
to have their babies.

352
00:15:57,307 --> 00:16:00,142
Good for you.

353
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,045
Okay, good night.

354
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,381
Good night.

355
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:12,054
You know, maybe it wouldn't be
the worst idea in the world

356
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,391
To violate the neutral zone
for just one night.

357
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,925
Oh!

358
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:20,529
Hey, leonard,
sheldon kicked me

359
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,765
Out of the room,
gave me your key.

360
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,167
Penny's here.

361
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:33,876
No, we don't want to watch
bridget jones's diary!

362
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:43,319
Good morning and welcome
to science and society.

363
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,059
I'm dr. Sheldon cooper, bs, ms,
ma, phd, and scd.

364
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,461
Omg, right?

365
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:59,101
Perhaps that joke was a little
too hippie-dippy for this crowd.

366
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,370
All right then, we'll begin
with opening remarks.

367
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:04,506
Miss rostenkowski,
would you like to start us off

368
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:05,974
By discussing
your assessment

369
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:09,111
Of science's responsibility
to society?

370
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,346
Sure.

371
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:12,381
I think all branches
of science

372
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,683
Have to move cautiously
these days.

373
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:16,785
It's not just giant
nuclear weapons

374
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,320
That can destroy
the world.

375
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,389
As a microbiologist,
I can tell you

376
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,094
Even the tiniest organisms
can still tear you a new one.

377
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:29,264
Interesting.

378
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:32,368
I think what you might need
to know about my colleague

379
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:36,405
Is that though she claims
her field of interest
is tiny organisms,

380
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:40,175
She certainly has spent
her fair share of time

381
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:45,180
Around what we can assume was
pretty massive weaponry.

382
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:49,885
I think mr. Wolowitz
needs to keep in mind

383
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:51,820
That the past
is the past.

384
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,356
But he should know
that I <i>am</i> the kind of girl

385
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:57,760
Who could get <i>all</i>
the giant missiles she wants.

386
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:03,198
Are we talking about women
wanting penises?

387
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,167
Because I'd like to weigh in.

388
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:15,144
Dr. Koothrappali, would you care
to join the conversation?

389
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:18,113
Certainly.
I'd like to raise two points.

390
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:22,217
Number one, I think they <i>are</i>
talking about penises.

391
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:28,524
And number two, these mimosas
are kicking my little brown ass.

392
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,595
I'd like to kick
your little brown ass.

393
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,030
What did I do?

394
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,465
Oh, I don't know.

395
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,066
Maybe when you walk
into a hotel room

396
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,936
And you see a guy getting back
together with his girlfriend,

397
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:43,272
You should consider doing
something other

398
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:45,741
Than crawling into
the adjoining bed.

399
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,777
I did. You said no
<i>bridget jones.</i>

400
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,513
Penny:
We weren't getting
back together!

401
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:54,249
It was a one-time thing!

402
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,517
Excuse me.

403
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,486
We're not taking comments
or questions

404
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,154
From the audience just yet.

405
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:01,657
Oh, shut up, sheldon!

406
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:03,859
Hi, bestie.

407
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,127
All right,

408
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,863
Why don't we see if we can bring
this back to topic.

409
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,598
Let me ask you
something, bernie.

410
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,999
I guess not.

411
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,869
How would you feel if
you met <i>my</i> ex-girlfriend

412
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,605
And she was like
angelina jolie?

413
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:19,975
Oh, come on, howard,
be realistic.

414
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:26,849
What, I'm not hot enough
for angelina jolie?

415
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,051
I'd like to weigh in here.

416
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:30,586
No.

417
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:34,857
All right,
why don't we open it up

418
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,058
To q&a from the audience?

419
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,459
Penny:
Yeah, I have a question.

420
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,961
Is there anybody who can get me
the hell out of here

421
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:42,130
And back to los angeles
tonight?

422
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:44,933
Glenn:
I'm driving back
to l.A. Tonight.

423
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,505
Penny, that's glenn.
Glenn, that's penny.

424
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,373
No!

425
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,258
Sheldon (over radio):
Red leader to red five.

426
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,261
Red leader
to red five.

427
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:07,364
Anybody up for a little game?

428
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:12,469
I spy with my little eye...

429
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,539
A nonferrous metal.

430
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,576
(retching)

431
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:22,579
Must be out of range.

432
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:25,883
Leonard, can I ask you
a question?

433
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,284
Sure.

434
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,586
Are you bothered by the fact
that your former girlfriend

435
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,288
Left the symposium
with what is probably

436
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:35,325
The most beautiful man
I've ever seen in my life?

437
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:37,394
No. Why do you ask?

438
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:40,731
Because we're going
120 miles per hour.

439
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,268
All right, if no one's going
to guess...

440
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,372
I was spying the aluminum rims
on the police car

441
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,040
We passed a few miles back.
