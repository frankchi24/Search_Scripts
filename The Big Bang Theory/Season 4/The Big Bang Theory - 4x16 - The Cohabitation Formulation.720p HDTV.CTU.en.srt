<i>Previously on
The Big Bang Theory:</i>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,551
Guess who I found at LAX.
My baby sister Priya.

3
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:06,703
It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

4
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:08,572
Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.

5
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:09,640
Here you go.

6
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:10,808
Thanks.

7
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:15,859
You slept with
my sister?!

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,110
Yeah.

9
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:19,246
This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust!

10
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,114
Would it help
if I told you

11
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,783
that I offered
her my heart,

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,618
and she kinda
stomped on it?!

13
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,902
How hard did she stomp?

14
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:27,120
Very hard.

15
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:29,489
Okay, I'm good.

16
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:34,995
(giggles)

17
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:36,697
What's so funny?

18
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:38,932
Nothing. Just thinking

19
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,369
about the noises people
make during sex.

20
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,405
I do sometimes get a bit
carried away, don't I?

21
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,940
(chuckles)

22
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:48,392
It's cute.

23
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:52,145
You sound a little
like a drunken monkey.

24
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:54,982
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

25
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:59,920
You know it's meant
as a compliment.

26
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:01,521
That's how I take it.

27
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:04,024
(sighs)
This is perfect.

28
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,960
I hope this moment
never ends.

29
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,528
Me, too.

30
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:11,031
(both sigh)

31
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:13,100
Well, gotta go.
Oh!

32
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,121
Already?
Why don't you stay over?

33
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,540
I'd love to, but you know

34
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,627
my mother needs me in
the morning.

35
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:29,683
I think the woman can manage
to put a wig on by herself.

36
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:32,452
It's not just the wig.

37
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:34,621
It's pinning her hair up,
drawing on her eyebrows.

38
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:36,189
It's a two-person job.

39
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:41,028
It's just, when you leave right
after we make love,

40
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:42,629
it makes me feel...

41
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,897
cheap.

42
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,932
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,567
What can I do?

44
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:48,935
Stay.

45
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:51,338
Okay.

46
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:56,576
(sighs)

47
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:58,879
Like, what, another five,
ten minutes?

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,415
Go home.

49
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,666
Your call.

50
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,387
Howard...

51
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:11,558
have you ever considered us
living together?

52
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,393
Boy, I don't know.

53
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:16,863
You, me, Ma living
under the same roof?

54
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:20,634
No, I mean just you and me.

55
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:21,902
You can move in here,

56
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:23,837
or we can find a place.

57
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,639
I've got a better solution.
What?

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,707
We wait for my mom's heart
to explode

59
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,676
from all the salt she eats.

60
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:32,045
Then we just stick her in
the ground, flip her mattress

61
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,380
and move into the big bedroom.

62
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,782
Great.

63
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:39,786
Look at us planning
a future together!

64
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,660
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Who's there?!

65
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:48,495
Are you a
sex criminal?!

66
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:54,000
Sex criminals
don't have keys, Ma!

67
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,903
Where were you
so late?!

68
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:58,305
I was out with Bernadette!

69
00:02:58,306 --> 00:02:59,739
I know what
that means!

70
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,276
<i>I watch Dr. Phil!</i>

71
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:06,847
I hope to God
you used a condom!

72
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:09,616
I'm not having this conversation
with you, Ma!

73
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:14,654
God forbid you get one of
those new fancy sex diseases!

74
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,124
Nobody has a disease!

75
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,592
I hope not!

76
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:21,828
I share a toilet
with you!

77
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:25,332
Is that what
you want?!

78
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,801
To give your
mother herbies?!

79
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:30,303
That's it!
I don't have to take this!

80
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:34,874
Good luck with your eyebrows in
the morning!

81
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,748
Who's there?!

82
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,884
Are you a
sex criminal?!

83
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm still leaving!

84
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,605
I just forgot my Claritin!

85
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:53,243
Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state

86
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:56,863
Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait!

87
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,731
The Earth began to cool

88
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:01,434
The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools

89
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:03,637
We built the Wall
We built the pyramids

90
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:06,439
Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery

91
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,441
That all started
with a big bang

92
00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:09,506
<i>Bang!</i>

94
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:18,505
Hey, what's up?

95
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,207
I need a place to crash.

96
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:20,974
Uh, sure.

97
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:23,043
Why?

98
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,911
Big fight with my mother.

99
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:29,149
<i>Still arguing over
which CSI is the best?</i>

100
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,186
No, we agreed they all have
their merits.

101
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:35,255
This was about Bernadette.

102
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:37,357
What's going on?

103
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:38,458
Howard's gonna sleep here
tonight.

104
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,843
He had a fight with his mother.

105
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:43,063
Did you offer him
a hot beverage?

106
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,905
No.

107
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:56,509
Leonard, social protocol states
when a friend is upset,

108
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,745
you offer them a hot beverage,
such as tea.

109
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,448
Tea does sound nice.

110
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:03,700
You heard the man, Leonard.

111
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:04,918
(snaps fingers)

112
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:08,722
And while you're at it,
I'm upset

113
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:12,125
that we have an unannounced
houseguest, so make me cocoa.

114
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:16,830
Point of inquiry,

115
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,466
given that Leonard is
your secondary friend

116
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,868
and Koothrappali is
your primary friend,

117
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:24,137
why didn't you seek refuge
under his roof?

118
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:25,372
There's no room.

119
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:26,773
His sister is staying with him.

120
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:28,942
Wait, wait. What?

121
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:30,193
Cocoa, Leonard.
Focus.

122
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:32,913
I'm down in
the dumps here.

123
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,732
Priya's in town?

124
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:37,434
Yeah, some work thing.

125
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:40,520
Anyway, my mother seems
to think that Bernadette...

126
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:42,622
Hold on.
When did Priya get here?

127
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:44,658
I don't know.
A couple of days ago.

128
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,611
The thing is, Bernadette doesn't
like that I have to take care

129
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,297
of my mother, and my mother
doesn't trust Bernadette...

130
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,448
Yeah, that's a real pickle.

131
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,666
Bye.

132
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:56,369
(door closes)

133
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,704
Don't worry.

134
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,589
As your tertiary friend,

135
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,642
I am prepared to step in
and comfort you.

136
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:04,895
That's not really necessary.

137
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,463
No, no. I'll finish
making the tea,

138
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:08,465
while you narcissistically
ramble on

139
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,517
about whatever's troubling you.

140
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:12,419
Thanks.

141
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,489
That's what
tertiary friends are for.

142
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,227
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Who is it?

143
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:21,428
It's Leonard.

144
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,930
You can't come in.

145
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,166
I just want to talk to her.

146
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,601
I forbid it.

147
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:28,952
Open the door,
Rajesh.

148
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,120
You heard me.

149
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:32,305
I forbidded it.

150
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:34,107
"Forbidded" it?

151
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:36,042
"Forbaded" it?

152
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,712
Get out of the way.

153
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:40,714
What are you doing here?

154
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,148
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

155
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,517
I have business in Los Angeles.

156
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,018
Why didn't you call?

157
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,586
Clearly, she was
sending you a message

158
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:48,855
to take a hike, Mike.

159
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:51,658
I'm sorry.
I thought about calling,

160
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,661
♪but I just wasn't sure if
seeing you was such a good idea.

161
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:57,097
I know. Last time
I came on too strong.

162
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,398
Can we talk in private?

163
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,467
No!
Sure.

164
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:03,436
It's completely inappropriate
for a single woman

165
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:04,738
to entertain a man in private.

166
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,640
If you insist on talking,
you must do it on the couch!

167
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,011
All right, you may talk in
the bedroom,

168
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:13,380
but I want this door
to remain open!

169
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:16,366
All right, just this once
you may close the door.

170
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,818
But keep in mind
I'll be right out here

171
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,420
monitoring the situation!

172
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,635
Oh, damn it.

173
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:38,905
Leonard, when you get this
message, call me.

174
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:48,148
Priya, this is your brother.

175
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,084
When you get this, tell Leonard
to check his voicemail.

176
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:56,656
Would you be sleeping over
again this evening?

177
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:58,124
Because you're welcome to.

178
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,293
That's very nice of you,
but I made other plans.

179
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:03,430
Well, just keep in mind that
should you ever need

180
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:08,635
a slightly apathetic tertiary
friend, I stand at the ready.

181
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,536
Hi, Howard.
Hi, Sheldon.

182
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:11,537
Hello.
Hey.

183
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,256
Why are you
holding hands?

184
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:15,241
I forbid you to hold hands.

185
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:18,728
Rajesh, you know Leonard and I
spent the night together.

186
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:20,413
Yeah, but you were just
sleeping,

187
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:22,949
because I forboded you
to have sex.

188
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:25,652
The word is "forbade""

189
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:28,922
You sure?
That doesn't sound right.

190
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:31,124
Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I
have decided

191
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,559
to see each other again,

192
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,327
and you don't get
to tell me

193
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:37,163
who I can and can't have
a relationship with.

194
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:38,598
Actually, he can.

195
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,069
The Hindu Code of Manu is
very clear in these matters.

196
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,704
If a woman's father is
not around,

197
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:48,174
the duty of controlling her base
desires falls

198
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:53,013
to the closest male member of
her family, in this case, Raj.

199
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,247
The code also states

200
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,616
that if she disobeys,
she will be reborn

201
00:08:56,617 --> 00:09:01,421
"in the womb of a jackal
and tormented by diseases."

202
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:03,857
If true,

203
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:06,292
that seems
like an awfully large gamble

204
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:08,495
given that the prize is Leonard.

205
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,434
There it is, Priya.
We're Indian.

206
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:16,469
We believe this stuff.

207
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,706
I think it also says that
if you eat beef,

208
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:21,875
you need to live with cows
for three months

209
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:23,043
and drink their urine.

210
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:26,413
Some of it makes sense,
some of it's crazy.

211
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:29,349
My point is, you can't go out
with Leonard.

212
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,784
Who can't go out with Leonard?

213
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:32,018
My sister.

214
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,587
Penny, this is
Raj's sister, Priya.

215
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:35,955
It's very nice to meet you.

216
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:38,291
Oh, yeah, you, too.

217
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,561
Priya, if you're experiencing
any tension or awkwardness,

218
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:44,647
it may stem from the fact that
Leonard and Penny used to--

219
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:48,301
if I may quote Howard--
"do the dance with no pants."

220
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:54,407
Sheldon!

221
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,642
Really?

222
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:58,361
Hey, Bernadette, can I
talk to you for a second?

223
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:00,480
Sure.

224
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,749
Penny, you became disenchanted
with Leonard

225
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,817
as a lover.

226
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:06,119
Would you please tell
my sister why?

227
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,172
Listen, my mom's
going to Palm Springs

228
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,490
to visit her sister.

229
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:11,925
That's two whole nights
in a row I can sleep over

230
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:13,893
with you
all the way to morning.

231
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:15,261
Unless the desert air
dries out her sinuses,

232
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:16,546
in which case I'll have
to schlep out there

233
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:18,465
with the big humidifier.

234
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:20,667
That's it?

235
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:22,502
That's your big solution
to all of our problems?

236
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:25,872
If your mom's nose holds up,
we get two nights together?

237
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:28,108
Isn't that great?

238
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:30,360
No, it's not great.

239
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,611
You need to make a choice.

240
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:32,846
Me or your mother.

241
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,714
Uh...

242
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:35,848
Wrong answer.

243
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:37,200
No, wait.

244
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,568
You didn't let me finish.

245
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,153
I'm listening.

246
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:41,821
Uh...

247
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:43,990
(groans)

248
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:54,086
I came as quickly as I could.

249
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

250
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,025
Why?

251
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,715
To comfort you, of course.

252
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:02,549
Sheldon told me about Leonard
dating Rajesh's sister.

253
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:04,039
So I high-tailed it over here

254
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,542
to pick up the pieces
of your broken heart.

255
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:08,644
Amy, I'm fine.

256
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:11,780
You don't have to
be strong for me.

257
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:14,300
Now let's talk about Priya,
that man-stealing bitch.

258
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,886
What?

259
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,555
In situations like this,

260
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:22,091
best girlfriends are often
catty about the other woman.

261
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,759
(yowls)

262
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:28,514
Really, I am not upset
about Leonard and Priya.

263
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:33,102
Oh. Then perhaps you don't
understand what's going on.

264
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:34,970
Your former boyfriend
has replaced you

265
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,839
with what appears to be
a very suitable mate.

266
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,341
Arguably much
more suitable than you.

267
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:43,712
Oh. Well, good for him.

268
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,547
Hey, what do you mean,
"more suitable"?

269
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:48,984
Well, granted, Penny, your
secondary sexual characteristics

270
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:51,687
are reasonably bodacious.

271
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,222
But Priya is highly educated,

272
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:54,757
she's an accomplished
professional,

273
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:57,092
and she comes from the culture
that literally wrote the book

274
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,194
on neat ways to have sex.

275
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,565
Whereas you, on the other hand,
are a community college dropout

276
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:06,368
who comes from the culture that
wrote the book on tipping cows.

277
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,704
Yeah. Okay, I got it.

278
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:10,005
I got it.

279
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:12,808
So... what is
all that stuff?

280
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,010
This is a portable
electroencephalogram.

281
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,563
I'm doing research
on emotions and brain activity.

282
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:18,914
So when you start crying,

283
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,250
I can see which region
of the brain is activated.

284
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:24,353
Then I'm going to stimulate
the analogous area

285
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:27,189
in the brain of a rhesus monkey
and see if he cries.

286
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,426
Cool, huh?

287
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:35,164
(knocking at door)

288
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,242
I choose you.

289
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:48,911
Really?

290
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,779
Yep. I moved out
of my mother's house.

291
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,847
Cord is cut.

292
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,049
I'm all yours.

293
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:56,402
What did she say
when you told her?

294
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:59,354
I don't know. She hasn't
responded to my email yet.

295
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:02,091
This is so great.

296
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,159
I love you, Howard.

297
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,444
I love you, too.

298
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:06,862
So what's for dinner?

299
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:10,699
Well, I don't really have much
of anything in the house.

300
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,601
That's fine.

301
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:14,837
Why don't we go fool
around in our bedroom?

302
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,006
And then you
can go shopping.

303
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,796
I thought maybe after we eat,
we could see an early movie.

304
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:25,080
I'd love that.

305
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:26,715
I love the way you say,

306
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:29,318
"I'd love that."

307
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:31,487
She says it the same way I do.

308
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:34,990
"I'd love that."

309
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:36,992
Everybody in India
says it that way.

310
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,494
It's not a big deal.

311
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,613
Rajesh, don't be a child.

312
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,698
I'm not being a child.

313
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,066
Leonard, I swear to God,

314
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,284
if your sister
ever comes to town,

315
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,002
I shall have my way with her.

316
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:51,173
My sister's 38 and married.

317
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:52,825
All the more shame
that will fall

318
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,843
upon the house of Hofstadter.

319
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,998
Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.

320
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,150
That's remarkable.

321
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,418
If pepperoni
were an explosive substance,

322
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,053
you could replace
German shepherds

323
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,955
at our nation's airports.

324
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:09,358
Hi. Penny, right?

325
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,260
Oh, yes. H-Hi. I'm sorry.

326
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,395
I didn't know you had company.
I don't want to impose.

327
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,314
No, no. It's not
an imposition.

328
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,667
At this point, in our ecosystem,
you are akin to the plover,

329
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:21,670
a small scavenging bird
that eats extra food

330
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:23,639
from between
the teeth of crocodiles.

331
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:28,644
Please, fly into our open maw,
and have at it.

332
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:33,348
If I had more than a box of
baking soda in my refrigerator,

333
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:34,716
I wouldn't have to take that.

334
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,322
Hi, bestie.

335
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:41,723
Hi.

336
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,994
So, um, Priya,

337
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,296
you're a lawyer, right?

338
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:48,997
I know. Pretty boring, huh?

339
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:52,234
Oh, come on.
It's not boring at all.

340
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:55,637
She's currently helping set up
a secondary derivative market

341
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:58,140
which would allow
overseas car firms

342
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,608
to hedge their investments

343
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:02,277
against potential advancements
in battery technology.

344
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,562
Hmm?

345
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:05,113
Thank you, Leonard.

346
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,482
That doesn't make it
sound boring at all.

347
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:11,587
(Leonard chattering excitedly)
So, how you holding up?

348
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:14,923
I'm fine.

349
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:16,691
Oh, who are you kidding?
She's breathtaking.

350
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:20,862
So, Penny,

351
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:22,698
Leonard tells me
you're an actress.

352
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:24,800
That must be
pretty exciting.

353
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,168
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's real great.

354
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,803
Today I drove to Van Nuys
for an audition

355
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:29,671
I thought was going to be
for a cat food commercial.

356
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,640
Turned out to be porn.

357
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,510
Did you get the part?

358
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:39,248
I didn't do the audition.

359
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:40,816
Given the state of your career,

360
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,985
can you really afford
to be picky?

361
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:47,823
I took acting classes
when I was at Cambridge.

362
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:48,991
I loved it.

363
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,559
<i>We did Taming
of the Shrew.</i>

364
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,861
Oh, wow. I love
Taming of the Shrew.

365
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:54,596
I did a paper
on it in high school.

366
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:58,066
"Who knows not where
a wasp does wear his sting?

367
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,101
In his tail."

368
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:01,136
"In his tongue""
"Whose tongue?"

369
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,005
"Yours, if you
talk of tails,

370
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,289
and so farewell."

371
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,291
"What, with my tongue
in your tail?"

372
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:07,643
(both laughing)

373
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,384
I'm regretting
my earlier cattiness.

374
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:18,153
She is an
absolute delight.

375
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:24,443
Wow.

376
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,867
Wow, indeed.

377
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:35,203
I can't believe we're
finally living together.

378
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,805
Yeah.

379
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,640
You know what would make
this moment perfect?

380
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:39,808
What?

381
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:43,011
A little snack.
You got any string cheese?

382
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,746
No.

383
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,448
I-I might have some cheddar.

384
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:48,317
Not as good.

385
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:51,053
You can't make strings with it.

386
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:53,188
Remind me to put it
on your shopping list.

387
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,490
Okay.

388
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,225
You have
hypo-allergenic detergent?

389
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,393
No.

390
00:16:58,394 --> 00:16:59,811
Better put it on the list.

391
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:01,763
If you wash my underwear
with regular soap,

392
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:04,299
<i>I get little red bumps
on my tuchus.</i>

393
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,237
Wait a second.

394
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,672
I'm doing your laundry?

395
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:14,343
Well, honey,
it's not gonna do itself.

396
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:15,977
Oh, before I forget,

397
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,863
tomorrow morning, you're
driving me to the dentist.

398
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,814
I have to take you?

399
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:23,118
You don't have to take me.
You get to take me.

400
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,171
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

401
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,590
your mother usually takes you
to the dentist?

402
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:30,158
It's not weird.

403
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,894
There's lots of kids there
with their moms.

404
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:36,098
I can't believe this.

405
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:37,766
What? It's fun.

406
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,034
If I have no cavities,

407
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,303
afterwards,
we go out for a treat.

408
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:45,507
All right, Howard, let's get
something straight right now.

409
00:17:45,508 --> 00:17:47,442
I'm not going
to be your mother.

410
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:48,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

411
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:50,846
Where did that come from?

412
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:00,188
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Who's that?!

413
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:03,658
Is it a
sex criminal?!

414
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:07,329
Nobody wants to do
that to you, Ma!

415
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,564
Where were you?!

416
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:10,999
Didn't you read my email?!

417
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,269
<i>You know I can't turn on
that ferkakta computer!</i>

418
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:18,507
I left you some brisket
on the kitchen counter!

419
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:20,175
Thank you!

420
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:21,543
Remember
to floss after.

421
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:25,097
We have the dentist
in the morning!

422
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:29,985
Oh, hey.
What's up?

423
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:31,353
I just wanted to
check in on you.

424
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:32,421
Why?

425
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,122
It seems like the
appropriate thing to do

426
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:36,058
when one's best friend
finds herself replaced

427
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,659
by a smart, beautiful woman

428
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,396
with the smoldering sexuality
of a crouched Bengal tiger.

429
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:45,033
I already told you,
I'm okay with it.

430
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:48,203
I mean, if anything,
I'm quite pleased

431
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:49,588
that Leonard
has found someone

432
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:52,591
(sobbing):
that makes him so happy.

433
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:55,177
It's okay, it's okay.

434
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:56,311
Thank you.

435
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:57,946
Now, let's get these
electrodes attached

436
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:00,632
and see what's going on in that
pretty little noggin of yours.

437
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,851
Okay.

438
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:10,438
(knocking at door)

439
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:13,778
I smell Chinese food.

440
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,197
It's actually Thai.

441
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:16,831
You're slipping.

442
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,385
Are Leonard and Priya here?

443
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:22,254
They went to Catalina
for the weekend.

444
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:23,488
Oh. Where's Raj?

445
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,391
At home, forbidding it.

446
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:27,893
How about Howard?

447
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,094
I'm given to understand

448
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:32,297
his mother grounded him
for running away.

449
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,434
Oh, okay.

450
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:39,271
Well, I guess it's just
the two of us, huh?

451
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:41,540
Actually, it's
the three of us.

452
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,842
AMY (on computer):
What up, bestie?

453
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,079
Good news.

454
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,548
Thanks to you, I was able
to make a rhesus monkey cry

455
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:51,717
like a disgraced televangelist.

456
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:54,553
Great.

457
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:55,821
So, you feeling better?

458
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:56,922
Not really.

459
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:59,558
Sheldon, you have
a guest who's upset.

460
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,560
Right. I'll make tea.

461
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:04,112
- Sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.
- I'm sorry. It's not optional.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
