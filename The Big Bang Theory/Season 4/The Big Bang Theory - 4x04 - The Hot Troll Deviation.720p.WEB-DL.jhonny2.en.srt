1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,962
I'm telling you,
if xenon emits ultraviolet light,

2
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:07,349
then those dark matter discoveries
must be wrong.

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,351
Yes, if we lived in a world

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,387
where slow-moving xenon
produced light,

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,156
then you'd be correct.
Also, pigs would fly,

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,991
my derriere
would produce cotton candy,

7
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,435
and <i>The Phantom Menace</i>
would be a timeless classic.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,319
You're so arrogant.

9
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:23,866
If you were a superhero,
your name would be Captain Arrogant.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,035
And you know
what your superpower would be?

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
Arrogance.

12
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:31,550
You're wrong again.
If my superpower were arrogance,

13
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:34,141
my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

14
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:39,146
I love watching them
try to work together.

15
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,836
It's like if Alien and Predator decided
to go partners in a Jamba Juice.

16
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,004
You're missing the big picture!

17
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,574
If you look
at neutron scattering data...

18
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,973
- What's up?
- I just wanted to make Raj

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,051
stop talking.

20
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,848
He won.
Suck it up.

21
00:00:57,835 --> 00:00:59,395
I'd ask you if you want dessert,

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,760
but I know Sheldon
doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays.

23
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:03,855
And if Raj wanted something,
he couldn't tell me.

24
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:06,537
Howard won't anything,
but he will come up with kind

25
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:08,985
of skeevy comment
involving the words pie or cheesecake.

26
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,524
And Leonard's lactose intolerant,
he can't eat anything here

27
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:15,241
without his intestines blowing up
like a balloon animal.

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,621
Hang on a second.
I could have the fruit platter.

29
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,081
- You want the fruit platter?
- Does it have melon on it?

30
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,416
No, I can't eat melon.

31
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,328
Howard, heads up.

32
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,809
Your ex-girlfriend
came in for her shift.

33
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:33,065
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Not since we broke up.

34
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:35,886
How am I going to play this?

35
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,011
Sophisticated and relaxed?

36
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:40,975
Friendly, noncommittal?
Cold and distant?

37
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:45,827
Hi, guys.

38
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,820
I see you decided to go
with pathetic and frightened.

39
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,572
It's one of his best moves.

40
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,663
My dear, we meet again.

41
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:48,877
I've missed you.

42
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,951
I've missed you, Katee Sackhoff.

43
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,300
- One question.
- Anything.

44
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,718
Why am I wearing
my <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> flight suit

45
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,678
in bed?

46
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,765
Why are you in bed with me?

47
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,827
If we start to question this,
it all falls apart.

48
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:06,897
Sorry.

49
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,009
Ravish me, Howard.
My loins ache for you.

50
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,225
Okay, if you insist.

51
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:20,004
Have you seen my girdle?

52
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,234
No, Ma!

53
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:22,566
I can't find it,

54
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,330
and I'm late
for my <i>Weight Watchers </i>meeting!

55
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:28,875
Maybe it committed suicide!
Leave me alone!

56
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,990
Now, where were we?

57
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:35,207
I believe you were
about to rip off my uniform

58
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:36,508
with your teeth.

59
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,512
Bernadette?
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,892
If I had to guess, I'd say I'm here

61
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:45,683
because you saw me this evening,
and you're still hung up on me.

62
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:48,186
- No, I'm not.
- Clearly you are.

63
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:53,433
Otherwise, based on past experience,

64
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,058
we'd be done by now.

65
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,683
I'm a little confused here.

66
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:00,990
Oh, my...

67
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,209
Can I help?

68
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,038
Not that kind of confused.

69
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:08,832
What's George Takei doing here?

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,418
Do you have latent
homosexual tendencies?

71
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,461
Of course not.

72
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,680
So you say.

73
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,494
Yet, here I am.

74
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,719
Let me ask you something.

75
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:25,014
How did you deal with being typecast
as a science fiction icon?

76
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:28,126
It's difficult.
You try and stretch as an actor...

77
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,329
do Strindberg, O'Neill,
but all they want is,

78
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,254
"Course laid in, Captain."

79
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:37,827
Tell me about it.
It's frackin' frustrating.

80
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,092
Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?

81
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:43,890
She's leaving because you really
want to be with me.

82
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,072
I found my girdle!
It was in the dryer!

83
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,523
Great, Ma!

84
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,019
I think it shrunk!

85
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:55,671
I'm spilling out
like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!

86
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,964
And with that mental picture,
I think we're done for the evening.

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,143
You never told me what happened
between you and Bernadette.

88
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:11,770
I did a stupid thing.

89
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,415
Yeah, I guessed that.

90
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:15,909
It was the kind of thing

91
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:18,276
that makes it kind of hard
to face her now.

92
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,093
That covers anything
from farting in bed

93
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:23,018
to killing a homeless guy.

94
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,232
Oh, my God.
You ran over a hobo.

95
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,675
- Stop asking.
- All right, fine.

96
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:33,617
You want to get back together,
but you're too ashamed to face her

97
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:35,460
because of whatever it is you did.

98
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:37,128
In a nutshell.

99
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:38,847
Well, how about this?

100
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,030
Kidnap Bernadette from the opera
wearing a creepy mask

101
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,105
so she doesn't know it's you.

102
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,306
Now, I don't know
if you're kidding or not.

103
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,590
You're being unreasonable.

104
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,540
Why can't I have a desk?!

105
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,742
Our collaboration
is a work of the mind.

106
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,231
We don't need desks.

107
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:58,483
- You have a desk.
- Correct.

108
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:00,474
- But I can't have one.
- You're two for two.

109
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,571
Why can't he have a desk?

110
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:07,144
Oh, Lord, will this day never end?
As I've explained repeatedly

111
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,592
to Dr. Koothrappali,
whose ability to comprehend

112
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:12,205
the American idiom
fails him when it's convenient,

113
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,078
there's absolutely no money

114
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,292
in my budget
for additional office furniture.

115
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:19,204
But there's money
for a drawer full of Red Vines,

116
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,953
a marshmallow shooting rifle,

117
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:24,426
and a super executive ant farm
with glow-in-the-dark sand?

118
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:30,932
- What if he buys his own desk?
- Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?

119
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,558
- That's ridiculous.
- Why?

120
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:33,727
Because...

121
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,315
Yes?

122
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,375
It's my office.

123
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,259
All right, all right.
He can buy his own desk.

124
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,199
And I can put it in your office?

125
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,703
You really want to dot the I's
and cross the T's, don't you?

126
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:57,125
- Why do you want a glowing ants?
- They do their best work at night.

127
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:04,883
It's okay.

128
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,657
Would you have opened the door
if you knew it was me?

129
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:28,754
Not since I found out the teddy bear
you gave me had a webcam in it.

130
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,285
I just have a question.

131
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,454
Does Bernadette ever talk about me?

132
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:36,416
- Absolutely.
- She does?

133
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,210
Yeah, sure. Yesterday, she asked,
"Why is Howard hiding under the table?"

134
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,743
- She saw that.
- No, not at first.

135
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:45,479
Right after I pointed it out.

136
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:49,636
Let me ask you something else.
Is she seeing anybody?

137
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:51,478
Not that I know of.

138
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:54,182
While we're on the subject,
why did you guys break up anyway?

139
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,267
I'd rather not say.

140
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:58,478
If you want my help,
I've got to know what happened.

141
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,063
But it's embarrassing...

142
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,189
that's what I'm counting on.
Spill.

143
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:07,079
You know <i>World of Warcraft?</i>

144
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,947
The online game?
Sure.

145
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:12,002
Did you know
that the characters in the game

146
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,952
can have sex with each other?

147
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:18,928
Oh, God. I think
I see where this is going.

148
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:21,918
Her name was Glissinda the Troll.

149
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:28,171
Bernadette walked in on me
while we were doing the cyber-nasty

150
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:29,823
under the Bridge of Souls.

151
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:34,389
You're right.
That is so embarrassing.

152
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:36,516
Would you talk to her?

153
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:38,385
Bernadette or the troll?

154
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,121
She was mad at me,
she wouldn't listen

155
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,649
- to my side of the story.
- What was your side?

156
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:47,834
For all we know, Glissinda the Troll
wasn't even a real woman.

157
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,315
She could've been
a 50-year-old truck driver

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,640
in New Jersey.

159
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,473
Really?
And that didn't make her feel better?

160
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,288
Will you talk to her,
if there's any chance at all

161
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,832
we could get back together?

162
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:03,918
Gee, I really don't want
to get in the middle of this.

163
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:05,938
No. Why would you?

164
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:09,841
I'm just another lonely nerd,
living with his mother,

165
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,787
trying to find any scrap
of happiness he can.

166
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,930
Maybe to make up
for the fact that his dad

167
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,682
left him when he was 11.

168
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,520
- Okay, I will think about it.
- I've always blamed myself

169
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,170
for him leaving.

170
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:27,609
I always thought it was
because I wasn't the son he wanted.

171
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,027
I said I'd think about it.

172
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,474
I wasn't athletic,
I was kind of sickly...

173
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:34,324
Okay, fine.
Look, I'm calling her now!

174
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:36,618
Thank you.

175
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:42,307
Howard asked Penny
to talk to Bernadette, and she did,

176
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:45,009
and Bernadette agreed to meet him
for a cup of coffee.

177
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,535
- One question.
- Yeah?

178
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,128
Why on earth
are you telling me all this?

179
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,497
I don't know.

180
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:56,190
Sometimes your movements are lifelike,
I forget you're not a real boy.

181
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,828
You said I could buy a desk.

182
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,996
This isn't a desk.

183
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,258
This is a...
Brobdingnagian monstrosity.

184
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:30,194
Is that the American idiom
for "giant, big-ass desk"?

185
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:33,073
It's actually British.

186
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,761
- Can you say it again for me?
- Brobdingnagian.

187
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,528
- One more time?
- Brobdingnagian.

188
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:43,750
- Now three times fast?
- Brobdingnagian, Brobdin...

189
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,856
How did you even get it in here?

190
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,175
That's for me, Ramon, Julio,
Jesus and Rodrigo to know

191
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,736
and you to find out.

192
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,496
All right, you've made your point.

193
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:00,366
A fine prank, very amusing.

194
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:02,205
Now get it out.

195
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:10,628
I have three brothers and two sisters,
I can do this all day.

196
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:13,546
All right,
if you're not going to remove it,

197
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:14,924
I'll remove it for you.

198
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,634
Knock yourself out.

199
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,559
Help me move my desk.

200
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:35,280
No. It's too Brobdingnagian.

201
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,491
Why do you even want this here?

202
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,744
Its size is completely
disproportionate to its purpose.

203
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,987
Seeing as its purpose
was to piss you off,

204
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,445
I'd say it's spot-on.

205
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:51,878
All right, I see what's going on.

206
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,589
This is the opening salvo
in what will be

207
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:55,983
an escalating series

208
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,844
of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.

209
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,213
Well titted.

210
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,486
Stand by for my upcoming tat.

211
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,898
See what I did there?
I turned it around.

212
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:21,247
- Sorry, I had to clock out.
- No, that's okay.

213
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,051
- How have you been?
- Okay.

214
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,130
You know, busy, schoolwork.

215
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:27,696
- You?
- Same.

216
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,022
I took a scuba-diving course
over the summer,

217
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,897
but it turns out
I'm terrified of the ocean.

218
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:35,169
Too bad.

219
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,177
You know anybody
who wanna buy a wetsuit,

220
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:38,402
boy's large?

221
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,231
Forget it, not important.

222
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,348
So, are you seeing anyone?

223
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,307
Well, to be honest, I...

224
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:50,476
Doing fine?
Can I get you something to drink?

225
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,229
- Not for me.
- I'm okay.

226
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,690
- Are you gonna wanna order food?
- Maybe latter.

227
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:56,733
So, are you seeing anybody?

228
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,641
That's what I said when he asked.

229
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:01,780
I hope that's not out of line.

230
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,825
- It's fine.
- Can we have a little privacy?

231
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:06,866
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,416
And you,
have you been seeing anybody?

233
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:16,379
Well, you know how it is with guys,
we have needs...

234
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,423
You've been seeing other girls?

235
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,866
Well, not real girls.

236
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,272
Does that mean slutty trolls?

237
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,309
You look thirsty,
I brought you some iced tea.

238
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,394
It's passion fruit, new on the menu.

239
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:33,146
I know. I work here.

240
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,756
You're right. Doy.

241
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,777
So, Howard, trolls: yay or nay?

242
00:13:39,714 --> 00:13:41,279
You can't be somewhere else?

243
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:42,760
Not where I can hear you.

244
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,369
Fine.

245
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:49,354
I'll admit,

246
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,747
there are dark, sordid little corners
of the internet

247
00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:55,418
where the name Wolowizard
is whispered in hushed tones.

248
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:01,447
But the only reason{\*I go there,
the only reason}
I've ever gone there,

249
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:04,469
is because I don't have
a real woman in my life.

250
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:06,971
You happy?

251
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,473
That'll hold me for a while.

252
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,598
You did have a real woman.

253
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,332
I was right there in the next room

254
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:16,694
while you were clicking
that troll's brains out.

255
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,277
But we weren't...

256
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:23,613
I mean, you and I never...

257
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:24,864
Had sex?

258
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,242
Whose fault was that?

259
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,825
Complimentary nachos!

260
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:31,881
You enjoy.

261
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,076
Never had sex?

262
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,669
What do you mean?

263
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:40,713
We could've been having sex,
but you never made the move.

264
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:43,174
I didn't think you wanted me
to make the move.

265
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,393
A girl doesn't go out
with a man like you,

266
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,643
with your looks, your fancy patter
and your tight hoochie pants,

267
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:53,254
if she's not expecting him
to eventually make the move.

268
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:55,686
Really?

269
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:56,771
Really.

270
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:58,663
Son of a bitch.

271
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,762
This is a little awkward,

272
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,833
but my manager says
I can't actually give nachos away.

273
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,213
So, take that when you're ready.

274
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,479
We had a really great talk,

275
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:14,735
we're gonna start
seeing each other again.

276
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,213
Congratulations.

277
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,001
Have you broken it to the troll yet?

278
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:20,879
Did Penny tell you about that?

279
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,922
No. Steve Patterson told me.

280
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,727
The greasy old fat guy
in Facilities Management?

281
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:29,208
How'd he know?

282
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:31,092
He's Glissinda the troll.

283
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:33,767
Sorry, dude,

284
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,975
the thermostat's
on my side of the room,

285
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,679
so it stays Mumbai hot in here

286
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,110
until you turn off
that stupid Indian music!

287
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:41,628
I'll turn off the music

288
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:44,194
when you get rid of that
salmonella-ridden parakeet!

289
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:47,363
Too bad,
you're pathologically afraid of birds!

290
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:51,011
Look, Sheldon!
Birdie, birdie, birdie!

291
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:53,369
That's it!
Prepare for marshmallow death!

292
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,084
Eat flaming Nerf!

293
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:06,111
So anyway,

294
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,260
great news about you and Bernadette.

295
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,633
I think I'm gonna take her
to miniature golf.

296
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,936
I guess for you,
that's like regular golf.

297
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,009
Short jokes? Really?

298
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,386
You're, like, a quarter of an inch
taller than me.

299
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:21,959
Yeah and don't you forget it.

300
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:26,778
I had a good time.

301
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,004
Me too.

302
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:29,897
Kiss her good night.

303
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,104
Now a little tongue.

304
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:39,997
Hold on there.

305
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:44,962
We've only rekindled the romance.

306
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,890
Let's not sully the moment
with the exchange of saliva.

307
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:54,201
Don't listen to him, she wants it!
Tongue!

308
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,310
See?

309
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,471
Now make the move.

310
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:05,150
Too soon.

311
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:07,036
Trust me, she's ready.

312
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:08,319
Make the move.

313
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:12,136
A lady wants to be wooed,

314
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,191
courted slowly.

315
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:17,915
How would you know?

316
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:21,135
I read.

317
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,574
Listen to me, Howard, it's time.

318
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:26,337
Make the move, now.

319
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,799
What are you doing?

320
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,045
You said...

321
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:35,013
The move, remember?

322
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,452
Not now.

323
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,476
We're starting a new relationship,
I need to get to know you again.

324
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,057
No, you don't.

325
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:42,195
It's me.

326
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,281
The lusty charmer with the fancy patter
and the hoochie pants.

327
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,324
Be patient,
we'll get there.

328
00:17:58,246 --> 00:17:59,490
Told you.

329
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:07,447
God, what's that smell?

330
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,805
What are you doing in there?

331
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:20,399
I'm making hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia gas.

332
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:23,481
Just a little experiment
in pest control.

333
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:26,731
It won't work, I grew up in India,

334
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,365
an entire subcontinent
where cows walk in the street

335
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,674
and nobody has ever had
a solid bowel movement.

336
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:35,155
We'll just see
how long you can hold out.

337
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:37,666
We'll just see
how your noxious gas fares

338
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,096
against my cinnamon-apple scented
aroma therapy candles.

339
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:44,833
Didn't you say
you're making hydrogen sulfide gas?

340
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,770
Isn't that flammable?

341
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:47,961
Highly.

342
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:49,954
Oh, dear.

343
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,266
This is not over.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
