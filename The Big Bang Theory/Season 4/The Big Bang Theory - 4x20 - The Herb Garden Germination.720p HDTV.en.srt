1
00:00:01,613 --> 00:00:05,883
My new book <i>The Hidden Reality</i>
takes on a grand question:

2
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:08,853
Is our universe
the only universe?

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:12,089
You see, there's a growing
belief among scientists like me

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:15,660
that ours may only be one
among many universes

5
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:17,728
populating a gigantic cosmos.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,665
In <i>The Hidden</i> Reality,
I explore this possibility

7
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,601
without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics

8
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:24,802
on the part of the reader.

9
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:28,105
Hysterical.

10
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:30,575
I'm glad you
talked me into this.

11
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:33,044
We work so hard, sometimes,
it's nice to goof off

12
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,746
- and do something silly.
- Agreed.

13
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:39,283
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

14
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:41,302
You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

15
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:45,423
You can think about Heisenberg's
"Uncertainty Principle"

16
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:47,425
much like the special order menu

17
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,861
that you find in certain Chinese
restaurants, where you have

18
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:52,897
dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B,

19
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,032
and if you order the first dish
in column A,

20
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,235
you can't order the corresponding
dish in column B.

21
00:00:57,737 --> 00:00:59,804
That's sort of like the
"Uncertainly Principle."

22
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:03,007
♪ Ba-dum-bump. ♪

23
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,012
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit
about Howard and Bernadette.

24
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:10,147
Really, Amy? Gossip?

25
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,883
I'm disappointed in you.

26
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:13,184
Now, now.

27
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:16,254
Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar
has identified gossip

28
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:18,656
as an aid to social
bonding in large groups.

29
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:22,326
Forgive my language,
but "poppycock."

30
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:23,361
What if he's right?

31
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:26,761
And by not participating in gossip,
society breaks down into

32
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,200
small feral bands of tattooed
motorcycle riders

33
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:31,547
fighting to the death over the
last few cans of tuna fish?

34
00:06:12,272 --> 00:01:32,971
Fine.

35
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:35,239
In the parlance
of the urban music scene,

36
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,875
"What's the 4-1-1"?

37
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:41,545
Bernadette is thinking about
breaking up with Howard.

38
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:44,382
I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

39
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:47,618
Excuse me.
Dr. Greene, question?

40
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,486
Yes?

41
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,871
You've dedicated
your life's work

42
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,890
to educating
the general populace

43
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:55,426
about complex scientific ideas.

44
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:56,694
Yes, in part.

45
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:58,229
Have you ever considered

46
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,364
trying to do something useful?

47
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:05,202
Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

48
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:06,854
Excuse me?

49
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:10,441
Yeah, but not your books;
something they might enjoy.

50
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:14,178

61
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:51,017
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

62
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,088
My father taught me archery
as a child.

63
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,426
It's odd how the activity

64
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:03,429
brings back the smell
of Kmart bourbon.

65
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:07,667
- Perfect.
- I know.

66
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,203
What an elf
I would have made.

67
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:12,839
Whoo.

68
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:14,006
What do you think you're doing?

69
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,541
Shooting at a target?

70
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,509
With what?

71
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,678
- An arrow.
- Really?

72
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,614
I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

73
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:23,683
I'm not going to do that,
Sheldon.

74
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:26,686
Leonard, the people at Nintendo
can only go so far

75
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:30,156
in helping us recreate
an actual athletic experience.

76
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,225
We have to do our part, too.

77
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:41,634
That was uncalled for,
but...

78
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:44,637
I'll play along... Ow!

79
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:51,210
I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

80
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:54,480
Really? How could you tell?

81
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,985
She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

82
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:00,720
- Mm. You don't say.
- Yes.

83
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,655
I think prolonged exposure
to Penny

84
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:05,558
has turned her into a bit
of a Gabby Gertie.

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,293
So, what's the gossip?

86
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,395
Oh, please, I was just
pointing it out.

87
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:11,914
I have no desire to engage
in the activity.

88
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,332
Fine, don't tell me.

89
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:17,587
All right, get this.

90
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,274
Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

91
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,608
Oh...

92
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,744
That's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

93
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:26,913
Mm, it's hard to say.
I can only speculate

94
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:28,347
based on the data I collected

95
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:30,216
watching my parents' marriage
implode.

96
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:33,636
In that case,
the woman dives into religion,

97
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,389
while the man dives
into a bottle-blonde bartender

98
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:39,976
who tries to buy my love
with action figures.

99
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:41,928
Oop! Out of arrows.

100
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,942
Boy, you sure get your money's
worth out of these games.

101
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,615
- Priya, can I come in?
- Sure.

102
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:05,451
Oh, God.

103
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:07,620
What?
It's okay.

104
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:10,590
You didn't know.
I'll take care of it.

105
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:12,642
What-what did I do?

106
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,093
Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

107
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,661
that close to the mirror.

108
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:16,762
You're kidding.

109
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,364
It's a splatter thing.

110
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:20,199
There's a little piece of tape
on the floor

111
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,134
you're supposed to stand behind.

112
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:24,070
- That's madness.
- I know.

113
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,305
Just do it. There's a big
inspection coming up,

114
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:29,325
and I don't want to lose
my TV privileges.

115
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:31,444
You really need
to let me take a look

116
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,179
at that roommate agreement,
one of these days.

117
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:34,697
Mm, I don't know.

118
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,866
I get a lawyer,
he gets a lawyer...

119
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:39,485
It's just easier
to stand behind the tape.

120
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,220
Oh, by the way,
a fellow at work

121
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:43,005
said I could use his
Dodger tickets this weekend.

122
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,291
- Does that sound like fun?
- Yeah!

123
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:48,094
Dodgers are baseball,
right?

124
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,162
You'll need to explain
the game to me.

125
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:51,597
Mm, it's complicated.

126
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,666
But as I remember it,
the essentials are

127
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:57,002
"get chosen last, get hit
by the ball, cry, go home."

128
00:05:57,004 --> 00:06:00,640
Well, regardless,
I've got four tickets.

129
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:03,142
And I was thinking we can bring
Bernadette and Howard.

130
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:06,612
She's really interesting,
and I bet I can get used to him.

131
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:08,514
Well, it might not
be a great idea

132
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,950
- to invite those two.
- Why not?

133
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,785
Don't tell anybody
I told you,

134
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,787
but I heard she might
be breaking up with him.

135
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,656
Oh... too bad...

136
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:19,041
Although I do know one person
for whom that's good news.

137
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,192
Really? Who?

138
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:21,460
My brother.

139
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:22,828
He's got a big crush
on Bernadette.

140
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,166
What?

141
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:29,268
You're kidding!

142
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,221
No. I found poems
he wrote about her.

143
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:33,639
Very disturbing.

144
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:37,843
"Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet."

145
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:43,049
- Wow, that's hard to believe.
- Yes.

146
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:44,917
And for years,
everyone in my family

147
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,987
was convinced that <i>he</i> was
the clarinet enthusiast.

148
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,741
Hmm. What's that
piece of tape?

149
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:55,528
Oh, that one doesn't
apply to you. You sit.

150
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:59,265
- Hey!
- Hey! How's it going?

151
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,400
Not too bad. Did you hear
about Howard and Bernadette?

152
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,369
'Course I heard about it.
How did you hear about it?

153
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,204
I heard about it
from Sheldon.

154
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,256
- He got it from Amy.
- Oh, damn it.

155
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:09,208
I told Amy that in the
strictest confidence.

156
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,378
Boy, some people are
such blabbermouths.

157
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,796
Well, whatever.

158
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:15,181
I'm sure Bernadette
can do better.

159
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:18,751
Do you think a sexually ambivalent
Indian astrophysicist

160
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:21,437
with selective mutism
and alcohol issues is better than

161
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,807
a hundred-pound Jewish guy
who lives with his mom?

162
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:27,360
You are kidding.
Raj likes Bernadette?

163
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:30,946
I didn't say Raj.
Who said <i>Raj?</i>

164
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:32,698
Okay, give.

165
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,133
How do you know?
Did he tell you?

166
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,485
- No.
- Well, then who?

167
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,654
I can't say...

168
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:42,074
Priya told you.
What a little gossip.

169
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:45,044
You know, not an attractive
quality in a woman, Leonard.

170
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:48,781
Not judging,
just my opinion.

171
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:50,750
Well, The point is,
if this got out,

172
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,952
it would destroy Howard
and Raj's friendship.

173
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:54,053
You don't have to worry.

174
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:57,623
Unlike Amy and Priya,
I know how to keep a secret.

175
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,559
You're the one who told Amy
in the first place.

176
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,461
In confidence!

177
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:10,703
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
How are you?

178
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,938
We're very rich
in a very poor country.

179
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,508
So, all in all,
can't complain.

180
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,543
So, Priya,

181
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:20,246
how are enjoying
staying with your brother?

182
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,515
It's fine. But if
I'm going to stay

183
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:23,682
in Los Angeles much longer,

184
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,084
I think I should
get my own place.

185
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,085
Why?

186
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:28,354
Is Rajesh not making you
feel comfortable?

187
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:31,157
Rajesh, why aren't you making
your sister comfortable?

188
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,726
I am making her comfortable.

189
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:34,960
Besides, she's not
sleeping here

190
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,196
half the time anyw...

191
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:39,799
What?

192
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,400
Where are you
sleeping, Priya?

193
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,235
It's a figure of
speech, Daddy.

194
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:46,839
It means I-I work late.

195
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,908
Please tell me
you're not dating an American.

196
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,543
I knew this would happen.

197
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:52,211
Rajesh, are you
letting your sister

198
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:53,913
date that little Howard boy?

199
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:57,483
Now, hold on. If she
is dating an American,

200
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,984
that's not a bad way to go.

201
00:08:58,986 --> 00:08:59,952
He's Jewish.

202
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,887
Those chaps are
very successful,

203
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,889
and they don't drink a lot.

204
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:06,358
It-It doesn't matter.
Howard has a girlfriend.

205
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,860
- For now.
- What does that mean?

206
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,061
I'll tell you later.

207
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:11,130
Is something going on
with him and Bernadette?

208
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:13,332
- Who's Bernadette?
- Doesn't sound Jewish.

209
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,301
You can't tell by that.

210
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:18,938
Winona Ryder is Jewish.

211
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,973
Okay, we're getting
off the subject.

212
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:22,741
Rajesh, I want
you to try harder

213
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,310
to make your sister
feel welcome.

214
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:25,878
Thank you, Daddy.

215
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,580
Don't worry. Everything I have,
I share with her.

216
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,415
Including my friend Leon...

217
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,651
Good night, Mummy.
Good night, Daddy.

218
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:37,189
Oh, my God,
I think you broke my toe!

219
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:39,425
You should have kept
your mouth shut.

220
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,327
Fair enough.

221
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,896
Now, what's up with Clarinet...?
Bernadette!

222
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,170
I've been thinking about
Dr. Greene's efforts

223
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:53,939
to make science palatable
for the masses.

224
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,508
Oh, yeah?
What about it?

225
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,677
That's all. I've just
been thinking about it.

226
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,982
Now, I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

227
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,251
Now I'm thinking about

228
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:09,321
the origin of the phrase
"train of thought."

229
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,090
Now I'm thinking about trains.

230
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,728
Are you listening
to this guy?

231
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,563
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:18,864
I was somewhere else.

233
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:21,433
Lucky bastard.

234
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:26,338
Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.

235
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,806
So what's up?

236
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,543
It's a Bernadette thing.

237
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:35,114
Oh, no. I hope
everything's okay.

238
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,585
Whatever it is,
we're here for you.

239
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:41,670
You can tell us anything.

240
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:44,390
Yeah. Good or devastating.

241
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,626
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

242
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:50,062
- Marry you?   - What?
- Yeah.

243
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:53,632
I just need to figure out the
right time to pop the question.

244
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:57,536
- Oh, I'd wait.
- No rush, no rush.

245
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:01,023
Oh, great. It's my cousin David
about the ring.

246
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,208
Hey, David, what'd you find?

247
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,910
Sure, a half a caret's fine.

248
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,981
Her freakishly small hands
make anything look big.

249
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,217
It's one of the reasons
I love her.

250
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:18,157
Man, he's going
to be blindsided.

251
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,528
I know. It'll be awful.

252
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,930
Why are you smiling?

253
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, Raj, why?

254
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:31,804
Uh, a smile means something
different in my country.

255
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:36,742
You know, tears of joy,
smile of sadness.

256
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:39,044
India's a goofy place.

257
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:43,616
Oh, I'm back to trains.

258
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:46,352
Woo-woo.

259
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,235
Did I tell you our lab got
a grant to study addiction?

260
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,269
- No.
- Fascinating work.

261
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:58,006
I recently trained a capuchin
monkey to smoke cigarettes.

262
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,875
Have you learned anything?

263
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:03,345
Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

264
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:06,482
Although it's not
much of a contest.

265
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:10,119
The other monkeys just
sit around and masturbate.

266
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:18,160
If you don't mind, I'd like to stop
listening to you and start talking.

267
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:19,828
By all means.

268
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,297
Howard has announced
his intention

269
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,466
to propose marriage
to Bernadette.

270
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:26,001
I don't understand.

271
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:28,604
The original piece of gossip
indicated an impending breakup.

272
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:29,705
I know.

273
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,241
The group consensus
is that his proposal

274
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:36,111
will be met with an humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

275
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:39,148
Everyone was set a-twitter.

276
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,885
Although oddly,
no one tweeted.

277
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:46,132
It's not surprising that
the story has captured

278
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,059
the attention of our
little circle of friends.

279
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:49,825
Are you familiar
with meme theory?

280
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:52,427
I'm familiar with
everything, but go on.

281
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:54,730
Meme theory suggests

282
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,332
that items of gossip
are like living things

283
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,135
that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

284
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:03,372
I'm no stranger to
memetic epidemiology.

285
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:05,240
At Johnson Elementary School,

286
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:10,045
the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

287
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,681
I should think so.

288
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,416
That's gold.

289
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:21,790
Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

290
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,859
How might we examine
this more closely?

291
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:27,729
Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

292
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:32,701
It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

293
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:36,171
We need to fabricate a
tantalizing piece of gossip.

294
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:40,076
And a second non-tantalizing
piece to use as a control.

295
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:42,444
Then we'll track its progress
through our social group

296
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,779
and interpret the results through
the competing academic prisms

297
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:48,884
of memetic theory,
algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

298
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:54,223
Look at you, getting me to
engage in the social sciences.

299
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:59,294
You're a vixen,
Amy Farrah Fowler.

300
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,235
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

301
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:08,370
Sheldon and I engaged
in sexual intercourse.

302
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,406
In other news, I'm thinking of starting
an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.

303
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:19,781
Oh, hey, Raj, what
are you doing here?

304
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:24,653
I just felt like drinking alone...
because I'm deep and dark.

305
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,355
Uh-huh.

306
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:27,856
So, uh, Howard's not here?

307
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:30,692
No. It's just one of those
times when it's just you and me.

308
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,794
Like when the three of us
went to the movies

309
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,529
and you and I waited outside
the bathroom

310
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:37,332
while Howard threw up
Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

311
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,902
Do you remember that?

312
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:41,003
Yeah.

313
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,237
Me, too.

314
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:44,006
Good times.

315
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,909
Alright, 16 wants
to order appetizers.

316
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:49,544
- Oh, thanks.
- This was nice.

317
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:55,067
What the hell are you doing?

318
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,352
Howard is your best friend,
and that is his girlfriend.

319
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,853
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

320
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,322
I was when I came in,

321
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,824
but it's amazing what
liquor does to guilt.

322
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:05,127
Besides what you
might not know is...

323
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:07,496
Bernadette is planning on
breaking up with Howard.

324
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:09,497
Well, I know that.
How do you know that?

325
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,098
My sister told me.

326
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,001
Oh, that gossipy bitch!

327
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:15,370
No offense.

328
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,421
None taken.

329
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:18,640
You should hear how
she talks about you.

330
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:22,311
Okay, listen, just because Howard
and Bernadette are having problems,

331
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,346
does not mean you should
be here sniffing around.

332
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,564
What can I do?

333
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,716
I can't stop
thinking about her.

334
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,936
All right, try
thinking about this...

335
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,021
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

336
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:36,158
Shut your ass!

337
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:41,830
Yeah, it's true.
Amy told me.

338
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:43,699
How did that even happen?

339
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,334
Did they know that's
what they were doing

340
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:47,569
when they were doing it?

341
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,972
I-I guess they just figured
it out at some point.

342
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,306
Wow.

343
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:55,077
I can't believe old
Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

344
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,015
- Hey.
- Hey.

345
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:00,949
Hope you're hungry.

346
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,418
Interesting.

347
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,687
A friendly sentiment
in this country,

348
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,291
cruel taunt in the Sudan.

349
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:12,761
It's a lesson in context.

350
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,863
Will Amy be
joining us for dinner?

351
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,398
Yes, I believe so.

352
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,866
Good, good.

353
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:21,069
Everything...
okay between you two?

354
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,643
Yes.

355
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:31,079
Why do you ask?

356
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:33,215
No reason.

357
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:35,417
I was just talking to Raj,

358
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:39,121
and he mentioned what a lovely
glow she has these days.

359
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:43,692
Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun,

360
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:47,262
tending an herb garden without
wearing a hat or sunblock?

361
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,600
No.

362
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:54,803
That's not what he meant.

363
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,773
Well, we may never know.

364
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:58,907
As my mother would say,

365
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:02,778
the Asians are
an inscrutable folk.

366
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:07,282
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

367
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:09,818
Yeah, you do.
You dog, you.

368
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,793
Did you get that?

369
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,895
Every word.

370
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:23,065
Our false gossip meme appears
to have reached node lambda.

371
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,166
This is moving faster
than we thought.

372
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:25,133
Agreed.

373
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:26,234
It appears the rate

374
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,402
of gossip transmission

375
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:29,471
is proportional
to the number of nodes squared.

376
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:32,074
I must say, Amy,

377
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:34,009
pretending to have
intercourse with you

378
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,946
is giving me a great
deal of satisfaction.

379
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,982
Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

380
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:45,654
- Pass the soy sauce.
- Sure.

381
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:49,324
Bernadette just asked about
my sexual encounter with you.

382
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,860
The meme has reached
full penetration.

383
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:56,932
Pun intended?

384
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,068
No. Happy accident.

385
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,171
This is remarkable.

386
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:05,056
Took less than 24 hours.

387
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:06,908
I should let you know

388
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,227
that she asked for details
about our dalliance.

389
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:10,879
Interesting.

390
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,515
So it went beyond the
mere fact of coitus

391
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:17,119
to a "blow by blow,"
as it were.

392
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:19,237
Pun intended?

393
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:22,557
I'm sorry. What pun?

394
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,027
Not important.

395
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,698
I described your lovemaking
as "aloof, but effective."

396
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,401
I wish you hadn't done that.

397
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,170
That's going to make
me a chick magnet,

398
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:38,874
and I'm so busy as it is.

399
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,375
Hey, everybody,

400
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:43,245
I got something I want
to ask Bernadette,

401
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,514
and I can't think
of a better time

402
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,149
than when I'm
with all my friends.

403
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:48,416
Oh, hold on, Howard.

404
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,785
There's lots of better times.

405
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:53,388
Leonard, please.
The man is talking.

406
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,459
Let him get it out, and let
the chips fall where they may.

407
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,562
Thank you.

408
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:04,733
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

409
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,768
Oh, God.
What's happening?

410
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,572
I know things haven't
been perfect with us,

411
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,007
and we've had our problems,

412
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:14,309
but I just have to tell you,
from the moment I...

413
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,878
Howard, let me just
stop you right here.

414
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,047
This is it.

415
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,851
Yes.

416
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:24,853
Yes, what?

417
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:26,855
Yes, I will marry you.

418
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:28,356
- You will?
- You will?

419
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:29,758
I will.

420
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,227
I will!

421
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:33,862
Oh, I love you so much.

422
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:35,180
Oh, I love you, too.

423
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,765
Congratulations!

424
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:38,635
Oh, it's so exciting.

425
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:45,308
I wonder what
changed her mind.

426
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,944
Perhaps your talk
of my sexual prowess

427
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:50,580
renewed her faith in love.

428
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:53,350
As good an explanation as any.

429
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,920
That's great...

430
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:02,028
Oh, hey, Amy.

431
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,029
Bernadette just texted me.

432
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,497
Howard proposed?

433
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,098
Yes, not important.
Just stopped by

434
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,717
to let you know I'm
getting orthotics.

435
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,035
Also, I'm carrying
Sheldon's baby.

436
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:10,202
Mum's the word.

437
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:19,612
You're pregnant?!

438
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,721
Wow. Is there anything
on there about orthotics?

439
