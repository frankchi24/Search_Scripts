1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,960
Whatcha doin' there?

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,000
Working on a new plan
to catch the roadrunner?

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,880
The humorous implication being
that I am Wile E. Coyote?

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,640
And this is a schematic
for a bird-trapping device

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,910
that will ultimately backfire
and cause me physical injury?

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,400
What I'm doing here

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,660
is trying to determine
when I'm going to die.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,140
A lot of people are working
on that research.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,970
So what is all this?

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,040
My family history
factoring in longevity,

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,210
propensity for disease, et cetera.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,680
Interesting.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,790
Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB.
What's "KBB"?

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,560
"Killed by badger."

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,800
How's that?

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,440
It was Thanksgiving.
Uncle Carl said:

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,120
"I think there's a badger
living in our chimney.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,710
"Hand me that flashlight."

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,380
Those were the last words
he ever spoke to us.

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,680
I don't think you need to worry
about death by badgers

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,060
being hereditary.

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,220
Not true.

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,310
The fight or flight instinct
is coded genetically.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,250
Instead of fleeing,
he chose to fight barehanded

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,910
against a brawny member
of the weasel family.

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,860
Who's to say that I don't share
that flawed DNA?

27
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,540
You can always get a badger
and find out.

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,290
But seriously,

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,010
even if I disregard
the Uncle Carl factor,

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,430
at best I have 60 years left.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,970
That long!

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,600
60 only takes me to here.

33
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,890
I need to get to here.

34
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,630
What's there?

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,300
The earliest estimate
of the singularity,

36
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,870
when man will be able
to transfer his consciousness

37
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,520
into machines
and achieve immortality.

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,850
So, you're upset about missing out

39
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,610
on becoming some sort
of freakish self-aware robot?

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,210
By this much.

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,660
- Tough break. You want eggs?
- You don't get it.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,780
I'm going to miss so much
the unified field theory,

43
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,430
cold fusion, the "dogapus".

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,060
- What's a "dogapus"?
- The hybrid dog and octopus.

45
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,430
Man's underwater best friend.

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,720
- Is somebody working on that?
- I was going to.

47
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,840
I planned on giving it to myself
on my 300th birthday.

48
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,190
Wait a minute.
You hate dogs.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,660
A dogapus can play fetch
with eight balls.

50
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,030
No one can hate that.

51

- What do we owe you?
- It came to $28.17.

57
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,170
Let's say six bucks apiece.

58
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,930
Here you go.

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,560
What?

60
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,270
- Never mind. I got it.
-

61
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
It's no big deal.

62
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,810
You're right. We're not going out

63
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,900
What?

65
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,700
but you wouldn't be able
to talk to yourself.

66
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,540
I'm a little low on cash.

67
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,250
- How much you got?
- Nothing.

68
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,800
- How can you walk 'm cute, I get by.

69
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,880
It's okay, you can owe me.
Sheldon, six bucks.

70
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,550
No, thank you.
I'm not eating pizza tonight.

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,790
But it's Thursday.
Thursday's pizza night.

72
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,910
Not for me.

73
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,030
Thursday is now
Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

74
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,250
Tonight's selection:

75
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,810
Brussels sprouts.

76
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,780
Really? You're changing
the Sheldonian calendar?

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,810
- It's a small price to pay.
- For what?

78
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,320
- Don't ask.
- Sorry

79
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,800
In order to live long enough
to fuse my consciousness

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,330
with cybernetics,
I need to change my diet.

81
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,500
Wait.
Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?

82
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,500
Correct.

83
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,000
You want to turn yourself
into some sort of robot?

84
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,830
Essentially, yes.

85
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,920
Here's my question.
Didn't you already do that?

86
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,970
Flattering, but sadly, no.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm also planning
to begin an exercise regimen

88
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,770
designed to strengthen
my cardiovascular system.

89
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,140
- AKA jogging.
- Wait.

90
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,400
- Honey, have you ever run before?
- Certainly.

91
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,530
I've run from bullies, dogs,

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,980
angry chickens,

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,710
and one particularly persistent
P.E. teacher

94
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,870
determined to bend me over
and give me a scoliosis test.

95
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,710
You're right, Penny jogs.
Maybe you guys can run together.

96
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,920
That's an excellent idea.

97
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,050
If we chat, it will create
the illusion of time going faster.

98
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,880
No, it won't.

99
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,350
How does he know I jog?

100
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,610
He watches you from his car
with high-powered binoculars.

101
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,390
That is so creepy!

102
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,730
I know!

103
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,650
And he says he's not gonna stop.

104
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,560
Then see a shrink
and figure out how to talk to women.

105
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,550
What the hell?

106
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,120
What's the matter?

107
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,760
I have pain radiating from my navel
to my lower right abdomen.

108
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,850
I'm nauseated and feverish.

109
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,580
I believe I may have cholera.

110
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,170
There's no cholera in Pasadena.

111
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,150
Just like last summer,
when there was no malaria in Pasadena.

112
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,130
If it's not cholera,
then based on a quick Internet search,

113
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,280
the other explanations
in decreasing order of likelihood

114
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,200
are Hirschsprung's Disease,
botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

115
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,470
or accidental ingestion
of chrysanthemum blossoms.

116
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,920
When would you have accidentally
eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,630
It's part of an unlikely scenario
that involves sleepwalking

118
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,510
and a 24-hour flower mart
with a less-than-vigilant proprietor.

119
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,550
Lord, my belly!

120
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,640
Ever had your appendix out?

121
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,610
I haven't.

122
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,870
I've been meaning to,
but who has the time?

123
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,810
Let's go spital.

124
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,390
So this is how it ends...

125
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,540
with cruel irony.

126
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,600
Just as I just make
the commitment to preserving my body,

127
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,110
I am betrayed by my appendix,
a vestigial organ.

128
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,620
Do you know the original purpose
of the appendix?

129
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,570
I do.

130
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,070
And yet I'm doomed
while you live on.

131
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,480
Funny how things work out, isn't it?

132
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,240
Lord, I think it's about to burst!

133
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,550
On the other hand,

134
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,090
it might have been
the Brussels sprouts.

135
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,990
Good night.

136
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,930
Good night.

137
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,720
Appendicitis.

138
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,390
What a nervous Nelly.

139
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,470
Coming, coming.

140
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,440
Hey, nice knees.

141
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,660
Thank you.

142
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,740
They're er}'s.

143
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,260
Why the Flash shirt?You're gonna run really fast?

144
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,970
No,  because it's Friday,

145
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,070
but it's nice when things work out.

146
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,550
- Where's your on't have one.

147
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,460
- ur pedometer?
- Don't have one.

148
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,880
And telematics in your shoes
connected to an iPod?

149
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,800
What do you do,

150
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,540
you just go out there
and gambol about like a bunny?

151
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,600
I just run till I'm hungry,
then I stop for a bear claw.

152
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,610
Why are you doing that?

153
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,230
It's good to stretch your muscles
before you run.

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,650
- All right.
- Let's start with a toe touch.

155
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,490
You do it.

156
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,070
I am doing it.

157
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,970
Good job.

158
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,050
Can you do this?

159
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,570
We'll never know.

160
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,430
Let's just warm up on the run.

161
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,770
Let's go.

162
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,100
I've been reading up
on biomechanics.

163
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,130
I think you'll be surprised at my...

164
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,870
- e you okay?
- I think so.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,930
- t me help you up.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,760
If it makes you feel any better,

167
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,990
Thursday is no longer
Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

168
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,840
Here's my chicken curry.

169
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,090
- Howard, your shrimp biryani.
- Thank you, sir.

170
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,240
- Palak paneer, that's Penny.
- Thanks.

171
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,130
And for Rajesh Koothrappali,

172
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,300
from whose homeland
these tasty dishes originate,

173
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,470
one large order
of chicken McNuggets.

174
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,140
What's my share?

175
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,100
12 bucks.

176
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,520
- Can I get you
- Sure.

177
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,310
What am I up to now?

178
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,650
With the Indian food, the pizza,
the Thai food, the tank of gas,

179
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,310
the frozen yogurt

180
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,780
and your rent

181
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
a little over $1,400.

182
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,780
What now?

183
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,090
He's just expressing his admiration

184
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,600
that you don't even have to put out
to get free stuff.

185
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,170
It's not free,
I'm gonna pay him back.

186
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,120
Shut up!

187
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,970
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

188
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,090
Coming!

189
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,560
<i>Greetings, friends.</i>

190
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Greetings,
whatever the hell you are.

191
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,580
<i>I'm a mobile virtual
presence device.</i>

192
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,240
<i>Recent events</i>

193
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,080
<i>have demonstrated to me
that my body is too fragile</i>

194
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,120
<i>to endure the vicissitudes
of the world.</i>

195
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,280
<i>Until such time as I am able
to transfer my consciousness,</i>

196
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,900
<i>I shall remain in a secure location</i>

197
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,720
<i>and interact with the world
in this manner.</i>

198
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,380
Really? That's your question,
when did he put a ramp in?

199
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,770
<i>You're in my spot.</i>

200
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,380
<i>This may seem a little odd at first,</i>

201
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,920
<i>but over time,
you'll grow accustomed</i>

202
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,780
<i>to dealing with me
in this configuration.</i>

203
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,850
To be honest,
I don't see much difference.

204
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,090
<i>nk you.
That's what I was going for.</i>

205
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,270
Now, Leonard, tomorrow,
when we go to work,

206
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,060
<i>you'll need to allow some extra time
to get me down the stairs.</i>

207
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,980
<i>For your convenience,</i>

208
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,450
<i>I disassemble into four pieces.</i>

209
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,950
This is ridiculous.
I'm coming to talk to you.

210
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,030
<i>You don't know where I am.</i>

211
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,820
<i>My physical body is safely ensconced
in a secure, undisclosed location.</i>

212
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,540
You're in your bedroom.

213
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,210
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

214
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,300
I can hear your voice
coming from your bedroom.

215
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,630
<i>No, you can't.</i>

216
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
<i>Wait.</i>

217
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,550
<i>Come back.</i>

218
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,670
<i>Halt.</i>

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
<i>Authorized personnel only!</i>

220
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,620
One of you weirdos
want to buy my underwear?

221
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,480
Only 1,400 bucks.

222
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,440
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

223
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,810
I'm behind you.

224
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,950
Please, look at me
when you're talking to me.

225
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,790
- I am looking at you.
- No, you're not.

226
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,090
Pay no attention
to that man in the bed.

227
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,390
You cannot exist
as a virtual presence.

228
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,640
Not here and certainly not at work.

229
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,390
At my age,

230
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,420
do you know how I'm statistically
most likely to die?

231
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,720
At the hands of your roommate?

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,300
An accident.

233
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,470
That's how I'm going
to make it look.

234
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,470
Until I can transfer my intellect
to a more durable container,

235
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,400
my body will remain
safely ensconced in my bed.

236
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,520
Fine, but don't expect my help.

237
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,070
You have to help.
It's in the roommate agreement.

238
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,400
No, it's not.

239
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,900
Section 74 C.

240
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,160
The various obligations and duties
of the parties

241
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,740
in the event
one of them becomes a robot.

242
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,790
I'll be damned.

243
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,980
<i>This is delightful.</i>

244
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,350
<i>It's much easier to enjoy
the picturesque route we travel to work</i>

245
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,400
<i>when you remove
the specter of fiery vehicular death.</i>

246
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,510
Refresh my memory.
Why didn't I put you in the trunk?

247
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,710
<i>Because I called shotgun.
Remember?</i>

248
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,800
Right.

249
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,630
<i>You seem tense.</i>

250
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,270
<i>Perhaps this will relax you.</i>

251
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,920
I don't wanna listen to music.

252
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
<i>Very well.</i>

253
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,770
<i>I don't understand
why you're not enjoying this.</i>

254
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,900
<i>Together, in this car,
with my enhanced capabilities,</i>

255
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,620
<i>we're like Knight Rider.</i>

256
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,910
<i>Except in Knight Rider,
the car isn't a yammering sphincter.</i>

257
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,380
<i>You mock the sphincter,</i>

258
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:40,710
<i>but it's a class of muscle without which
human beings couldn't survive.</i>

259
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,860
<i>There are over 50 different sphincters
in the human body.</i>

260
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,470
<i>How many can you name?</i>

261
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,610
<i>I was wrong,
this is exactly like Knight Rider.</i>

262
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,620
<i>Perhaps you'd be interested
in a different game.</i>

263
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,790
<i>This is a photograph
of the 1911 Solvay Conference</i>

264
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,300
<i>on the theory
of radiation and quanta.</i>

265
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,280
<i>Using Photoshop,
I've introduced a few anachronisms.</i>

266
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,400
<i>See if you can spot all 24.</i>

267
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,940
<i>I'll give you the first one.</i>

268
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,050
<i>Madame Curie should not be wearing
a digital watch.</i>

269
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
<i>And go.</i>

270
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,620
That's it.

271
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
<i>I have an override switch.</i>

272
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,590
I almost died!

273
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,960
<i>And I'm safe and sound in bed.</i>

274
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,340
<i>Who's crazy now?</i>

275
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm still gonna go with you.

276
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,740
<i>Hello, Professor Hoskins.</i>

277
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,220
<i>Nice to see you, Mindy.</i>

278
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,100
<i>Konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamora.</i>

279
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,860
<i>Sorry the Swedes
disproved your theory.</i>

280
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,210
<i>My door.</i>

281
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,460
What about it?

282
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,790
<i>Be a lamb and open it for me.</i>

283
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,090
Why? What's the problem?

284
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,660
<i>You think you have me stymied,
don't you?</i>

285
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,190
I think a doorknob has you stymied.

286
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,890
Look, it's Leonard and R2-D-Bag.

287
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,820
That's my joke, I told it last night.
You can't use it.

288
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,200
<i>Be a lamb and open the door for me.</i>

289
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,610
Sure.

290
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,500
<i>He's a lamb.</i>

291
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,840
<i>You're not.</i>

292
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,430
I'm a lamb.

293
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,460
<i>Isn't this nice?</i>

294
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,420
The pleasures of fellowship
and camaraderie

295
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,920
<i>without having to tolerate
your germy breath on my skin.</i>

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,120
Let's take him to Tatooine
and sell him to some Jawas.

297
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
That's two, dude.
Write your own jokes.

298
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,110
Great.

299
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,860
I'm Penny, I'll be your waitress.

300
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,440
You're introducing yourself?

301
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,990
I'd rather people not know
I've prior connection to you whatsoever.

302
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,280
<i>Can you tell me
the specials this evening?</i>

303
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,790
I'm not waiting on you.

304
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,450
<i>Obviously.
I don't even have water yet.</i>

305
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,620
Because you're not here.

306
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,880
<i>That's discrimination
against the otherwise located.</i>

307
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,800
<i>I'll have to go over your head.</i>

308
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
<i>Manager!</i>

309
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,040
Lord, look who it is.

310
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,560
- Is that Steve Wozniak?
- I think it is.

311
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,990
<i>The Great and Powerful Woz.</i>

312
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,820
He was one of the co-founders
of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs...

313
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,780
<i>I know.
I watch Dancing with the Stars.</i>

314
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,990
I must speak to him.

315
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,240
Of course.

316
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,190
There's an Olive Garden
down the street,

317
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,610
you should try it

318
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,830
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?</i>

319
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,710
Nice virtual presence device.

320
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,320
<i>I just want to say I'm a big fan.</i>

321
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,650
<i>You're my 15th favorite
technological visionary.</i>

322
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,510
Only 15th?

323
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,070
<i>It's still 6 spots above Steve Jobs.</i>

324
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,260
<i>I care neither
for turtlenecks nor showmanship.</i>

325
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,340
I never got that turtleneck thing.

326
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,990
<i>One of my proudest possessions</i>

327
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,810
<i>is a vintage 1977 Apple Two.</i>

328
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,580
<i>Despite the file system limitations
of Apple DOS 3.3,</i>

329
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,770
<i>it was a pretty nifty
little achievement.</i>

330
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,910
Thanks,
we were shooting for "nifty".

331
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,360
If you had it here,
I'd autograph it for you.

332
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,640
<i>Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes,
depending on how the buses are running.</i>

333
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,690
Nerds.

334
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,290
I'm coming, Woz, I'm coming.

335
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,720
What up, Shel-Bot?

336
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,120
<i>I can't get out of bed.</i>

337
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,460
<i>I hurt my ankle.</i>

338
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,170
What do you want me to do?

339
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,090
<i>Sing me Soft Kitty.</i>

340
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,800
<i>You want me to sing Soft Kitty
to a computer monitor?</i>

341
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,670
<i>Would you rather come over
and sing it to me in person?</i>

342
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,170
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

343
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,760
<i>Little ball of fur</i>

344
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,430
<i>Closer to the microphone.</i>

345
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,090
<i>Happy kitty, sleepy...</i>

346
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,380
<i>You have to start over.</i>

347
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,700
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

348
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,390
<i>Little ball of fur</i>

349
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,080
<i>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty</i>

350
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,290
<i>Purr, purr, purr</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
