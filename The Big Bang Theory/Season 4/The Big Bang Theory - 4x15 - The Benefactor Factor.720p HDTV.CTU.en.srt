1
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,599
Here's what I wonder
about zombies.

2
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:08,495
What happens if they can't get
any human flesh to eat?

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:11,698
They can't starve to death--
they're already dead.

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,601
You take this one.
I spent an hour last night on

5
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:16,102
"How do vampires shave

6
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:18,204
when they can't see
themselves in the mirror"?

7
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:21,007
Well-groomed vampires
meet in pairs

8
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:23,142
and shave each other--
case closed.

9
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:26,712
Yeah, okay, so, zombies.

10
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:28,714
I guess it depends
on the zombies, Raj.

11
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:30,516
Are we talking slow zombies,
fast zombies?

12
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:32,718
<i>Like, in 28 Days,
if those zombies didn't eat,</i>

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,986
they starved.
You're thinking

14
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:35,588
<i>of 28 Days Later.</i>

15
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:37,622
<i>28 Days is where
Sandra Bullock goes to rehab</i>

16
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:40,391
and puts the audience
into an undead state

17
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,834
Hey, don't bag
on Sandra Bullock!

18
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,703
You think it makes you
look cultured,

19
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:47,506
but you just
come off as bitter.

20
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:50,509
Oh, Dr. Siebert,
twelve o'clock.

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,811
Why's the president
of the university

22
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,812
slumming in the cafeteria?

23
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:56,914
Perhaps he's emulating
Shakespeare's Henry V,

24
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:59,316
who dressed as a commoner
and mingled among them,

25
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:02,352
to find out how he was being
perceived by his subjects.

26
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,387
Of course, if he'd

27
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,155
have read any
of the 1,300 e-mails

28
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:07,190
I've sent him on the subject
of his administration,

29
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,443
he could have saved himself
the trouble.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,474
Or maybe he heard it's
Tator Tot Tuesday.

31
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:13,010
That's why I'm here.

32
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:16,379
Hey, there's
my favorite geniuses!

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,381
How are we doing today?

34
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:19,783
That depends--
how much longer

35
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:22,519
do you plan on
fondling my shoulder?

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,521
Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot
you have a touch phobia.

37
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:27,923
It's not a touch phobia,
it's a germ phobia.

38
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:30,693
If you'd like to go put on
a pair of latex gloves,

39
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,594
I'll let you check me
for a hernia.

40
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:34,396
Yeah.

41
00:01:34,397 --> 00:01:37,166
So, listen, fellas, who's up
for a little party this Saturday night?

42
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,369
Open bar, good eats, might
even be a few pretty girls.

43
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,569
Sounds great!
I'm in!

44
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,004
Hold on.

45
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,106
Just because the nice man
is offering you candy,

46
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:47,408
doesn't mean you should jump
into his windowless van.

47
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:51,312
What's the occasion?

48
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:53,514
Just a little fund-raiser
for the university.

49
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:57,151
Aha! The tear-stained air
mattress in the back of the van.

50
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,019
I understand
your reticence, Dr. Cooper,

51
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,254
and I sympathize,
but the hard facts are,

52
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,523
occasionally,
we have to shake a few hands

53
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,626
and kiss a few butts
to raise money for our research.

54
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,476
I don't care;
it's demeaning.

55
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:10,879
And I refuse to be
trotted out and shown off

56
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,114
like a prize hog
at the Texas State Fair.

57
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:15,749
Which, by the way, is something
you don't want to attend

58
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,286
wearing a Star Trek
ensign's uniform.

59
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:19,420
All right,

60
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:20,888
let me put it this way.

61
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,590
You're gonna put on a suit,
you're gonna come to this party,

62
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,293
and you're gonna
explain your research

63
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:26,760
to a bunch of old people,

64
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:29,762
or I swear to God,
I'll blind you with a hot spoon,

65
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:33,033
<i>like they did  to that little boy
in Slumdog Millionaire.</i>

66
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:35,001
Oh, you don't want that.

67
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:37,404
So, Saturday night!

68
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,205
It's gonna be
off the hook.
Ugh!

69
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,206
Get over it.

70
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:43,876
Oh, boy!

71
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:45,911
Tator tots and
a party invitation?

72
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:47,712
What a great day!

73
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:53,085
Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state

74
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,288
Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait!

75
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,923
The Earth began to cool

76
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:00,826
The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools

77
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:03,294
<i>We built the Wall
We built the pyramids</i>

78
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,929
Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery

79
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,465
That all started
with a big bang-- Bang!

80
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:11,168
<font color=#00FF00>The Big Bang Theory 4x15</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>The Benefactor Factor</font>
Original Air Date on February 10, 2011

81
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:17,251
There you go.

82
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:23,522
Are you sure
this is right?

83
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:27,660
Yeah, just tuck that
part in your pants;  you'll be fine.

84
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:32,698
<i>Okay, let's go smooch some
rich, wrinkled tochis.</i>

85
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,867
Oh, Howard, I can't believe
Bernadette let you go

86
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,801
to a fancy party
wearing a dickey.

87
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:40,004
Excuse me, my girlfriend
doesn't pick out my clothes.

88
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:42,274
My mother does.

89
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:43,978
Oh. We should
get going.

90
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,089
What about Sheldon?

91
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,167
Sheldon is not going.

92
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:49,005
Really? What do we tell Siebert?

93
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:52,955
Tell him Dr. Cooper feels
that the best use of his time

94
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:55,806
is to employ his rare
and precious mental faculties

95
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:59,561
to tear the mask off nature
and stare at the face of God.

96
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:04,066
Sheldon, it's Saturday night,
you'll be doing laundry.

97
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,536
Don't tell him that,
tell him the mask thing.

98
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:15,476
Hey, put your tie
back in your pants.

99
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:18,746
Nice place.

100
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:21,349
Reminds me of my parents'
house back in New Delhi.

101
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,518
- You're kidding.
- No. We are very wealthy.

102
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,619
But the only difference is,
we have more servants.

103
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,399
- More than this?
- More than we can use.

104
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:29,861
You see, in India,
we don't make the mistake

105
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,369
of letting our poor people
have dreams.

106
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,729
Ah. There's my band
of brainiacs.

107
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,830
Where's Dr. Cooper?

108
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,702
He's tearing the mask off nature
to look at the face of God.

109
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:46,372
The board of directors insists
he has a beautiful mind.

110
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,706
I think he's just bananas.

111
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,076
Come on, let me introduce you

112
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,843
to one of the university's
leading donors.

113
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:57,615
I think we were misled
about the cute girls.

114
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:00,118
Mrs. Latham, I'd like
you to meet three

115
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,586
of our outstanding
young researchers.

116
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:03,154
This is Dr. Leonard
Hofstadter,

117
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:06,591
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
and Howard Wolowitz.

118
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,093
Well, what happened
to you, Wolowitz,

119
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:10,962
couldn't stick with it
long enough to get your PhD?

120
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:12,796
I'm an engineer.

121
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:14,764
Most engineers
don't bother with a PhD.

122
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,600
But you may be
interested to know

123
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,903
I designed the zero-gravity
waste-disposal system for NASA.

124
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,063
Got it--
you're a space plumber.

125
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,849
I'm gonna go hit the bar.

126
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,546
Tell me about
these two.

127
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,048
- Do him first.
- Dr. Hofstadter

128
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,518
is representing our
experimental physics
program tonight.

129
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,885
I think you'll
really enjoy

130
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:38,087
hearing about his
fascinating work.

131
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,155
Right.

132
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,889
Fascinate me.

133
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:46,694
They're cute when they're about
to wet themselves, aren't they?

134
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:48,696
I'll make it
easy for you.

135
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:50,698
When you arrive at the lab
in the morning,

136
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,501
what sort of machine
do you turn on?

137
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,837
Coffee maker?

138
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:59,641
All right, Dr. Kooth--
uh, whatever it is-- you're up.

139
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:01,175
It's Koothrappal

140
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,177
I have to tinkle.

141
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:09,042
And so, instead
of bowing to pressure,

142
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,078
and going to that
pointless soiree,

143
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,581
I stayed right here
and did a load of whites.

144
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,350
Well, normally I respect
your macho rebellious attitude

145
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,086
toward "The Man,"

146
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:23,890
but, in this case, I think
you've made a foolish mistake.

147
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:25,556
Unlikely.

148
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,926
But make your case.

149
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:30,428
Keeping in mind that
your critical attitude

150
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,430
is ruining our
Saturday night together,

151
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:35,200
and I'm not above
minimizing your window.

152
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,535
Sheldon, like it or not,

153
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:39,971
until you manage
to upload your intelligence

154
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:41,939
into a self-sustaining
orbiting satellite,

155
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,308
equipped with high-speed
Internet and a cloaking device,

156
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:47,611
you will be dependent on other
members of the human race.

157
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:50,380
That's it.
Prepare to be minimized.

158
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:52,183
I'm not finished.

159
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:53,884
All scientists have
to fund-raise, Sheldon.

160
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:56,153
How do you think
I paid for my lab?

161
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,721
I went to Saudi Arabia
and met with a prince

162
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:00,623
who had an interest
in neurobiology.

163
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:04,427
Your lab is funded by some
Middle-Eastern dilettante?

164
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:07,130
Technically,
Faisal is my fiancé.

165
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,767
But I do have a state-of-the-art
two-photon microscope

166
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,769
and a place to stay in Riyadh
for the winter.

167
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,973
Well, that explains those
puzzling camel race photos

168
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:20,342
on your Facebook page.

169
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:21,877
And consider this:

170
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:24,512
without you to make the case
for the physics department,

171
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:27,115
the task will fall to people
like Leonard and Rajesh.

172
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:29,317
Are you trying to scare me?

173
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,585
'Cause you're succeeding.

174
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,321
Well, then prepare
to be terrified.

175
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,956
If your friends
are unconvincing,

176
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,958
this year's donations
might go to,

177
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,425
say, the geology department.

178
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,095
Oh, dear, the dirt people!

179
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:45,832
Or worse-- it could go to...

180
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,868
the liberal arts.

181
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,637
No!

182
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,707
Millions of dollars
being showered on poets,

183
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,378
literary theorists
and students of gender studies.

184
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,414
Oh, the humanities!

185
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,185
On the bright side, I don't
think President Siebert

186
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,388
will be making us go
to any more fund-raisers.

187
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,323
It was so much easier
at my bar mitzvah.

188
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,658
The old people just came up
to you, pinched your cheek

189
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,161
and handed you a savings bond.

190
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,396
Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.

191
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,165
Look at the size
of these shrimp!

192
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,869
At what point do we start
calling them lobsters?

193
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,172
Face it, Raj,
we crashed and burned tonight.

194
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,308
Oh, you didn't
do that badly.

195
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,743
Mrs. Latham, the first machine
I turn on in the morning

196
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:36,280
is the helium-neon laser,
'cause it needs to warm up.

197
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,848
I no longer care, dear.

198
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,350
But don't worry,

199
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,352
I really enjoyed
meeting you this evening.

200
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:44,321
u're kidding.
That was good for you?

201
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:46,589
'Cause I was sweating
through my T-shirt.

202
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,925
Excellent! There's
nothing I like better

203
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,627
than making smart people
feel ill at ease.

204
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:53,529
Why?

205
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,731
Oh, I don't know,
it's one of the fun things

206
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:58,534
you get to do when
you have lots of money.

207
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:59,969
Watch.

208
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,638
Hey! Who said you
could eat that shrimp?

209
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,176
See? Fun.

210
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:10,445
No, no, no, I'm just here

211
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:11,746
for your money.

212
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:14,149
I don't want to shake
anyone's germy hands.

213
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,652
Explain it to
them, Siebert.

214
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:23,204
I must confess

215
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,806
I don't understand you,
President Siebert.

216
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:27,575
First you say you want me
to appear at your fund-raisers,

217
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:30,078
but now you say
you never want me to go

218
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,812
anywhere near your fund-raisers.

219
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,815
Forgive me, but that sounds
like a mixed message.

220
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:36,416
Here we go again.

221
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,585
If there's simply
no talking to me,

222
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,655
why did you call?

223
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:43,523
I'm sorry, someone's
on the other line.

224
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:46,093
Why don't you see if you
can organize your thoughts,

225
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:49,228
and we'll try again later.

226
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:51,864
Cooper-Hofstadter residence.
Go for Cooper.

227
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,966
Good morning, Mrs. Latham.

228
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,102
Well, yes, of course
I remember you.

229
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,770
A woman well past her prime

230
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,672
seeking to augment
her social status

231
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:02,608
by doling out her late husband's
ill-gotten gains.

232
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:07,545
So, how much money
are you going to give me?

233
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:10,882
I'm not crazy--
my mother had me tested.

234
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,417
Well, if you're not

235
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,120
going to give me money,
then why are you calling?

236
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,222
She wants to talk to you.

237
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:20,390
Who's crazy now?

238
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,560
Hello, Mrs. Latham.

239
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:26,463
Yes, I live with him.

240
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,966
I don't...
I-I really don't know why.

241
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:38,007
Tonight? Sure,
that'd be great.

242
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:40,409
Okay, I'll see you then.

243
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,778
Bye.

244
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,914
She wants to have dinner
and talk about my research.

245
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:48,384
An entire dinner
to talk about your research?

246
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,788
Where you going, the drive-thru
at Jack in the Box?

247
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,392
Well, wherever
we're going,

248
00:10:57,393 --> 00:11:00,528
she's sending a car
to pick me up.

249
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,864
Okay,

250
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,966
- I see what's happening.
- What?

251
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,135
My stature intimidates her,

252
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:09,403
so she's using you to get to me.

253
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,641
Crafty old gal.

254
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:16,510
Excuse me, but you are not the
only distinguished scientist

255
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:17,812
in this apartment.

256
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,580
I've been published in
peer-reviewed journals,

257
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,715
I received a Dissertation
of the Year award

258
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:23,716
for experimental
particle physics.

259
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,153
No, that can't be it.

260
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:27,587
And since you seem

261
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,790
to have forgotten,
the reason we live together

262
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,457
is we're best friends.

263
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,559
And I got your back, Jack.

264
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,298
That was a great meal.
I'm glad you
enjoyed it.

265
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,401
The only time I eat this well
is when my mom's in town

266
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,904
- and she takes me out to dinner.
- Is that so?

267
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,738
You kind of
remind me of her.

268
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,475
She enjoys making people
uncomfortable, too.

269
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,545
Well, you remind me of
a boy I dated in college.

270
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,479
- No kidding.
- Sweet boy.

271
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,781
Very smart.

272
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,250
If only he'd had money.

273
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,720
Yeah, um...

274
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,190
so, hey,
speaking of money,

275
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,492
how are you feeling about
helping the physics department

276
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:11,428
get a cryogenic centrifugal
pump and molecular sieve?

277
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,898
Well, I must say, you make a
very persuasive case for it.

278
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,167
Oh, good, good.
And I'm seriously

279
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,836
considering taking it
to the next level.

280
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:21,871
Terrific. Great.

281
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,106
What level is that?

282
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,549
Okay, now you don't
remind me of my mom.

283
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:43,291
I'm sorry, so, eventually,
zombies are going to attack

284
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,261
the rehab facility
where Sandra Bullock is?

285
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:50,998
Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

286
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,635
You know, it's a shame, all that
work she's doing to get sober,

287
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,804
only to be torn apart
and eaten alive.

288
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:01,541
Hey. How was dinner?

289
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,978
Swell. I need a drink.

290
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:06,279
Do we have any alcohol?

291
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,383
No. But we have potatoes--
I could make you vodka.

292
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:11,751
It'll take two weeks.

293
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,087
Leonard, are you okay?

294
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:16,622
Um, I'm not sure.

295
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:18,057
What's going on?

296
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:21,294
Well, Mrs. Latham said
she was seriously considering

297
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,462
donating money so we could get
a cryogenic centrifugal pump...

298
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,998
Yes!
Oh, wow!

299
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,901
...then she stuck
her tongue down my throat.

300
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,569
Why?

301
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,138
Okay, we can't keep
explaining everything.

302
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,739
Read that book
we got you.

303
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,309
She hit on me.

304
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,710
Wait-wait-wait.
Are you telling us

305
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,179
that old lady wanted
to have sex with you

306
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,917
in exchange for giving your
department millions of dollars?

307
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:47,118
I think so.

308
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,387
You lucky duck.

309
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:53,924
You're really
a broken toy, aren't you?

310
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,259
I was able to get out of there
before anything else happened,

311
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,061
but she wants to see me again
tomorrow night.

312
00:13:58,062 --> 00:14:00,797
Excellent!
What are you planning to wear?

313
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,399
What?

314
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,936
Penny, you're an expert on trading
sexual favors for material gain--

315
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,604
walk him through this.

316
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:12,541
Well, n-no, hold on a second,
I'm not going to sleep with her.

317
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,945
But we need a cryogenic
centrifugal pump.

318
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,647
Well, forget it!
It's not gonna happen.

319
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:21,683
Well, come now, Leonard,
this may be your only chance

320
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:24,086
to make a real contribution
to science!

321
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:27,255
I repeat: Not gonna happen.

322
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:33,227
What was all that
about me trading sexual favors

323
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:34,929
for material gain?

324
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,398
It was a compliment.

325
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,268
I believe in giving credit
where credit is due.

326
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:44,938
Okay, fine. I'll tell him.

327
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:47,574
Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car
is here for you.

328
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,609
I won't be too late;
I'm just gonna make

329
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,112
a final pitch for the funding
and then say good night.

330
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:54,481
Hold on,
I have something for you.

331
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,850
What's this?

332
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,684
Just a few things you
may need tonight.

333
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:01,653
Baby oil, condoms
and, uh...

334
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:04,556
a little something I procured from the
school of pharmacology.

335
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:08,494
They say it is to Viagra as
Viagra is to a green M&M.

336
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:15,233
I am not going
to have sex with her.

337
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,934
Maybe this will overcome
your reluctance.

338
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:19,570
I went on the Internet
and found a photograph

339
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:23,641
of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham
to get your libido humming.

340
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:29,014
Check out those saddle shoes.

341
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:35,752
Are you insane?

342
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:37,554
I'm not going
to prostitute myself

343
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:39,856
just so we can get
some new equipment.

344
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,425
Oh, come on! Why not?

345
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,260
Good night,

346
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:44,861
Sheldon.
Given how much time

347
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,030
you spend engaging
in pointless self-abuse,

348
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,965
you might consider,
just this once,

349
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:53,269
using your genitalia to
actually accomplish something!

350
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,673
He still won't shag
the old lady, huh?

351
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:00,910
No. But thank you for asking.

352
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,113
Hey. Hi.

353
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:06,648
Hello, Leonard.

354
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,183
I hope you're hungry.

355
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:09,951
I'm very hungry.

356
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:12,620
For food, right?

357
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,123
Oh, I made you uncomfortable
last night.

358
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:16,958
I'm so sorry.

359
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,260
No, that's okay.

360
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,194
No, it most
certainly is not.

361
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:22,430
Leonard, I'm making the
donation to your department

362
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,732
regardless of what
happens between us.

363
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,801
- Really?
- Well, of course.

364
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:28,670
There's no quid
pro quo here.

365
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,672
You and your colleagues are
doing remarkable research,

366
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,406
and you deserve the money.

367
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,108
Oh.

368
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,543
Then what was
last night about?

369
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:39,646
I took a shot; sue me.

370
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,148
Oh.

371
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,051
You're a very
handsome man, Leonard.

372
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,621
Thank you.

373
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:50,923
It was foolish of me to
think someone your age

374
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:53,492
might ever be interested
in someone like me.

375
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:54,827
Oh, don't say that.

376
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:56,696
- You're a very attractive woman.
- Oh, please.

377
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:59,665
- No, it's true.
- Well, aren't you sweet.

378
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,968
Just for the record...

379
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:05,471
you'd remember a night with me
for the rest of your life.

380
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,575
I'm sure I would.

381
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,511
But why-why, exactly?

382
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:15,546
You're a very smart man.

383
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:18,449
How do you think I landed
such a rich husband?

384
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,919
I hadn't really
given it much thought.

385
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,854
Well, think about it.

386
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:27,658
Do you mean...?

387
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,994
Yep. I'm that good.

388
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:36,033
Oh, what the hell.

389
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:53,683
Good morning, slut.

390
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:58,219
What?

391
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,990
Oh, please, I recognize
the walk of shame
when I see it.

392
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:04,092
All you're missing is
a little smeared mascara

393
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,394
and a purse with panties
wadded up in it.

394
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,063
What's
going on?

395
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,397
Oh, nothing's going on.

396
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:10,498
Excuse me.

397
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:12,366
- Are you just getting home?
- Yeah.

398
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,169
That's a good sign, right?

399
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,303
Oh, yeah.

400
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,973
I'm so proud of you!

401
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,141
You sold yourself out

402
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,309
like a common streetwalker!

403
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,914
No, I didn't do it
for the money.

404
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:28,214
She stiffed you?

405
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,084
I believe that's what
your roommate did to her.

406
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:33,141
What?!

407
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:35,723
Again, read the
book we gave you.

408
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:37,456
No, I mean,

409
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:39,003
I-I got the money first.

410
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:40,685
Smart. Get paid up front.

411
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:43,860
Yeah, I think you have a real
knack for gigolo work, Leonard.

412
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:45,831
Uh...

413
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm gonna go lie down.

414
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:49,902
That's a good idea;
get your rest.

415
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:52,004
There are a lot more
rich old ladies out there,

416
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,605
and Daddy needs
a new linear accelerator.

417
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,929
And I thought he didn't learn anything
from his relationship with you.

418
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:02,842
Hey!

419
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:03,973
Another compliment!

420
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:05,649
Learn to recognize them.

421
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:13,681
Ah, there he is!

422
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,183
The man of the hour!

423
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,851
He took one for the team!

424
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:23,090
I didn't do it
for the money!

425
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:26,627
Keep telling yourself that--
it makes it easier.

426
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,996
Trust me, I know.

427
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:32,466
Cool, buddy!
That's awesome!
Yeah!

428
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,268
<i>How was she?</i>
