1
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:12,154
Clarify something for me.

2
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:13,189
Isn't the point

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,257
of a communal meal

4
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:17,893
the exchange of ideas
and opinions?

5
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,629
An opportunity to consider
important issues of the day?

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,964
It is.

7
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:23,832
You just kind of put
a damper on things

8
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,467
when you said,
"The next person I see talking

9
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:28,037
with food in their mouth
will be put to death."

10
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:31,307
Well, we could argue about
who said what all night long,

11
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:34,109
but to set things back
on course,

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,445
I will propose
a new topic of conversation.

13
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:37,479
(groans)
(groans)

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
Great.

15
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:40,549
What is the best number?

16
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,353
By the way, there's only
one correct answer.

17
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:48,157
5,318,008?

18
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:49,358
Wrong.

19
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:53,495
The best number is 73.

20
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:57,800
You're probably wondering why.

21
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,301
No. Uh-uh.
We're good.

22
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:01,720
73 is the 21st prime number.

23
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:05,707
Its mirror, 37, is the 12th,
and its mirror, 21,

24
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,409
is the product of multiplying--

25
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,779
hang on to your hats--
seven and three.

26
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:14,783
Eh? Eh? Did I lie?

27
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:15,818
We get it.

28
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,687
73 is the Chuck Norris
of numbers.

29
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,390
Chuck Norris wishes.

30
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:24,059
In binary, 73 is a palindrome:

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,795
"one-zero-zero-
one-zero-zero-one"

32
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:30,266
which backwards is "one-zero-
zero-one-zero-zero-one"--

33
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:31,634
exactly the same.

34
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:36,038
All Chuck Norris backwards
gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."

35
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,073
Just for the record,

36
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:41,627
when you enter 5,318,008
on a calculator,

37
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:44,546
upside-down it spells "boobies""

38
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:48,918
Remember when you were wondering

39
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:51,086
why the girls didn't
want to eat with us tonight?

40
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:53,088
Yeah, I get it now.

41
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:56,725
I love your little
heart locket, Bernadette.

42
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:58,060
Oh, thanks.

43
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,361
Howard gave it to me.

44
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:00,696
It's the cutest thing.

45
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:02,431
Every time I have
dinner with his mom,

46
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,400
the next day I get jewelry.

47
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,469
Did you know that the iconic
Valentine's heart shape

48
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,872
is not actually based
on the shape of a human heart,

49
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,507
but rather on the shape
of the buttocks

50
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,242
of a female bending over?

51
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:18,013
Oh, so I spent seventh grade

52
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,582
dotting my I's
with little asses?

53
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:22,751
Cool.

54
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:25,821
Hey, Penny, how's it going?

55
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,723
Hey, Zack,
what are you doing here?

56
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:29,758
My dad's company prints
the menus for this place.

57
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm just dropping off
some new ones laminated.

58
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,096
Makes 'em easier to clean
if people throw up on 'em.

59
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,598
Guess how I got the idea?

60
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,267
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

61
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:41,737
Uh, Zack, these are
my friends Bernadette and Amy.

62
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,138
- Hi.
- Hey.

63
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,523
Hoo.

64
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:49,144
Okay, well, it was
good to see you.

65
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:51,080
Yeah, you, too.

66
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:52,915
He's really cute.
How do you know him?

67
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,533
Oh, we went out
a couple of times.

68
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,618
I'm often flummoxed
by current slang.

69
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:59,355
Does "went out" mean
"had intercourse"?

70
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,540
Yes.
No, no.

71
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,059
But in this case, yes.

72
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,561
Interesting.

73
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:06,862
And was it not satisfactory?

74
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:08,397
No, it was great.

75
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:11,266
He just didn't really challenge
me on an intellectual level.

76
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:14,937
Couldn't you just fool around
with him and then listen to NPR?

77
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:19,408
Wouldn't help. Zack
can't even spell NPR.

78
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,510
It's what I do with Howard.

79
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,212
I'm much smarter than he is.

80
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,814
But it's important
to protect his manhood.

81
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,684
Hoo.

82
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:32,221
What's the matter?

83
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:33,906
I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

84
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:37,126
My heart rate is elevated,
my palms are clammy,

85
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,360
my mouth is dry.

86
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:41,830
In addition, I keep
involuntarily saying "hoo."

87
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:45,534
Oh, we know what's
causing that, don't we?

88
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:47,202
It's no mystery.

89
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:48,704
I obviously have the flu

90
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:51,173
coupled with sudden-onset
Tourette's syndrome.

101
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,456
Did you hear about the
accident at the bio lab?

102
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:20,473
No.
What happened?

103
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,360
They were injecting rats
with radioactive isotopes

104
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:25,296
and one of the techs got bit.

105
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:27,798
Did he get superpowers?

106
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:33,337
No, he got five stitches
and a tetanus shot.

107
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:36,140
Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

108
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:37,708
Why?

109
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,777
Well, you get bit by a
radioactive animal in a lab,

110
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:42,413
you kind of want to turn
into a superhero.

111
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:45,616
Yeah, but who'd want
to become Rat-Man?

112
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,918
Who wouldn't?

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,455
You could zip through
a maze in nothing flat,

114
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,290
squeeze through
really small holes,

115
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,327
and shut down restaurants
in a single bound.

116
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:58,395
And the best part is,
if I were Rat-Man,

117
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,664
you could be my
sidekick, Mouse Boy.

118
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,371
Mouse Boy?

119
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,806
You don't like "Mouse Boy"?

120
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,908
How about "Kid Vermin"?

121
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,877
First of all,
if we had superpowers,

122
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:15,546
I wouldn't be the sidekick.
You'd be the sidekick.

123
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:18,382
Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.

124
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,034
Leonard, settle this.

125
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,286
Of the two of us, who's
the obvious sidekick?

126
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,687
Yeah, Leonard, who?

127
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,227
12 years after high school,
and I'm still at the nerd table.

128
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,227

129
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:37,101
Aren't you slicing that
man's brain a little too thin?

130
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,974
It's too thin if I were making

131
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,143
a foot-long brain sandwich
at Quiznos.

132
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:50,915
For examination under a two-
photon microscope, it's fine.

133
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,754
Well, you're the expert.

134
00:05:56,755 --> 00:06:00,758
If the correct way to do it
is the wrong way, then I yield.

135
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,959
Very well.

136
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,211
If you die and donate
your body to science,

137
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,263
I promise to slice your brain
like Canadian bacon.

138
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,232
Thank you.

139
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,833
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

140
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:12,653
I have to take my temperature.

141
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:15,172
Are you monitoring
your circadian rhythms

142
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:18,375
in order to identify your periods
of maximum mental acuity?

143
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,210
I did that one summer.

144
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,012
Ah, youth.

145
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:25,883
No, I experienced some
distressing symptoms last night,

146
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,785
so I'm checking
my vital signs every hour.

147
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:29,820
I'd be happy to create a chart

148
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:32,523
and participate in a
differential diagnosis.

149
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,591
Oh, that sounds like fun.

150
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:39,096
All right.

151
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:40,698
What were the symptoms?

152
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,601
Elevated heart rate,
moist palms, dry mouth

153
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,571
and localized
vascular throbbing.

154
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:52,242
Localized to what region?

155
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:55,913
Ears and genitalia.

156
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,148
Interesting.

157
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:00,851
Not body parts
that usually team up.

158
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,622
What about
environmental factors?

159
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,524
Describe the scene for me.

160
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,793
I was sitting in a restaurant
with Penny and Bernadette,

161
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:12,663
drinking water-- carbonated
as it was a special occasion.

162
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:18,302
Penny's friend Zack stopped by
and said hello and I said "hoo."

163
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,503
Who?

164
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:20,804
Zack.

165
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:23,040
Then why did you ask?

166
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,175
Ask what?
Who.

167
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:26,977
Zack.

168
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:30,080
All right, let's start over.

169
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,182
What did you say
when Zack walked in?

170
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,818
"Hoo."
Zack.

171
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,587
Why do you keep saying "Zack"?

172
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,255
Because you keep saying "who."

173
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:39,790
I'm not saying "hoo" now.

174
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,924
I said "hoo" last night.

175
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:43,260
And the answer was Zack,
correct?

176
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:45,062
There was no question.

177
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,864
I simply said "hoo."

178
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,168
All right, I think
I have enough to go on.

179
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,239
Possible explanations
for your symptoms are,

180
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,541
in descending order
of likelihood:

181
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,177
hyperthyroidism,
premature menopause,

182
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:03,480
hosting an alien parasite or--

183
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,816
and I only include it
for the sake of covering

184
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:09,686
absolutely all bases--
sexual arousal.

185
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:14,016
Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

186
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,124
There you are.

187
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:19,650
Oh, hey.

188
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,652
Let me ask you a question.
What are you most afraid of?

189
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,254
I don't know. Um...

190
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,455
Nuclear war.

191
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,990
Accidentally being
buried alive.

192
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,992
Any of those movies where
you get that phone call

193
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,293
that says you're
going to die.

194
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:32,362
And then you do.

195
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:34,197
No. Something very specific

196
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:35,432
that we both know you,

197
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,268
Rajesh Koothrappali,
are terrified of.

198
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,104
Well, type two diabetes
runs in my family.

199
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,238
The thought of
losing a toe...

200
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,224
Spiders!
You're afraid of spiders!

201
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,743
What the heck is this?

202
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:49,179
A jar with a big spider
in it, of course.

203
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,181
Bravery test.

204
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:55,218
First one to take his hand out
is the sidekick.

205
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,887
Are you crazy?

206
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,756
Perhaps.

207
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,158
Are you scared?

208
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,427
No. But it's a stupid test.

209
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:07,363
Oh, really?
What if the earth was in danger

210
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:08,515
and the only way to save it was

211
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:11,434
to stick your hand
in a jar with a spider?

212
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,969
Oh, yeah?
What if the earth was in danger

213
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,537
and the only way
to save it was to take a shower

214
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,173
in the locker room and let
other guys see you naked?

215
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,511
Oh, come on.
That's never gonna happen.

216
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:24,147
Put your hand
in the jar

217
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,616
or forever be revealed
as my sidekick.

218
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:29,436
All right, I will.

219
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,656
How did you get so brave
all of a sudden?

220
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,824
It's easy.

221
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,226
The spider's crawling
up your arm.

222
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,062
(screaming)

223
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:43,900
Get it off! Get it off!

224
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:46,169
Please, Raj!

225
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,904
(screaming)

226
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:49,739
Please.

227
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,174
Oh!

228
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,176
(blowing forcefully)

229
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:56,946
My blood work shows
thyroid function normal.

230
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,348
Cortisol levels normal.

231
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,916
How about your

232
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,085
follicle-stimulating hormone
levels?

233
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:04,854
Sheldon, I am not going
through menopause.

234
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,489
Are you sure?

235
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,393
You said that with
the testy bark of an old biddy.

236
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,663
I think we need
to face the cold, hard truth:

237
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:17,433
I was sexually aroused
by Penny's friend Zack.

238
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,102
Hang on. I don't know

239
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,304
that we've given
the alien parasite hypothesis

240
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,406
a fair shake.

241
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,474
Let's look at this logically.

242
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,409
I have a stomach; I get hungry.

243
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,512
I have genitals; I have the
potential for sexual arousal.

244
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:32,482
A cross we all must bear.

245
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,587
You know, in difficult
moments like this,

246
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:40,590
I often turn to a force
greater than myself.

247
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:41,591
Religion?

248
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:42,792
Star Trek.

249
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:46,196
Did you see
<i>Star Trek: The Motion Picture?</i>

250
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:48,231
No.
Don't. It's terrible. However...

251
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,733
in it, we learn that

252
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,770
when Spock finds himself
drawn off the path of logic

253
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:57,640
by feelings bubbling up from his
human half, he suppresses them

254
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,410
using the Vulcan mental
discipline of Kolinar.

255
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,512
Are you suggesting
we live our lives

256
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:05,114
guided by the philosophies
found in cheap science fiction?

257
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:07,250
"Cheap science fiction"?

258
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,523
What are you doing?

259
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:19,996
Using Kolinar to suppress
my anger at that last comment.

260
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:22,565
Is it possible that your
concern for me at this moment

261
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:25,168
is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?

262
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,104
I hadn't considered that.

263
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:31,007
Give me a moment.

264
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,410
All right, I've considered it.

265
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:37,213
And?
I reject it.

266
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:40,149
You reject it because
you don't feel jealousy,

267
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,285
or because you are
suppressing jealousy?

268
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:46,289
I think
I'll eat my lunch at home.

269
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,659
That's not your
lunch, Sheldon;

270
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,062
those are the cadaver
brain specimens.

271
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:54,430
Oh.

272
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:57,183
As they were incorrectly sliced,

273
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,403
you can see how I could
mistake them for my sashimi.

274
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,441
Hello.

275
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:10,736
Hey. Isn't tomorrow
your usual laundry night?

276
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:13,905
The supermarket was out of
my regular fabric softener.

277
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:16,658
If this one under-
or over-softens,

278
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:19,444
I'll need time
to make things right.

279
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:21,146
That's thinking ahead.

280
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:24,499
The alternative would be
to think backwards.

281
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,118
That's just remembering.

282
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,121
So how's Amy?

283
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,490
Amy's changed.

284
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,959
I might have to let her go.

285
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,560
Oh, no. Why?

286
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:38,296
I thought she was
a highly evolved creature

287
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:40,399
of pure intellect, like me.

288
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,217
But recent events indicate that

289
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:44,686
she may be a slave
to her baser urges.

290
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:46,705
Like you.

291
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:50,575
Just going to
skip over that insult.

292
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,028
What insult?

293
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,114
Yeah. That's why
I'm going to skip over it.

294
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:57,983
Are you saying that Amy is...

295
00:12:57,984 --> 00:13:00,986
oh, what's the
scientific word...

296
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:03,755
Forget science. She's horny.

297
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,743
Oh! Okay. Wow.

298
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:11,096
It's simple biology. There's
nothing I can do about it.

299
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:17,436
Are you sure?

300
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,938
What are you suggesting?

301
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,575
I'm suggesting there
might be something

302
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:27,012
you could do about...
Amy's urges?

303
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:33,752
It's illegal to spay
a human being.

304
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:38,557
Yeah. That's not
what I had in mind.

305
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,025
Oh.

306
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:42,627
Oh!

307
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:45,297
You mean...
something <i>I</i> could do.

308
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:46,364
Exactly.

309
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:51,203
Well, I was hoping
to avoid this.

310
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:54,206
But I might as well
get it over with.

311
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,407
Thank you, Penny.

312
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,643
I'll let you
know what happens.

313
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:05,217
Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

314
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,821
Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

315
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:11,389
Is this the Zack Johnson

316
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,259
who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny?

317
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,263
Sorry to bother you.

318
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,205
Hello. I'm looking
for a Zack Johnson

319
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:30,742
who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny.

320
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,844
Coitus. It means intercourse.

321
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:36,515
And I have a feeling I'm
speaking to the right Zack.

322
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:38,750
This is Sheldon Cooper.

323
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,619
Fine. Shelly.

324
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,156
Yes, that does
sound like a girl's name.

325
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:46,124
No, it doesn't bother me.

326
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,060
Yes, "Smelly Shelly"
does bother me.

327
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,462
Let me tell you why I'm calling.

328
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,464
I'd like to know
if you'd be interested

329
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:56,101
in having sex
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

330
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:58,503
Amy Farrah Fowler.

331
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,906
Yes, that <i>is</i>  a girl's name.

332
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:04,693
Good grief. It's like trying
to talk to a dolphin.

333
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,846
Really?

334
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:11,116
This is going to decide who's
the hero and who's the sidekick?

335
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,359
You got a better idea?

336
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,797
Every idea is better
than this idea.

337
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:26,998
Ding!

338
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:29,834
Wait. What the hell is "ding"?
It's a bell.

339
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:31,436
I don't think this
kind of wrestling has a bell.

340
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,271
Fine. How do you
want to start?

341
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:35,407
I say, uh, how about
one, two, three, go?

342
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:38,043
One-two-three-go?
That's for babies.

343
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:40,078
Okay, how about, uh...

344
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,513
On your mark, get set, go?

345
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,864
That's for a footrace.
If you want to race,

346
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,182
we have to go outside.

347
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:46,985
No, it's chilly outside.
Didn't bring my jacket.

348
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,704
Oh, for crying out loud.

349
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:52,023
What kind of superhero
needs a jacket?

350
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:54,409
What kind of superhero says,
"Dibs on the red tights!

351
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,127
Dibs on the red tights!"

352
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:59,097
All right, how about this?
Ready, wrestle.

353
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:01,700
Wait. Are we starting now? Or
is that what you're going to say

354
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,001
when we do start, or...
We're starting now!

355
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:05,170
Don't yell at me!

356
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,647
Suppose there are worse ways
to spend a Friday night.

357
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,684
None come to mind.

358
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:27,292
Look at this stamp.
On what authority

359
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:30,695
are they permitted to
mutilate patrons as they enter?

360
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,747
I'm sure it'll wash off.

361
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,366
Little comfort tonight.

362
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,434
I look like a Hell's Angel.

363
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:39,904
There's Zack.

364
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:42,574
Are you sure this is
what you want to do?

365
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,476
It's not what I want to do;

366
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:47,345
it's what I have to do.

367
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:50,448
Go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

368
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:52,617
Follow your endocrine system.

369
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:55,287
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

370
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,755
Please don't drag this out.

371
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:04,262
This is never going to come off.

372
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,731
Excuse me?

373
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,534
Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler.
We met the other night.

374
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:12,771
I have spent my life in
pursuit of pure knowledge.

375
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,506
Until I met you,
my decisions

376
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:16,408
were founded in
logic and reason.

377
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:19,878
And yet here I stand before you,
130 pounds of raging estrogen,

378
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:22,213
longing to grab hold
of your gluteus maximus

379
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:23,715
and make Shakespeare's
metaphorical

380
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:26,651
beast with two backs.

381
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:30,455
My gluteus what?

382
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,791
On the other hand,

383
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,427
as I look at the blank, ape-like
expression on your face,

384
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:38,363
I have decided to adopt the
Vulcan practice of Kolinar.

385
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:41,933
Good-bye, Zack.
Bye.

386
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,152
(ecstatically):
Hoo.

387
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:49,841
That should hold me for a while.

388
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:01,486
I'm legally obligated
to inform you

389
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:05,840
that I took a karate lesson
when I was 11.

390
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:07,759
I'd be a regular ninja by now

391
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,511
if my mom could've
arranged a carpool.

392
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:12,180
Oh, yeah?

393
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,299
Well, I've been taking
Pilates class at the rec center,

394
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,185
and my abs look like
sections of a Hershey bar.

395
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:19,220
Oh, yeah? Won't matter,
you're going down!

396
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:20,972
No, uh-uh, you're going down!

397
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:23,007
If anybody's going to go down,
it's going to be you.

398
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:27,779
Fellas. It's been 30 minutes.
Nobody's touched each other.

399
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:32,984
I'm glad you decided to reject
your animal hindbrain

400
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:35,620
and return to the
realm of pure intellect.

401
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:37,789
As am I.

402
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:41,543
What are you doing?

403
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:43,712
An experiment.

404
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:47,265
Nope. Nothing.
Never mind.

405
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,068
You realize you can't win.

406
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,872
I prefer to think
that I can't lose.

407
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,776
You're wrong.

408
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,011
It's only a matter of time

409
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,948
before you fall into
Rat-Man's rat trap.

410
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,416
You pathetic fool!

411
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,386
If there were a rat-catcher,
wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?

412
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,788
Just because I didn't
express myself well

413
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,174
doesn't mean my
underlying point was invalid!

414
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,976
You bloviating buffoon!

415
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,461
You narcissistic nincompoop!

416
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:26,130
You crimson coward!

417
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,532
Oh, Leonard, wake up,

418
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,317
you're missing some very
excellent superhero quips.

419
