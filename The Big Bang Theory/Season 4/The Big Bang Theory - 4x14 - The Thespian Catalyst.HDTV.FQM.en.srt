1
00:00:01,345 --> 00:00:02,313
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:05,344
I'm your guest lecturer,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

3
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:14,304
I was expecting applause,

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:18,090
but I suppose stunned silence
is equally appropriate.

5
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:20,758
I agreed to speak
to you this evening,

6
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:23,928
because I was told that you're
the best and the brightest

7
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,164
of this university's
doctoral candidates.

8
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,149
Hmm. Of course,
that's like saying

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,452
you are the most important
electron in a hydrogen atom.

10
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:36,877
'Cause, you see,

11
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:41,245
there's only one electron
in a hydrogen atom.

12
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,550
Best and brightest,
my sweet patootie.

13
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,218
All right, let's begin.

14
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,637
Show of hands,
who here is familiar

15
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:52,290
with the concept
of topological insulators?

16
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:54,792
Don't kid yourselves.

17
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:59,764
I found another tweet from a
student at Sheldon's lecture.

18
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:02,600
"Dr. Cooper has taken
a relatively boring subject

19
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:06,103
"and managed to make it
completely insufferable.

20
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:09,106
Plus, he looks
like a giant insect."

21
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,308
Look. Listen to this one.

22
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:14,912
"Does Einstein's theory
explain why time flies

23
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,047
"when you're having fun,

24
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:18,115
"but when you're listening
to Dr. Cooper,

25
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,784
it falls out of the sky, dead?"

26
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,286
Ooh, somebody took pictures

27
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:25,155
and uploaded them
to their Flickr account.

28
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:26,557
Wow.

29
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:28,292
How do you get an
entire lecture hall

30
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:30,628
to flip you off
at the same time?

31
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,263
Apparently, if you're Sheldon,

32
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,732
all you need
to do is turn your back.

33
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:37,501
Hey, Leonard,
is your wi-fi down?

34
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:38,469
I can't get on.

35
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,937
Oh, Sheldon changed
the password.

36
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:42,173
It's now
"Penny is a freeloader."

37
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,542
No spaces.

38
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,577
Thanks.
What are you guys doing?

39
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:48,346
Sheldon gave a lecture
at the university tonight.

40
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:49,614
We're reading
the reviews.

41
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:50,948
Oh. How'd he do?

42
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:53,084
Well, picture the Hindenburg
meets Chernobyl

43
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:55,653
meets Three Mile Island
meets <i>Tron 2.</i>

44
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:57,872
That bad, huh?

45
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,208
Read this woman's tweet.

46
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,627
"Listening to Dr. Cooper

47
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:05,129
has made me want to start
cutting myself again""

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,831
Yeah.

49
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,902
Good evening,
Leonard, Howard, Raj,

50
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:13,204
freeloader.

51
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:16,207
So, how'd the lecture go?

52
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,010
In a word, triumphant.

53
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:22,346
Really? Triumphant?

54
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:24,282
Oh, yes, you should have
seen those young people.

55
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:27,351
Thirsty for knowledge,
drinking in my wisdom.

56
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:30,488
I may have changed
a few lives today.

57
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,659
Oh, please let
me tell him.

58
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,460
I don't know,
I kind of promised Howard.

59
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:38,446
Tell me what?

60
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,031
Actually, we should
all share the moment.

61
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,465
Raj, if you would.

62
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:46,837
Oh, tweets about my lecture.

63
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,043
Hmm...

64
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:54,679
That's rather unfair.

65
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,248
That's downright cruel.

66
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:59,717
Plus, insects
have six legs.

67
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,721
Yeah, I'm not familiar
with the acronym "KMN""

68
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:07,291
From the context, we think
it means "kill me now."

69
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:14,265
Well, I suppose everyone's
entitled to their own opinion.

70
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,000
I think I'll turn in.

71
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:20,338
I didn't want to teach
those poopy heads, anyway.

72
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,510
FYI, I think that's
what Darth Vader said

73
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:29,613
just before he started
building the Death Star.

84
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,072
Sheldon still moping?

85
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,397
Yeah, it's weird.
Even though he didn't want

86
00:03:57,398 --> 00:03:58,798
to give the lecture
in the first place,

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,134
being rejected by those students
really hit him hard.

88
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:02,585
I know the feeling.

89
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,471
It's like accidentally
walking into a gay bar

90
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:06,072
and then having
no one hit on you.

91
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:17,684
It-It happened
to a friend of mine.

92
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:19,852
Are you guys doing okay?

93
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,254
Leonard and I are fine,

94
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:24,090
but I think Raj needs
to meet a girl really soon.

95
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,159
Well, that shouldn't
be too hard.

96
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,260
He's such a cutie.

97
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:29,362
Thank you,
but "cute" is for bunnies.

98
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:31,331
I want to be something
with sex appeal,

99
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:34,501
like...
like a labradoodle.

100
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:37,303
Labradoodle?

101
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:41,241
We might be starting
to zero in on your problem.

102
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:43,009
Don't you listen to them.

103
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,710
You've got plenty
of sex appeal.

104
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:45,845
You really think so?

105
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,097
Yeah. You're a hottie.

106
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:50,917
Well, thanks, Bernadette.

107
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,735
And just for the record,

108
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:54,420
labradoodles are
hypo-allergenic,

109
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,924
which is a very sexy quality to
those troubled by animal dander.

110
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:02,896
AMY
So, what do you think?

111
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,935
It's a charming illusion,
but it does not cheer me up.

112
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:11,104
Not even when I do this?

113
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,211
No.

114
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,217
Well, that was the last arrow
in my quiver of whimsy.

115
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:26,519
Do you realize that teaching
is the first thing

116
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,555
I've failed at
since my ill-fated attempt

117
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:31,724
to complete a chin-up
in March of 1989?

118
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:33,760
If this humiliating experience

119
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,861
is really troubling you,

120
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:36,396
there are things
we could do about it.

121
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,031
For instance?

122
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:39,866
Well, the first thing
that comes to mind

123
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,267
is isolating the part
of your brain

124
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,771
where the memory is stored
and destroying it with a laser.

125
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:47,073
Hmm, no.

126
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:48,608
One slip of the hand,

127
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,810
and suddenly I'm sitting
in the Engineering Department,

128
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:53,413
building doodads with Wolowitz.

129
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:55,114
All right.

130
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:57,550
Have you considered improving
your socialization skills,

131
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:58,785
thus allowing you

132
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:00,386
to communicate more
effectively with other people?

133
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:01,955
Isn't that their burden?

134
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:04,958
I'm the one with something
interesting to say.

135
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,493
Fair enough, but in its essence,

136
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:08,928
teaching is a performance art.

137
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,430
In the classroom paradigm,

138
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,132
the teacher has the
responsibility to communicate,

139
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,168
as well as entertain and engage.

140
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,571
I sense that you're trying
to slow-walk me to an epiphany.

141
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:20,473
Would you mind very much
jumping to it?

142
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:23,977
Perhaps you should consider
taking acting lessons.

143
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:25,879
Acting lessons.

144
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,847
Interesting.

145
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:30,416
It might help
if I could act as though I care

146
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:34,153
about my students
and whether or not they learn.

147
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:37,457
Penny.

148
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,510
Penny. Penny.

149
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:42,545
What?

150
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:45,465
You're an "actress," correct?

151
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,101
I'm not an "actress."

152
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:50,503
I'm an actress.

153
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:51,804
All right.

154
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:54,140
You're an actress.

155
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:56,709
I need you to teach me.

156
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,111
You want an acting lesson?

157
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:01,347
Perhaps two. I'd like
to master the craft.

158
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:04,150
Okay, where
is this coming from?

159
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:08,021
It has been suggested to
me that acting techniques

160
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,023
could improve my
lecturing, at which,

161
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:12,358
if certain tweets and
blogs are to be believed,

162
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,260
I "suck the big one."

163
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,963
Yeah, I saw those.
They were funny.

164
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:19,865
I printed a few out
and put 'em on my fridge.

165
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,801
So, when could we start?

166
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,536
Okay, just to be clear.

167
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:26,306
You are asking me for help
because I know something

168
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,741
that the brilliant
Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.

169
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:32,545
I suppose that's one
way to look at it.

170
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:35,315
I think it's the only
way to look at it.

171
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,216
Are you going to
help me or not?

172
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:39,686
Probably. I'm just
enjoying the foreplay.

173
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:43,256
Does this mean you are done
mocking my acting career?

174
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:46,359
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
making the transition

175
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,227
from actor to acting teacher

176
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:49,595
was the signal
that one's career

177
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,731
had reached the
end of the road.

178
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,584
Forget it.

179
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:56,069
I'll pay you $40.

180
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,621
Saturday, 9:00 a.m.
Bring cash.

181
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,976
Raj, I have amazing news!

182
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:03,943
What?

183
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:05,295
I just got offered
a fellowship

184
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,280
at the Weitzmann
Institute in Israel.

185
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,048
Dude, that's incredible!
I know.

186
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:11,951
The only thing is, I'm
gonna be gone for two years.

187
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:13,753
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

188
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:14,887
Are you going with him?

189
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,789
I have to stay
here for school.

190
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,858
That's what we're here
to talk to you about.

191
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:23,296
You see,
Bernadette has needs.

192
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:25,932
What kind of needs?

193
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:28,568
Sexual needs.

194
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:30,803
Most of them regular,

195
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:34,307
some of them
kind of messed up.

196
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,077
So, while I'm gone,

197
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:40,313
you're going
to have to satisfy her.

198
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,116
What do you say?

199
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:47,587
I say okey-dokey.

200
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:54,627
What ya thinking
so hard about?

201
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:58,765
Just that
I'm definitely not gay.

202
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:08,340
SHELDON
Penny!

203
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,109
Penny! Penny!

204
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,010
What's wrong?

205
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,512
Nothing.
I was acting.

206
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:17,382
You were acting.

207
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,868
Yes. In preparation
for today's studies,

208
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,087
I read Stanislavski's
<i>An Actor Prepares,</i>

209
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:24,255
Stella Adler's
<i>The Technique of Acting,</i>

210
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:25,824
Uta Hagen's
<i>Respect for Acting,</i>

211
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:29,194
and Henry Winkler's
<i>Ayyy, I'm an Actor.</i>

212
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,096
Well, good for you.

213
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,048
Come on in.

214
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,165
How shall we begin?

215
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,867
Well, I thought we'd start

216
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,336
with some
basic movement exercises.

217
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,171
You know, get our bodies
warmed up a little.

218
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:41,406
All right.

219
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:42,574
So I just want you to relax

220
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,442
and kind of
move around in the space.

221
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:47,228
You know,
just do whatever feels natural.

222
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,854
Sheldon?

223
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:58,556
You said to do whatever
feels natural.

224
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,492
This feels natural.

225
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:02,527
Certainly more natural

226
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:04,329
than what you're doing.

227
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,597
Come on,
you got to work with me.

228
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:07,332
We need to get connected
with our bodies.

229
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,301
Penny, my body and I have
a relationship

230
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:12,604
that works best
when we maintain a cool,

231
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,706
wary distance from each other.

232
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:19,344
All right,
let's just say we've warmed up.

233
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,396
You're the "teacher."

234
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:25,650
Okay. One of the things
that might help you

235
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:26,951
in connecting with your students

236
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:28,820
is being
a little more spontaneous.

237
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,755
So why don't we
try some improvisation?

238
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,157
Why not?
It seems like

239
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:34,092
you're improvising
your entire curriculum.

240
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:39,364
This is all about
listening and responding.

241
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,331
Gotcha.

242
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,566
I'm going to create a character

243
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,284
and a situation, and you
just jump in when you feel it.

244
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:44,786
All right.
All right.

245
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,838
Action.

246
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,375
Okay, it's not a movie.

247
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:52,544
It's improv.
So no one calls "action."

248
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:54,596
Hey, you taught me something.

249
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,082
Who would have thought it?

250
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:00,518
Okay.

251
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,320
Uh, no, the shipment
has not arrived,

252
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:03,922
and I really need those shoes.

253
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,140
They are my biggest seller.

254
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,908
Yes, ladies sizes six
through ten.

255
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:08,293
Thank you.
Oh, sorry.

256
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,729
I have to go.
I have a customer. Bye-bye.

257
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,946
Hi. Can I help you?

258
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:15,667
I'd like a frozen yogurt,
please.

259
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:19,571
Yogurt?

260
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:21,106
Yeah.
Um...

261
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:22,373
Okay, sure.

262
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:25,844
Luckily, we sell both shoes
and yogurt here.

263
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:28,446
You do?

264
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,950
Yes. Look up at the sign,

265
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,786
and remember, improv is always
about saying yes.

266
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:36,955
All right.

267
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:39,140
Yes.

268
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,093
I see a sign.

269
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:45,830
It says "Camarillo State
Mental Hospital."

270
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,600
What?

271
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,202
It's the only explanation
I can come up with

272
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:54,539
for why you think
you sell shoes and yogurt.

273
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,940
Okay, you know what?

274
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,776
Let's just try
a different improv. Uh..

275
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:01,045
Oh, this time
we will be two winos

276
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,814
living under a freeway overpass.

277
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,983
Oh, and we're going
to use props?

278
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:06,985
You bet.

279
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,288
I had dreams,
you know.

280
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,623
I was gonna be famous.

281
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:14,008
Show everybody back home
I could be someone.

282
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:15,960
Now look at me.

283
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:17,962
Want some?

284
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,799
You have any frozen yogurt?

285
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:26,271
I'm still not adjusted

286
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:28,940
to how the SyFy channel
spells their name now.

287
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:32,577
S-y-F-y.
That's "siffy."

288
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:34,579
Uh-huh.

289
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,451
Hello?

290
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,888
Oh, my God! Is he okay?

291
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,790
What happened?
Hang on. Hang on.

292
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,625
Uh-huh.

293
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:49,160
Okay, thank you.

294
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:52,597
Howard was on his scooter,
and got hit by a truck.

295
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:54,599
He's in critical condition.

296
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,801
Oh, no!

297
00:12:58,604 --> 00:12:59,771
Did you hear?

298
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,689
Isn't it terrible?

299
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,824
Have you seen him?

300
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,108
They wouldn't let me in.

301
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:07,045
Oh, my Howie.

302
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:10,615
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

303
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:12,617
It'll be okay.

304
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:14,619
It'll be
okay.

305
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,489
It's Howard.

306
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:21,392
Howard, hello.

307
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:24,963
Raj, is that you?

308
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:26,831
Yeah, I'm right here,
buddy. How are you?

309
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:28,366
Shh, shh. Listen to me.

310
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,901
I'm not gonna make it.

311
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,402
No, no, no,
don't say that.

312
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:33,004
You're going to
be all right.

313
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:35,306
Raj, I don't have time.
Now, pay attention.

314
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:40,311
My last wish is that
you look after Bernadette.

315
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,513
Of course, of course.

316
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:46,818
Now when you say "look
after," you mean...

317
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:48,753
Sexually.

318
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:52,123
Excuse me, Bernadette.
I have to hear it from him.

319
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,926
Sexually.

320
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,661
Got it. Take care.

321
00:13:58,196 --> 00:13:59,397
I guess I have no choice

322
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,165
but to make sweet,
guilt-free love to you

323
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,384
over and over again
for the rest of my life.

324
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,503
That's how I heard it.

325
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:13,611
Or it could be "sy-fee."

326
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:14,812
What?

327
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,515
S-y-F-y. "Sy-fee."

328
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,117
Oh, right.

329
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:21,319
Good one.

330
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,890
So, did you get a chance
to go over the scene I gave you?

331
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:28,076
Yes. I didn't care for it.

332
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:34,032
Okay, <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>
is an American classic.

333
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,300
So is the McRib sandwich.

334
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,368
I don't care
for that, either.

335
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:43,207
Fine. What would you rather do
as a scene study?

336
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,842
I'm glad you asked.

337
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,077
I took the liberty

338
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,013
of adapting a <i>Star Trek</i>
fan fiction novella

339
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,548
I wrote when I was ten

340
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,350
into a one-act play.

341
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,753
And you think it's better
than Tennessee Williams?

342
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:59,757
Why don't we leave that for
future generations to decide?

343
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:03,695
<i>Where No Sheldon</i>
<i>Has Gone Before.</i>

344
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:07,565
It's the story of a young boy
who is transported

345
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:10,134
from the ignorant backwoods
of East Texas

346
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,669
to the 23rd Century,

347
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,941
where his genius is not only
appreciated, but celebrated.

348
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:19,160
KMN...

349
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,297
Now, in this
pivotal scene,

350
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:25,717
Sheldon's mother, played by you,
argues with an emissary

351
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,619
of the United Federation
of Planets, Mr. Spock,

352
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,255
the role I will bring to life.

353
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:33,725
Okay, that's fine,
but let's try

354
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,827
and get you out
of your comfort zone.

355
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:37,662
Why would we want to do that?

356
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:40,431
It's called "the comfort zone"
for a reason.

357
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:43,601
Okay, the whole point of this is
to loosen you up a little,

358
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:46,137
so I'm thinking you'll play
the role of your mother,

359
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,373
and I will bring life
to Mr. Spock.

360
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:55,480
I'm sorry.

361
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:57,281
You'll be Spock?

362
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,951
It's only logical.

363
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:04,622
Very well.

364
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:05,957
I'll set the scene.

365
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:06,924
All right.

366
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,926
"East Texas.

367
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,212
"A warm summer night.

368
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:12,747
"A woman, Mary,

369
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:14,866
"stands on a porch.

370
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:17,501
In the distance, we hear a
lonesome train whistle..."

371
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:21,672
"The droning buzz of cicadas..""

372
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,693
"A coyote howls at the moon,

373
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,112
frightening sensitive young boys
everywhere."

374
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,416
"Out in the woods,

375
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,117
an owl screeches..."
Okay, okay.

376
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,752
We get it.
You set the scene.

377
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:36,821
Hoo!

378
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:40,158
Now just read
your mother's line.

379
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,328
"Shelly!

380
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,864
"Shelly, how many times
have I told you

381
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:50,134
"not to leave your sciencey
stuff out on the porch?

382
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,836
"Goodness,

383
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,305
"I'll never understand that boy.

384
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,241
"But then again,
I'm a religious nut,

385
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:01,345
and my mind is closed
to so many things."

386
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,519
"Spock to <i>Enterprise.</i>
Transport successful."

387
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,788
"Glory be to Heaven,

388
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,492
"some sort of creature
just manifested out of thin air.

389
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,928
"George, put down that Pepsi can
full of bourbon

390
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,198
that ain't foolin' no one,
and get your shotgun!"

391
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,450
"Greetings, Mary Cooper.

392
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:24,702
I am Spock."

393
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,457
I'm sorry.
I just don't buy it.

394
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,543
Just keep going!

395
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:37,849
"Oh, my, your sudden appearance
startles me."

396
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,684
"We have been monitoring
your son Sheldon

397
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,352
"from the 23rd Century, and

398
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,121
"we have determined
that he is now ready

399
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:44,388
"to join us.

400
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,224
"His unique genius
is our best hope

401
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:49,260
for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

402
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:50,661
"I understand.

403
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:52,763
"Oh, Shelly?

404
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:55,366
"A man's here
to take you away to the future!

405
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,235
Be sure to pack
clean underwear."

406
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,705
Okay, okay, let's try
that last line again,

407
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,573
and this time,
maybe try choking up

408
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,175
a little.
Why?

409
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:05,710
Well, you're losing your son.

410
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,012
Yes, but he's going
to a better place

411
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:11,249
where he won't get beat up...
so much.

412
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,217
All right, come on,
just try it my way.

413
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,785
Pretend you're sad
to see him go.

414
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:17,171
I'm gonna lead you in.

415
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:19,140
"His unique genius
is our best hope

416
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,844
for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

417
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,265
- That's your cue.
- I'm sorry. I just love that line.

418
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,934
Even the way you do it.

419
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,469
All right, come on, come on.

420
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,821
Put some real emotion into it.

421
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,606
Blah-blah, blah, blah...
"vast and troubled galaxy."

422
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:37,008
Go.
Hmm.

423
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:39,610
"Oh, Shelly?

424
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,313
A man's here
to take you away to the future""

425
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:49,053
"Be sure to pack clean
underwear."

426
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:51,339
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

427
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,792
Mommy, why are you crying?

428
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:57,762
'Cause I'm gonna
miss you, Shelly-bean,

429
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:01,332
even though you creep
the bugeeses out of me.

430
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,217
Okay, I guess
we're improvising now.

431
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:04,635
I'm sorry.

432
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:06,103
It's not my fault.

433
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,672
I'm just incredibly smart,

434
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:11,175
and everyone around here is
dumber than a bag of rocks.

435
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,044
Oh, now, don't
you start crying.

436
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,529
You get in that spaceship.

437
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,147
Mommy's late for
Indian bingo.

438
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:21,519
Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny.

439
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,521
Yeah, I think I broke your son.

440
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:24,789
Hey, hold on.

441
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,923
Talk to your mother.

442
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,793
Mommy, I love you.

443
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,295
Don't let Spock take
me to the future!

444
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,584
Okay, Raj,

445
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:42,243
I know you've been avoiding me
and Howard, and I'm not leaving

446
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:43,778
until you tell me
what's going on

447
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,180

of yours.
