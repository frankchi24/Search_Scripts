1
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:06,497
Why hast thou forsaken me, O
deity whose existence I doubt?

2
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:10,834
Here. Breathe
into this bag.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,320
What's going on?

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,990
They stole everything, Leonard!

5
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:17,424
Everything.

6
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,176
Are you the roommate?

7
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:21,261
Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter.
What happened?

8
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:23,497
Your friend here called 911
to report a robbery.

9
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:25,432
Oh, my God,
what did they get?

10
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:26,717
What didn't they get?

11
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:28,669
They got my enchanted weapons,

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,638
my vicious gladiator armor,

13
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,973
my wand of untainted power,

14
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:35,943
and all my gold!

15
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:37,745
You called the police

16
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,514
because someone hacked your
World of Warcraft account?

17
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:42,950
What choice did I have?

18
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:46,153
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf,

19
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:47,955
hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

20
00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:52,159
has been picked clean, like
a carcass in the desert sun.

21
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,029
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,966
Into the bag.

23
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:02,970
They took my battle ostrich!

24
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,305
- Oh, no, not Glenn!
- Yes!

25
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:06,640
Glenn!

26
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,842
The only bird I ever loved.

27
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,146
Good luck, fellas.

28
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:13,847
Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

29
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:15,115
Wait a minute!

30
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,617
You're not going to do anything?

31
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,785
Mr. Cooper,
there's nothing...

32
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,286
Dr. Cooper.

33
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:21,855
Seriously?

34
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,726
Not the kind with
access to drugs.

35
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:28,696
Fine. Dr. Cooper.

36
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:30,130
I'm sorry for your loss,

37
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,665
but the Pasadena
Police Department

38
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,901
doesn't have
jurisdiction in...

39
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:35,803
Pandora.

40
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,472
That's from <i>Avatar!</i>

41
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:41,809
World of Warcraft
takes place in Azeroth.

42
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,678
Goodness gracious, how are you
allowed to carry a gun?

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,817
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

44
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,151
What?

45
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,954
Wh-- you know, one who was
drummed off the force

46
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:55,789
because he refused
to play by the rules,

47
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,491
and now he hires himself out

48
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,694
to impose his own brand
of rough justice?

49
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,430
No.

50
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,483
Thank you, officer.

51
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:10,003
It's all gone. <i>All</i> gone.

52
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,872
I'm really
sorry, Sheldon.

53
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:13,540
What kind of world
do we live in,

54
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,478
where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

55
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,379
I don't know.

56
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,749
This act of aggression
must be met

57
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,118
with swift and cruel ferocity.

58
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:28,756
It is time to cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war.

59
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:30,924
I'm on it.

60
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:37,030
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Is, is Howard there?

61
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,200
Okay, thanks.

62
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,702
That particular dog of war

63
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,804
will have to call you back
after his bath.

64
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:49,543
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

75
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:17,274
Three thousand hours.

76
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:20,410
Three thousand hours
clicking on that mouse,

77
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,379
collecting weapons and gold.

78
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,251
It's almost as if it was
a huge waste of time.

79
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:28,886
Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

80
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,921
He got in and out
of your account in under

81
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:33,423
15 minutes, transferred
all your stuff,

82
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:34,658
and didn't leave
a digital fingerprint.

83
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,893
Oh!

84
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:38,462
There isn't enough
chamomile tea in the world

85
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:41,365
to quell the rage in my heart.

86
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,067
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

87
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:45,636
under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff

88
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:48,472
who says if we pay him, he'll
help us track down your things.

89
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:49,973
Can we trust him?

90
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:52,276
I should say so;
he appears to be a member

91
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,812
of the Nigerian royal family.

92
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:59,683
Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle!

93
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:01,318
No. Glenn's was leather.

94
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,354
He was a simple ostrich.

95
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:07,357
Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

96
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,127
Hey.

97
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,362
Hey, Penny. We're kind of in
the middle of a crisis, here.

98
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:14,731
Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

99
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:18,068
Sorry, Sheldon. I know
that game meant a lot to you.

100
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:20,137
What-- "that game"?

101
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,075
Excuse me, Penny, but
Doodle Jump is a game.

102
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,744
Angry Birds is a game.

103
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,213
World of Warcraft is a

104
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:33,383
massively multi-player
online role-playing...

105
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:35,319
all right,
technically it's a game.

106
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:40,357
Bad news, the Nigerian prince
may be a fraud.

107
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,592
Okay, well, anyways,
I brought you

108
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,144
a day-old cheesecake
to cheer you up!

109
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:46,730
Stale pastry
is hollow succor

110
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:49,199
to a man who is
bereft of ostrich.

111
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,501
Just say "thank you."

112
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:54,071
I thought I just did.

113
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:57,908
All right. See you later.

114
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,009
Oh! Hello.

115
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,245
Oh, hi! I was just
dropping off a cheesecake

116
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:04,414
to Sheldon. He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap

117
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,017
that's useful in
a make-believe place.

118
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,353
I don't know what that means.

119
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:12,189
Yeah, well,
sadly, I do.

120
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,393
Did you know last weekend
Priya took Leonard

121
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:17,794
rollerblading
at the beach?

122
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,563
Can you believe that?

123
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:22,516
I feel like I'm supposed
to say "that bitch,"

124
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:25,068
but I don't have
enough information.

125
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,437
I am the one who
spent two years

126
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:28,639
trying to get him to even

127
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,274
go to the beach
in the first place.

128
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,326
And he was so phobic about
stepping on medical waste,

129
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:34,244
I had to carry him
to the water.

130
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,947
I took Howard to the beach once.

131
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:40,017
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

132
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:44,171
So what's the thanks
I get for turning Leonard

133
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:45,872
into quality boyfriend material?

134
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:48,058
I have to tiptoe around
his new girlfriend.

135
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,711
I think you're on.
Oh.

136
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:53,964
That bitch!

137
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,733
Want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

138
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:59,636
Ah, here's the alcohol
and drug peer pressure

139
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,138
Mother warned me about.

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,975
I was starting to think
it was never going to happen.

141
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,711
Yes, please.

142
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,413
You guys should've seen Leonard
when I first met him.

143
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:10,414
There was no eye contact.

144
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:11,815
He was either looking
up at the ceiling,

145
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,483
or down at his shoes.

146
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:15,419
I'm drunk.

147
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,206
You know, for the
first couple of months,

148
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:21,024
whenever I would
take off my bra,

149
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:25,862
he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends!"

150
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:28,098
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

151
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,067
I'm never speaking
to Priya again.

152
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,134
No, don't do that.

153
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:32,686
No reason to be mean to her.

154
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,106
This may be the
alcohol talking...

155
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:37,341
but I believe there is.

156
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:39,509
Are you familiar
with the recent study

157
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,945
of Tanzanian chimpanzees
by Nishida and Hosaka

158
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:44,181
out of Kyoto University?

159
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:47,417
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

160
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:50,320
Primates, such as ourselves,
have a natural instinct

161
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:52,923
to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

162
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:54,257
Bernadette's urge to

163
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:57,094
shun, scowl or
fling her waste at Priya

164
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,329
is hard-wired into her DNA.

165
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,233
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

166
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:05,569
Believe me, it's there,
we all have it.

167
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,739
Hit me with some more booze,
and I'll show you.

168
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,176
All right, here we are--
this is the tavern

169
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:16,847
where all the black-market
weapon trades go down.

170
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:19,649
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

171
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,852
Everyone's undressing
her with their eyes.

172
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,021
Maybe if you stop
dropping your sword

173
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,256
and bending over to pick it up.

174
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,309
Okay, what exactly
are we looking for?

175
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,395
Redheaded troll,
goes by the name of Glumly.

176
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,429
According to the
message boards,

177
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,964
if you want to
move stolen goods

178
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:36,099
and it's after school
hours, he's your guy.

179
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,367
Leonard,
is this going

180
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:39,169
to take much longer?
I thought we were

181
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,570
going to spend
some time together.

182
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:42,005
Uh, we are.
In the meantime,

183
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,808
you're welcome to whip up
a quick character and join us.

184
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,376
Seriously?

185
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:48,979
Well, you have to put
in a credit card number,

186
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,947
but it's fun.

187
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,716
Maybe I should just go home.

188
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:54,217
Our troll just walked
in! I got him!

189
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:56,053
We got him.
We're almost done.

190
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:57,054
So, how do

191
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,338
you guys want
to play this?

192
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,890
Be ruthless.
You tell him

193
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,192
if he doesn't start talking,
we'll register a complaint

194
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:05,095
with his Internet
service provider.

195
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:08,565
<i>Sheldon,</i> what if he gets his
Internet from his cable company?

196
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:13,503
He could lose his HBO and all their
delightful original programming.

197
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:16,840
I don't care!
I'm losin' it, man!

198
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:18,308
Why don't we play this smart?

199
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,610
Try a little
"good goblin, bad goblin."

200
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:22,679
Oh, dear Lord.

201
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,948
Nah, I think we have
to be more subtle.

202
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:27,918
Okay, I see where
this is going.

203
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,487
Fine, I'll have
sex with him.

204
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,592
That's not where it was going.

205
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:37,916
Good, because
I would hate that.

206
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,356
Leonard, you're busy--
let's talk tomorrow.

207
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,557
Oh, wait.

208
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:46,386
- Hang on. Are you upset?
- No, no, I think

209
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:48,905
it's sexy to date a boy
trapped in a man's body.

210
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:49,906
Oh.

211
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:50,907
Good, good.

212
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:53,610
I'll tell you
what happens.

213
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,514
And people think <i>I</i>
don't get sarcasm.

214
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:03,653
Well, well, well.

215
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:06,206
Look who it is.

216
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,290
Okay, be nice.

217
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,492
Hello.

218
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:10,410
Hi. We're just
heading out for a drink.

219
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:13,430
Because I do that now.

220
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:15,465
Count your blessings

221
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,634
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

222
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:19,803
What?

223
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:20,754
Don't listen to her--

224
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:22,672
she's had a lot
of ice cream.

225
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:24,608
Do you want to join us?

226
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,277
Oh, thank you,
but I have work to do.

227
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,848
Four women walk
down the stairs--

228
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:34,434
how many reach the lobby?

229
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:43,288
Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

230
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,640
Oh, no, don't put me
in the middle of this.

231
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:47,308
I'm not going to
be your go-between.

232
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:48,476
Come on, help me out.

233
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:49,877
Am I in trouble?

234
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:51,829
There's no
reason to worry.

235
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,981
That's a relief.

236
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,182
I'm sure
many women

237
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,117
in happy relationships
spend their nights

238
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:58,519
Skyping with their
ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

239
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,092
Good news, gentlemen--
I found our hacker.

240
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:05,426
- What?
- Really?

241
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:07,294
Yeah. No one can hide from me,

242
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:08,980
not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

243
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:11,199
not even topless
Natalie Portman.

244
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:14,035
I've never said
these words before,

245
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:16,437
but good job, Howard!

246
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:21,943
Thanks. Our culprit
is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711

247
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:23,144
Ocean View Road,

248
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:24,712
Carlsbad, California.

249
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:27,715
The name and the address
drip with evil.

250
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:29,050
What else do we know about him?

251
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:30,868
Why, quite a
bit, actually.

252
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:34,088
I'll bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

253
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,262
Yes, he does live
with his parents.

254
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:45,566
Here's a Google Earth
shot of their house.

255
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,535
Excellent!
It's in a cul-de-sac.

256
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:48,703
We can box him in.

257
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:51,606
Hold on, you're thinking
of going there?

258
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,941
Carlsbad is only
a couple of hours away.

259
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,059
Fine.

260
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,011
You walk up to the house,
knock on the door

261
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:59,013
and demand your stuff back.
What if he says no?

262
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:01,249
I don't know if you've been
following the news, Leonard,

263
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,051
but there have been
some terrific advancements

264
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:04,652
in the field of torture.

265
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:08,122
No one's getting tortured.

266
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,358
Fine, we'll abide by
the Geneva Convention.

267
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,793
But ask yourself this:

268
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:13,828
in the course
of our lives,

269
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,164
how much lunch money
has been taken from us?

270
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:17,915
How many kites?

271
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,668
How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

272
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,804
I totally had one of those.

273
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:24,205
Of course you did.

274
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,741
It was a fun and practical way
of organizing your school work.

275
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:29,093
But the bullies
took it from us.

276
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:30,078
Well, no more.

277
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,246
Tonight, we take back
our dignity,

278
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:34,348
our birthright and our pride.

279
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:35,516
What do you say?

280
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,018
Who's with me?

281
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:44,892
I have a hip-hop aerobics class
at 5:00; could we go after?

282
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:46,861
Sure.

283
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:48,729
Also, tonight's the Sabbath

284
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,298
and my mother and I
have a tradition of

285
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,500
lighting the candles and
watching <i>Wheel of Fortune,</i> so...

286
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,534
If we could leave

287
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:54,836
at 8:00, we'd still be able to

288
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:56,437
regain our birthright
at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

289
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:58,539
Fine.

290
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,842
Leonard?

291
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:03,511
Oh, geez, I-I don't know
if I can ditch Priya

292
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:04,846
two nights in a row.

293
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:06,013
Oh, come on, man.

294
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:08,683
Bros before...

295
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,287
...my sister.

296
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:15,790
Aw, screw it.

297
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,924
I'm in.
Me, too.

298
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,793
And me.

299
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:21,813
One moment.

300
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,535
I'm hell-bent on catching
a cyber criminal,

301
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:29,787
not the common cold.

302
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:34,772
I'm sorry, I thought
this delay was

303
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:37,375
so you could watch <i>Wheel of</i>
<i>Fortune</i> with your mother.

304
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:38,610
I am.

305
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,245
She's just bleaching
her mustache.

306
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:42,447
Check it out.

307
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,616
Hey, Ma!
"Before and After!"

308
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:48,052
Four words, 17 letters,
two N's, one V!

309
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,488
"Fanny pack of wolves!"

310
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:53,958
That's incredible.

311
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,627
Yeah, she's kind of
a <i>Wheel</i> savant.

312
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:59,564
Uh-oh, that's Priya.

313
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:04,235
Sitar music for her ringtone
is not cool, dude.

314
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:05,904
Hit the...

315
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:09,774
Hey, sweetie.

316
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,042
Yeah, I'm sorry.

317
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:12,944
I'm gonna be working late.

318
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:16,247
Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

319
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:19,250
Okay, sure, I'll call you
when I get home.

320
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:20,752
Okay, bye-bye.

321
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,020
Very nice.

322
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:23,821
You lie to my sister.

323
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,425
That's the nicest thing
he does to your sister.

324
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,267
Oh, guess who.

325
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:37,802
Cover for me.

326
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,139
Hello, Priya. What's up?

327
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,508
How would I know
if Leonard's at work or not?

328
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:46,044
Don't be suspicious.

329
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,812
Look, if you want your
relationship with Leonard

330
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,480
to continue,
you're going to have to believe

331
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,249
whatever wild-eyed,
cockamamie excuse

332
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,484
the white devil
has the nerve to offer you.

333
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:58,223
Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

334
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:01,059
You owe me.

335
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,795
New puzzle, Ma!

336
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:05,096
"Same name"!

337
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:06,798
One N, two D's, three O's!

338
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,500
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

339
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:10,835
That's uncanny.

340
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,670
I know.
It's her superpower.

341
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,739
Well, that and jiggling
her arm fat.

342
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:20,144
I can't believe we're going
all the way to San Diego

343
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:21,913
to confront this guy.

344
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:24,549
Yeah, we're kind of
bad-asses, aren't we?

345
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,917
Totally.

346
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,785
Hey, how about
we stay the night

347
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:30,255
and hit Legoland
in the morning?

348
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:31,856
Sea World is better.

349
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:35,893
It has Shamu, who is
literally tons of fun.

350
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:39,163
But for the moment, let's stay
focused on Todd Zarnecki.

351
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,833
Yeah, we're coming for you,
Todd Zarnecki.

352
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:45,336
And for the record, Legoland
is more interactive.

353
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:47,405
I almost feel sorry

354
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:51,009
for the poor fool, sitting in
his split-level suburban ranch,

355
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,343
unaware that

356
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:56,047
a vengeful horde is barreling
down the San Diego Freeway

357
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:58,283
at 71 miles an hour.

358
00:14:58,284 --> 00:14:59,750
Ease up there, lead foot.

359
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,219
You trying to get us killed?

360
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:05,456
I took the liberty
of burning us

361
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,558
a mix of heroic
questing music.

362
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:12,830
This says "Beyonce
Bootylicious Dance Mix."

363
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,499
It's a
re-writable CD.

364
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,434
Just put it in.

365
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:18,152
Beyonce? Really?

366
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:20,004
She's curvy and she owns it.

367
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:21,539
I like that.

368
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:31,949
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

369
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,785
We are winged fury!

370
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,187
Which is still no excuse

371
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,089
for going over
the posted speed limit.

372
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,361
♪ ♪

373
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:45,897
Next time we go to
kick someone's ass,

374
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,498
we take the train.

375
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:50,935
I always prefer the train.

376
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:54,155
Sheldon, let's go.

377
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,741
Coming.

378
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,679
Why did you bring that?

379
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,699
No weapon strikes more fear
into a man's heart

380
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,718
than a Klingon bat'leth.

381
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,871
Okay, let's get
clear on something.

382
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:11,956
We're just going to tell
this guy to transfer all of

383
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:14,759
your stuff back into your
account and then be on our way.

384
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,295
No one's bat'lething anybody.

385
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,165
So my blade shall not
taste blood tonight?

386
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,701
No.

387
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:27,305
Well, now I just feel silly
holding it.

388
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:28,973
Come on.

389
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,809
Can I at least
kick down the door?

390
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,278
You're welcome to try, but
the other day, it took you

391
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,215
15 minutes to get
into a FedEx box.

392
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:41,753
Who is it?

393
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,554
Your doom!

394
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:44,856
Don't say "your doom."

395
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:47,258
Who opens the door
for their doom?

396
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,626
Good point.

397
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,628
Basket of puppies.

398
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:54,365
What?

399
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:56,033
Uh...

400
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:58,903
Sheldon?

401
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:03,074
Are you Todd Zarnecki?

402
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:04,709
Yeah. Who are you?

403
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,911
I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

404
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,546
I want my things back.

405
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:09,680
I don't think so.

406
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,882
Let me see that.

407
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,183
Careful.
That's a collectible.

408
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,267
I know.

409
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:16,854
I've always wanted one.

410
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:27,064
Well, he's even more cunning
than we thought.

411
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,337
You know, the joke's on him.

412
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,673
Without the certificate of
authenticity,

413
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:38,309
that bat'leth is worthless.

414
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,579
Yeah, he walked
right into our trap.

415
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:46,551
Legoland seems like
a hollow dream now.

416
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:50,104
Uh-oh.

417
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:51,806
What's the matter?
Something's wrong.

418
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,458
I'm not getting any gas.

419
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:02,934
Anybody know anything about
internal combustion engines?

420
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:03,901
Of course.

421
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,403
19th-century technology.
Very basic.

422
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:07,772
Does anybody know how to fix
an internal combustion engine?

423
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:10,208
No. No.
Not a clue.

424
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:13,344
Well, we'd better call somebody
to come pick us up.

425
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:16,214
It'd be swell
if they had a train.

426
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,421
Thank you, Penny.

427
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:25,790
No problem.

428
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,325
So, Leonard,

429
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:29,393
I think it's interesting
you didn't call your girlfriend

430
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,595
to come get you.

431
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:33,064
Uh, I kind of
told her I was working.

432
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:34,899
So you lied to her.

433
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,767
Also interesting.

434
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:38,519
Yeah, she doesn't really
understand

435
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,472
the whole Warcraft
adventure-role-playing thing.

436
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:45,142
Well, doesn't matter if she gets
it, as long as she's pretty.

437
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:48,813
This one's funny,
Leonard.

438
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:51,249
How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

439
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:55,019
So did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

440
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,322
No. We failed
in our noble quest.

441
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,373
How come?

442
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:02,927
Todd Zarnecki was mean.

443
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:04,462
All right. Hang on.

444
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,897
What are you doing?

445
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:08,933
I'm gonna show you how we
finish a quest in Nebraska.

446
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,638
Oh. Beyonce.

447
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,446
This ain't no Beyonce.

448
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:28,452
Now what?

449
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:31,255
Give my friend his stuff back.

450
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:33,124
I don't know
what you're talking about.

451
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,592
Well, then, good news.

452
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:36,627
Today's the day a girl's
finally going to touch you

453
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:38,028
in your little special place.

454
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,801
Now give him his stuff back.

455
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:45,336
Okay.

456
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:46,804
We did it!

457
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,225
I said, "we."

458
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:00,673
Oh, hold the door.

459
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:02,341
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

460
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:04,053
Going to see Leonard?

461
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:06,022
Yes.

462
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:07,373
How have you been?

463
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,758
Fine. You?

464
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,960
Very well, thank you.

465

466
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,268
All right, well,
great seeing you.

467
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,470
Yeah. You, too.

468
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,941
Amy's right.

469
00:20:57,942 --> 00:21:01,311
I do want
to fling my poop at her.
