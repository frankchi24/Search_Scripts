1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:05,631
All right, I'm ready
for my next question.

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:09,385
In a world where rhinoceroses
are domesticated pets,

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:11,387
who wins the Second World War?

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,591
Uganda.

5
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:16,592
Defend.

6
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:18,444
Kenya rises to power

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,062
on the export of rhinoceroses.

8
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:22,264
A Central African
power block is formed,

9
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:24,367
colonizing North Africa and Europe.

10
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:27,787
When war breaks out, no one can
afford the luxury of a rhino.

11
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:30,173
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

12
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:33,292
Correct.

13
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:34,610
My turn.

14
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:40,650
In a world where a piano is a weapon,
not a musical instrument,

15
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:44,437
on what does Scott Joplin
play "The Maple Leaf Rag"?

16
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:47,223
Tuned bayonets.

17
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:48,291
Defend.

18
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:49,225
Isn't it obvious?

19
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:51,794
You're right. My apologies.

20
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:56,816
What the hell are you guys playing?

21
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:58,568
It's a game we invented.

22
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,770
It's called Counterfactuals.

23
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,139
We postulate an alternate
world that differs from ours

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,658
in one key aspect and then
pose questions to each other.

25
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,493
It's fun for ages eight to 80.

26
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:08,945
Join us.

27
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,446
All right.

28
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:11,914
I like a good brainteaser.

29
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,499
Give it a whirl.

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,084
You're in luck;
this is an easy one.

31
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:18,137
In a world where mankind is ruled

32
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:20,656
by a giant intelligent beaver,

33
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:23,125
what food is no longer consumed?

34
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:28,030
Uh... a BLT where the
"B" stands for beaver?

35
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,248
I don't know.

36
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:31,333
Leonard, be serious.

37
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:33,102
We're playing a game here.

38
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:35,170
I can figure this out.

39
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,205
Let's see.

40
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:38,975
Um, well, beavers eat tree bark.

41
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:42,361
The only tree bark I know that
humans consume is cinnamon.

42
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:43,980
So, I'll say cinnamon.

43
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,014
Incorrect.

44
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:48,501
Obviously, the answer
is cheese Danish.

45
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:49,852
What?

46
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:52,572
In a world ruled by a giant beaver,

47
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:55,858
mankind builds many dams to
please the beaver overlord.

48
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,244
The low-lying city of
Copenhagen is flooded.

49
00:01:58,245 --> 00:01:59,528
Thousands die.

50
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:03,983
Devastated, the Danes never
invent their namesake pastry.

51
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,587
How does one miss that?

52
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,973
This is ridiculous.

53
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:12,508
You're just making stuff up.

54
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,827
Is he always like
this when he loses?

55
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:16,245
Oh, yes.

56
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:20,082
You should've been here for the
great Jenga tantrum of 2008.

57
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,136
You bumped the table
and you know it.

58
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:30,159
Perhaps it would be
kinder to play a game

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,194
more suited to his abilities.

60
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:35,998
We'll close our eyes and
count to ten while you hide.

61
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,668
I'm going to my room.

62
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:39,919
Very good, Leonard.

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,088
But next time, don't tell
us where you're hiding.

64
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:11,703
Did you guys see the paper

65
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:13,798
in <i>The American Physics
Journal</i> on supersolids?

66
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:14,999
It's pretty interesting.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,234
This guy's working from
a hypothesis where...

68
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:18,219
Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.

69
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,004
What? Don't ruin it for me, man.

70
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:22,840
I printed out a PDF
to read on the potty.

71
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,891
On the potty?

72
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:24,942
What are you, five?

73
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:26,928
It's a potty. What do you call it?

74
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:27,945
Toilet.

75
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:28,930
That's a little vulgar for

76
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,064
the dinner table, don't you think?

77
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:32,183
Oh, and "potty" is okay?

78
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:33,184
"Potty" is innocent.

79
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,302
"Potty" is adorable.

80
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:37,071
What do you do in the potty,
wee-wee?

81
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:39,407
If I don't have to boom-boom.

82
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,776
Greetings.

83
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:43,945
You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.

84
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,162
Nice to see you. Hello.

85
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,198
Sorry we're late.

86
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,249
I must take responsibility.

87
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,917
I had to stop for
feminine hygiene supplies.

88
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:51,085
Aha. Okay.

89
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:53,254
I believe she's
experiencing her menses.

90
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:55,506
Actually, I'm not.

91
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,258
In order to avoid surprises,
I wear them all the time.

92
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,459
Aha. Okay.

93
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:01,846
"Toilet's" sounding
pretty good now, huh?

94
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:05,266
Hey, look, it's Shamy.

95
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:06,601
Shamy?

96
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:09,770
A juvenile amalgamation
of our names.

97
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,306
Sheldon, Amy-- Shamy.

98
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:13,641
Oh.

99
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:14,642
I don't like that.

100
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:15,693
Don't do that.

101
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:18,779
All righty. What's new?

102
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,365
Well, just recently, I learned
that you refer to us as Shamy,

103
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,600
and I don't like that.

104
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,435
I got it.

105
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:27,221
But what I was going for was,
you know, how's your life?

106
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,040
Like everybody else's.

107
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,159
Subject to entropy,
decay and eventual death.

108
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:34,845
Thank you for asking.

109
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:36,631
Why is she not taking our order?

110
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:37,832
I should've warned you,

111
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,302
one has to navigate a
labyrinth of social nonsense

112
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:42,970
before one can be fed here.

113
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,305
Really?

114
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,007
I assumed an establishment called

115
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:48,809
the Cheesecake Factory would
function more efficiently.

116
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,127
It's how they lure you in.

117
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:52,396
I believe it's called "
bait and switch."

118
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:55,266
Okay, I'm just gonna walk away,

119
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,351
'cause... I don't want to be here.

120
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,291
So, this is nice.

121
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,142
First time we've all
gotten together to eat.

122
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:08,429
You're right, he's a
festival of humdrum chitchat.

123
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:11,415
Okay, that's all I got.

124
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,668
Howard, you're up.

125
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,171
Um... tell us about your work, Amy.

126
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,873
I doubt you'd understand.

127
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:21,626
Sheldon tells me you only
have a master's degree.

128
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:26,013
Raj, do you have any
questions for Amy?

129
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,420
I'm curious as to why
we're not eating alone.

130
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:34,488
They can't function without me.

131
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:39,343
I'm the social glue that holds
this little group together.

132
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:40,811
You're welcome.

133
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:46,067
Listen, can I talk to you
about your girlfriend?

134
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:47,868
She's not my girlfriend.

135
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,820
She's a girl and she's my friend,

136
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:53,541
but there's no touching or
unsanitary exchange of saliva.

137
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,410
Got it.

138
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,379
Although, for the record,
on one occasion,

139
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,031
she licked her thumb to
remove raspberry jelly

140
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:02,883
from the corner of my mouth.

141
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,302
It's an action we both
regret to this day.

142
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:06,387
Uh-huh.

143
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:08,723
Anyway, I'm not sure
she's the best fit

144
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:12,376
for our little-- how should
we call it-- rebel alliance.

145
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:15,763
Oh, I never identified
with the rebel alliance.

146
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:18,182
Despite their tendency
to build Death Stars,

147
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:20,434
I've always been more
of an empire man.

148
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:23,387
Yeah, not my point.

149
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:24,605
I know what your point is.

150
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,657
You're intimidated
by Amy's intellect.

151
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,110
To that I say, buck up.

152
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,327
Okay, let me just

153
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:31,412
get right to it.

154
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:34,749
Amy is judgmental,
sanctimonious and frankly...

155
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,019
just obnoxious.

156
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,787
So?

157
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:42,173
So we already have
you for all that.

158
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:46,761
Are you suggesting I terminate
my relationship with Amy?

159
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:48,179
No, no, of course not.

160
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,265
Just have your relationship
someplace else.

161
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:54,885
May I point out that
for eight long months,

162
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:57,755
I suffered in silence
as your female companion

163
00:06:57,756 --> 00:06:59,974
filled our apartment with her

164
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:02,810
off-key country music caterwauling,

165
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:04,261
the unappetizing spectacle

166
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,948
of her grinding a pumice stone
against her calloused feet

167
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,567
in our living room,

168
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:12,936
and night after night of
uninformative TV documentaries

169
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:15,489
about the Jersey Shore.

170
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:19,794
Suffered in silence?

171
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,796
Yes.

172
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:26,083
And I'd thank you to do the same.

173
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,004
Reall-- Silence?!

174
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:34,792
Ah.

175
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,594
Nothing makes beer
taste better than

176
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:40,581
cool clear Rocky
Mountain spring water.

177
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:42,700
Where are the Rocky
Mountains, anyway?

178
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,370
Philadelphia.

179
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:47,388
Really?

180
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:48,823
I thought they were
out West someplace.

181
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:49,974
Think about it, Raj.

182
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:53,344
Where did the movie
<i>Rocky</i> take place?

183
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:55,913
Philadelphia.

184
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,865
Okay, now I get it.

185
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:00,451
So this is the plan?

186
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,419
From now on, we're just
gonna hide out in here

187
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,588
to avoid the Shamy?

188
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,173
I'm very comfortable here.

189
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:10,711
Penny, dear, why don't you shoot
another silver bullet my way?

190
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:12,763
Get one yourself.

191
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:16,016
Ooh, somebody's been
taking bitchy pills.

192
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:19,670
God, he's an ass when he drinks.

193
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,021
Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't.

194
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,224
You just don't hear it.

195
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:26,176
Think we need to start
entertaining the possibility

196
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:28,028
that the Shamy could
go on for years.

197
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,731
Well, if that's the case,
Penny will have to get satellite TV

198
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:33,450
and maybe once a week run a
vacuum through this place.

199
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,490
I thought you were going
to talk to Sheldon.

200
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,358
I did. Well, what'd he say?

201
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,494
Well, he pointed out that
he kinda sorta had to...

202
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:44,962
put up with you.

203
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,914
Kinda sorta had to?

204
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:48,215
I didn't agree with him.

205
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:49,216
Well, you defended me, right?

206
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:52,052
I tried, but...

207
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:58,375
...he made a fairly
well-reasoned argument.

208
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:01,645
You're not doing that right.

209
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:02,646
What?

210
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:03,881
Gimme.

211
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:05,099
No. Trust me.

212
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,818
No! I do this for
my mom all the time.

213
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,988
See?

214
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,107
With the grain.

215
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:15,726
Wow, that is better.

216
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:18,412
And someday, when you
have varicose veins,

217
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:20,331
I'll show you how to massage them.

218
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:27,254
Oh, God, never again.

219
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:30,240
I assume by "never again,
" you mean never again will you drink

220
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,626
all of Penny's beer,
then run down to the gas station

221
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:34,845
for a couple of 40s,
a box of Slim Jims

222
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:38,766
and the latest issue of
<i>Bombay Badonkadonks.</i>

223
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,952
I was homesick.

224
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:44,054
The highlight of the evening
was when you showed us

225
00:09:44,055 --> 00:09:46,140
your Bollywood break
dancing skills.

226
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,900
That's very offensive.

227
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:57,985
Yeah, we all thought so.

228
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,287
Oh, no.

229
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:01,288
What?

230
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,657
It's John and Yoko.

231
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,410
More like Yoko and Yoko.

232
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,111
Greetings. Hey.

233
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:09,330
I brought Amy here

234
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,582
to show her some of
the work I'm doing.

235
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,968
It's very impressive,
for theoretical work.

236
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:18,122
Do I detect a hint
of condescension?

237
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:20,324
I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

238
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,761
I meant compared to the
real-world applications

239
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,796
of neurobiology,
theoretical physics is--

240
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,998
what's the word I'm looking for?--
hmm, cute.

241
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:33,687
Are you suggesting the
work of a neurobiologist

242
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:37,057
like Babinski could ever
rise to the significance

243
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:40,411
of a physicist like
Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?

244
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,112
I'm stating it outright.

245
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:44,114
Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast

246
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:47,017
and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.

247
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:51,021
You take that back.

248
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:53,891
Absolutely not.

249
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:55,125
My colleagues and I are mapping

250
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,094
the neurological
substrates that subserve

251
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:58,245
global information processing,

252
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:00,347
which is required for
all cognitive reasoning,

253
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:04,051
including scientific inquiry,
making my research ipso facto

254
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:05,386
prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

255
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:08,088
That means it's better
than his research,

256
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:10,107
and by extension, of course, yours.

257
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,895
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying

258
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:19,199
to work on the defecating
Clark Maxwell, so...

259
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:23,737
Excuse me, but a
grand unified theory,

260
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:26,323
insofar as it explains everything,

261
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:29,376
will ipso facto
explain neurobiology.

262
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:30,995
Yes, but if I'm successful,

263
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:33,497
I will be able to map and
reproduce your thought processes

264
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,382
in deriving a grand unified theory,

265
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:38,252
and therefore, subsume your
conclusions under my paradigm.

266
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:41,805
That's the rankest psychologism,

267
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:44,208
and was conclusively
revealed as hogwash

268
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,327
by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!

269
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:49,430
We appear to have
reached an impasse.

270
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:51,098
I agree.

271
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:54,735
I move our relationship
terminate immediately.

272
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,737
Seconded.

273
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:57,838
There being no objections...

274
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,574
Uh-uh.

275
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,276
...the motion carries.

276
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:04,244
Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.

277
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,246
Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

278
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:12,252
Women, huh?

279
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,787
Can't live with them,

280
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:17,207
can't successfully
refute their hypotheses.

281
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,376
Amen to that.

282
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:26,765
Hey, Sheldon.

283
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,400
Hello.

284
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,154
I hear you broke up with Amy.

285
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:36,575
A breakup would imply
she was my girlfriend.

286
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:38,193
She was a girl who was my friend

287
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:41,630
who is now a girl who
is not my friend.

288
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:45,217
Wow. That's like the
worst country song ever.

289
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,704
So, how are you doing?

290
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:50,972
Regarding what?

291
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,107
Amy.

292
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,209
I don't follow.

293
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,431
Well, breakups-- or whatever the
hell this is-- can be tough.

294
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:01,433
Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

295
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:04,603
My relationship with Amy
was purely intellectual,

296
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,055
There were no emotional bonds,

297
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:09,390
the severing of which would
cause me any discomfort.

298
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:12,060
The relationship simply
outlived its utility,

299
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:15,030
and I'm continuing on
with my life as before.

300
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,915
Okay. Good.

301
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,752
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to buy a pussycat.

302
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,623
I gotta tell you guys,

303
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,208
I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

304
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:29,044
We're all a little
worried about Sheldon.

305
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:32,080
No, I mean since the
Shamy hit a reef.

306
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,349
Oh, I thought you were just
making a generalization:

307
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,767
"You know,
I'm worried about Sheldon

308
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:37,969
"someday setting off a
low-yield nuclear device

309
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,722
because the cafeteria
ran out of lime Jell-O."

310
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,108
What does "hit a reef" mean?

311
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,643
Uh, went splitsville.

312
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:45,644
Pardon?

313
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:48,230
Turned to boom-boom.

314
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,981
Ah.

315
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:52,450
I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

316
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:56,721
You should lend him your copy of
<i>Bombay Badonkadonks.</i>

317
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:58,907
He got a cat to keep him company.

318
00:13:58,908 --> 00:13:59,908
You're kidding.

319
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,159
He takes it everywhere:

320
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,011
to bed, to the bathroom.

321
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,963
He takes the kitty to the potty?

322
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:07,582
I thought we discussed the P-word.

323
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,150
Don't try to change me, dude.

324
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,136
I am what I am.

325
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:14,455
Oh, gentlemen.

326
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:16,508
Hey. Aren't you going
to introduce us

327
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:18,176
to your little friend?

328
00:14:18,177 --> 00:14:19,644
My apologies.

329
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:24,416
Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr.
Robert Oppenheimer.

330
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:27,686
Hello. Hi.

331
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:28,970
Now, if you'll excuse me,

332
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:32,490
the father of the atomic
bomb wants a saucer of milk.

333
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:36,611
Okay, I get it.
We're worried about Sheldon.

334
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:38,079
Yeah.

335
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:42,918
Hey.

336
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,437
Oh, no.

337
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:48,039
Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

338
00:14:48,040 --> 00:15:03,838
So you decided to get the
whole Manhattan Project?

339
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,358
but he's so zazzy.

340
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:11,529
Okay, we need to talk.

341
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,781
About what?

342
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:14,399
Cats, Sheldon.

343
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,401
You're clearly upset
about Amy being gone,

344
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:19,120
and you're trying to replace
her with a bunch of cats.

345
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,705
Clowder. What?

346
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:24,075
A group of cats is a clowder.
Or a glaring.

347
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:25,126
Okay, yeah, fine.

348
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:26,828
It's the kind of thing you ought

349
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,496
to know now that we have one.

350
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:31,750
Terrific. My point is,
you need to face up

351
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,718
to what you're feeling
with this breakup.

352
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,970
It wasn't a breakup.

353
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:36,871
A breakup would imply that
Amy was my girlfriend.

354
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:39,391
Okay, I got it, I got it;
she's not your girlfriend.

355
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:40,759
Now listen to me.

356
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,346
I know about loneliness.

357
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:46,681
I know about trying to replace
someone with other stuff.

358
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:49,567
When I broke up with Penny,
I got back into my cello,

359
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:51,686
I built a bunch of model rockets,

360
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:56,207
I got those weightlifting gloves
and that five-pound dumbbell.

361
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,577
You didn't break up,
she dumped you.

362
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:01,529
She didn't dump me.

363
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,914
It was mutual!

364
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:04,582
I was there. She dumped you.

365
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,967
Okay, fine.

366
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,252
Live with cats.

367
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:08,536
Be like my Aunt Nancy.

368
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:09,904
She had dozens of them.

369
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,374
And do you know what happened
after she died? They ate her.

370
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,043
You don't have to sell
me on cats, Leonard.

371
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:16,261
I'm already a fan.

372
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:24,936
All right, fellas,
who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?

373
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:27,922
Well, that's not fancy at all.

374
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:34,279
Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

375
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,363
Where is he?

376
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:36,531
He's in his bedroom.

377
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:39,317
Now, when you said on the phone

378
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:41,820
he broke up with a girl,
you meant an actual girl,

379
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:44,322
not something you kids
whipped up in a lab?

380
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:45,874
No, she's real.

381
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,909
Did they sin?

382
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,944
No, no, it's not like that.

383
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:52,047
It's, uh...

384
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:53,748
I don't know what it's like.

385
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:55,667
But there is something I
should prepare you for.

386
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:59,337
Oh, relax, Leonard,
I have raised that boy.

387
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:01,890
I've seen him at his best,
I've seen him at his worst.

388
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:04,509
There's nothing he can
do that'll surprise me.

389
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,344
Hold on to that thought.

390
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,147
Come in.

391
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,136
Surprise.

392
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:17,939
Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

393
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,776
My, my, that's a powerful smell.

394
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:25,780
I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer,
Frisch, Panofsky,

395
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,499
Feynman, Weisskopf...

396
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,666
Yeah, I get it.

397
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,452
You got a lot of cats

398
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,470
and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.

399
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:34,339
What are you doing here?

400
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,590
Leonard called.

401
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:38,826
And he said that you were
pining for a young lady.

402
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,628
Oh, that's preposterous.

403
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:42,664
I'm not pining over anyone.

404
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:45,767
Oh, lambchop, we can
quibble what to call it,

405
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:49,337
but I think we can
both agree it's creepy.

406
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:51,439
I do not agree.

407
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,792
Cats make wonderful companions.

408
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:58,063
They don't argue or question
my intellectual authority,

409
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,948
and this little guy here,

410
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:03,201
I think you'll find
to be quite zazzy.

411
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:07,989
You should have called sooner.

412
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,326
Shelly! Dinner's ready!

413
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,360
Coming!

414
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:13,628
No cats!

415
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,046
Aw...

416
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,585
What is she doing here?

417
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:21,886
I called her.

418
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:22,937
Your mother thinks

419
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,889
you might be losing
your mind over me.

420
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,542
As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

421
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:31,229
Well, rest assured, I am in
full possession of my faculties.

422
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,349
25 cats!

423
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,652
Oh, God bless you, dear.

424
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:40,021
Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

425
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:42,824
All right, but you're
not fooling me.

426
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:44,042
Whenever you say we have to talk,

427
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,276
it means you want me to listen.

428
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,277
Then stop talking.

429
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:48,079
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,198
Now, the reason I
called Amy over was

431
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,750
to find out what type
of person she is.

432
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:54,419
And after chatting a bit,

433
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,754
I have to say that while she is a

434
00:18:56,755 --> 00:19:00,258
<i>perfectly</i> unique young woman,

435
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,778
you two are definitely not
suited for each other.

436
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:06,581
That's a peculiar conclusion.

437
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:09,033
By any standard,
Amy is more similar to me

438
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,351
than anyone I've ever met.

439
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:13,154
Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly,
I can't see it.

440
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:16,057
Well, whether you see
it or not is irrelevant.

441
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:18,059
I can't see subatomic particles,

442
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,911
but nevertheless, they're there.

443
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:21,029
Excellent point.

444
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,763
A physics point.

445
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:25,300
Touché.

446
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:27,635
Well, putting aside the pig Latin,

447
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,470
it's a good thing that

448
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,422
you two decided to
end the relationship

449
00:19:31,423 --> 00:19:33,875
so I didn't have to end it for you.

450
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:37,896
Amy, after consideration,

451
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:40,098
I believe we may have acted rashly.

452
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:41,966
I propose we resume
our relationship

453
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,469
and attempt to resolve
our differences.

454
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,421
I'll agree to that only
if you'll stipulate

455
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:48,523
that 80% of our difficulties
were caused by you.

456
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:50,308
I'll go as high as 40. Sixty-five.

457
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:51,843
Done.

458
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,845
You understand that moving forward,

459
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:57,332
we deal with the fact that my
mother does not approve of you?

460
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,301
I do. I find being cast

461
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:02,987
in the role of bad
girl oddly titillating.

462
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,407
Would you like to see my cats?

463
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,526
I would. I love cats.

464
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:09,861
They're the epitome
of indifference.

465
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:13,681
Ah, then you may find
Zazzles a little cloying.

466
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,534
I saw what you did there.

467
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,620
He thinks he's such a smarty pants.

468
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,004
He's no different from any man.

469
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:22,373
You tell 'em not to do
something, that's all

470
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:23,341
they want to do.

471
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:24,842
If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy

472
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:26,828
not to clear out the
wood chipper by hand,

473
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,379
we'd still be calling him Edward.

474
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:31,165
Now, don't you move.

475
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,767
I'll bring over all the food.

476
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:34,869
No, no, no, I can do it.

477
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:38,873
Well, isn't that sweet?

478
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,475
Thank you, Amy.

479
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:47,976
Here's your cat.

480
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:50,779
And here's your $20.

481
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:53,399
Next!

482
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,350
Thank you, Amy.

483
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:56,535
Here's your cat.

484
00:20:57,404 --> 00:20:59,371
And here's your $20.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
