1
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,205
Okay, help me out here.

2
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:20,842
How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

3
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:23,411
Maybe he took a class
at the adult bookstore.

4
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:25,046
That's how I learned.

5
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:27,849
I can't believe you've never
seen <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,653
And I can't believe you've
never read <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

7
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:33,121
When she comes out with

8
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,857
<i>Eat, Pray, Run Away From A</i>
<i>Giant Boulder,</i> I'll read it.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,862
I don't care if <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>
changed your life,

10
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:43,798
I'm not reading it.

11
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,067
You know, I could totally
rock a hat like that.

12
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,803
That's the work of noted
Hollywood costume designer

13
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:49,904
Deborah Nadoolman.

14
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,239
She also designed

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,574
the iconic red and black jacket

16
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,442
in Michael Jackson's
<i>Thriller</i> video,

17
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:56,411
which I've never viewed
in its entirety,

18
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:57,796
as I find zombies dancing

19
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,981
in choreographed synchronicity
implausible.

20
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:04,586
And also, it's really scary.

21
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:07,722
Would someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

22
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:11,659
There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

23
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,062
Penny, if you think
this is good,

24
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:15,263
you should come with us Friday

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,399
to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,466
Well, I'm watching it now.

27
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:19,968
Why would I want to see it again
on Friday?

28
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,903
Because the print
they're showing on Friday

29
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:26,191
has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

30
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:30,879
21 seconds? That'll be like
seeing a whole new movie!

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,113
Exactly.

32
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:33,948
They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

33
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:35,984
Did-- Leonard?

34
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:37,585
I'm no expert, but I believe

35
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:39,504
what we just heard from Penny
was sarcasm.

36
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:42,757
Oh! Good.

37
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:44,426
I'm eight for 26 this month.

38
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,061
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

39
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:49,931
But you guys enjoy
your extra 21 seconds.

40
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,399
Bet if I could
make you understand

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,735
why this is such a cool thing,
we'd still be together.

42
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:57,238
Mm, yeah, no,
we wouldn't.

43
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,640
Uh-huh.

44
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:02,744
I'm guessing 21 seconds had
something to do with that, too.

55
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,136
May I point out to you all

56
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,505
that the screening is
"first come, first served"?

57
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:40,075
Relax, it's 5:00. The movie
doesn't start till midnight.

58
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,445
Another way of saying that is

59
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:44,580
"the movie starts at midnight,
and it's already 5:00."

60
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,848
Let's go.

61
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,083
You know, if we miss it,
we'll have the fun of

62
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,437
listening to Sheldon whine about
it for the rest of our lives.

63
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,290
See? Howard's on my side.

64
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,925
Actually, I'm not.

65
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,927
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

66
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,781
Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

67
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,749
Don't worry, Sheldon.
We'll be fine.

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,701
What happened to
the Leonard Hofstadter

69
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:08,070
who waited in line
with me for 14 hours

70
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,405
to see the midnight premiere
of <i>Star Trek: Nemesis?</i>

71
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,175
Oh. Well, he waited
in line for 14 hours,

72
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:14,777
while you napped
in a lawn chair,

73
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,445
he got in a fight
with a Klingon

74
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,147
when he stepped
out of line to pee

75
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,915
and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him,

76
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,352
and worst of all,
he saw <i>Star Trek: Nemesis.</i>

77
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,488
But how were our seats?

78
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,555
Excellent.

79
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,190
I rest my case.

80
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:31,460
Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

81
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,364
Actually, as the newest member
of your social group,

82
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,500
I believe I'll gain more
acceptance by arbitrarily

83
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,869
siding with your friends
from time to time.

84
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,872
Shrewd.

85
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:45,341
Leonard, you're right.

86
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:47,376
We should enjoy our meal,
arrive late,

87
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,078
and risk winding up
with terrible seats,

88
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,180
assuming we get in at all.

89
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,882
Thank you, Amy.

90
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,385
See? It's working.

91
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:58,420
Knock-knock.

92
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,471
Who's there?

93
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,489
Olive.

94
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,458
Olive you, too.

95
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,861
Guys, that's really
starting to get old.

96
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:06,979
Knock-knock.

97
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,030
Who's there?

98
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:10,866
I have a girlfriend
and you don't.

99
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:12,985
Hysterical!

100
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,104
Wait, now, we don't know
that yet. He isn't finished.

101
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:17,973
I have a girlfriend
and you don't <i>who?</i>

102
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:22,111
So. Are you sure you don't want
to come with us to <i>Raiders?</i>

103
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:25,114
Oh, no. That movie
has melting faces.

104
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:26,749
It reminds me
too much of the time

105
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,851
I dropped that vial of
flesh-eating bacteria

106
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,352
into the Rhesus monkey lab.

107
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,190
Besides, Penny and I are having
a girls' night tonight.

108
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,359
Girls' night?
What does that entail?

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,994
Oh, you know, girls get
together,

110
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,729
hang out, share girl talk.

111
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,566
I'm a girl.

112
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:48,103
Oh. Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

113
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:51,056
No need. Penny and I
are very close.

114
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,708
You are?

115
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,411
Yes. In fact,
our menses are synchronized.

116
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,368
Penny.

117
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,253
Bernadette tells me you're
planning a girls' night.

118
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:05,287
Yeah?

119
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:08,157
I'm a girl.

120
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:10,826
Oh. Um, it was-- it was just
going to be me and Bernadette.

121
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,728
Besides, I thought you
were going to the movies

122
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,829
with Sheldon and the guys.

123
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,230
Yes, but they're not girls.

124
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,266
I'm a girl.

125
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:21,503
Yeah, no, no,
I-I-I got that.

126
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:22,871
What's the dress code?

127
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:24,873
Uh, just wear something
comfortable.

128
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:28,844
All right.
I'll have to go shopping.

129
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,680
Knock-knock.

130
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:32,715
Who is there?

131
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,283
Hugh.
Hugh who?

132
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,252
Hugh people need to
listen to me.

133
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:44,726
It's time to get
in line for the movie.

134
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,578
And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

135
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:55,904
Under normal circumstances
I'd say, "I told you so."

136
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,073
But as I have told you so

137
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,842
with such vehemence
and frequency already,

138
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,678
the phrase has lost all meaning.

139
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,347
Therefore, I will be
replacing it with the phrase:

140
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,633
"I informed you thusly."

141
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,519
Ooh. Can't wait
for that to start.

142
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,771
I informed you thusly.

143
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,358
Eight for 28.

144
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:20,145
This is where we could have been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

145
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,314
This is where we could have been

146
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,633
if Koothrappali
hadn't ordered dessert.

147
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,785
Well I earned it, dude,
I ate all my broccoli.

148
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:31,957
And here's where we are.
The runts in a large litter.

149
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,575
unlikely to ever reach

150
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:37,646
the nourishing teats
of Indiana Jones.

151
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,749
So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

152
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,504
You know, guys, when
facing disappointment,

153
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,788
<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>  teaches us--

154
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,508
Oh, shut up.

155
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:53,028
...so anyway, to make
a long story short,

156
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:56,765
turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

157
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:01,970
You--
Amy, when we say "girl talk,"

158
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,808
it doesn't just have to
be about our lady parts.

159
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:10,846
Shame. 'Cause I have a real
zinger about my titled uterus.

160
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:17,820
Penny, your nails
look great.

161
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:21,123
Oh, thanks. I found
this place in Alhambra.

162
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,491
It's in a woman's basement.

163
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,893
I think it's a front
for human trafficking,

164
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,995
but they do a really good job.

165
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:30,799
A colleague of mine did her
graduate thesis on the fungus

166
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,435
that grows on improperly
sterilized manicure implements.

167
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,573
Well don't tell me
that's not "girl talk."

168
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:40,526
So where should
we go tonight?

169
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,711
A bar? A club? A movie?

170
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,379
Or we could just stay here.

171
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,948
Yes, and continue to bond.

172
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,683
I have a feeling
that after tonight,

173
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,219
one of you will become
my best friend forever.

174
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,222
Or "BFF," if you prefer.

175
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,556
Which I don't.

176
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,794
All right, time to open
Bachelor Number Two.

177
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:01,163
Gee, I don't know
if I should drink more.

178
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,332
I have to drive home,
and I've got enough trouble

179
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,168
seeing over the dashboard
as it is.

180
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,471
That's okay.
You can just sleep here.

181
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,774
Oh, good, a slumber party!

182
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,143
We'll do makeovers,
initiate phony phone calls,

183
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:17,179
and have spirited pillow fights
in our frilly nighties!

184
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,714
Oh, gosh, Amy.

185
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,183
I don't know if I would call
this an actual slumber party.

186
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,484
Well, that's disappointing.

187
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,286
I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

188
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:25,754
Oh, you never were?

189
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,222
Not even when
you were a kid?

190
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,758
Well, there was the time
I had my tonsils out,

191
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,494
and I shared a room with
a little Vietnamese girl.

192
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,030
She didn't make it
through the night,

193
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,199
but up till then,
it was kind of fun.

194
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,838
Okay. Well, I guess we're
having a slumber party.

195
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,206
Oh!

196
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,110
Pillow fight!

197
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,448
Oh, I hope they
let us in soon.

198
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,884
I'm tired of running to the gas
station to use the bathroom.

199
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:59,188
The guy makes me buy
a Gatorade every time.

200
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:00,489
It's a vicious circle.

201
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,560
Too bad you don't have
a stadium pal like me.

202
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,928
What's a stadium pal?

203
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,462
Let me put it this way:

204
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,331
takes care of
the bathroom problem,

205
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,066
and it keeps your calf warm.

206
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,337
Hey, guys, bad news.
I just did a quick calculation.

207
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,906
Given the size of the theater
and the length of this line,

208
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,808
we might not get seats.

209
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,945
What did he say?

210
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,146
Nice going, Raj.

211
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,148
Just got him down for his nap.

212
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,451
We might not get seats?!

213
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:30,785
It's fine, it's fine.
Go back to sleep.

214
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:34,506
Oh, I informed you thusly!
I so informed you thusly.

215
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,226
Howard, you talk to him.

216
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:38,393
Howard?

217
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,231
You're peeing,
aren't you?

218
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,500
Hey, look who's here!

219
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,269
Hey, buddies!

220
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,687
Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

221
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,808
the Jar Jar Binks
of the <i>Star Trek</i> universe.

222
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:56,545
Mee-sa think that very funny!

223
00:09:56,546 --> 00:10:00,382
Well, you-sa can go think that
at the back of the line.

224
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,951
No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

225
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,003
Wil Wheaton.

226
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,038
Yeah.

227
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,005
I'm a big fan.

228
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,659
Of what? Poorly
executed beards?

229
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,728
Do you think you could get me
and my friends into the movie?

230
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:13,996
We got here
a little late.

231
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,830
No problem. Come on,
I'll hook you up.

232
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,015
Awesome.

233
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,803
We-sa gonna go into
the movie now! Bye-bye!

234
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,976
This is <i>Indiana</i> Jones,
not <i>Star Trek.</i>

235
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:31,313
There should be no value
to his pseudo-celebrity here!

236
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,081
And even at
Star Trek conventions,

237
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:35,884
they only let him in
if he helps set up!

238
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,552
Calm down, Sheldon.

239
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,987
I will not calm down.

240
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,990
This affront to justice and
decency cannot go unanswered.

241
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,826
As Captain Jean-Luc Picard
once said,

242
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,913
"The line must be drawn here!

243
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,000
"This far, no farther!"

244
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:55,637
Had to wake him up
from his nap, didn't you?

245
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,861
You know what I really love
about Howard?

246
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,846
His chest hair.

247
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:06,316
Howard has a
hairy chest?

248
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,519
No, just the one.

249
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:11,955
But it's really long.

250
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:16,994
Okay, there you go--
Sultry Sunrise Red.

251
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,595
What do you think?

252
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,365
My nails have never
looked so pretty before.

253
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,534
Get it off.

254
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:27,354
Oh, oh, uh, looks like
they're getting ready

255
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:28,589
to let people in.

256
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,642
Listen to what Mr. Wil
Wheaton is tweeting.

257
00:11:31,643 --> 00:11:35,512
"Best seats in house
for <i>Raiders</i> screening.

258
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:38,649
Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

259
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,417
Why do you read
his Twitter feed?

260
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,269
You know it's only
going to upset you.

261
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,621
I believe in knowing
my enemy, Leonard.

262
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,975
Had Twitter existed at the time,
would not General Custer

263
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:50,260
have followed the tweets
of Sitting Bull?

264
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,696
Would not Lee have
followed Grant?

265
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:55,265
Would not Spy have followed Spy?

266
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:58,936
I have more examples,
but excuse me.

267
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:00,604
Hello.

268
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:03,006
Well, this seems
like an odd time

269
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:06,577
to test my cell phone quality,
but go on.

270
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:09,012
Test phrases? All right.

271
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,749
Imatote.

272
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,784
Ulba.

273
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:15,552
Twad.

274
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:18,122
All together?

275
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:20,591
I'm a total buttwad.

276
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:25,095
Why are you laughing?

277
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:28,365
Hello?

278
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:31,235
And that, girls, is how you make
a phony phone call.

279
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,171
I'm not sure I grasp

280
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,774
the full entertainment value,
but all right.

281
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:40,210
Next on Wikipedia's list
of slumber party activities:

282
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,495
"Truth or Dare."

283
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,147
Okay, it's your game.
You go first.

284
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:46,617
Hang on. I'm familiarizing
myself with the rules.

285
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:49,319
Seems fairly straightforward.

286
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,588
Bernadette, truth or dare?

287
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:53,157
Truth.
All right.

288
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:55,659
To what temperature
must you heat beef

289
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,261
in order to
kill the prion

290
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:59,897
that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy?

291
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:01,532
Um...

292
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,234
Remember, you have
to answer honestly.

293
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,503
Wait. No, Amy, you're
supposed to ask her

294
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:07,905
something personal
or embarrassing.

295
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:09,239
Oh.

296
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,507
All right.

297
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:13,443
What is the circumference
of your areolas?

298
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:22,786
"Munching on
complimentary popcorn.

299
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,121
Woot, woot."

300
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,455
Oh, the gall.

301
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:29,376
I hope his next tweet is
"Popcorn lodged in trachea.

302
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:31,428
"Choking to death.

303
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,330
Woot, woot."

304
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:36,533
Guys, I am sorry.
We are full up.

305
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:37,935
No!

306
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:39,202
We're full up.

307
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:40,637
We really want
to see this.

308
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:42,973
Isn't there anything
you can do?

309
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:45,042
Sorry. Fire regulations.
Should've gotten here earlier.

310
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:47,878
This is nothing but a
blatant abuse of power

311
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,546
by a petty functionary.

312
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:52,015
Explain to me why
Wil Wheaton and his lackeys

313
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,717
get in and we don't.

314
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:57,554
'Cause I'm the petty functionary
with a clipboard, bitch.

315
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,558
I guess that's that.

316
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:04,227
Let's go home.

317
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:05,245
You know what?

318
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,864
I'm going back to
"I told you so."

319
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:08,115
I told you so.

320
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:10,751
We can still see something.

321
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:13,453
Oh, the new Sandra Bullock movie
is playing two blocks away.

322
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,973
You know Sandy B.
always brings it.

323
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,408
Look-- a side door.

324
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:19,977
Come on, Short Round.

325
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,013
I guess we'd better
go after him.

326
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,414
Short Round?

327
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:26,133
Indy's young sidekick
from <i>Temple of Doom.</i>

328
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:28,685
Yeah, I know who it
is, but why is it me?

329
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:30,921
You're right. It should
be a cuddly Asian boy.

330
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,089
Like me.

331
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,627
"And Absolon hath
kist hir nether ye,

332
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,662
"and Nicholas is scalded
in the towte.

333
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:42,633
This tale is doon,
and God save al the rowte."

334
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,972
What the hell was that?

335
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,842
Bernadette dared me to
tell a dirty story.

336
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:55,345
"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer
is the dirtiest story I know.

337
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:58,215
It would have been hidden
in sock drawers

338
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:01,852
if people in the 14th century
had worn socks.

339
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,254
I thought it was pretty spicy.

340
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:08,158
Especially the part
where he kisses her nether ye.

341
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,826
You might not
like it as much

342
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,461
if you knew what
"nether ye" meant.

343
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:13,497
if one cares
about hygiene,

344
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:16,033
one ought not be kissing it.

345
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,002
Okay, my turn.

346
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,604
Penny, truth or dare?

347
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:21,822
Truth.

348
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:24,174
Why are you still hanging out
with Leonard so much

349
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:25,676
even though you broke up
with him?

350
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:28,078
Oh, that's an
excellent question.

351
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,447
For two people who claim to be
no longer pair-bonded,

352
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:32,883
you spend an inordinate amount
of time in each other's company.

353
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,751
Yeah.

354
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,822
Dare.

355
00:15:40,158 --> 00:15:41,358
I don't believe the rules allow

356
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,260
for an ex post facto
option change.

357
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:45,062
Yeah.

358
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,599
Okay, look, just because we're
not seeing each other anymore

359
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,268
doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

360
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:53,070
I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

361
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,272
Then, why did you terminate
your relationship with him?

362
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:56,640
I don't know.

363
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,509
He got really serious,
and I wasn't ready for it.

364
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,844
Interesting.

365
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,512
How will you react
if, in the future,

366
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:04,614
you become ready for it,
and Leonard is unavailable,

367
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,750
because another woman
has realized that he is--

368
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:09,186
to use your words--
"a great guy"?

369
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,490
You can only ask one question.

370
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,760
That one.

371
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,430
You know what,
I don't want to play anymore.

372
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,039
Well, I'm not sure
how this is scored,

373
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,675
but I believe
we may have won.

374
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:37,314
Sheldon?

375
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:39,816
Sheldon?

376
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,217
Where did he go?

377
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:47,391
We're looking for Sheldon,
not Marmaduke.

378
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:51,394
You whistled?

379
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:52,696
What is that?

380
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,230
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

381
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,232
with 21 additional seconds.

382
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,337
If I can't see it,
no one else can see it.

383
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:02,172
Sheldon, this is crazy.

384
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:05,876
No. Crazy was leaving
the projection booth unattended.

385
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,127
Listen to me.

386
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,545
You are over-tired.
You're not thinking right.

387
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:11,181
Put the movie back
before we get into trouble.

388
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:13,250
Trouble is my middle name,
Leonard.

389
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,053
Actually, it's Lee,
but I prefer Trouble.

390
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:19,523
Oh, look who
they let in.

391
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:23,426
Don't worry, Wil Wheaton.
I was just leaving.

392
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:29,032
Come on, Short Round.

393
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,867
Yeah.

394
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,406
Come on, guys!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

395
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:37,541
Let's see you run

396
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,976
with a bag of urine
strapped to your leg.

397
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,546
He's got the movie! Get him!

398
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:52,022
Why is there never a pontoon
plane when you need one?

399
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,031
She's been in there
a long time.

400
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,933
Clearly, losing Truth or Dare
upset her.

401
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,920
Perhaps we should try
to take her mind off it

402
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,905
with another popular
slumber party activity.

403
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,974
Ooh, like what?
Well, the Internet suggests

404
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:17,343
that slumber party guests
often engage

405
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:19,445
in harmless experimentation
with lesbianism.

406
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:25,184
Where exactly on the Internet
have you been looking?

407
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:28,754
Penny?
Oh, hey, Amy.

408
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:30,923
Look, I'm sorry I got
so upset. I just...

409
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:32,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

410
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:35,294
What are you doing?

411
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:37,663
Don't worry. I'll
avoid the nether ye.

412
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:40,116
I might have gone
with eating raw cookie dough.

413
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:43,435
