00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:02,983
(water running)

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,885
Leonard, are you in the shower?

3
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:08,022
I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

4
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:10,157
I asked if you
were in the shower,

5
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:12,126
but that's moot now!

6
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:13,294
What?

7
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:18,132
Moot! Rendered unimportant
by recent events!

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,684
I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

9
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,503
I have to skip
the chitchat.

10
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:23,771
Emergency.

11
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,639
What kind of
emergency?

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,275
Mathematical--
32-ounce banana smoothie,

13
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:30,344
16-ounce bladder.

14
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,913
You might not
want to do that.

15
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:34,648
I assure you I do.

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,251
Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.

17
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,203
What?!

18
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:42,056
Hello, Sheldon.

19
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:43,524
What are you doing in there?

20
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:44,792
She can't be in here!

21
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:47,461
We were in here first;
<i>you</i> can't be in here.

22
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:49,129
According to
the roommate agreement,

23
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,598
paragraph nine, subsection B,

24
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,333
"The right
to bathroom privacy

25
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,635
is suspended in the event
of force majeure."

26
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,303
And believe me,
I am experiencing

27
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:59,240
a <i>very</i> majeure force.

28
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:01,742
Come on, you can't
wait two minutes?

29
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:04,678
Oh, Leonard,
let the man pee.

30
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,119
Penny? Penny?

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,787
Penny?

32
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:15,188
What?

33
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:17,391

45
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:50,988
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

46
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,486
you are officially charged

47
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,839
with two violations
of the roommate agreement.

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,357
Do you waive

49
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:58,109
reading of the charges?

50
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,243
Yeah, fine.

51
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,578
Hang on. No.

52
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,097
My client does not waive
reading of the charges.

53
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:04,365
LEONARD:
Oh.

54
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:07,368
Cool. I've got
a lawyer.

55
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,621
And I've seen her naked.

56
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:12,406
(chuckles)

57
00:02:12,407 --> 00:02:13,974
Proceed.

58
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,576
Very well.

59
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,777
(clears throat)

60
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,079
"Count the first:

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,581
"On or about
the 28th day of April,

62
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,384
"the accused did knowingly
and with malice aforethought

63
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,352
"deny access

64
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,140
"in a time of emergency, to wit,
my back teeth were floating.

65
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,394
"Count the second:
the accused exceeded

66
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,696
"the agreed upon occupancy
of the shower,

67
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,365
"to wit, one,

68
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,234
by water-soluble aliens."

69
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,405
Can I see
the roommate agreement?

70
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:46,941
Um, it's fairly technical.

71
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,827
I think I can handle it.

72
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:53,581
Top of her class,
Cambridge University.

73
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,983
Licensed to practice law
in three countries

74
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,752
and your face.

75
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:05,459
All right,
based on a cursory reading,

76
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,145
it doesn't look like you have
much of a case, Sheldon.

77
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,065
Do so, do so.

78
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,850
Oh, I'm afraid not.

79
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,736
Section seven here, on
the right to enter the bathroom

80
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,105
in emergency situations,
is not specific

81
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,307
as to what constitutes
an emergency.

82
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:21,575
Oh, that's ridiculous!

83
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,878
A bathroom emergency
is self-explanatory.

84
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,947
Is it? If Leonard forgot
to trim his nose hair,

85
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:29,350
could he barge in
while you were showering?

86
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,836
Irrelevant. Leonard
doesn't trim his nose hair.

87
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,456
He thinks because he's short
nobody can see up there.

88
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,395
My point is, Sheldon,
the legal principle is,

89
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:44,598
ambiguity in a contract benefits
the party that did not draft it,

90
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,850
in this case, Leonard.

91
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,219
So much for count one.
But...

92
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,504
There's no buts, Sheldon;
that's how the law works.

93
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,223
Schooled!

94
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,562
As for the shower capacity
issue,

95
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,414
I cite addendum J.

96
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:02,917
"When Sheldon showers second,
any and all measures

97
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:05,903
shall be taken to ensure an
adequate supply of hot water."

98
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:09,023
I believe this supercedes
the occupancy issue.

99
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,092
Superceded!

100
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,698
This isn't over.

101
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,920
No offense, but
shower sex with you

102
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:25,439
is now the <i>second</i> best thing
that's happened today.

103
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,512
Mmm, Greek food
on pizza night?

104
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:34,148
This is the most delightfully
cruel thing we've done to Sheldon

105
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,283
since we left that fake message
from Stephen Hawking

106
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:37,952
on his voice mail.
(laughs)

107
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:40,053
Seriously?

108
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:43,524
(imitating mechanical voice):
I wish to discuss your theories
of black holes.

109
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:45,059
(laughter)

110
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,864
Meet me at the Randy's Donut
by the airport at 2:00 a.m.

111
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,169
What is that you're eating?

112
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,904
Tonight is pizza night.

113
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:00,174
I'd like to refer that
to my attorney.

114
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:03,143
According to what I see here,

115
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:05,245
Thursday nights
are Franconi's pizza night.

116
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:07,781
Yes, and when Franconi's
went out of business,

117
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:09,850
we switched to Graziano's.

118
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,135
That's interesting.

119
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:14,922
Can you just switch
restaurants like that, Priya?

120
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,225
A good question, Howard.

121
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,594
Turns out you can't.

122
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:21,929
According to
the document

123
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,797
you drew up, Sheldon,
the selection

124
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:26,233
of a new takeout restaurant
requires public hearings

125
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:28,319
and a 60-day comment period.

126
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,371
Were those criteria met?

127
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,013
No.

128
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,849
Opa! Opa!
Opa!

129
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:45,386
This is Greek food?

130
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,454
Leonard, you hate Greek food.

131
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:50,024
Not as much as you.

132
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:57,865
Fine. I'm nothing
if not adaptable.

133
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:02,102
I got you the
lamb kabob.

134
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:04,137
Thank you.

135
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,060
If you think about it,

136
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,796
Greek food isn't that far
from Italian food.

137
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:31,332
They share a spice palette.

138
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:40,190
And what a civilization
is the Greeks'!

139
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:49,183
They gave us science, democracy,

140
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:53,070
and little cubes of charred meat
that taste like sweat.

141
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,592
Penny? Penny?

142
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,127
Penny?

143
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,246
Hey. What's up?

144
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:06,166
The mean Indian lady tried
to make me eat lamb.

145
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:09,871
Congratulations.

146
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,436
Pizza night will now
be at your apartment.

147
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,207
Order one.

148
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,533
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

149
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm meeting Amy and
Bernadette for dinner.

150
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,312
But you're welcome
to tag along.

151
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,580
A girls' night?

152
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,648
Oh, I don't know
if I'm up for an evening

153
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,952
talking about rainbows,
unicorns and menstrual cramps.

154
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:27,271
Okay, suit yourself.

155
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,857
We'll probably be
trashing Priya a little.

156
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,526
Shotgun.

157
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,496
Okay, I'd like
to propose a toast

158
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,281
to a wonderful
girls' night out.

159
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,735
Fair warning--
we can get ca-razy.

160
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:45,806
Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars
and pretended to be dragons.

161
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,442
Really, Amy?

162
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:49,860
Tobacco and alcohol?

163
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:53,047
Need I remind you not a lot of
scientific discoveries were made

164
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:55,616
by people having a good time?

165
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,253
Why did you bring him?

166
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,954
He's harshing my buzz.

167
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:03,123
I felt sorry for him.

168
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,158
Priya's giving him a hard time.

169
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,662
Ooh, the Priya bashing's
starting early. Yay!

170
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:13,267
Okay, what's up
with those pantsuits?

171
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,102
I need some context.

172
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,403
Pantsuits suck.

173
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:17,838
And that opens her up

174
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,857
to justifiable ridicule
for wearing them.

175
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:21,308
Good one, Bernadette.

176
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,412
See? Ca-razy.

177
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:33,231
Whee...!

178
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:35,133
(laughing)

179
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,370
You smell like baby powder.

180
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:40,971
It's talc.

181
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:44,042
But as that's a primary
ingredient of baby powder,

182
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:46,511
I understand your confusion.

183
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:50,081
Oh, I'm not
confused at all.

184
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:53,284
You're like a sexy toddler.

185
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:57,121
I don't know
how to process that.

186
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,490
I do.

187
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:03,594
♪ Amy and Sheldon
sitting in a tree ♪

188
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:07,498
♪ K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G. ♪

189
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:10,601
That's too many S's
for "kissing."

190
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:13,905
Not if they're doing it
for a long time.

191
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:18,843
Sheldon... have you
ever kissed a girl?

192
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:22,563
Other than my mother,
my sister and my Mee-Maw, no.

193
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:24,315
But in the interest
of full disclosure,

194
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:26,150
I was once on a bus

195
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,252
and had to give
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

196
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:31,856
to an elderly nun who passed out
from heat exhaustion.

197
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,876
Every year I get
a Christmas card from her,

198
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:38,429
signed with far
too many X's and O's.

199
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,298
That doesn't count.

200
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,467
Aren't you even
a little curious?

201
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:46,337
Yeah, you're a scientist--
where is the curiosity?

202
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,906
I'm available
for experimentation.

203
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:54,212
Thank you.

204
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:55,413
Not necessary.

205
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:57,715
We know everything
there is to know about kissing.

206
00:09:57,716 --> 00:10:01,569
It requires 34 facial muscles
and 112 postural muscles.

207
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,754
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

208
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:04,822
Give me some sugar, bestie.

209
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,924
(laughs)

210
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:10,328
I'm certainly glad
no one said they were curious

211
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:13,448
about Aztec human sacrifice.

212
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:16,334
Hey, I know--
let's take Sheldon dancing.

213
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:18,536
Ooh, I totally want
to see Sheldon dance.

214
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:21,756
I bet he looks like
a spider on a hot plate.

215
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,009
No, thank you,
but for the record,

216
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,244
I'm an excellent dancer.

217
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:28,946
Proficient in the rumba,
waltz and cha-cha.

218
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,014
Really?

219
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,716
I don't see why
that's surprising.

220
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,434
I excel at so many things.

221
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,953
You've had my sourdough bread.

222
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,423
Did you take dance lessons?

223
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:39,791
Against my will.

224
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,893
In the South,
preadolescent children

225
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:44,362
are forced through
a process called cotillion,

226
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,731
which indoctrinates them
with all the social graces

227
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:51,569
and dance skills needed to
function in 18th century Vienna.

228
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,673
Oh, we are so
taking you dancing.

229
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:58,042
No, you most certainly are not.

230
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,711
Well, what does your cotillion
training say is expected

231
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,914
of a gentleman when three ladies
ask him

232
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:04,949
to escort them
to a dance soiree?

233
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,288
I saved a nun's life.

234
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,523
Why am I being punished?

235
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:18,696
(Sheldon grunts,
Penny squeals)

236
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:21,432
Take us someplace we can waltz.

237
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,667
Where you can what?

238
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:25,403
Waltz. It's a social dance
from Austria

239
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:28,439
choreographed
to a three-four time signature.

240
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,309
(hums "The Blue Danube")

241
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,378
(speaks Korean)

242
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,548
(dispatcher replies in Korean)

243
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,985
(speaks Korean,
hums "The Blue Danube")

244
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,689
Oh, waltz.

245
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,924
(dispatcher speaks Korean)

246
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:49,827
Here we go.

247
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:55,967
♪ I kissed a girl
and I liked it ♪

248
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,186
♪ I hope my boyfriend
don't mind... ♪

249
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,054
What happened to you?

250
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:06,010
(waltz playing)

251
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,293
Shake it baby,
shake it!

252
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:25,162
<i>Muy caliente,</i> Sheldon!

253
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:27,231
Care to dance?

254
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:30,051
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm engaged.

255
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:32,069
How about you?

256
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,339
Oh, what the hell.
(chuckles)

257
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,258
Ooh!

258
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,226
How come if we're
the smart people,

259
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:58,563
we don't do this
every night?

260
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:01,165
What's 16 times 14?

261
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,702
My burps taste
like cranberry juice.

262
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:09,173
And there's your answer.

263
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:12,076
Would you like to come in
for a nightcap?

264
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,911
If you're referring
to the beverage,

265
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:15,446
you know I don't drink.

266
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:16,948
If you're referring
to the hat you don

267
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:21,252
while wearing a nightshirt and
holding a candle, I have one.

268
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,621
I have Yoo-hoo.

269
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:26,123
It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo.

270
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,393
The name literally beckons.

271
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:34,665
Make yourself comfortable.

272
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,900
Thank you.

273
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,303
Is someone smoking?

274
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,238
Oh, that's just Ricky.

275
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:48,346
You own a smoking monkey?

276
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,298
Don't be silly.
He's one of the animals

277
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,450
in my department's
nicotine addiction study.

278
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:55,953
What's he doing here?

279
00:13:55,954 --> 00:13:57,254
I'm giving him emphysema.

280
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:00,424
The least I can do is let him
hang out and watch cable.

281
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,694
Remarkable.

282
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,731
Aren't you worried
about secondhand smoke?

283
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:09,133
A little.
The real danger is him biting

284
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:10,935
my face off while I'm sleeping.

285
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:17,325
(coughs)
Is he deliberately
blowing smoke at me?

286
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:20,411
Yeah. He's kind of an ass.

287
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:25,316
Thank you.

288
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:28,119
May I share
something with you

289
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,587
that's troubling me?

290
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:31,005
Of course.

291
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:33,090
What's rattling around that
big bulbous head of yours?

292
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,926
Priya has essentially nullified

293
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:37,828
my roommate agreement
with Leonard,

294
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,599
making life in the apartment
very uncomfortable for me.

295
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,969
And you want me
to kill her? Done.

296
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,837
No, of course not.

297
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:47,838
I trained Ricky how to smoke.

298
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,306
I can train him
to shoot a poison dart.

299
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:52,643
No jury would convict us
'cause people love monkeys.

300
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:55,479
I understand

301
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,715
the alcohol has stirred up
whatever it is

302
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,784
that makes girls go wild...

303
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:03,754
but I really need to talk
to smart Amy now.

304
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:04,889
(chattering)

305
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,824
Excuse me.

306
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,460
Have you considered
that your intelligence

307
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:13,714
might be the very thing
causing your dilemma?

308
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:19,704
No.

309
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,005
What do you think Ricky
over here would do

310
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:23,641
if an interloper
encroached on his territory?

311
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:28,479
Well, when challenged, monkeys
generally assert their dominance

312
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,884
through chasing, assault
and a stylized penile display.

313
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:36,320
That's a little outside
my comfort zone.

314
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,822
You're being too literal.

315
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:41,158
My point is, he would not meekly
surrender to the rules,

316
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,893
and neither should you.

317
00:15:42,894 --> 00:15:45,830
Are you suggesting I play dirty?

318
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,165
Yes, dirty.

319
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:52,603
Dirty... dirty... dirty.

320
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,875
Which brings me to our
next order of business.

321
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:04,482
Fascinating.

322
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:06,717
I hope you don't take
what I'm about to do

323
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:08,753
as a comment
on what we just did.

324
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:15,626
(Amy retching)

325
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:20,264
(retching continues)

326
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:26,337
Who's to say you shouldn't be
dissecting our brains?

327
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:30,458
You really are an ass.

328
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,409
(retching continues)

329
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,412
Morning, Sheldon.

330
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,131
Oh, good, you're up.

331
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:39,283
I've written a new
and improved

332
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,969
roommate agreement
that benefits me greatly.

333
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,004
I'd like you to sign it.

334
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,891
Why would I want
to do that?

335
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:48,659
Excellent question.

336
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,595
Do you remember
what happened to the alien,

337
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:54,348
played by talented character
actor Frank Gorshin,

338
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:58,469
in the <i>Star Trek</i> episode "Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield"?

339
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,406
Uh, Captain Kirk activated
the self-destruct sequence

340
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:04,642
and threatened to blow up
the <i>Enterprise</i>

341
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,877
and kill them both
unless he gave in?

342
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:08,145
Affirmative.

343
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:12,183
Computer, this is
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

344
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,651
(computer beeps)

345
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,686
Activate self-destruct sequence.

346
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:18,289
Code 1-1-A-2-B.

347
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,958
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Self-destruct sequence
activated.

348
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:26,997
What are you
gonna do, Sheldon,

349
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:28,399
blow up the apartment?

350
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,836
That was my first thought,
but all my cool stuff is here.

351
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:35,406
So what happens
when it counts down?

352
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,641
Unless Leonard signs
the new agreement

353
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:39,693
in the next 41 seconds,

354
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:43,647
this computer will send an
e-mail to your parents in India

355
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,883
saying that you're in
a secret relationship

356
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,235
with the
whiter-than-Marshmallow-Fluff

357
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:49,920
Leonard Hofstadter.

358
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:52,756
Oh, my God.

359
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:53,857
What's the big deal?

360
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:55,409
Trust me, it's a big deal.

361
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,527
They're gonna find out
about me eventually, right?

362
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,029
Yeah, of course,
just not today.

363
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,598
20 seconds.

364
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,765
Are you ashamed of me?

365
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:02,967
Of course not.

366
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,602
Then why can't we
tell your parents?

367
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:05,936
Please, don't push this.

368
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:08,172
He does that all the time,
doesn't he? 15.

369
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:10,241
Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win.
Turn it off.

370
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:11,308
No, he's bluffing.

371
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,644
I never bluff. Ten.
It's blackmail!

372
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:14,712
Nine.
We give up.

373
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,730
Eight.
This is ridiculous.

374
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,515
It's a laptop
with a full charge.

375
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,050
Honestly,
what do you see in him?

376
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:21,986
Give him what he wants
or we're done.

377
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:22,953
Three.
Really?

378
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,521
Two.
Okay, I'll sign it!

379
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:29,193
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Self-destruct sequence aborted.

380
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:34,365
You may have gone
to Cambridge,

381
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,418
but I'm an honorary graduate
of Starfleet Academy.

382
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,101
(Skype alert rings)

383
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:53,139
Good morning, Amy.

384
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,245
It most assuredly is not.

385
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:02,682
Are you experiencing
dehydration, headache,

386
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,852
nausea and shame?

387
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,720
Yes.

388
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:09,989
I also found a Korean man's
business card

389
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,392
tucked into my cleavage.

390
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:14,694
What happened last night?

391
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,596
Ah, memory impairment;

392
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:21,201
the free prize at the bottom
of every vodka bottle.

393
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,335
Sheldon?

394
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,470
All right.

395
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:27,073
Last night you gave me
some excellent advice

396
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:28,441
regarding my problem here
at home,

397
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:32,879
you kissed me and then vomited
on and off for 40 minutes,

398
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,683
following which you passed out
on your bathroom floor.

399
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,786
I then folded a towel under
your head as a pillow,

400
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,721
set your oven clock
to the correct time

401
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,190
because it was
driving me crazy...

402
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,693
...and I left.

403
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:49,863
Okay.

404
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:53,466
Don't really know
where we go from here.

405
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,136
I suggest
we treat our relationship

406
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:58,304
as if it were
a crashed computer

407
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:01,908
and restore it to the last point
we both agree it worked.

408
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,277
Terrific. Thank you.

409
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:05,845
(monkey chittering)

410
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,580
They were out of menthols!

411
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,382
Get off my back!

412
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,722
Not easy living with a
temperamental little primate.

413
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:18,158
LEONARD:
Come on, Priya,
just admit I embarrass you!

414
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,459
You're preaching
to the choir, sister.
