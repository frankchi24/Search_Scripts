1
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:48,901
The island of Manhattan
is a cozy village...

2
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:52,567
populated by more than seven million
fascinating individuals...

3
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:55,042
who all behave like they own
the sidewalk.

4
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:58,205
But lately it seemed
as if the entire city...

5
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:01,216
had been magically reduced
to only two people...

6
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:02,512
us.

7
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:06,022
Four-hour conversations flew by
in a space of 15 minutes...

8
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:08,182
and a few days apart
felt like weeks.

9
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:10,385
I realize that Einstein's
Law of Relativity...

10
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,520
would have to be amended
to include a special set of rules...

11
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:17,124
those to explain
the peculiar effects of infatuation.

12
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:20,329
- Hello?
- Hi.

13
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:23,702
I'm trying to get a hold of
a Miss Carrie Bradshaw.

14
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,105
- She used to be a friend of mine.
- Good morning.

15
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:29,168
Wait. I think I recognize that voice.

16
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:31,942
I can't believe it's been so long.
I've been meaning to call you.

17
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:34,210
- I've just been...
- Fucking your brains out?

18
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,514
That's the least of it.
You know what?

19
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:40,317
I don't think that I have been
hit this hard since...

20
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,417
I won't compare it to anything, because
everything else has always ended.

21
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:46,394
Will I get to see you sometime?

22
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:47,930
Absolutely. How about tonight?

23
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:51,263
- Tonight will work.
- I'll call Charlotte and Samantha...

24
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:55,327
see if they're free, 'cause Big's got
this dinner thing, so we had no plans.

25
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:56,895
God, would you listen to yourself?

26
00:01:56,973 --> 00:02:00,670
Yeah, I know. I've become
one of those women we hate.

27
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:03,804
Yes, you have. I can't talk now.
I'll call you later. Okay?

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,211
All right. Bye.

29
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:08,774
As I hung up, I realized
I'd committed the cardinal sin...

30
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:12,015
I'd forsaken my girlfriends
for my new boyfriend.

31
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:15,652
That night I faced the tribunal.

32
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,249
We really weren't that concerned.

33
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:20,125
Just completely hurt and offended.

34
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,460
Actually, you missed a lot.

35
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,261
I know. I am trying...

36
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:27,826
Miranda had worked on
a big successful merger.

37
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:31,738
Samantha was obsessed with the idea
of a new apartment.

38
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,435
And Charlotte...

39
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,411
Charlotte was practically engaged.

40
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,277
They met the day after
I dropped off the edge of the earth.

41
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,512
His name was Michael Conway.
He was from a good New York family...

42
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,951
and he absolutely adored Charlotte.

43
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,989
I think this might be it.
I think this might be the one.

44
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,459
We've met him.
He's perfect.

45
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:53,553
Even his fucking dog is perfect.

46
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57,327
But there is one thing.

47
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:01,093
Last night after Michael took Charlotte
to the Philharmonic...

48
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:05,699
they went back to his place
and began the classic dating ritual...

49
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,709
the blow job tug of war.

50
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:20,585
- Come on.
- Not tonight.

51
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:23,717
When?

52
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:25,021
Sometime.

53
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:27,256
The truth is...

54
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,025
I hate doing it.

55
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,033
Honey, you can't be serious.

56
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:33,092
Are you telling us
you never perform this act?

57
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,070
She'll juggle, she'll spin plates,
but she won't give head.

58
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,631
I don't like putting it in my mouth.
I have a very sensitive gag reflex...

59
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,370
and it makes me wanna puke.

60
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:44,038
- That's one way to say no.
- It's not like I haven't tried.

61
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:46,582
I practiced on a banana.

62
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:49,777
I pretended it was a popsicle,
but I just don't like it.

63
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:53,254
Personally, I'm loving it up to the
point where the guy wants me to swallow.

64
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:54,915
That's just a judgment call.

65
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:57,459
Some men just take it
so personally if you don't.

66
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,757
Some guys don't give you a choice.

67
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,627
- That's just bad behavior.
- You honestly like it?

68
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,692
It's not my favorite thing on the menu,
but I'll order it from time to time...

69
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,863
and with the right guy...

70
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,132
it can be nice.

71
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:15,473
Oral sex is God's gift to women. You can
get off without a worry of pregnancy.

72
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:17,445
Plus, the sense of power
is such a turn-on.

73
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:20,574
Maybe you're on your knees,
but you got 'em by the balls.

74
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,019
Now, you see, that is the reason
that I don't wanna go down this road.

75
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:28,148
Sweetheart, if you're gonna get
all choked up about it...

76
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,919
just don't do it.

77
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:33,087
But if you don't go down on him,
how do you expect him to go down on you?

78
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:34,596
I don't.

79
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:37,098
Oh, well, forget it!

80
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,328
- I only give head to get head.
- Me too.

81
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,906
A few hours and a couple of bottles
of Pinot Grigio later...

82
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:50,343
and vows of friendship renewed,
we were almost out the door when...

83
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:53,177
Hey, isn't that Mr. Big?

84
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:57,446
Oh, I'm gonna go over and say hi.

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,988
Ditching us now
would be really bad form.

86
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:01,785
I'm not gonna ditch you.

87
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,426
Surprise.

88
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:10,625
Hey, Carrie.
How are you?

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,033
Good. Good. I was just here
with my posse having dinner...

90
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,161
and I saw you.

91
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,068
Carrie, this is Julia Woods.
Julia, Carrie Bradshaw.

92
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:24,045
- Let's go.
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:28,947
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

94
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:29,950
Excuse me.

95
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,251
Are you on a date?

96
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,054
Sort of.

97
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:40,485
I thought you said you had
a business thing tonight.

98
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:42,793
I said a "dinner thing."

99
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:46,427
She's stunning. And I should know,
because, frankly, she stunned me.

100
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:48,596
Well, enjoy your dinner.

101
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,798
Are you okay?

102
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,502
Sure. I was just...

103
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:56,340
I just didn't realize
you were dating other women.

104
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,141
Not a lot of other women.

105
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,881
- Why don't we talk about this Saturday?
- Sure, sure, sure.

106
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:04,852
So, then, enjoy your dinner.

107
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:07,151
I already said that.
Well, enjoy it twice.

108
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:08,520
Here we go.

109
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:15,624
I can't believe it.
He's seeing other women.

110
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,290
Prick.

111
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:21,929
True, we had never
discussed exclusivity.

112
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,565
But while for me the idea of
seeing another man would be like...

113
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:28,202
trying to fit another outfit
into an already overstuffed suitcase...

114
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:30,337
Big was happily dating another woman...

115
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:33,007
like it was the most natural thing
in the world.

116
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:36,108
Is it that men have an innate aversion
to monogamy...

117
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,119
or is it more than that?

118
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:39,814
I wondered.

119
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,256
In a city like New York
with its infinite possibilities...

120
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:46,557
has monogamy become
too much to expect?

121
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,757
I've been involved in a monogamous
relationship for over a year now.

122
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:52,130
It's been wonderfully fulfilling.

123
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:55,898
Of course, my definition of monogamy
includes sex with prostitutes.

124
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:59,931
The problem with monogamy,
it's just so incredibly dull.

125
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,239
My lover and I have a kind of
'90s monogamy.

126
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:06,408
We have sex with other people, but we
don't exchange fluids or phone numbers.

127
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,140
Hello.

128
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:12,779
Monogamy is fabulous. It gives you
a deep and profound connection...

129
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:16,188
to another human being and you don't
have to shave your legs as much.

130
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:19,361
Of course, I'm monogamous.

131
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:21,226
Why? What have you heard?

132
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:24,560
This is the C-line.
This is the best in the building.

133
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:27,467
Have you ever seen any place like this?
Is this to die?

134
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,402
It's nice.

135
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:31,167
Hold this.

136
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,832
Just a second.

137
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:37,337
Excuse me. Excuse me.

138
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,347
Was someone looking for a view?

139
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,940
Pamela, it's beautiful,
but it's a little out of my price...

140
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,213
I know, I know, so sue me.

141
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:46,278
I just love to show
the crème de la crème.

142
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:48,347
I will break my ass for you,
sweetheart.

143
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,949
I just wanna ask you
for one small favor in return.

144
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,289
My first born?

145
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:57,794
No, sweetheart.
I don't even want my own kids.

146
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,267
Promise me that you won't work
with any other broker.

147
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:02,099
Of course.

148
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,605
Samantha didn't believe in monogamy...

149
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:07,108
especially when it came
to real estate agents.

150
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:10,771
This is a prewar 6.
Notice the classic lines.

151
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:12,508
Very solidly built.

152
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:15,676
Although Pamela had
the hottest contacts in town...

153
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:18,721
Rick did have a slight
competitive edge.

154
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:22,383
He gave Samantha the opportunity
to combine her two greatest loves...

155
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,585
sex and real estate.

156
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,653
That afternoon I dragged
my poor tortured soul...

157
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,823
out to lunch with Stanford Blatch...

158
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,891
and attempted to stun it senseless
with cosmopolitans.

159
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,460
Monogamy is on the way out again.

160
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:39,634
It had a brief comeback in the 90s,
but as the millennium approaches...

161
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,973
everyone's leaving
their options open.

162
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:44,343
You wouldn't commit
to a nice guy given the option?

163
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,712
I can't even commit
to a long distance carrier.

164
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,411
You know what you are?
You're a whore.

165
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:51,680
I wish that were true.

166
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:55,115
Jared, how are you?

167
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:57,523
My book just got a kick-ass review
in Entertainment Weekly.

168
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:58,651
How marvelous.

169
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:01,720
Jared, have you met Carrie Bradshaw?

170
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:04,824
No, but I've read your column.
Nice shit.

171
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,061
Thanks.

172
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,797
You should write about me.
My life is so fucked up right now.

173
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:12,329
Carrie, Jared is the writer
of the book Avenue B.

174
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:16,037
And New York magazine just named him
one of the 30 coolest people...

175
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:17,773
under 30 in the city.

176
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:19,872
Wow. What an honor.

177
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:22,213
If they were doing
the 30 sexiest women under 30...

178
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,253
I'm sure you'd go
right to the top of the list.

179
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,015
You're quite the storyteller.

180
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:27,986
That's no lie.

181
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:30,719
The magazine's throwing us a party
tomorrow night at Luna.

182
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:33,284
- I'll put your names at the door.
- Thanks.

183
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,956
- So you'll be there?
- I'll do my best.

184
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:37,556
Groovy.

185
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,875
What was happening to me?
I used to get a secret rush...

186
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:50,037
from men who hit on me
during their 15 minutes of fame.

187
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:53,412
In this case,
it merely felt exhausting.

188
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:07,390
I'm just calling to confirm
tomorrow night. Are we still on?

189
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:10,091
Yeah, of course we are.
Why wouldn't we be?

190
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,569
I was striving for noncommittal, but I
was worried I had bordered on shrill.

191
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:15,763
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

192
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:18,731
Yeah, 8:00's fine.

193
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,874
I miss you, baby.

194
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:23,743
Yeah, me too.

195
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:27,374
There were so many questions I wanted
him to answer, but would not ask.

196
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,213
Not tonight at least. Nope.

197
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:31,549
Tonight I would ask Miranda.

198
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,111
He said, "I miss you, baby."

199
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:36,590
Do you think that was meant to be
some kind of coded mea culpa?

200
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:40,118
You mean like what he really meant was,
"I've been a complete idiot.

201
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,289
Please forgive me for having dinner
with that other woman"?

202
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:44,424
- Exactly.
- Could be.

203
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,798
No, 'cause that would mean
everything he ever said...

204
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,463
that I interpreted as sincere
is subject to interpretation.

205
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:52,235
In that case, what I perceive
as his feelings for me may only be...

206
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:55,243
reflected projections
of my feelings for him.

207
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:56,471
What?

208
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,246
Oh, God. I'm freaking.
I got to stop.

209
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:07,955
Hey, you guys. Great to see you.
What are you up to?

210
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,150
Just hanging.

211
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:12,820
Allison, this is Miranda and Carrie.
Miranda and Carrie, this is Allison.

212
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:16,092
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

213
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:20,261
Me too. We're all such big fans
of your column over at Vogue.

214
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,930
- You work at Vogue?
- Designer relations.

215
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:25,769
Skipper and I just had
the most incredible meal.

216
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:27,776
This little hole in the wall.

217
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:30,642
This darling French bistro
that I am telling you...

218
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:34,012
I lived a year in Paris
and never ate so well, and cheap.

219
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,175
Really?

220
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:38,049
Go quick before the Times
destroys it with a rave.

221
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,953
- It was great to see you guys.
- Great meeting you.

222
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:43,048
- You too.
- Good night.

223
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,924
Who was that self-important bitch?

224
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,294
I think that was
Skipper's new girlfriend.

225
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:51,299
She seemed all right.

226
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,234
I didn't think that was his type.

227
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:57,898
That's true. You're his type,
but you broke up with him, remember?

228
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:00,238
Something looks different.

229
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,039
Has he been working out?

230
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:21,587
Hey, Skipper here.
Leave me a message.

231
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:24,531
Hi, Skipper, it's Miranda.

232
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,797
I just wanted to say
it was great running into you today.

233
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,928
And...

234
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,438
you looked great.

235
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:33,475
Did you do something different
to your hair?

236
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,975
Hello, Miranda.

237
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,809
I can't talk right now.

238
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:42,408
That's okay.
I just wanted to say...

239
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,386
maybe, you know, I thought
we could have dinner some night.

240
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:46,785
Seriously?

241
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:49,256
I miss you.

242
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:52,085
I'll call you later.

243
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:55,593
Is everything okay?

244
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:58,259
Allison, I think you're great...

245
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:02,333
but I've gotta be
totally honest with you.

246
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:06,774
The woman who I think I love
just called and asked me back.

247
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:12,271
You're breaking up with me
while you're still inside of me?

248
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:16,774
As Skipper rededicated his
singular affection for Miranda...

249
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:19,753
Charlotte was receiving
her own declaration of monogamy.

250
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:24,259
What do you think about
not seeing anyone else but each other?

251
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:26,795
- Really?
- Yeah.

252
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:28,853
That might be a good idea.

253
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,866
I think it's the best idea
I ever had in my life.

254
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:34,960
Well, in that case,
absolutely.

255
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:38,899
And while Charlotte
embraced fidelity...

256
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:41,603
and Samantha flaunted
her infidelity...

257
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:46,507
I found myself caught somewhere
in between.

258
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:49,278
So, whose very crowded apartment
are we in?

259
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:52,378
Max. He's an old friend of mine.
Remember, Becky's his second wife.

260
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:55,913
- She's a doll. You'll love her.
- Hey, there, stranger.

261
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:57,289
Melissa.

262
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,157
This is Carrie Bradshaw.

263
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:02,493
- Hi. Love your column. Never miss it.
- Wow. Thanks.

264
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:06,331
I've been trying to call you.
You still have my passport.

265
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,802
She's a friend
I once traveled with.

266
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,841
Internationally, I would imagine.

267
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,374
Let's find Max.

268
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,219
Excuse me.

269
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,221
Glad you could make it.
How are you?

270
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,281
I want you to meet someone
very special.

271
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,958
Julia.

272
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,792
Actually, it's Carrie.

273
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,791
Carrie. Well, welcome.

274
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,597
Carrie writes this fantastic column
in the New York Star.

275
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:43,467
It's called "Sex and the City."

276
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:46,599
If you're looking for material,
you're dating the right man.

277
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:48,575
Thank you, Max.

278
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:50,271
Thank you very much.

279
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:53,315
Are we dating? I thought
we were just sleeping together.

280
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:56,943
Well, I'm sure after tonight
we won't be doing much of either.

281
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,646
Excuse me.

282
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,655
I'll be right back.

283
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,018
You've got to be kidding.

284
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:07,653
How many women are you dating?

285
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,459
In the tristate area?

286
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:12,831
Let's see, there's me, Julia...

287
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:15,564
and let's not forget
"International Melissa."

288
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:18,505
- I'm not doing this here.
- Fine.

289
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:20,599
Can't we just enjoy the party?

290
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,610
I don't know.

291
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:27,207
Come on. I mean,
what do you want from me?

292
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,046
What do I want from you?

293
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,479
Nothing.

294
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:36,752
I don't want anything from you.

295
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,760
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:42,491
I felt like a fool. I had gone so far
out on a limb with my feelings...

297
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:45,557
that I didn't realize
I was standing out there alone.

298
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:51,038
When life gets this confusing,
sometimes there's only one thing to do...

299
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,098
attend a fabulous party.

300
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:01,482
Hey, Stanford.

301
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,883
Carrie! What a surprise.

302
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,717
- Where's...
- Don't ask.

303
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:08,120
What happened?

304
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,920
- He became predictable.
- How predictable.

305
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:13,791
- Hey, you made it.
- Hey, Jared.

306
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:17,663
- I'll get you a drink.
- Cosmopolitan. Thanks.

307
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:21,169
In a room where everyone was gorgeous,
cool and under 30...

308
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:24,604
monogamy suddenly began to seem
like a quaint notion.

309
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,407
That was, like, so great.

310
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:32,840
Don't you just wanna
lie like this forever?

311
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,179
Well, for a few minutes anyway.

312
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:38,083
I missed you.

313
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:41,089
I want you to know that that
other woman doesn't mean a thing to me.

314
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:44,490
That's all right.
I don't mind if you keep seeing her.

315
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,394
Oh, God, no. I broke up with her
the second that you called.

316
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,929
Skipper, you didn't
have to do that.

317
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,195
Of course I did.

318
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,261
I was so happy to hear from you,
that we were still doing it...

319
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,671
while I was talking to you
and I didn't even realize it.

320
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:01,403
You're kidding, right?

321
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:03,274
No. Isn't that crazy?

322
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:07,008
Yeah, that's exactly what it is,
crazy.

323
00:17:07,082 --> 00:17:08,640
Listen, Skipper...

324
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:12,175
I'm not ready for a full-blown
relationship thing.

325
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:14,287
What?

326
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:18,486
I mean, we can see each other
and still see other people.

327
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,960
Right?

328
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,792
No, we can't.

329
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:23,263
At least I can't.

330
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,130
Why did you call me back anyway?

331
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,831
I'm sorry. I thought...

332
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:34,205
I'm not your private stud horse,
Miss Dial A Fuck.

333
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,376
Come here.
Come back.

334
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,380
I'm tired of being jerked around.

335
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:42,417
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

336
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:47,354
While Miranda misjudged
the intensity of Skipper's feelings...

337
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:50,483
Michael left Charlotte
no doubt about his.

338
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,550
You're amazing.

339
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:55,654
You've got everything
I'm looking for...

340
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:58,825
and I've never found before
in one woman...

341
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,495
brains, taste, class...

342
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:08,972
and you're very, very sexy.

343
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,636
Thank you.

344
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:27,923
What's the problem?

345
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:29,464
I hate doing it.

346
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,826
You hate giving blow jobs?

347
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:36,765
It's not that big of a deal,
is it?

348
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,774
Well, sort of.

349
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,969
Can't you just do it for me?

350
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:45,138
Would you really want me
to do something I didn't wanna do?

351
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:47,409
You'll get used to it.

352
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:51,353
No, I won't.

353
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,082
I never have.
Sorry.

354
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:58,684
Well, I plan on getting a lot
of blow jobs in the future...

355
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:00,854
and I'm hoping that you're around
when I get them.

356
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,261
What's that supposed to mean?

357
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,823
It means I'll have to find them
somewhere else.

358
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,804
You're telling me...

359
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:12,534
that you would give up a woman
who really cares for you...

360
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,941
who would share your hopes
and your fears and your dreams...

361
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:18,479
the future possible mother
of your children...

362
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:20,208
all for a blow job?

363
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,544
You're right.

364
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:27,782
Will you at least
lick my balls?

365
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,084
Good-bye, Michael.

366
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:35,625
Michael was upset,
but Butterscotch seemed pleased.

367
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:39,190
She was finally back
in her monogamous relationship.

368
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:43,265
Half-past midnight
in a city that never sleeps...

369
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:45,637
neither did the real estate market.

370
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,505
It's beautiful.

371
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:48,975
Isn't it?

372
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:50,978
It went on the market at midnight...

373
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:53,810
and you're the first one to see it.

374
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:56,146
Two bedrooms, prewar...

375
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:58,448
fireplace and views.

376
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,181
Everything you wanted.

377
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:03,281
I love it.
I really love it.

378
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,587
I knew you would.

379
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,321
Let's celebrate.

380
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:34,582
Oh, my God!

381
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:37,853
I can't believe that you are working
with another broker.

382
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:41,089
I can't believe you weren't
gonna show me this apartment.

383
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,068
2:00 a.m. And I already had
a new man in my life.

384
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:57,510
You know the greatest thing
about writing a successful book?

385
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,570
Besides the validation and acclaim.

386
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:02,617
Knowing that I'm pumping my ideas
into the world.

387
00:21:02,684 --> 00:21:05,414
I thought it was the fact that you
could behave like an utter asshole...

388
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:07,819
and people would find you amusing.

389
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,654
I'm, like, in love with you,
you know that?

390
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:13,354
I'm, like,
fucking in love with you.

391
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:17,354
Will you go home with me tonight?

392
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,135
Give me a minute.
I just have to make a call.

393
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,104
I just wanted to let you know
I'm at this very cool party...

394
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,207
for very cool people under 30 and this
very cool writer wants to take me home.

395
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:38,481
- What? What the hell happened to you?
- His name is Jared.

396
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:42,422
He's really cute
and really successful...

397
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,984
and he just put his arms
around me.

398
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,552
Here. Say hello, Jared.

399
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,360
- Hello, Jared.
- That was Jared.

400
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:53,663
Carrie, just get over here.

401
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:54,929
You get over here.

402
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:57,494
I can't.
I don't know where you are.

403
00:21:57,573 --> 00:22:01,669
I am the Luna Park Cafe. Meet me
out front. Your name's not on the list.

404
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:05,913
Forty-five minutes later...

405
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:09,075
I realized I was alone in a park
at 3:00 a. M...

406
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:11,642
and that it was time
to call it a night.

407
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:15,952
What are you doing back here?
You said to meet out front.

408
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:17,753
This is the front.

409
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:21,353
This isn't the front.
This is the back.

410
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,263
I've been waiting out front
for 30 goddamn minutes.

411
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:29,069
You see those doors? That's the front.
You were waiting at the street entrance.

412
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:31,697
The street entrance
is the front entrance.

413
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:33,707
Depending on where
you're coming from.

414
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:41,748
I'm here.
Now, what's going on?

415
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:47,345
I've done the merry-go-round.
I've been through the revolving door.

416
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:51,916
I feel like I met somebody I can
stand still with for a minute and...

417
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,022
Don't you wanna stand still
with me?

418
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:03,230
You drag me out here at 3:00 a.m. To
ask me if I wanna stand still with you?

419
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,981
In a city of infinite options...

420
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:25,186
sometimes there's no better feeling
than knowing you only have one.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
