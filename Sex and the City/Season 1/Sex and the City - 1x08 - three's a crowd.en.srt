1
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:51,638
Once upon a time
in a magical land called Manhattan...

2
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,835
a young woman fell in love.

3
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,612
Charlotte and Jack locked eyes at
a black-tie benefit for Epstein-Barr.

4
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:07,879
She chased him through every disease
in New York.

5
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:12,019
They've been officially dating
since retinitis pigmentosis.

6
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,321
Jack was perfect for her.

7
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:19,494
Architect, philanthropist
and the sex was amazing.

8
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:24,966
Late one night,
Jack popped the inevitable question.

9
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,474
So...

10
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:29,478
what are your fantasies?

11
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:34,745
God, I'd love to own
my own gallery...

12
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:36,843
and maybe a little cottage in Maine.

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,254
Actually, I meant more like
screwing in an airplane bathroom...

14
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:43,053
kind of fantasies.

15
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:47,589
The closest Charlotte had ever come
to getting screwed on a plane...

16
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:51,065
was the time she lost all her luggage
on a flight to Palm Beach.

17
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:53,534
Well...

18
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:57,403
I've always wanted to do it
in my parents' bed.

19
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,704
Wild. I like it.

20
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,266
What about you?

21
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,507
You, me and another woman.

22
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,681
Come on!

23
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,547
I'm serious.

24
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:12,554
Charlotte, you have no idea
how sexy you are, do you?

25
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:15,284
The idea of you touching
another woman...

26
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:19,418
God, it makes me hard
just thinking about it.

27
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,963
Wow.

28
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,038
Jack wants us to do a threesome.

29
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,942
Of course he does.
Every guy does.

30
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,103
Threesomes are huge right now.
They're the blow job of the '90s.

31
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:39,046
- What was the blow job of the '80s?
- Anal sex.

32
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:41,583
- Any sex, period.
- Don't let him pressure you into it.

33
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:44,643
It's just this guy's cheap ploy
to watch you be a lesbian for a night.

34
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:48,157
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
- I had a threesome once, I think.

35
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:51,318
In college. I was drunk.
I woke up in someone else's bra.

36
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:54,124
The only way to do a threesome
is to be the guest star.

37
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:56,165
- The guest star?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:59,065
The girl the couple gets to come in,
screw and leave.

39
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,126
- The pinch hitter.
- Exactly.

40
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:05,766
Perfect. Great sex without wondering
what it will do to your relationship.

41
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:09,505
- But you don't have relationships.
- Which is why I have great sex.

42
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:12,673
- I've never done a threesome.
- Because you have relationships.

43
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,149
I've never done a threesome.

44
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:18,517
Of course you haven't. You in a
threesome? You won't even wear a thong.

45
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:21,716
- Jack thinks I'm sexy.
- He's buttering you up.

46
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,852
You start thinking you're hot,
then he brings up the threesome thing.

47
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:29,057
Boom! Suddenly you're kissing
another woman while he beats off.

48
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,360
Please!

49
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,924
Just make sure the other woman
isn't a friend.

50
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:36,130
Use somebody random,
somebody you meet in a bar or something.

51
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:38,572
- That's romantic.
- No.

52
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:43,578
I think I'd feel safer with a friend,
with someone I could trust. Like Carrie.

53
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:46,479
Gee, I'm flattered.

54
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,451
But I'd go with someone who has
a little more experience, like Sam.

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,953
Well, thanks.

56
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:56,458
But there is something sexy
about a first-timer like Charlotte.

57
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:59,290
- Really?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:03,993
Great. No, forget about me.

59
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:08,036
- Come on.
- I'd do it with you guys.

60
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:11,904
It's like picking teams
for dodgeball all over again.

61
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,068
Was Samantha right?

62
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:17,079
Were threesomes
the new sexual frontier?

63
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:22,710
No question.
Guys were infatuated with threesomes.

64
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:26,244
And when I started looking,
they were everywhere.

65
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:29,382
After all, our lives
are built on threesomes.

66
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,484
Fat, low-fat, nonfat.

67
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:35,122
First, business, economy.
Moe, Larry, Curly.

68
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:38,690
Maybe we were never meant to do it
with only one other person.

69
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:42,226
Maybe threesomes were
the relationship of the future.

70
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:46,436
Meanwhile, Samantha had been busy
guest-starring in a show...

71
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:49,478
I like to call
"Sam Does the Married Guy."

72
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,480
I love that you're not my wife.

73
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:53,675
I love that, too.

74
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,742
I mean, that thing you do
with your hips!

75
00:04:57,887 --> 00:05:00,378
Ruth won't even get on top.

76
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:02,925
Ken was 37, a wine importer...

77
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:06,723
unhappily married to a woman
who designed modular office furniture.

78
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:09,788
This affair was the most exciting thing
that had happened to him...

79
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,857
since the '94 Montrachet.

80
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:17,863
Five hours later,
Charlotte's night was just beginning.

81
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,910
She and Jack had just had
another fantastic date...

82
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,740
dancing for dyslexia.

83
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,178
So, what do you think of her?

84
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:28,979
- Is she hot?
- Jack!

85
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,485
You're right.

86
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,881
Maybe she's more your taste.

87
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:36,892
- Stop it.
- Have a light?

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,484
Sorry, I don't smoke.

89
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,426
That's a shame.

90
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,768
Did you see that?
She was flirting with us.

91
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,737
I think she was flirting with you.

92
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:53,537
You are such a turn on,
and you have no idea.

93
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,603
You're giving off this sexual energy
all the time.

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,478
A vibe like you've got
a fire inside of you.

95
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,881
She'd be crazy not to be in to you.

96
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:08,151
Who knows whether it was her vodka
or her vibe...

97
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,920
but Charlotte suddenly did feel
a little warm.

98
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,326
I think she put her hand on my leg.

99
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:16,126
Should I ask her to join us?

100
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:24,170
That night she had
an eye-opening experience.

101
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,037
Charlotte hadn't been that excited since
she tried on her cheerleading uniform.

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,631
What do you think
your dream meant?

103
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,237
I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam
and Carrie and they won't play with me.

104
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:06,907
Please. It's obvious.

105
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:09,884
Across town, Miranda was dealing
with her own nightmare.

106
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:13,411
I know it's juvenile, but it bothers me.
I'm attractive, smart. Right?

107
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,423
Plenty of people should want me
for a threesome.

108
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:20,190
So you're saying you're attracted
to your girlfriends.

109
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:24,029
No! But if your friends
won't go down on you, who will?

110
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,727
That's some dream.

111
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:28,327
It was so real.
I can't stop thinking about it.

112
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,565
- And I think I enjoyed it.
- That's great.

113
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,837
Dreams are a good way to experiment.

114
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,344
It's like buying a dress
and keeping the tags on.

115
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:39,939
Do you think it means I should do it?
Have a threesome?

116
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,507
Jack says that I have a fire
inside me.

117
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:44,519
Tell him they make a cream for that.

118
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,145
I'm serious.

119
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:49,658
It's your call, but don't do it
just to make Jack happy.

120
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:51,660
Maybe it would bring us closer.

121
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:55,630
Isn't it weird that you're thinking of
sleeping with someone you don't know...

122
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:58,565
to get closer to Jack?

123
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:01,160
How well do we ever know
the people we sleep with?

124
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,171
That was the thing about Charlotte.

125
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,107
Just as you were about to write her off
as a Park Avenue Pollyanna...

126
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:10,577
she'd say something so right on,
you'd think she was the Dalai Lama.

127
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:13,445
Is my hair too shiny today?

128
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:18,954
And then, she'd say something else.
But the bigger question remained.

129
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:22,583
If Charlotte was actually considering
a threesome, who wasn't?

130
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,287
The Village Voice had more ads
looking for threesomes...

131
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:28,956
than it did for small, rat-infested
studios running at $1000 a month.

132
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:31,933
But who actually answered these ads?

133
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:34,401
Wall Street honcho seeks
two horny gal pals...

134
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,904
for an East Hampton fuck-fest
at my summer home.

135
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,406
No fatties, please.

136
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:44,071
Sweet, suburban school teacher seeks two
men to fulfill her wildest fantasies.

137
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:48,846
You be black or hispanic,
I'll be on time.

138
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:51,478
I need your dick now.

139
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,488
X-Files fanatic twosome...

140
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,753
seeks Scully look-alike
for abduction fantasy.

141
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,919
Me, gorgeous with big boobs.

142
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:01,020
You, a couple with class.

143
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:03,691
Let's experience everything
the city has to offer.

144
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:07,566
I'm into museums, blow jobs,
theater...

145
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:10,128
and golden showers.

146
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,902
I seem to be the only person
in New York...

147
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:15,569
who still believed
in the one-on-one relationship.

148
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:17,613
Mr. Big and I
were actually doing sleep-overs.

149
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,113
Which one?

150
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,016
This one.

151
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:31,550
You better be careful.
I could get used to this.

152
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,994
Why is it that putting a tie
around a man's neck...

153
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:37,555
is sometimes even sexier
than taking it off?

154
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,624
What are you doing for lunch today?

155
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:42,364
I could maybe swing an hour
between meetings.

156
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:46,636
No. Sorry, I can't.

157
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,735
- I have to interview someone.
- About what?

158
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:52,804
Threesomes.
Ever go to one?

159
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:55,077
Sure. Who hasn't?

160
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:58,814
Really. With who?

161
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,049
My ex-wife.

162
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:04,457
Suddenly my column
was the last thing on my mind.

163
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,960
You were married?

164
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:10,158
Yeah. I thought I told you.

165
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,858
No, you didn't.

166
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,131
An ex-wife. That's a new twist.

167
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:19,504
And they had wild sex. Threesomes.
We don't have wild sex.

168
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:23,375
We used to, but now we have sweet sex.
Wild always beats out sweet.

169
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:27,780
- But he's not with her anymore.
- Because they stopped having wild sex.

170
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,613
That's why Ken's fucking me.

171
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:32,415
- His wife won't give him a blow job.
- Should that make me feel better?

172
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:35,480
He's never going to leave his wife
for you. They never do.

173
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:39,289
Thank God. Who needs the trouble?
This is ideal. No muss, no fuss.

174
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,296
Sounds like you're selling
toilet bowl cleaner.

175
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:44,197
Does this color turn you on?

176
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:46,599
You had to hand it to Miranda.
She was determined.

177
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,364
It's a little orange.

178
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,837
There's only one thing left to do.

179
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:52,875
What? Leave him before he leaves me?

180
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:55,410
You kidding?
Check out the ex.

181
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:03,743
Charlotte was right. We don't
really know the people we sleep with.

182
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,755
After all, what did I really know
about Mr. Big?

183
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:10,759
Except he had an ex-wife named Barbara,
who, I discovered, worked in publishing.

184
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,590
My plan was simple.

185
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:16,462
I'd pitch her a steamy, bodice-ripping
paperback which she'd probably reject...

186
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,625
but at least I'd get five minutes
face-to-face with her.

187
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,396
Carrie?

188
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,663
Come right in.
Barbara's ready for you.

189
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:27,904
Thanks. Bye.

190
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:31,435
Carrie Bradshaw.
I am so excited.

191
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:34,677
Sit down.
I'm a huge fan of your work.

192
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,775
Good taste and beautiful.
Could it get worse?

193
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:41,654
Oh. Special Olympics chairwoman.

194
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:44,022
Sorry. I haven't hung it yet.

195
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:46,288
So, I'm dying to hear your pitch.

196
00:11:46,362 --> 00:11:49,729
I never knew you were interested
in writing children's books.

197
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,758
Well, who doesn't love
children's books?

198
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,805
Five minutes of bodice-ripping material
out the window.

199
00:11:56,873 --> 00:12:01,606
So I did what any writer would do.
I pulled an idea out of my ass.

200
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:06,307
Well, my story is about
a little girl...

201
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,786
named Cathy,
Little Cathy.

202
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:13,287
What makes Little Cathy special?

203
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:18,487
Well, she's got
these magic...

204
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:20,659
cigarettes.

205
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,097
- She has magic cigarettes?
- Yes.

206
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,930
Little Cathy and her magic cigarettes.

207
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:33,531
Whenever she lights up, she can go
anywhere in the whole wide world.

208
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,305
Arabia, New Jersey.

209
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:39,280
I mean, that stuff is gonna be
all worked out, of course.

210
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:43,375
You want to write a children's book
about smoking?

211
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:47,047
It's a children's book for adults.

212
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:53,186
You are outrageous.
I love it.

213
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:55,127
I thought you might.

214
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:58,894
I have been dying to do something
with an edge. This could be great.

215
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:00,458
It was the last straw.

216
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:04,472
She was smart, beautiful,
and she got me.

217
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,600
I'd have to kill her.

218
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:13,071
Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have
her own encounter with the third kind.

219
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:14,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,814
- Ken!
- Sam!

221
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:19,081
- You two know each other?
- Sure.

222
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:23,615
Not really.
Ruth, this is Sam. Samantha.

223
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,490
She bought pinot noir from me.

224
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,722
- Sam, this is my wife Ruth.
- Hi.

225
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:33,299
Okay, we should be going.
See you.

226
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,496
That afternoon was a first
for Samantha.

227
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:39,701
She successfully screwed a guy
in under two minutes.

228
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:44,979
The more Miranda analyzed,
the worse her nightmares got.

229
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:49,450
So, the four of us get into a cab, only
they won't let me sit in back with them.

230
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:52,578
They make me ride in front with
the driver, who's the original Chris...

231
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,816
from The Partridge Family.

232
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,188
What I'm hearing is
you're still very upset...

233
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,557
about being sexually rejected
by your friends.

234
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:01,459
Let me ask you something.

235
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:06,592
Would you do a threesome with me?

236
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:10,969
I think we need to talk about
why you're asking me that.

237
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,031
I take that as a no.

238
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:18,914
That night I thought I could put
the whole Barbara thing out of my mind.

239
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:21,745
After all,
Mr. Big was with me now.

240
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:26,521
Nibbling his ear lobes?
How sweet.

241
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,649
Let me show you how it's really done.

242
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:35,292
So I guess you couldn't avoid
a threesome...

243
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,855
because even if you're the only person
in the bed...

244
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:41,528
someone has always
been there before you.

245
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:44,198
What just happened?
Where'd you go?

246
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,074
I was preoccupied.

247
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,134
No kidding. About what?

248
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:52,146
Your ex-wife's breasts,
your ex-wife's lips...

249
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:54,978
your ex-wife's long legs.

250
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:57,349
My column.

251
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,720
You know, I didn't tell you I was
married because it was a long time ago.

252
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,622
What happened?

253
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:07,492
Alienation of affection
followed by divorce.

254
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,423
Let's not talk about the past.

255
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:14,127
Please?

256
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:21,572
What Mr. Big didn't realize was
the past was sleeping right next to me.

257
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:30,085
The next day, the flesh-and-blood
Barbara asked me to lunch.

258
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,712
Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

259
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,949
Thanks for inviting me.

260
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:37,857
Wow! You changed your hair.

261
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:41,192
Oh. Well, thanks.

262
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:45,324
- Listen, I have some not great news.
- I'm back with Mr. Big?

263
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,700
The head guys didn't go
for Little Cathy. But fuck 'em.

264
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,262
They wouldn't know a good book
if it bit them in the ass.

265
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,773
Yeah, fuck 'em.

266
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,776
I still love the project.

267
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:57,335
And at the risk of sounding
like a groupie...

268
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:59,711
I'd really like it
if we could become friends.

269
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,045
Friends?

270
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:06,611
Two hours and four chardonnays later,
I was sleeping with the enemy.

271
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:10,523
- So, never been married?
- Once. Long time ago.

272
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:12,652
Really? What happened?

273
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:16,425
He had a wandering eye.
Wandered right over to my best friend.

274
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,828
What about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

275
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:25,170
No one special.

276
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:29,177
For Samantha, the shit
was about to hit the phone.

277
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:31,508
Hello.

278
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,946
It's over. I told my wife.

279
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,541
- Who is this?
- It's Ken.

280
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:40,146
Wait. You told Ruth about us?

281
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:42,782
I'm in love with you.
Now we can be together.

282
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:45,656
No, no, no.

283
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:47,161
Hang on.

284
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:53,463
- Hello.
- This is Ruth Scheer, Ken's wife.

285
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:57,495
- I found your number in his drawer.
- Hang on.

286
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,598
Listen to me.
You love your wife.

287
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:02,940
- No. I'm in love with you.
- No, no, no.

288
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:08,279
Sam's "no muss, no fuss" affair
was starting to feel very mussy.

289
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,750
- I'm back.
- I don't know who you are...

290
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,617
but Ken and I love each other
very much.

291
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:15,884
Of course you do.

292
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:21,396
We have an unshakable bond. Whatever it
takes, I'll keep this marriage together.

293
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:24,796
Good for you.
Listen, this was a huge mistake.

294
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,427
It didn't mean anything.
It was just sex.

295
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:29,164
Exactly!

296
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:32,332
And if being sexually adventuresome...

297
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:37,607
will keep this marriage together,
then I am prepared to join you...

298
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,511
with him...

299
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,015
in bed.

300
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:46,920
Oh, no. No, no, no.

301
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:51,221
Samantha was a guest star.
Series regular was not in her contract.

302
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:57,029
That night at the Attention Deficit
Disorder Masked Ball...

303
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,626
Charlotte felt free
to indulge her fantasy.

304
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:04,605
It's amazing what sequins on a stick
can do to free up inhibitions.

305
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:08,837
Who here is your type?

306
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:19,420
Do you like peacocks?

307
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:20,921
Do you?

308
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:27,028
Then Charlotte did the unthinkable.

309
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,691
Oh, my God.
She winked at me.

310
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,294
Excellent.

311
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:38,772
I need to get out of here.

312
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,382
Hey, you okay?

313
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,316
Yeah, I think so.

314
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:54,879
- How'd it feel?
- Weird.

315
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:57,858
Well, I enjoyed it.

316
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:02,663
- I do have another fantasy.
- What's that?

317
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:06,030
Doing it upstairs at a party.

318
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:25,444
Can I join you?

319
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:30,554
She realized that this was her moment.

320
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:34,392
If she was going to take the plunge,
it was now or never.

321
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:57,550
Unfortunately,
it was Jack who plunged first.

322
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:00,986
Apparently someone else's fire
was a little stronger than Charlotte's.

323
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,752
She was not the guest star
in this fantasy.

324
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:15,636
Meanwhile,
at a bar downtown...

325
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,543
- Miranda?
- Hi.

326
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,375
What a relief.

327
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:34,286
Most of the women who answered our ad,
they were kind of...

328
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:36,153
Butt ugly.

329
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:38,250
Nothing like you.

330
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:40,256
Thanks.

331
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:43,526
We've never done anything
like this before.

332
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,999
It's a huge fantasy of Mark's.

333
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:48,434
I offered to do it
for this 30th birthday.

334
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:50,972
Whatever happened
to giving a nice pen?

335
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:58,175
Are you doing anything tonight?

336
00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:03,542
Let me just be clear here.
You want to do a threesome with me.

337
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:08,622
If you're busy, we understand.

338
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,024
I tell you what. Let me just make
a quick phone call. Okay?

339
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:28,909
That night,
Miranda finally got her validation.

340
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:32,572
Her shrink had suggested
she come three times a week.

341
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,678
I didn't see Mr. Big for eight days.

342
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:41,553
- That was a great meal.
- Yeah, it was.

343
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:44,956
The food was terrible, and we were
talking to each other like strangers.

344
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:47,359
What is wrong?

345
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:49,863
Look, you tell me you have an ex-wife.

346
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:53,026
You tell me you guys had a three-way.
Yes, I asked.

347
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:56,696
You drop this big bomb,
and you don't give me any details.

348
00:21:56,772 --> 00:22:01,106
- You didn't tell me why you broke up.
- I cheated on her.

349
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:04,145
- I know. She told me at lunch.
- I know. She told me she told you.

350
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:06,647
- She told you?
- She told me.

351
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:11,015
That's another thing. You didn't tell me
that you're still talking to her.

352
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:13,213
I still talk to all my ex-wives.

353
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,882
I'm so not finding that funny.

354
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,392
Oh, come...
Wait a minute.

355
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:22,926
The reason we had the threesome
is because we were both looking...

356
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:25,296
for something or someone else.

357
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:35,771
Do you know anyone
who's right for me?

358
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:49,390
Then it was just the two of us.

359
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:54,191
And I realized the real appeal
of the threesome: It was easy.

360
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:56,527
It's intimacy that's the bitch.
