1
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,204
The most powerful woman in New York
is not Tina Brown...

2
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:56,075
or Diane Sawyer
or even Rosie O'Donnell.

3
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,704
It's the hostess at Balzac...

4
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:01,444
which had overnight become
the only restaurant that mattered.

5
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,213
And we were there to celebrate
the moment.

6
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:04,719
This is humiliating.

7
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:06,722
We've been waiting for 45 minutes.

8
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,223
I think I'm gonna faint.

9
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,885
- Doesn't she know who we are?
- Who are we?

10
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:13,725
I own my own PR firm.
You write a newspaper column.

11
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,731
This should not be happening.

12
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,959
I'm going back up there.
Excuse me.

13
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:23,767
Hello. Excuse me.
Hello! We've been waiting 45 minutes.

14
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:29,070
Look, I'm not sure you understand...

15
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,739
but I'm kind of somebody...

16
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:34,249
and she's definitely
kind of somebody...

17
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:37,218
and we really need to eat now.

18
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:39,221
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:45,760
Excuse me.

20
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,261
- Give me a 20.
- You must be joking.

21
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,267
Do you think I should
make it a 50?

22
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,429
If I had $50 with me,
do you think I'd give it to that girl?

23
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:57,439
She cannot do this to us.

24
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:59,600
- We're leaving.
- Oh, God.

25
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:02,944
Let me tell you something.

26
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,106
I was that woman ten years ago...

27
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:07,615
but I wielded my power
in a benevolent manner.

28
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:10,278
Can we please talk about this
over lunch somewhere else?

29
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:13,288
Where, somewhere like New Jersey,
where we might actually get seated?

30
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:17,793
Do you realize, if she were a man,
not only would we be eating now...

31
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:19,954
but they'd be sending over
free drinks.

32
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,123
I know a great Thai place
around the corner...

33
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:24,132
where the owner's son
practically always sends over...

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,134
a complementary order of mee krob.

35
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,864
How sad.
Do you think we can get it to go?

36
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:30,963
A short time later,
Samantha headed back to her office...

37
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,306
while I decided to investigate
this theory I had...

38
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:38,143
about shopping as a way to unleash
the creative subconscious.

39
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:42,313
All right.
I'm gonna take them.

40
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:44,819
I was already planning
on returning them when...

41
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,321
Miss?

42
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,622
They told me to do that.
And now they want to talk to you.

43
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:57,799
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, my God! I don't believe it!

44
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,670
- When did you get to town?
- Just yesterday.

45
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:07,334
- Darling, you look fantastic.
- I can't let you do this.

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,708
Of course you can.
And you can pay me back never.

47
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:12,304
Besides, it's on Carlo.

48
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,680
Wow. When did you two...

49
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,548
About two months.

50
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:20,214
His family has this gigantic ranch
in Argentina. Very, very wealthy.

51
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,852
He has a tiny little penis,
but he knows exactly how to use it.

52
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,862
Wave, darling. Wave.

53
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,728
Ciao, ciao, ciao.

54
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,199
That's very nice of you,
but I just can't accept these.

55
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,599
But of course you can.

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,436
When have I ever given you a birthday
present or a Christmas present?

57
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:39,702
I mean, you are like
a sister to me...

58
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:43,473
yet I never see you.

59
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,707
The truth was,
we'd only met a few times.

60
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:49,149
Most people would classify Amalita
as Eurotrash.

61
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,153
I thought she was fun.

62
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,655
So call me. I'm staying
at the Four Seasons with Carlo.

63
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:56,248
- Don't you live in the city?
- I'm a citizen of the world.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,385
A citizen of the world, darling.

65
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,396
Now take the shoes,
and we'll talk soon.

66
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:04,228
- I can't do this.
- Of course you can.

67
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,229
- Go, go.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:14,075
I couldn't understand a word
she was saying...

69
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:18,240
but I felt I had in my possession
all the Italian I'd ever need to know.

70
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,080
While at home, all the English
I seemed to encounter...

71
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,314
was "bills, bills, bills."

72
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:27,083
I envied Amalita.

73
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,921
Her life was a blur of rich men,
designer clothes...

74
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:31,756
and glamorous resorts.

75
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:35,093
She didn't actually work for a living,
yet possessed a dazzling sexual power...

76
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,929
that she exploited
to her full advantage.

77
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:40,936
Which presented
a certain conundrum.

78
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:43,097
Where's the line
between professional girlfriend...

79
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:45,698
and just plain professional?

80
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,267
Women have the right to use every means
at their disposal to achieve power.

81
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,279
Short of sleeping their way
to the top.

82
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:53,440
Not if that's what it takes
to compete.

83
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,450
But that's exploitation!

84
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,782
Of men...
which is perfectly legal.

85
00:04:57,854 --> 00:05:00,118
Saturday night.
In an effort to save money...

86
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,624
and maybe even pick up
a few extra bucks...

87
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:04,887
I invited the girls over for poker.

88
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,759
- I'll buy two.
- I'm in for three.

89
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:10,129
So you advocate a double standard.

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,294
Women can use their sexuality
to get ahead whenever possible...

91
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:16,236
but men should not be allowed
to take advantage of it?

92
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:19,469
I'm just saying that men and women
are equal-opportunity exploiters.

93
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,772
- I fold.
- What if you sense that someone...

94
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:26,976
is giving you a professional advantage
because they find you charming?

95
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,417
- Charming?
- This I gotta hear.

96
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:35,652
A few days ago, Neville Morgan,
the notoriously reclusive painter...

97
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:37,659
paid a visit to the gallery.

98
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,325
Neville was making his yearly
pilgrimage to Manhattan...

99
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,991
to check out what was new and hot
on the art scene.

100
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,831
And he found it...
Charlotte.

101
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:50,339
It was only a matter of moments before
he invited her to his farm upstate...

102
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,601
to view his latest work.

103
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:56,167
If I could get him to show at the
gallery, it would be an incredible coup.

104
00:05:56,246 --> 00:06:01,513
- But what if he wants me to, you know.
- Hold his brush?

105
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:04,519
If he so much as suggests
what she's suggesting...

106
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:06,680
you give me a call
and we'll sue the hell out of him.

107
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,883
That's the only proper way
to trade sex for power.

108
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,892
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

109
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,521
You're like the Harvard Law
Lorena Bobbitt.

110
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:17,691
It's Skipper.
I told him I was here.

111
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:21,100
He insisted on picking me up, but he's
not supposed to be here till 11:00.

112
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,502
He's like a sweet little seal pup.

113
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,201
That you sometimes want to club.

114
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,944
You're an hour early.

115
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,949
I can wait in the hall.

116
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,609
Skipper, come in.

117
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,710
It's all right.

118
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:39,550
I'm leaving anyway.

119
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,886
You guys have cleaned me out.

120
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,153
Good night, ladies.

121
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,888
Keep me posted.

122
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:54,228
A couple of hours later,
I was looking forward...

123
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:56,397
to calling it an early night,
when...

124
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,177
- Hello?
- Carrie, you bitch! What are you doing?

125
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:08,240
- I'm getting ready to go to sleep.
- Why don't you come and join us?

126
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:13,415
We are at Balzac, and there is someone
here I am dying for you to meet.

127
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,253
I'd love to,
but I'm really trying to cut back.

128
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:18,351
You know, pinch a few pennies.

129
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:20,589
You are crazy, you know that?

130
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:23,860
Why don't you just come down here
and be your fabulous self?

131
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:27,198
The truth was I could
barely afford that either.

132
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,204
But I rationalized
that my new shoes...

133
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,365
shouldn't be punished
just because I can't budget.

134
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:35,577
Sorry. You're not on the list.

135
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:37,772
I don't need a list.
My friends are already in.

136
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:40,543
Darling, what took you so long?

137
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:49,284
You won't believe what Carlo bought me
this afternoon at Van Cleef & Arpels.

138
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,792
What?

139
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,294
Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.

140
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,456
Twelve thousand dollars.

141
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:01,803
Listen, I want you to come and meet
the world's most fabulous man.

142
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:04,305
Sounds like a trendy sideshow act.

143
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:05,966
You're crazy!

144
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:13,038
Carrie, I'd like you to meet
my boyfriend Carlo.

145
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:15,744
- And his friend Gilles.
- Hello.

146
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:18,184
Hello. Nice to meet you.

147
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,154
Gilles is an architect from Paris.

148
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:26,787
- How long are you here for?
- Just a couple of days. On business.

149
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:30,663
I've told Gilles all about you.

150
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,894
I told him
you were the most beautiful...

151
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,961
talented and fascinating woman
in New York.

152
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,633
And single.
How is this possible?

153
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,373
I get it.
You're an architect and a comedian.

154
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,772
I don't understand.

155
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:51,377
Nothing.
I'm just being un peu stupide.

156
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:53,854
You? Never.

157
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:57,689
I suddenly recalled my terrible weakness
for gorgeous French architects.

158
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,524
Can I get anyone something else?

159
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,231
You would like another
bottle of wine?

160
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:06,893
Wonderful.

161
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,704
And what will the rest of you
be having?

162
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:17,045
During the next couple of hours, I put
my journalistic skills to good use.

163
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:19,206
I discovered that Gilles
was recently divorced...

164
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,216
with a five-year-old daughter,
Beatrice...

165
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:23,218
who lived with her mother in Paris.

166
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,220
He was passing through New York
on his way to Brazil...

167
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:27,722
to supervise construction
of a new hotel.

168
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,554
I think you are too beautiful
to be a writer.

169
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:33,561
I think you're too charming
to be an architect.

170
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,563
I think you should
give up your life here...

171
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,724
and move with me
to Paris immediately.

172
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,064
I thought you were spending the next
six months in Brazil.

173
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,400
You can join me there first.

174
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,235
Don't tempt me.

175
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,571
I'm so broke these days
I might take you up on that offer...

176
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,735
just to save on rent.

177
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,745
Writing does not pay well?

178
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:52,246
No, it does.

179
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:57,150
It's just, I have
this little substance abuse problem.

180
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,883
Expensive footwear.

181
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,258
I see.

182
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,389
I'm only here for the weekend...

183
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,899
but I would love to see you tomorrow.

184
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:15,762
Maybe you could show me the town.

185
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,772
You've never been to New York?

186
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,273
About 12 times...

187
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:22,675
but I've never seen it
with someone like you.

188
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,241
You really have that certain
je ne sais quoi, don't you?

189
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,452
Yes.

190
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:35,248
And so do you.

191
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:41,429
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

192
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,192
Good night.

193
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,132
Sure, I saw some red flags...

194
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,440
divorced, French
and almost uncomfortably handsome...

195
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,315
but I felt like
I was floating on air.

196
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,324
The next morning
I was brought back down to Earth...

197
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:12,657
as I confronted that eternal puzzle...

198
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,822
a closet full of clothes,
nothing to wear.

199
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,333
Just a minute!

200
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,136
Who is it?

201
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:29,504
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm sorry. I should go.

202
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,013
Skipper, come on in.
What is it?

203
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:36,013
It's Miranda.
She's got me totally whacked.

204
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,178
It's like I'm obsessed.

205
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,347
And I know that I shouldn't be
because I can sense...

206
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:42,357
that it's totally turning her off.

207
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:45,690
But I can't control it.
I can't.

208
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:48,195
It's like she's got
this power over me...

209
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,858
and I'm helpless.

210
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,527
Keep going.
I have to get dressed, all right?

211
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:56,936
Is it possible
to be addicted to a person?

212
00:11:57,006 --> 00:12:00,533
The sex is so awesome
that it's, like...

213
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,373
it's all I can think about.

214
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:06,279
I've never considered myself
a horn dog before...

215
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:09,375
but I'm worried I might be starting
to scare her off.

216
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,249
Well, is that what she said?

217
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,221
No, but mostly we just have sex
in the afternoon.

218
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,224
She never lets me spend the night.

219
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:20,728
Well, I have an idea.

220
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:25,392
Why don't the two of you
just spend a night together...

221
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,561
and not have sex?

222
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:31,232
That would be hard.
That would be really hard.

223
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:34,572
Well, I think it's really important
that you try.

224
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,578
I don't even shower afterwards.

225
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:41,242
I like to spend the whole day
smelling like Miranda.

226
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:55,930
I began to fear that Miranda's sexuality
was overpowering poor Skipper.

227
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:07,268
Later I spent the most incredibly
romantic afternoon with Gilles.

228
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,286
I felt like I had landed
in a Claude Lelouch film...

229
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:23,951
A Man and a Slightly Neurotic Woman.

230
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,463
Wait. Wait.

231
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:38,973
I kind of have this rule.

232
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,135
I don't sleep with men
I've only known a day.

233
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,644
I see.

234
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:52,654
I gave in. After all,
it was already tomorrow in Paris.

235
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:08,502
You look so beautiful
when you sleep.

236
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:11,165
I didn't want to disturb you.

237
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,505
- Are you leaving so early?
- I've got a plane.

238
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,010
I'll get up.

239
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,674
Stay in bed.
Order room service.

240
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,183
Enjoy yourself.

241
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:29,853
- I can just get dressed.
- Relax.

242
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,856
I'll call you.

243
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,361
Okay.

244
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:43,200
As he walked out the door,
it suddenly dawned on me...

245
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,365
that he didn't have
my phone number.

246
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,534
And I didn't have his phone number.

247
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,707
But he had left me a note...

248
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,723
with $1,000 in cash.

249
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,923
"Thanks for the beautiful day."

250
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,552
Must have been
a hell of a beautiful day.

251
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:10,725
Well, it was.
We had such a fantastic connection.

252
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,734
Then he leaves me money.

253
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:15,794
I don't understand.
What exactly about me screams "whore"?

254
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,896
Besides the $1,000 on the end table?

255
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:20,407
I just can't believe
that you had dinner at Balzac.

256
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:24,310
Wait a minute. I thought I ordered two
eggs benedict and one spinach omelette.

257
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,541
It's all right.
I'll take the omelette.

258
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:28,583
This isn't right. We're gonna
pay for all this ourselves, all right?

259
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,141
He said order anything.

260
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,744
The room service is one thing,
but the money... uh-uh.

261
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:35,450
What are you getting so uptight about?

262
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:38,084
Money is power.
Sex is power.

263
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,755
Therefore, getting money for sex
is simply an exchange of power.

264
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,493
Don't listen
to the dime store Camille Paglia.

265
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,501
I don't know whether to take it
as an incredible compliment...

266
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:48,469
or as an incredible insult.

267
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:49,902
Just take it, period.

268
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,339
I wouldn't know how to return it anyway
because he didn't leave me his number.

269
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:55,400
He paid in full.
What more is there to talk about?

270
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:58,538
Who is this Amalita Amalfi character,
anyway?

271
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:01,777
I'm concerned that you've been drafted
into a ring of high-class hookers.

272
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,318
She isn't a hooker.

273
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:04,943
She's...

274
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,113
She's like
an international party girl.

275
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:08,622
She's a hooker with a passport.

276
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,591
Do you ever have any conversations
about money?

277
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:15,755
I did allude to the fact that I was
a bit cash poor these days.

278
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:17,628
So maybe it's supposed to be a loan?

279
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,634
I don't remember filling out
an application.

280
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:22,136
Sweetheart, men give, women receive.

281
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:25,640
- It's biological destiny.
- Do you really want to say that?

282
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:30,839
That's the argument men have used
since the dawn of time to exploit women.

283
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:35,680
I'm just gonna write the whole thing off
as a bad date with a cash bonus.

284
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:37,981
You know, that salmon is really good.

285
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,816
I think we should order another one.

286
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,916
As I struggled with the dilemma
of how to manage my newfound money...

287
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:47,488
Charlotte arrived at the secluded
Connecticut home...

288
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:49,497
of the painter Neville Morgan...

289
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,159
in an attempt to secure
his latest work.

290
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:55,831
Welcome.

291
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,840
Hi. I feel so privileged.

292
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:02,002
Meeting you is without a doubt
the high point of my career.

293
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:03,510
Thank you.

294
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,845
I'm frankly surprised that someone as
young as you is familiar with my work.

295
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,181
Are you serious?
I studied you in college.

296
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,846
Oh, my God.
I apologize.

297
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:15,857
- I really do.
- You're much too modest.

298
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:17,358
Here we are.

299
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:18,859
Excuse me.

300
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:27,027
The canvasses you're about to see...

301
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:29,696
are what I consider to be
the apotheosis...

302
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:32,707
of every great idea I've ever had.

303
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:35,869
It's the closest I've ever come...

304
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:38,880
to pure, universal God force.

305
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:41,715
The cunt.

306
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:45,886
Oh, my.

307
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,220
They're very powerful.

308
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,055
Exactly.

309
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,096
The most powerful force...

310
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:56,927
in the universe.

311
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,067
The source of all life...

312
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:01,727
and pleasure...

313
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:03,271
and beauty.

314
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,232
That's true.

315
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:07,935
I used to paint full nudes...

316
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,411
but as I got older I realized...

317
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,243
that the truth...

318
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,545
was to be found only
in the cunt.

319
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:18,551
Charlotte hated the "C" word.

320
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:21,988
But Neville Morgan was not a man
to be corrected.

321
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,922
Hi.

322
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:25,756
I thought you might like
something to drink.

323
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:28,626
Charlotte, this is my wife,
Gertrude.

324
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,426
It's a pleasure.

325
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:32,933
- Lemonade and cookies?
- Thank you.

326
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,799
Each of these portraits...

327
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,636
is of a woman
who has touched my life.

328
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,442
Incredible.

329
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,807
I wonder...

330
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:45,745
would you consider
posing for me sometime?

331
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,577
Me? L...

332
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,778
Well...

333
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:53,287
I'm very flattered.

334
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,291
Excellent.

335
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,793
So long as you're here,
I could sketch you this afternoon.

336
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:03,631
I bet you have
a beautiful cunt, dear.

337
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,462
As Charlotte pondered how far
she would go for her love of art...

338
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,266
and the gallery...

339
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,702
Another Saturday night.

340
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:16,870
With my hooker money still
burning a hole in my pocket...

341
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:19,311
Samantha and I showed up
at Balzac.

342
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,315
She reasoned
that since I was there once...

343
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:23,317
I was as good as in.

344
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:24,818
I don't understand.

345
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:28,846
I made these reservations weeks ago,
and she's already been here.

346
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,482
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,987
Is there a host
that I might talk to?

348
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:38,999
I will snap her.

349
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:42,333
I will put her over my knee,
and I will snap her like a twig.

350
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:45,498
I'm sorry. I'm hungry.

351
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:48,509
I'm going to go to the bathroom,
and then we're leaving, all right?

352
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:01,020
Come here!

353
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,285
They all looked so chic and glamorous.

354
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,692
Part of me wanted to grab Samantha
and make a run for it.

355
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:08,753
- While another part...
- Hi.

356
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,093
How are you?

357
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:13,598
Carrie, I want you to meet Mario...

358
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:17,469
Allen, Justine and Peter.

359
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,399
Mario's family has one of those
gorgeous palazzos...

360
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,172
on the Grand Canal in Venezia.

361
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:27,272
And we are all going there next week
for the film festival.

362
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:30,284
- You should join us.
- Absolutely!

363
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:33,219
Yes, you must bring your little laptop
and write all about it.

364
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:35,449
You'd be mad not to go.

365
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,386
Carrie is one
of the most fascinating...

366
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:42,089
talented and beautiful women
in New York.

367
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:43,756
I have no doubt.

368
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:46,164
I've never been to Venice.

369
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:52,069
Venice is the most beautiful,
the most romantic city in the world.

370
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,267
Really?

371
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:55,708
I heard it was sinking.

372
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:02,079
That's why you must come immediately...
before it's all gone.

373
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:06,246
I couldn't say I wasn't tempted.

374
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:08,414
I realized
that I could leverage myself...

375
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,084
like the human equivalent
of a sexy junk bond.

376
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,391
I'd parlay that $1,000
into a trip to Venice...

377
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:16,761
into a nice piece of jewelry...

378
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:19,426
a rich husband,
followed by a richer divorce.

379
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:25,774
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to say good-bye.

380
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,036
I'm here with a friend.
She's waiting for me at the bar.

381
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,509
What a pity.

382
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:33,742
Call me. I'm staying
at the Carlyle with Peter.

383
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,122
Just because Venice was sinking...

384
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,023
didn't mean my morals
had to go down with it.

385
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:48,458
And as for Gilles and the $1,000...

386
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,464
I figured
there was nothing to be done.

387
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,296
For better or worse,
I had just established my rate...

388
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,302
for a one-night stand.

389
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:58,138
Excuse me.

390
00:21:58,207 --> 00:22:03,304
And then the most powerful woman
in Manhattan asked me for a favor.

391
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:04,811
Do you have a tampon?

392
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,313
Oh! Sure.

393
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:09,316
Of course.

394
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,411
Thanks a lot.

395
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:22,656
I never told Samantha the source
of my newfound power...

396
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:25,325
but from that moment on,
we never had a problem...

397
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,834
getting a table at Balzac again.

398
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:35,168
A couple of weeks later,
we were all there...

399
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:37,337
to celebrate Charlotte's coup.

400
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:39,676
Hi. Excuse me just a second.

401
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:44,685
Are you number nine?

402
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:46,186
Oh, my God.

403
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:48,689
I am so not number nine.

404
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,190
Five.

405
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:53,026
Yeah, right.

406
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:01,034
It's this, right?

407
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:11,545
Really?

408
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,055
They say a picture is worth
a thousand words...

409
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:26,822
but in this case...

410
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,886
I was speechless.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
