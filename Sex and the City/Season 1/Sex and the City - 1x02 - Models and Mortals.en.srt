1
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:48,767
Last night my friend Miranda
got invited to a dinner party...

2
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:50,772
by a man she hardly knew.

3
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:54,133
She was the date
of Nick Waxler...

4
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:58,875
a fairly successful sports agent
who once told her she had nice legs.

5
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,382
Okay.

6
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,285
Old movie stars you'd have liked to fuck
when they were young.

7
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,822
Alive or dead?

8
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,949
It doesn't matter.
I'll start.

9
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:12,859
Veronica Lake, the year she made
Sullivan's Travels.

10
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:14,487
Dave?

11
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:17,830
I'd have to say
Sophia Loren.

12
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,096
Probably 'cause my dad
had this thing for her.

13
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,900
We won't go there.
Montgomery Clift.

14
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,907
- He was gay.
- Oh.

15
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:27,739
Marilyn Monroe,
before the Kennedys got to her.

16
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,609
- Honey?
- Bing Crosby.

17
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,444
I stand by my choice.

18
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:35,416
Sean Connery.

19
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:38,682
Yesterday, today and tomorrow.

20
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:43,283
For a first date, Miranda felt like
she was hitting it out of the ballpark.

21
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:45,888
Thanks.

22
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:48,430
So how long have
you known Nick?

23
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:51,695
We've been riding the same
elevator line for years...

24
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,861
and then we had lunch
a few weeks ago...

25
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:56,064
and then he
invited me here to dinner.

26
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:59,666
- Well, we adore him.
- He's very smart.

27
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:03,076
- Guess he took our ultimatum seriously.
- Deanne.

28
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,511
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:10,314
They told Miranda
that Nick had this thing for models.

30
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:13,788
Old movie stars you'd have
liked to fuck when they were young.

31
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:18,385
I'll start. Veronica Lake,
the year she made Sullivan's Travels.

32
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,191
- Dave?
- I'd have to go with Sophia Loren.

33
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:23,960
Probably.
My dad had a thing for her.

34
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,935
- Montgomery Clift.
- Marilyn Monroe.

35
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:28,595
Bing Crosby.

36
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:31,465
Yvette?

37
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:35,638
I don't know.
Charlie Sheen?

38
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,646
They'd come to dinner...

39
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:40,979
push their food around and pout.

40
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,313
Veronica Lake.

41
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:44,785
- Sophia Loren.
- Montgomery Clift.

42
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,185
Marilyn Monroe.

43
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,917
Bing Crosby.

44
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,583
Marissa?

45
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:05,005
She had to make a phone call.

46
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:08,977
It got to be a problem.
They decided to take action.

47
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:12,947
Can't you find a woman who can
carry on a decent conversation?

48
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:16,008
Yeah, Nick.
And eat without purging.

49
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:17,519
What are you saying?

50
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:20,385
You can't bring around any more
of these so-called models.

51
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:22,982
It's too depressing.

52
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:27,189
Okay, okay.
I'll see what I can do.

53
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:29,026
And then he brought you.

54
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,364
- So obviously not a model.
- In a good way!

55
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,664
Nick dates models?

56
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:46,240
Miranda confronted him,
and it didn't take him long to fold.

57
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:49,615
It's true. It's true, okay?
I'm obsessed.

58
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,745
- Obsessed with models.
- Correct.

59
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:54,654
So what am I?
Your intellectual beard for the evening?

60
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,385
Don't be pissed, all right?

61
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,155
You gotta admit,
you met some nice people.

62
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:02,494
You had a good time. Okay?

63
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,767
You were on a date
with a modelizer...

64
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,769
and you didn't even know it?

65
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:11,796
If men like Nick are dating models,
what chance do ordinary women have?

66
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,969
Do you have to be a supermodel
to get a date in New York?

67
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:18,174
Modelizers are
a particular breed.

68
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:20,478
They're a step
beyond womanizers...

69
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,348
who will sleep with just about
anything in a skirt.

70
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,356
Modelizers are obsessed
not with women, but with models...

71
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:31,383
who in most cities are safely confined
to billboards and magazines...

72
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:34,624
but in Manhattan,
actually run wild on the streets...

73
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:37,689
turning the city into
a virtual Model Country Safari...

74
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,702
where men can pet the creatures
in their natural habitat.

75
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,500
As if we didn't
have enough problems.

76
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,335
They're stupid and lazy
and should be shot on sight.

77
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,900
I've been out
with lots of guys...

78
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:51,913
and they say I am just as beautiful
as a model, but I work for a living.

79
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:53,471
I'm like, well...

80
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,814
I'm like a model
who's taken the high road.

81
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:59,377
The advantages given to models
and to beautiful women in general...

82
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:01,390
are so unfair,
it makes me puke.

83
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,053
- Sweetheart, you are so cute.
- Cute doesn't cut it in this town.

84
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:07,790
What's cute
compared to supermodel?

85
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:11,391
There's nothing like raising the subject
of models among four single women...

86
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:14,198
to spice up an otherwise
dull Tuesday night.

87
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,670
They have this
distant, sexy look.

88
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,673
That's not sexy,
it's starvation.

89
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,039
That's starvation
in the best restaurants.

90
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,839
What I wanna know is...

91
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:25,437
when did all the men
get together and decide...

92
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:28,814
that they would only get it up
for giraffes with big breasts?

93
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:33,618
In some cultures, heavy women
with mustaches are considered beautiful.

94
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,624
You're looking at me
while you're saying that?

95
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:37,751
We should just admit
that we live in a culture...

96
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,886
that promotes impossible
standards of beauty.

97
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:42,363
- Except men think they're possible.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:45,265
No matter how good
I feel about myself...

99
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:47,803
if I see Christy Turlington,
I just wanna give up.

100
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:52,240
I wanna force-feed her lard, but that's
the difference between you and me.

101
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,242
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,040
Look at you two.
You're beautiful.

103
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:59,843
- I hate my thighs.
- Oh, come on.

104
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:04,285
I can't even open a magazine without
thinking, "thighs, thighs, thighs."

105
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:06,413
I'll take your thighs
and raise you a chin.

106
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,514
I'll take your chin
and raise you a...

107
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,291
What?

108
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:16,093
Oh, come on.

109
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,395
I happen to love the way I look.

110
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:20,129
You should.
You paid enough for it.

111
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:21,932
Hey, I resent that.

112
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,600
I do not believe in plastic surgery.
Well, not yet.

113
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:30,738
I find it fascinating that four
beautiful flesh and blood women...

114
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,940
could be intimidated
by some unreal fantasy.

115
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,348
I mean, look.
Look at this.

116
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,319
Is this really intimidating
to any of you?

117
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,720
- I hate my thighs.
- Pass the chicken.

118
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,951
I have that dress.

119
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,459
Suddenly I was interested.

120
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:47,655
If models could cause
otherwise rational individuals...

121
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,723
to crumble in their presence,
exactly how powerful was beauty?

122
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,770
There are two types of guys
that fall for beautiful women.

123
00:06:54,837 --> 00:06:57,431
Either they're slime-balls
that are just out to get laid...

124
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,975
or they fall in love with you instantly.
It's pathetic.

125
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:02,102
Why fuck the girl
in the skirt...

126
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:05,739
if you can fuck the girl
in the ad for the skirt?

127
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:09,273
Being beautiful is such a power.
You can get whatever you want.

128
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,580
You can get anything.

129
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:14,089
I've been offered trips to Aspen,
weekends in Paris...

130
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:15,749
Christmas in St. Barts.

131
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:18,589
A motorcycle, a juicer.

132
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:21,494
It's not like models
don't have brains.

133
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:25,523
They have them.
They just don't need to use them.

134
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:29,698
Most guys just think you're dumb,
but I'm really very literary. I read.

135
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:32,707
I'll sit down and read
a whole magazine from cover to cover.

136
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:34,606
Some scuba gear...

137
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,547
a Herb Ritt's photo.

138
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:41,880
A Bulgari necklace,
a breast job.

139
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:45,944
My friends think I'm shallow.
Sometimes I think they're right.

140
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:50,459
Other times I think,
"Hey, I'm fucking a model."

141
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:54,462
Models are a lot looser
than you think.

142
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,465
It's way easier to screw a model
than a regular girl...

143
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,558
'cause that's what
they do all the time.

144
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:02,264
It's how regular people are
when they're on vacation.

145
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,966
Barkley, a notorious modelizer...

146
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,636
was one of those SoHo wonders
who maintained a fabulous lifestyle...

147
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:11,771
despite never having sold
a single painting.

148
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:14,282
So you're saying
it's easy to meet them?

149
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,318
No, it's not so easy.

150
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:19,480
The trick is, you gotta treat them
like they're regular girls.

151
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:22,718
You gotta be able to roll into a place,
walk up to the hottest thing there.

152
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,989
Otherwise you're finished.
It's kind of like being around dogs.

153
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:28,826
- You gotta show no fear.
- Things?

154
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:30,729
You call them things?

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
Yeah.
Well, they are things.

156
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,136
They're beautiful things.
And that's what my life's about.

157
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,998
Beauty.

158
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,772
Come here. I want
to show you something.

159
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,211
This is my real art...

160
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:52,516
only I can't really
show it to the public.

161
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:57,653
Well, not yet, at least.
Sit down.

162
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:09,265
That's Vanessa.
That's Tanya.

163
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:11,306
Elana.

164
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:13,604
Katrina.

165
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:15,439
I couldn't believe it.

166
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,470
The man had slept with half
the perfume ads in September's Vogue.

167
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:26,144
Do they know about this?

168
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:27,189
Maybe.

169
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,349
Oh, look at that one.

170
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:34,655
She does runway now,
but I think she's gonna be huge someday.

171
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:38,929
I didn't know what to say. There really
wasn't anything to say except...

172
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,504
Do you have a light?

173
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:44,005
Sure.

174
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:53,547
Later that day
I was relieved to discover...

175
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:57,643
that at least one eligible bachelor
got his kicks off the runway.

176
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,985
- So I totally dig your friend Miranda.
- That's great.

177
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:04,686
Yeah, I think she is
so sexy and smart and...

178
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,286
- Did she tell you that we made out?
- No.

179
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:09,490
Yeah, it was totally hot.

180
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,997
Why don't you call her?

181
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:15,594
- You should call her.
- I did, like a hundred times.

182
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:20,301
She totally won't return my phone calls.
Did she say anything about me?

183
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:25,847
I don't know, maybe she's just busy.
Am I not cute enough for her?

184
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:28,042
Of course you are, Skipper.
You're adorable.

185
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:31,985
I don't know. Find out for me.
I wanna see if I still have a chance.

186
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:36,817
- Right now, in front of you?
- I can handle it.

187
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:41,423
Hi, this is Miranda.
Please leave me a message.

188
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,988
Oh, it's her machine.

189
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,933
Hey, this is Skipper.
I'm in the street with Carrie.

190
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,903
I just told her
how you won't call me back.

191
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:52,668
So now you have to call me back.
You better call me back!

192
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:55,302
No, I'm kidding.
I'm joking.

193
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:59,280
But seriously, I hope
you call me back and...

194
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,839
did I mention this was Skipper?

195
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:05,477
I believe there is a curse
put on the head of anybody...

196
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:07,785
who tries to
fix up their friends.

197
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:15,487
Where better to find modelizers in their
natural habitat than a fashion show?

198
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:20,195
Luckily, my friend Stanford Blatch had
a client in the hottest show in town.

199
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,500
"The Bone" is like the human
equivalent of the sable coat.

200
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:27,771
He's so beautiful that I find
that sometimes I have to look away.

201
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:30,404
- Do you see him?
- Right over there.

202
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:32,470
- Where?
- Look at him.

203
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:35,278
It's like he travels with
his own personal lighting director.

204
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:39,019
Derek, a.k.a. "The Bone"...

205
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:43,218
was the world's biggest underwear model
and Stanford's most important client...

206
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,420
as well as the subject
of his single-minded obsession.

207
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:48,520
Hey, Stanny.

208
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:52,466
Derek, I would like you to meet
a very dear friend, Carrie Bradshaw.

209
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:55,561
- Nice to meet you.
- Carrie writes "Sex And The City."

210
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:58,072
- Wow, that's great.
- Have you read it?

211
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:02,836
The other day, Derek and I
were walking past his billboard...

212
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:05,972
and he told me he'd like to get
a piece of it for his apartment...

213
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:07,640
like maybe his nose.

214
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:10,550
And I said, "You should get
the bulge in your pants.

215
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,454
That way when women ask how big you are,
you can say, 'Fourteen feet'."

216
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,390
- That would be funny, wouldn't it?
- Yeah.

217
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,122
Everybody's talking about you.
You are so great.

218
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:22,824
You're gonna be a star.
Have I told you that enough?

219
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,493
You're a star!
You're a star!

220
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:29,004
- We'd better let you get dressed.
- I am dressed.

221
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:32,703
- We'll see you after the show.
- Bye.

222
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:38,575
Can you believe anyone
that beautiful can be that nice?

223
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:42,982
I keep dreaming that someday
he's gonna say, "Stanford, I love you."

224
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:45,247
- Is he gay?
- He denies it.

225
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:47,812
How could anyone
that gorgeous be straight?

226
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:50,515
Sweetie, over here!

227
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:53,562
Samantha Jones never missed
a major fashion show.

228
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:57,224
She was one of the only people I knew
who thought that proximity to beauty...

229
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,768
made her feel
more attractive.

230
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:03,464
Hey, sweetie, what happened? You
couldn't find seats right on the runway?

231
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,133
Oh, you can see all the flaws
from this angle.

232
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:17,512
- Hey, Carrie.
- Barkley, how are you?

233
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:20,487
- You going to the party afterwards?
- I don't know.

234
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:24,322
Of course we are.
Hi. I'm Samantha.

235
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:25,883
Barkley.

236
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:33,090
Martini straight up
or with a twist?

237
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,602
Straight up.

238
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:37,295
Really? He's very cute.

239
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:38,806
You're not dating him?

240
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:40,899
God, no.
He's a total modelizer.

241
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:49,280
Is he dating any one model
in particular?

242
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:54,016
Actually, he's sleeping
with all of them in general.

243
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,957
- Only models?
- Only models.

244
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:17,811
Later that night we all went
downtown for a party.

245
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:22,745
I was beginning to float away
on a sea of sweet potato puffs...

246
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:25,946
with smoked salmon
and sour cream when...

247
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:30,617
It was Mr. Big:
Major tycoon...

248
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:34,151
major dream boat,
and majorly out of my league.

249
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,664
I thought I saw you
on the runway.

250
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,833
Hi.

251
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,836
I started reading your column
after we met.

252
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:43,462
- You did?
- Yeah.

253
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,166
Cute.

254
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:47,141
Cute?

255
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,303
Well... Yeah, cute.

256
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,313
What are you writing
about this week?

257
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:56,545
Well, I'm working on a story
about men who date models.

258
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,679
- Any thoughts?
- Only that they're very lucky.

259
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,385
So what have you discovered
about these men...

260
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,485
who are dating models?

261
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:09,531
Well, I'm discovering that...

262
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:12,226
some of them treat it
as a competitive sport...

263
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:15,464
and others I think
just need the validation.

264
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:19,372
And probably others just have a thing
for exceptionally beautiful women.

265
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:21,576
Exactly.

266
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,805
And there's something
wrong with that?

267
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,938
There's nothing wrong.

268
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:28,950
I just think it might become
a bit monotonous.

269
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,416
Puff?

270
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,456
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

271
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,548
So where do you...

272
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,527
- Where do you write these stories?
- My cute stories?

273
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:43,224
Have you got
an office or anything?

274
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:46,200
About half the time I'm at my apartment,
and the other half...

275
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:49,704
I'm over at this coffee shop
on 73rd and Madison.

276
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:53,572
Oh, Carrie,
I'd like you to meet Misha.

277
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:57,305
- Hi. You were great in the show.
- Thank you.

278
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,870
Suddenly I felt like
I was wearing patchouli...

279
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:01,883
in a room full of Chanel.

280
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,146
Well, it was nice
talking to you.

281
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,678
See you around sometime, I hope.

282
00:16:08,757 --> 00:16:13,023
I thought I had come to terms
with my looks the year I turned 30...

283
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:17,054
when I realized that I no longer had
the energy to be completely superficial.

284
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,591
Your friend Barkley,
he's really been coming on to me.

285
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:22,637
Do you actually think
he believes I'm a model?

286
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,970
- You don't want to go there.
- Why not?

287
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:30,273
He has this thing for
secretly taping his conquests.

288
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:32,041
Really?

289
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:33,741
What a pervert.

290
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:38,679
As Samantha began to
get ready for her close-up...

291
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:42,554
I felt it was time
to call it a night.

292
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,753
I had never felt so invisible
in my entire life.

293
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,420
Taxi!

294
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:54,498
- Carrie.
- Hey, hi.

295
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,128
Did Stanford leave?

296
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,969
No, he's in there giving
a neck massage to a Versace model.

297
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,009
So, where are you going now?

298
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:03,374
- I'm going home.
- Can I come?

299
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:07,205
- You wanna come home with me?
- Sure, if it's quiet.

300
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:09,581
I can't take these crowds.

301
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:16,716
The things you gotta do
in the name of research.

302
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:26,433
Shouldn't you be spending the night
with some girl from the show?

303
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:28,436
No, I never date models.

304
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,438
I think they're stupid.

305
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:33,998
I wondered if there wasn't
some kind of physics for beauty.

306
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:36,101
Maybe two models repelled.

307
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:39,636
Maybe models could only be
attracted to ordinary humans.

308
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:45,286
So, I think it's so cool
that you write.

309
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:48,118
- Thanks.
- I wish I could write.

310
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,216
I've got intense thoughts, but I can't
keep them in my head long enough...

311
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,887
to get them down on paper.

312
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,590
That's the big trick.

313
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,030
The truth is,
I'm totally neurotic.

314
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,763
One minute I can be walking
down the street, totally cool...

315
00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:04,863
and the next minute
I'm depressed for no reason.

316
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,601
I'm totally self-conscious.

317
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:10,873
Before I say something, I say it in my
head first so it doesn't come out wrong.

318
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:14,715
Doesn't that seem like
a waste of time?

319
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,047
It only takes a second.

320
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:24,919
- And sometimes I get so distracted.
- What's distracting you now?

321
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:26,586
Your nose.

322
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:29,358
Thanks a lot.
I hate my nose.

323
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:33,060
It's just so cute.
I hate my nose too. It's too big.

324
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,695
- But I think it depends on my hair.
- Yeah.

325
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:40,002
I see what you mean.

326
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,737
So what do you want to be
when you grow up?

327
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:46,303
Well, I think
this might be it.

328
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,316
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

329
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:52,844
I'd like to move back to Iowa
and have kids and be a cop.

330
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:58,520
I felt like I was in my bedroom
when I was 16...

331
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,358
and I used to hang out with this guy
who was really beautiful...

332
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,230
and my parents thought I was helping him
with his chemistry homework.

333
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,428
Do you mind
if we just lie here?

334
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:09,801
I get so Ionely in the city.

335
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:13,035
Sometimes it's just nice
to lie with someone.

336
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,735
Sure.

337
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,245
We could do that.

338
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:21,340
It was hard to imagine
that anyone so beautiful...

339
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,079
could ever be Ionely.

340
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,780
Meanwhile,
somewhere below 14th Street...

341
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:31,849
two ordinary joes were doing
their own Ionely late-night thing.

342
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,360
- Anything else?
- That's it.

343
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:36,796
- Just cat food?
- Yes, just cat food.

344
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,835
Oh, hi, Skipper.

345
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:43,997
So like, how come you haven't been
returning any of my calls?

346
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:46,633
I'm sorry.
It's been a really busy week.

347
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:48,939
I thought we had a connection.

348
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:52,169
I don't know.
Could I get my change?

349
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,545
You get that way with
every guy that you're with?

350
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:57,084
No, it's just...

351
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:01,884
Don't you wanna go out
with a girl your own age?

352
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,720
It's got nothing
to do with age.

353
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,090
I think you're luminous.

354
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:11,057
- You think I'm luminous?
- Totally.

355
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,765
Miranda couldn't resist
the vision of herself...

356
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:17,237
reflected in Skipper's
slightly smudged lenses.

357
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:24,176
- All right, let's get out of here.
- Let me just pay for my Cap'n Crunch.

358
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:27,347
There's cereal at my place.

359
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:37,382
And Samantha found
the ultimate validation:

360
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,393
Sex with Barkley.

361
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,122
So...

362
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:44,692
where is it?

363
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,598
What?

364
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:48,260
The camera.

365
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:52,606
Your friend Carrie
tell you about that?

366
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:54,938
Don't worry.
I only tape models.

367
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,140
I won't mind.

368
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,350
Fine. I'll make an exception.

369
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:16,759
Samantha demanded nothing less
than the same consideration...

370
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:19,096
given every other
model in town.

371
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:30,336
- Hello?
- Carrie, it's Stanford.

372
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:33,313
Do you have any idea what
happened to Derek last night?

373
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:34,815
Actually...

374
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:36,578
you'll never
believe it, but...

375
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:38,244
Yes?

376
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,351
It's Stanford.

377
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:49,497
- Hi, Stanford.
- Derek?

378
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:51,499
Could you put Carrie
back on the phone?

379
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,057
Sure.

380
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:58,902
- Hello.
- How could you?

381
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:01,704
I didn't.
We just talked.

382
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:04,405
I knew he was gay.

383
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,854
It's amazing what you'll do
to be with these models.

384
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:15,651
I've gotta retire soon.

385
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:19,057
They keep me from getting work done,
they make me fuck up my life.

386
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:22,324
Look at me!
I'm an old man at 34.

387
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,233
I began to realize
that being beautiful...

388
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:32,603
is like having a rent-controlled
apartment overlooking the park:

389
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:35,234
Completely unfair
and usually bestowed...

390
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,870
upon those
who deserve it least.

391
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:39,573
I'm not interrupting
your work, am I?

392
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:42,208
Hey, what a surprise.

393
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:44,275
I can't stay.
I'm late for a meeting.

394
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:48,016
But I've been thinking about your
article about men who date models.

395
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,682
What about them?

396
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:53,888
First of all, there are so many
goddamn gorgeous women in this city.

397
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,964
What an amazing observation.

398
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:01,267
But the thing is this.

399
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,497
After a while...

400
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:07,303
you just wanna be with
the one that makes you laugh.

401
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:08,809
Know what I mean?

402
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,315
Okay. See ya.

403
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:30,297
I take that back.

404
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:33,027
Beauty is fleeting...

405
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:36,628
but a rent-controlled apartment
overlooking the park is forever.

406
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:59,278
