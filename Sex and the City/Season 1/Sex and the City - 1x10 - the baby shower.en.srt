1
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,595
Let's be honest.

2
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:53,439
Sometimes there is nothing harder in
life than being happy for somebody else.

3
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,709
Like lottery winners or extremely
successful people who are 27.

4
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:01,544
Then there's that hell on Earth...

5
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:04,416
that only your closest friends
can inflict on you...

6
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:08,853
the baby shower.

7
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,452
You could not drag me to that thing
if you put a grappling hook in my mouth.

8
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:16,795
I think it's sad the way she's using
a child to validate her existence.

9
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:20,700
Exactly. Why can't she just use sex
and a nice cocktail like the rest of us?

10
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,499
I'm happy for her.

11
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:26,838
If I see another crepe paper stork,
I'm gonna rip its cardboard beak off.

12
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,572
Can I ask you,
would any baby shower bother you...

13
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:33,241
or is this one worse
because it's Laney's?

14
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:42,314
Laney Berlin.
You can't really describe her.

15
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:44,485
You just had to know her.

16
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:48,658
Chances are eight years ago
you probably did.

17
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:54,426
So help me,
she fucks on my couch, she buys it.

18
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:56,938
Isn't that how
you got the couch from me?

19
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,941
Laney, show us your tits!

20
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,274
Give it a rest!
You guys have seen enough of my tits.

21
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:05,605
Tits! Tits! Tits!

22
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,983
Laney did A&R for a record label...

23
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:13,284
or, as she used to call it,
sex with an expense account.

24
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:17,452
Every time she went on a scouting trip,
she came back with some hot new group...

25
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:20,792
and a gynecological condition
no one had ever heard of.

26
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:24,800
Those things make so many public
appearances, they need a booking agent.

27
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:32,335
Look at her, the poster girl
for low self-esteem.

28
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:35,344
I have low self-esteem,
but I express it the healthy way...

29
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,573
by eating a box
of Double Stuff Oreos.

30
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:38,978
She's so sad.

31
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,909
Take it off!

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,179
Samantha and Laney had
a long-standing rivalry.

33
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,920
Both wild, both sexy...

34
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:53,292
both incredibly insecure.

35
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:58,027
Two years ago, Laney did
the most shocking thing of all.

36
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,661
She met a Wall Street
investment banker, married him...

37
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,568
and moved to Connecticut.

38
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,869
That wasn't supposed to happen.

39
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:07,933
She was supposed to have sex
with Sid Vicious and move to heroin.

40
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:13,344
It'll be fun. We've never even been
to visit her in Connecticut.

41
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,441
Exactly.
There's a reason for that.

42
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:17,486
- Lyme disease?
- That's another good one.

43
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,421
- It's a baby shower.
- No, it's a cult.

44
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,357
- A cult? What are you talking about?
- Listen.

45
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,860
They all think the same,
dress the same...

46
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:29,023
and sacrifice themselves
to the same cause... babies.

47
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,361
She's insane.

48
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:34,836
I've lost two sisters to the motherhood.
I know what I'm talking about.

49
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,395
We should go.
It's the right thing to do.

50
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:38,907
Give me one reason.

51
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:42,502
Okay. You're driving down the road.
You see a sign.

52
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,275
It says "two-headed snake."
You pull over.

53
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:48,044
Wild Laney is having a baby shower.
You pull over.

54
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:50,916
She's got a point.
It's the right thing to do.

55
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:55,048
Just imagine how fat she must be.

56
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:59,653
As I penciled in the date,
I noticed something missing.

57
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,165
In between the Versace show
and dinner at Moomba...

58
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,030
there it wasn't...

59
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:07,160
my period, four days late.

60
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:11,574
That Saturday,
also known as "Seven Days Late"...

61
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:14,735
four city girls set off
to visit the country mice.

62
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,904
Are we there yet?

63
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,585
I've already had two of these,
so we're gonna be stopping a lot.

64
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:26,520
Hey, nice outfit. Is there gonna be
belly dancing at the shower?

65
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,614
Right after the gifts.

66
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:31,854
Shit! I spaced.
I forgot to buy her a present.

67
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:35,826
How tacky is it to give
the mother-to-be a fistful of cash?

68
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:39,062
Don't worry about it.
You can go in on mine.

69
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,933
You bought a pregnant woman
a bottle of Scotch?

70
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,939
The invitation said BYOB.

71
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:46,168
That meant "bring your own baby."

72
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,472
- What did you get her?
- Condoms.

73
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:53,278
- Seriously, what did you get her?
- Seriously. They're pastel.

74
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,510
Hey, guys! Wait, wait!

75
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:58,019
Hey, guys, wait for me!

76
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:01,386
Oh, my God!
Look at the size of that thing.

77
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,689
- We could drive that to Connecticut.
- I'm putting my name on that card.

78
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:07,628
All right.
Go, go, go, go.

79
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,628
Does anybody know how to drive?

80
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:23,308
As I turned the midsize coupe
onto Hollyhock Lane...

81
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:26,314
I was struck by how a place
so filled with nature...

82
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:29,408
could look so unnatural.

83
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,323
Oh, Toto, I don't think
we're in Manhattan anymore.

84
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,433
Her house is beautiful!

85
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:48,300
Oh, and look at her dog!

86
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,771
Hey, boy!
Come here, boy!

87
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,467
Come on, boy!

88
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:59,176
Why didn't he come?

89
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:01,012
Invisible electric fencing.

90
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:03,678
It's the latest thing.
My sister has it.

91
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:07,453
Ready, girls?

92
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:08,957
Let's go.

93
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,698
Charlotte sweetie,
don't forget our gift.

94
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,639
- Look at you! You're huge!
- I know.

95
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,684
Isn't it great?
I can eat anything I want. Jealous?

96
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:38,283
Come on in. Come in.

97
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,817
Brigid, Roxanne, these are
my friends from the city.

98
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,826
We didn't think you'd make it.

99
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,362
We got lost.
We took the wrong bridge.

100
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,228
Remember that feeling,
like if you left Manhattan...

101
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,995
you'd fall off
the edge of the earth?

102
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,298
Oh, God, don't remind me.

103
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:59,504
Oh, my God!
It's the Bellini baby basket!

104
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,339
Oh, look, everybody!

105
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:04,380
It's the Bellini baby basket!

106
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,645
Speaking of Bellinis,
I'm gonna have a big drink.

107
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:10,151
Jealous?

108
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:15,053
Is she still barhopping
and bed-hopping?

109
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:17,786
It's so sad
when that's all you have.

110
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,886
Okay, this is Rebecca...

111
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:23,728
- Susan...
- Hello.

112
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,199
Mindy.

113
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,862
Don't get up.
She's doing in vitro.

114
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:31,031
She's not supposed to move at all.

115
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:33,007
That's Betsy and her boy Harry.

116
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:35,010
They're inseparable.
They do everything together.

117
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:37,444
We call them
our old married couple.

118
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:40,949
Except it's not that funny since Betsy
and her husband are getting divorced.

119
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,951
Laney, we need you!

120
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:49,289
So all I have to do to meet
the ideal man is give birth to him.

121
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:52,453
I love my son.
Andy is 11 months old.

122
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:55,725
He is a god,
and I tell him so every day.

123
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:01,367
Thirty years from now,
what do you think the chances are...

124
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:04,463
that some woman's gonna be able
to make Andy happy?

125
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,303
I'm gonna go with zero.

126
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,681
Oh, it's adorable!

127
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,410
Look at that Charlotte.

128
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:17,248
I wish they made this in my size.

129
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,754
I told you, it's a cult.
We can't separate.

130
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:22,290
Once they isolate you from the herd,
it's all over.

131
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,786
As I watched Laney
tear open a baby bib...

132
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:27,796
with the same enthusiasm
she once reserved...

133
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:29,923
for tearing off rock stars' pants...

134
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,490
I couldn't help but wonder...

135
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,559
"Was I next?"

136
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:39,137
You know what?
I have to pee.

137
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,575
If you're not back in five minutes,
I'm coming after you.

138
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:48,884
The truth is,
I needed to escape.

139
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:51,511
The party had turned
into a preview...

140
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:54,522
a preview of a life
I didn't know if I was ready for.

141
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:05,093
Even seven months pregnant,
Laney couldn't keep her clothes on.

142
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:08,399
Clearly, a part of the old Laney
had survived.

143
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:10,939
But I wondered,
what was still buried...

144
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,601
deep inside the mommies downstairs?

145
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:17,271
Before I married my husband,
I slept around with everybody.

146
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:20,440
Now I have an Internet lover.

147
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,108
No one knows.

148
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:28,123
When I was senior vice president,
212 people reported to me daily.

149
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,455
Now I just yell at the gardener...

150
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,721
who doesn't understand
a single word.

151
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:37,696
I'm exactly the same.
I love my life.

152
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:42,136
But every now and then,
I can't help but think about...

153
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:43,866
Lisa.

154
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,637
Sometimes I climb up
into the kids' tree house...

155
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,373
with my Walkman,
light up a joint...

156
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:53,415
and listen to Peter Frampton.

157
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:12,259
There's a woman in there breast-feeding
a child who can chew steak.

158
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:14,769
You know how I feel about that?

159
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:18,273
If you can ask for it,
you're probably too old to have it.

160
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,002
Jeremy, no!

161
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,005
I just realized...

162
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,014
maybe it's maturity
or the wisdom that comes with age...

163
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:30,576
but the witch in Hänsel and Gretel,
she's very misunderstood.

164
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:33,622
I mean, the woman builds
her dream house...

165
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,284
and these brats come along
and start eating it.

166
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:42,754
I just have to tell you
your home is beautiful.

167
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:46,268
Thank you.
I know it's a big change.

168
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:49,600
But at some point,
you have to settle down.

169
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:52,163
I mean, life is not
a Jacqueline Susann novel...

170
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:55,540
four friends looking
for life and love in the big city.

171
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:01,715
Stop it! You are not going
to clean up at your own shower.

172
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:06,483
Relax, 'cause once Todd or Shayla comes
around, you'll never stop cleaning up.

173
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:08,524
Shayla? Did you say Shayla?

174
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,890
- It's so unique, isn't it?
- It's so my name!

175
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,797
- I thought your name was Charlotte.
- No, it's not my name.

176
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,163
It's my name,
my secret baby name...

177
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:21,795
that I made up when I was 11
for my daughter when I had her.

178
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:24,897
I told you.
Don't tell me you don't remember.

179
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:27,238
I'm sorry,
I really don't.

180
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,905
A complete lie. She remembered.
We all remembered.

181
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,040
Charlotte had made us all swear
never to use it.

182
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:38,780
- My husband heard it somewhere else.
- Really? Where? I didn't tell him.

183
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:42,120
I can't believe
you're freaking out over a name.

184
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:45,024
- You're not even pregnant.
- That's not the point!

185
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:47,892
- What's going on?
- She stole my baby name.

186
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,795
You bitch!

187
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:53,566
Let's go.

188
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:02,035
Beers and bar nuts
at Flanagan's off Route Five...

189
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,706
were the perfect antidote
to Laney's House of Humiliation.

190
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:09,945
If I hadn't waited this long to have
a baby, that name would be mine.

191
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,955
Come on. You're still young. You have
plenty of time to have children.

192
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,456
No, I don't.

193
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:19,187
I don't want to be
one of those 40-year-old moms.

194
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:22,959
- No offense.
- I don't want to be one of them either.

195
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:26,399
There are no frozen eggs
in my freezer.

196
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:28,334
Was the bathroom clean?

197
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:30,395
What do you think?

198
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:34,807
This is why I hate baby showers.
You always leave feeling depressed.

199
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:37,072
Paddy, another round.

200
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,512
Well, I, for one, love my life.

201
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:43,143
And I will not be made to feel
inadequate by all this baby talk.

202
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,814
I spoke to a woman
with a master's in finance.

203
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,824
All she wanted to talk about
was her Diaper Genie.

204
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:51,826
It doesn't have to be like that.

205
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:54,260
You don't have to lose yourself
to have a kid.

206
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,924
I know plenty
of cool, hip mothers...

207
00:12:56,999 --> 00:13:01,197
who live in the city and still have
great careers and stuff.

208
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,703
Who?

209
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,272
I'm late.
I missed my period.

210
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,936
Paddy, honey,
where are those beers?

211
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:10,444
How late?

212
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:13,949
I don't know, just a few...
Seven days.

213
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:16,610
Oh, honey, gray area.

214
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:19,120
True, you're in front
of the firing squad...

215
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:21,179
but you haven't been shot.

216
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:25,091
- I was once ten days late.
- Really? Were you having sex?

217
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:28,028
No.

218
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:32,231
What are you going to do?
You gonna tell Mr. Big?

219
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:35,737
I am not going to tell him
until I know what l...

220
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:38,205
till I know how l... what...

221
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:42,872
No, I am not going to tell him...

222
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:45,641
until I know how to finish
this sentence.

223
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:50,712
- What did I miss?
- Nothing.

224
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:55,823
That night, Charlotte
got out her wish box...

225
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,917
where she kept reminders of
all the things she hoped for in life...

226
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:02,254
a gift for Shayla...

227
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,392
a town house in the city...

228
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,665
a beach house in East Hampton...

229
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,074
her dream man...

230
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:19,814
her backup dream man.

231
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:26,311
It's very strange when the life
you never had flashes before your eyes.

232
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:30,022
Carrie Held Hostage: Day Eight.

233
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:31,957
Miranda and I went shopping.

234
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:35,964
I'm on total ovary overload.
Which kind do I get?

235
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:38,865
Here. This one's on sale,
half off.

236
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:42,768
Sweetie, I just spent $395 on a pair
of open-toed Gucci's last week.

237
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,432
This is not the place to be frugal.

238
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,271
What about this one?

239
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,004
I remember First Response.

240
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:52,104
I had a very reassuring moment once
with First Response.

241
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,950
Here's hoping.

242
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,610
What if I am?

243
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,589
If you am, you am.

244
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:05,627
I don't think I'd be
very good at this.

245
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:07,958
I mean, am I maternal?

246
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:14,066
When I was a girl, I left my baby doll
in the rain for four days.

247
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:16,263
Her face peeled off.
That can't be good.

248
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:19,239
- But if you...
- I shaved my Barbie's head.

249
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:23,705
When I was little, I took a rubber band
and put it around my dog's snout.

250
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,848
- What?
- God.

251
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,414
Can you picture it, us with...

252
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,354
Kids?

253
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:38,416
- Babies.
- I'll probably end up with five.

254
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:41,827
Five hours
and two packs of gum later...

255
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,865
I decided
I couldn't take the test...

256
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,425
till I knew exactly how I felt
about the results, either way.

257
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:55,873
- Hello?
- It's Laney.

258
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,942
I just wanted to tell you
it was so great seeing you guys.

259
00:16:00,015 --> 00:16:04,418
I know I was a big bitch, but you
gotta know my hormones are going wild.

260
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:08,856
The truth is, Laney's hormones
have been going wild since she was ten.

261
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:12,257
Seeing you made me remember
how much fun we used to have.

262
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:15,297
We did. It's amazing
how much time has gone by.

263
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:17,195
Tell me about it.

264
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:20,030
But I miss us. I really do.

265
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:23,037
- We should get together more often.
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:27,367
We should get together,
not just say we're going to...

267
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:29,377
but really do it.

268
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,970
Absolutely. Listen, I've gotta go.
I'm running late.

269
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:35,483
- Where are you off to?
- Samantha's having one of her parties.

270
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:37,143
- She is?
- Yeah.

271
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:41,155
Oh, man! That's the kind of thing...
I love Samantha's parties.

272
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:44,750
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Next time. I promise, all right?

273
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,260
Okay, bye.

274
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:50,895
Faced with her own inadequacies...

275
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,560
Samantha did something
only Samantha could do.

276
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:55,900
She threw
an l-don't-have-a-baby shower...

277
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,996
to let everyone know
she was fabulous.

278
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,904
Great to see you!

279
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,068
Oh! I don't have a baby!

280
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:03,771
Everybody drink!

281
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:09,576
- Are you having fun?
- Yes, but not as much fun as Miranda.

282
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:12,485
Still convinced that marriage
plus baby equals death...

283
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:14,318
Miranda chose life...

284
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,052
also known as Ed,
Samantha's accountant.

285
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,594
If she fucks on that couch,
she buys it.

286
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:29,869
Hey, you guys,
the entertainment has arrived!

287
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:36,109
- What are you doing here?
- What I do best... partying!

288
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:38,942
- Maybe we better sit down.
- Fuck no! Where's the bar?

289
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:42,040
- Somebody get me a drink!
- You think that's a good idea?

290
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:45,609
Fuck yeah. I'm due any day.
What's one little drink gonna matter?

291
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:48,623
Maybe it'll help me go into labor.

292
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:52,952
She gives birth on that couch,
she buys it.

293
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,656
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

294
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,596
- I missed you guys.
- Us?

295
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,998
The pathetic, live-for-the-moment
single girls...

296
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:02,367
who think that life
is a Jacqueline Susann novel?

297
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:06,306
I'm sure you get asked this
all the time, but what is your problem?

298
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,903
My problem? Just that I had a dream
and you killed it, in a nutshell.

299
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,472
Really? You're lucky, because at least
you know what happened to your dream.

300
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,383
I have absolutely no idea
what happened to mine.

301
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:19,216
Hi, Laney!

302
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,382
I spent the next hour
keeping Charlotte away from Laney...

303
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,392
and Laney away from the vodka.

304
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,553
Look who came up for air.

305
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,826
He's a good kisser
and he's gonna do my taxes for free.

306
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:31,923
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Hey, Carrie.

307
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,263
Hey, Jonathan.

308
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:36,133
I've been talking to your friend
Charlotte. She's great.

309
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:39,368
- Is she seeing anybody?
- Wide open.

310
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,671
Just don't mention
the name Shayla.

311
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,371
- I'm sorry?
- Nothing.

312
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:46,039
It's a private joke.
Go forth and date.

313
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,816
His name was Jonathan Bix.

314
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:50,818
He was a trader at Bear Sterns...

315
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:54,913
and had just closed escrow
on a house in the Hamptons.

316
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,187
Charlotte suddenly realized
all was not lost.

317
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,023
As she sipped her beer...

318
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:03,121
she mentally Scotch-taped
her dream house back together again.

319
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,927
This party sucks.

320
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:11,439
Laney, maybe we should think
about getting you home, all right?

321
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:13,941
No, I don't wanna go back there.

322
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,471
Who wants to see my tits?

323
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:21,976
I'll take a look.

324
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:24,485
Laney, come on. Come back.
Don't do this.

325
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,714
Relax! It'll be fun!

326
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:30,156
All right, look.
Now we're gonna have a party.

327
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:32,455
Pregnant lady showin' her tits!

328
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:37,156
Oh, my God.

329
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:39,325
This is at once so sad...

330
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:43,360
and the most fabulous validation
I've ever gotten in my life.

331
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,115
This is weird.

332
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:02,246
I don't think I can do this.

333
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:03,552
No biggie.

334
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:09,793
Despite her best efforts
to run free...

335
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,834
it appeared that Laney Berlin's
invisible electric fence...

336
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,062
stretched all the way to Manhattan.

337
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:20,441
No, I know I can do it.
Just give me one more chance.

338
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:24,104
Laney, it's not who you are anymore.
It's all right.

339
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:29,613
I didn't know that was gonna happen.
Nobody told me that was gonna happen.

340
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:32,347
I mean, somebody should warn you.

341
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,614
It's all right.

342
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:41,729
One day you're gonna wake up,
and you're not gonna recognize yourself.

343
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:51,735
Can you take her to Connecticut?

344
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,853
I spent the next day sitting on
a park bench watching children play.

345
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,983
If I had to, could I do this?

346
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:15,790
Would I be any good?

347
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:20,391
Would I somehow manage to stay me?

348
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:31,779
Hello. Oh, my!

349
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:35,680
Oh, sorry.

350
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,083
That's okay.
She's adorable.

351
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:40,178
Yeah, most of the time.

352
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,951
You wanna go home?
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,391
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

354
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,926
On the way home...

355
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,764
I got my period.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
