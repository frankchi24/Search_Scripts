1
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:53,008
Once upon a time,
an English journalist came to New York.

2
00:00:57,847 --> 00:00:59,815
Elizabeth was attractive and bright.

3
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:03,910
Right away she hooked up with one of
the city's typically eligible bachelors.

4
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:06,979
The question remains...
Is this really a company we want to own?

5
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:11,221
Tim was 42, a well-liked
and respected investment banker...

6
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:13,728
who made about two million a year.

7
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,727
They met one evening,
in typical New York fashion...

8
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:21,737
at a gallery opening.

9
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:30,413
Like it?

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,506
Yes, actually.
I think it's quite interesting.

11
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:35,980
What?

12
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,612
I feel like
I know you from somewhere.

13
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:40,679
Doubtful.
I only just moved here from London.

14
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:44,659
London? Really?
That's my all-time favorite city.

15
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,060
- It is?
- Absolutely.

16
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,155
It was love at first sight.

17
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,824
You know...

18
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:55,003
I think perhaps I have met you
somewhere before.

19
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:02,009
For two weeks they snuggled...

20
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:05,840
went to romantic restaurants...

21
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,979
had wonderful sex...

22
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:14,318
and shared
their most intimate secrets.

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,557
One warm spring day...

24
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:21,893
he took her to a town house he saw
in Sunday's New York Times.

25
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:24,798
How 'bout if we start at the top
and work our way down?

26
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,496
There are four bedrooms upstairs.
Do you have any children?

27
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,003
Not yet.

28
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,441
That day, Tim popped the question.

29
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,104
How'd you like to have dinner
with my folks Tuesday night?

30
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,739
I'd love to.

31
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:41,306
On Tuesday,
he called with some bad news.

32
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:43,944
My mother's not feeling very well.

33
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,578
Well, gosh, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:48,249
- Could we take a rain check?
- Of course.

35
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,158
Tell your mum
I hope she feels better.

36
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,794
When she hadn't heard from him
for two weeks, she called.

37
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:58,595
Tim, it's Elizabeth.
That's an awfully long rain check.

38
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:01,796
He said he was up to his ears
and that he'd call her the next day.

39
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:06,633
He never did call, of course.
Bastard.

40
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,009
- She told me one day over coffee.
- I don't understand.

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,914
In England, looking at houses together
would have meant something.

42
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:17,510
Then I realized no one had told her
about the end of love in Manhattan.

43
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:23,051
Welcome to the age of "un-innocence."

44
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:28,687
No one has breakfast at Tiffany's,
and no one has affairs to remember.

45
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:31,427
Instead,
we have breakfast at 7:00 a. M...

46
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:34,299
and affairs we try to forget
as quickly as possible.

47
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:39,303
Self-protection and
closing the deal are paramount.

48
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:42,641
Cupid has flown the co-op.

49
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:47,408
How the hell did we
get into this mess?

50
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:53,144
There are maybe tens of thousands
of women like this in the city.

51
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:56,852
We all know them,
and we all agree they're great.

52
00:03:56,926 --> 00:04:00,054
They travel. They pay taxes.

53
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,827
They'll spend $400 on a pair
of Manolo Blahnik strappy sandals.

54
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,560
And they're alone.

55
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:13,165
It's like the riddle of the Sphinx.

56
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:16,076
Why are there so many
great unmarried women...

57
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:19,172
and no great unmarried men?

58
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,683
I explore these sorts of issues
in my column...

59
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,083
and I have terrific sources: My friends.

60
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:27,885
When you're a young guy in your 20s,
women are controlling the relationship.

61
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,482
So by the time you're
an eligible man in your 30s...

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
you feel like you're being
devoured by women.

63
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:36,529
Suddenly, the guys are
holding all the chips.

64
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:39,830
I call it the mid-30s power flip.

65
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,837
It's all about age and biology.

66
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:50,311
I mean, if you want to get married,
it's to have kids, right?

67
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,747
Not with someone older than 35, 'cause
you have to have kids right away...

68
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,047
and that's about it.

69
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:59,316
I think these women should
just forget about marriage...

70
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,981
and have a good time.

71
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:08,356
I have a friend who'd always gone out
with extremely sexy guys...

72
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,365
and just had a good time.

73
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:13,561
One day she woke up,
and she was 41.

74
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:17,128
She couldn't get any more dates.
She had a complete physical breakdown...

75
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:21,337
couldn't hold her job and moved back
to Wisconsin to live with her mother.

76
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:29,183
Trust me... this is not a story
that makes men feel bad.

77
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:33,313
Most men are threatened
by successful women.

78
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,381
If you want to get these guys,
you have to keep your mouth shut...

79
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,393
and play by the rules.

80
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:44,427
I totally believe
that love conquers all.

81
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,799
Sometimes you just have to
give it a little space...

82
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,270
and that's exactly what's missing
in Manhattan...

83
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,534
the space for romance.

84
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,369
The problem is expectations.

85
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:59,609
Older women don't want to settle
for what's available.

86
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:06,019
By the time you reach your mid-30s
you think, "Why should I settle?"

87
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:09,557
You know?

88
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:12,288
It's like the older we get,
the more we keep self-selecting...

89
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:15,160
down to a smaller and smaller group.

90
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,222
What women really want is
Alec Baldwin.

91
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:23,234
There's not one woman in New York who
hasn't turned down 10 wonderful guys...

92
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:26,969
because they were
too short or too fat or too poor.

93
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:30,479
I have been out with some of
those guys... the short, fat, poor ones.

94
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:32,174
It makes absolutely no difference.

95
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:36,014
They are just as self-centered and
unappreciative as the good-Iooking ones.

96
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:39,054
Why don't these women
just marry a fat guy?

97
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:44,116
Why don't they just marry
a big, fat tub of lard?

98
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:49,358
Happy birthday, dear Miranda

99
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:52,993
Happy birthday to you

100
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,199
Another 30-something birthday with
a group of unmarried female friends.

101
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:59,969
We would all have preferred
a nice celebratory conference call.

102
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:01,840
- You were saying?
- Look.

103
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:05,506
If you're a successful single woman
in this city, you have two choices:

104
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,142
You can bang your head against the wall
and try and find a relationship...

105
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,981
or you can say "screw it,"
and just go out and have sex like a man.

106
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:16,492
- You mean with dildos?
- No, I mean without feeling.

107
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,255
Samantha was a New York inspiration.

108
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,263
A public relations executive...

109
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:24,823
she routinely slept
with good-Iooking guys in their 20s.

110
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:28,393
Remember that guy I was going out with?
Oh, God, what was his name? Drew.

111
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:30,962
- Drew the sex god.
- Right. Afterwards?

112
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,168
I didn't feel a thing. It was like,
"Hey, babe, gotta go. Catch ya later."

113
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:36,837
And I completely
forgot about him after that.

114
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:39,575
But are you sure that isn't
just 'cause he didn't call you?

115
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:42,982
Sweetheart, this is the first time
in the history of Manhattan...

116
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:45,384
that women have had
as much money and power as men...

117
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,822
plus the equal luxury
of treating men like sex objects.

118
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:51,883
Yeah, except men in this city
fail on both counts.

119
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:53,895
I mean, they don't want to be
in a relationship with you...

120
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,488
but as soon as you only want them
for sex, they don't like it.

121
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:59,057
All of a sudden they can't perform
the way they're supposed to.

122
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:02,366
- That's when you dump them.
- Ladies, are we really that cynical?

123
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,372
What about romance?

124
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,101
- Yeah!
- Who needs it?

125
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,700
It's like that guy, Jeremiah,
the poet.

126
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:11,804
I mean, the sex was incredible.

127
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,044
But then he wanted to read me
his poetry and go out to dinner...

128
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:17,882
and the whole chat bit, and I'm like,
"Let's not even go there."

129
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,889
What are you saying? That you're just
going to give up on love?

130
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:23,016
- That's sick.
- No, no, no. Believe me...

131
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:25,458
the right guy comes along,
and you two here, this whole thing...

132
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,758
- right out the window.
- That's right!

133
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,233
Listen to me! The right guy is
an illusion. Start living your lives.

134
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:36,601
So you think it's really possible
to pull off this whole...

135
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,334
women-having-sex-like-men thing?

136
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:42,037
- You're forgetting The Last Seduction.
- You're obsessed with that movie.

137
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:47,640
Okay, Linda Fiorentino fucking that guy
up against the chain-link fence.

138
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:50,584
And never having one of those "Oh,
my God, what have I done?" epiphanies.

139
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,086
I hated that movie.

140
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,051
Was it true?

141
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:00,221
Were women in New York really giving up
on love and throttling up on power?

142
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,732
What a tempting thought.

143
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:11,337
I'm beginning to think the only place
one can still find love and romance...

144
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:14,376
in New York is the gay community.

145
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:17,277
It's straight love
that's become closeted.

146
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:19,314
Stanford Blatch was
one of my closest friends.

147
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:24,081
He owned a talent agency and, at
the moment, was down to a single client.

148
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,984
So, are you telling me...

149
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:27,955
that you're in love?

150
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:31,289
How could I possibly
sustain a relationship?

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,386
You know Derek takes up like,
a thousand percent of my time.

152
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:37,262
Don't you think
that's a bit obsessive?

153
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,200
I'm a passionate person.
His career is all I care about.

154
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,864
When that's under control, then I can
concentrate on my personal life.

155
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,137
Stanford, he's an underwear model.

156
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,236
With a billboard in Times Square.

157
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:52,838
Oh, my God. Don't turn around.

158
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:55,406
The loathe of your life is
at the bar.

159
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:58,017
It was Kurt Harrington...

160
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:01,318
a mistake I made when I was 26...

161
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,255
and 29...

162
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:04,657
and 31.

163
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,662
Carrie, don't even go there.

164
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,595
What?
Do you think I'm a masochist?

165
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,257
- The man is scum.
- Good.

166
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:15,236
Because I don't have the patience to
clean up this mess for the fourth time.

167
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:18,239
Will you relax?
I don't have a shred of feeling left.

168
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,604
Thank God.

169
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:23,503
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to visit the ladies' room.

170
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:28,646
It was true.
I no longer felt a thing for Kurt.

171
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:32,484
After all these years,
I finally saw him for what he was:

172
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,921
A self-centered, withholding creep...

173
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:37,687
who was still the best sex
I ever had in my life.

174
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,287
However, I did have
a little experiment in mind.

175
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,434
Wow. What are you doin' here?

176
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:53,941
Hey, babe.

177
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:58,442
- God, you look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

178
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:02,313
So, how's life?

179
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:05,445
Not bad. Can't complain. You?

180
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:08,456
Oh, you know, just writing the column.
The usual.

181
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:11,618
So, you seeing anyone special?

182
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,659
Not really. You?

183
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,960
Oh, just a couple guys.

184
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:20,762
- Well, you look good, though.
- So do you.

185
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:27,003
So...

186
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,874
what are you doing later?

187
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,540
I thought you weren't talking to me
for the rest of your life.

188
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:34,708
Who said anything about talking?

189
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:40,478
What do you say to my place, 3:00?

190
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:43,957
All right. See ya there.

191
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:59,170
Are you out of your mind?
What the hell do you think you're doing?

192
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:02,143
Oh, calm down.
It's research.

193
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:05,810
Oh, God. Oh, Kurt.

194
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:08,510
Kurt was just like I remembered...

195
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,883
better... because this time...

196
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:15,287
there would be none of that
messy emotional attachment.

197
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:27,125
All righty. My turn.

198
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, sorry.
I have to go back to work.

199
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:33,967
What? Are you kiddin'?
You're serious?

200
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:36,705
Oh, yeah. Completely.
But I'll give you a call.

201
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,644
Maybe we can do it again sometime.

202
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,349
Yeah, but...

203
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:47,183
As I began to get dressed,
I realized that I'd done it.

204
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,888
I'd just had sex like a man.

205
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:56,622
I left feeling powerful,
potent and incredibly alive.

206
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:58,564
I felt like I owned this city.

207
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,125
Nothing and no one
could get in my way.

208
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:14,246
- Number one, he's very handsome.
- There ya go.

209
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:17,150
Number two, he's not wearing
a wedding ring.

210
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:22,486
Number three, he knows I carry
textured Trojans with a reservoir tip.

211
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:23,820
Thanks a lot.

212
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:25,793
Anytime.

213
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:45,614
Later that night,
Skipper Johnston met me for coffee...

214
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,774
and confessed
a shocking intimate secret.

215
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,579
Thank you.

216
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:52,246
Do you know that it has been,
like, a year?

217
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:54,948
Really?

218
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:57,424
I don't understand that.
You're such a nice guy.

219
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:00,724
That's the problem.
I'm too nice, you know?

220
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:03,993
I'm a romantic.
I just have so much feeling.

221
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:06,034
Are you sure you're not gay?

222
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:09,003
No! I'm sensitive...

223
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:11,801
and I don't objectify women.

224
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:15,366
You know, most guys,
when they meet a girl...

225
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:18,504
the first thing that they see is...

226
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,446
- You know...
- Pussy?

227
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,609
Oh, God! Oh!

228
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:25,449
I hate that word.

229
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:28,422
Don't you have any friends
that you can hook me up with?

230
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:32,092
- They're too old for you.
- I like older women.

231
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:35,163
Maybe.

232
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:38,826
- Maybe my friend Miranda.
- When?

233
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:42,667
Tomorrow night. We're all going
downtown to this club, Chaos.

234
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,330
Great.

235
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,475
Don't tell her I'm nice.

236
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,872
Miranda was gonna hate Skipper.

237
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,347
She'd think he was mocking her
with his sweet nature...

238
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,284
and decide he was an asshole...

239
00:14:57,353 --> 00:15:00,288
the way she had decided
all men were assholes.

240
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:09,095
- Hello?
- Hey, Carrie, it's Charlotte.

241
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,792
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

242
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,834
Look, I can't meet you guys
for dinner tomorrow night...

243
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,961
because I have an amazing date.

244
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,129
With who?

245
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:19,641
Capote Duncan. He's supposedly some
big shot in the publishing world.

246
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,936
- Do you know him?
- Did I know him?

247
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,138
He was one of the city's most
notoriously "un-gettable" bachelors.

248
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:29,116
Wait, don't even answer that question
because, frankly, I don't care.

249
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:34,384
And another thing. I'm not buying any
of that women-having-sex-like-men crap.

250
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:39,292
I didn't tell her about my afternoon of
cheap and easy sex and how good it felt.

251
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:43,024
All right. Fine. Have a good time,
and promise to tell me everything.

252
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,691
Well, if you're lucky.

253
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,928
- Bye.
- All right. Bye.

254
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,138
Friday night at Chaos.

255
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:56,736
It was just like that bar in "Cheers"
where everybody knows your name...

256
00:15:56,812 --> 00:16:00,475
except here they were likely
to forget it five minutes later.

257
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:02,709
Hi.

258
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:08,155
Still, it was the creme de la creme
of New York whipped into a frenzy.

259
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:10,556
Sometimes you got a souffle...

260
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:13,885
sometimes cottage cheese.

261
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,932
It is like a model bomb
exploded in this room tonight.

262
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,526
Is there a woman here aside from me
who weights more than a hundred pounds?

263
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:23,299
I know.
It's like "Undereaters Anonymous."

264
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:24,999
That's funny, Skippy.

265
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,975
- Skipper.
- I have this theory...

266
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:32,571
that men secretly hate pretty girls
because they rejected them in school.

267
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:35,310
Right. But if you're not
part of the "Beauty Olympics"...

268
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:38,979
you can still become
a very interesting person.

269
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:40,715
Are you saying
that I'm not pretty enough?

270
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,780
No, no, no.
Of course you are.

271
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:45,190
So, ipso facto,
I can't be interesting?

272
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,195
Women fall into one of two categories:

273
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:50,664
Beautiful and boring
or homely and interesting, is that it?

274
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,224
No, that's not what I meant.

275
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:55,998
Excuse me.
Is this your hand on my knee?

276
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,571
Let's just keep 'em
where I can see 'em, all right?

277
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:03,601
Well, I guess you must
find me beautiful.

278
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,273
- Or interesting.
- I was about to rescue Skipper...

279
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:09,579
from an increasingly hopeless situation,
when suddenly...

280
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,951
Lucky me, twice in one week.

281
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,651
Well, I don't know if you're going
to be getting that lucky.

282
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:18,920
You know, I was really pissed off
the way you left the other day.

283
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,655
- You were?
- Yeah.

284
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:22,924
Then I thought, how great!

285
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:24,727
You finally understand
the kind of relationship I want...

286
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,392
and now we can have sex
without commitment.

287
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:31,637
Yeah. Right. Sure. I guess.

288
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,972
- So when I feel like it, I'll call you.
- Yeah, please.

289
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:38,411
Whenever you feel like it.
If I'm alone, I'm all yours.

290
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,471
Right.

291
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:41,846
I like this new you.

292
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,248
Call me.

293
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,411
Yup.

294
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,683
I didn't understand.

295
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:53,217
Did all men secretly want their women
promiscuous and emotionally detached?

296
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:58,062
And if I was really having sex like a
man, why didn't I feel more in control?

297
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,693
You see that guy?
He's the next Donald Trump...

298
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,465
except he's younger
and much better looking.

299
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:06,865
Hi.

300
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:09,001
- You know him?
- No.

301
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:10,909
I've never seen him in my life.

302
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,575
He usually dates models, but, hey,
I'm as good-Iooking as a model...

303
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,175
plus I own my own business.

304
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:19,585
Samantha had the kind
of deluded self-confidence...

305
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:22,488
that caused men like Ross Perot
to run for president...

306
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,186
and it usually got her
what she wanted.

307
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,729
Well, if you're not gonna hit on him,
I will.

308
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,525
And there she went...

309
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:32,590
off to take her best shot
with Mr. Big.

310
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:39,903
Meanwhile, Charlotte York was having
a splendid evening with Capote Duncan.

311
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:42,876
Wanna go back to my place
and see the Ross Blechner?

312
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:45,539
I'd love to,
but it's really getting late.

313
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:47,206
No problem.

314
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:53,745
- What year was it painted again?
- '89.

315
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:56,052
Though Charlotte was determined
to play hard-to-get...

316
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,616
she didn't want to end the evening
too abruptly.

317
00:18:58,694 --> 00:19:02,027
Well, maybe just for a minute.

318
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:10,569
This could easily go
for a hundred grand.

319
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,869
Ross is so hot right now.

320
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,706
It's beautiful.

321
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:20,113
No, you're beautiful.

322
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:26,419
Thank you for tonight.

323
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:28,319
- Yeah?
- I had a wonderful time.

324
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,982
Well, it was my pleasure.

325
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:48,468
I have to get up
really early tomorrow.

326
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,708
I'll get you a cab.

327
00:19:56,618 --> 00:20:00,782
Charlotte told me she thought she had
played the entire evening flawlessly.

328
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:09,363
So, what are you doing
next Saturday?

329
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:12,662
I'm having dinner with you.

330
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:25,245
- You're going to the West Side, right?
- Right. West Fourth and Bank, please.

331
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:30,675
Hey, scoot over, will ya?
Two stops:

332
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:32,983
Fourth and Bank and...

333
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:34,682
West Broadway and Broom.

334
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:38,921
- You're going to Chaos?
- Oh. Yeah.

335
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:41,789
Why?

336
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,522
Look, I understand
where you're coming from...

337
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,465
and I totally respect it...

338
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:50,062
but I really need
to have sex tonight.

339
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,399
Back at Chaos...

340
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:57,672
things were swinging into high gear...

341
00:20:57,746 --> 00:21:00,340
and Samantha was
putting the moves on Mr. Big.

342
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,577
I've been smoking cigars for years...

343
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,949
back when they were
terminally uncool.

344
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,319
I've got this great source that sends me
Hondurans. Do you want to try one?

345
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,790
- No, thank you.
- Really? You can't find them anywhere.

346
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:14,894
Cohibas... that's all I smoke.

347
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:24,566
Look, I do the PR for this club...

348
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:28,468
and I have the key
to the private room downstairs.

349
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:30,508
Really?

350
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,311
You want a private tour?

351
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:39,285
No, thanks,
but maybe another time.

352
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:47,490
Meanwhile...

353
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:51,863
Skipper Johnston was hopelessly smitten
with Miranda Hobbes.

354
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:55,461
- So, where we goin' now?
- Listen, Skippy...

355
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:58,700
you know, you really are a nice,
sweet guy, but...

356
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:02,007
Oh, I understand.

357
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:03,339
Good night.

358
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:12,751
Miranda told me later
that she thought he was too nice...

359
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,654
but that she was willing
to overlook one flaw...

360
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,954
and Capote Duncan found his fix
for the night.

361
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:26,357
Where is it?
I wanna see the Ross Blechner.

362
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:28,096
Wait. Later.

363
00:22:28,837 --> 00:22:30,099
Later.

364
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:42,317
Oh, listen, l...

365
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:44,079
I gotta get up really early...

366
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:46,552
and, actually, you can't stay over.

367
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:48,283
Cool?

368
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:50,791
Sure. I have to
get up really early too.

369
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,302
Taxi! Taxi!

370
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,675
And so another Friday night
in Manhattan crept towards dawn.

371
00:23:20,322 --> 00:23:24,156
Just when I thought
I would have to do the unspeakable...

372
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:25,591
walk home...

373
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:39,570
Well, get in, for Christ's sakes.

374
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:52,442
- Where can I drop you?
- 72nd Street and Third Avenue.

375
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,822
- Have you got that, Al?
- Yes, sir.

376
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:59,926
So, what have you been
doing lately?

377
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:02,555
You mean besides going out
every night?

378
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:04,565
Yeah. I mean,
what do you do for work?

379
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,191
Well, this is my work.

380
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:09,066
I'm sort of a sexual anthropologist.

381
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:13,039
You mean like a hooker?

382
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:17,503
I write a column called
"Sex and the City."

383
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:20,571
Right now I'm researching an article
about women who have sex like men.

384
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,411
You know, they have sex...

385
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:25,976
and then afterwards
they feel nothing.

386
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:29,683
- But you're not like that.
- Well, aren't you?

387
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:33,926
Not a drop.
Not even half a drop.

388
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,165
Wow. What's wrong with you?

389
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:43,296
I get it.

390
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:45,840
You've never been in love.

391
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:48,199
Oh, yeah?

392
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:49,538
Yeah.

393
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:54,614
Suddenly I felt
the wind knocked out of me.

394
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:57,777
I wanted to crawl under the covers
and go right to sleep.

395
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:09,661
- Thanks for the ride.
- Anytime.

396
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:15,231
Wait.

397
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:23,106
Have you ever been in love?

398
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:26,780
Abso-fuckin'-lutely.

399
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,449
