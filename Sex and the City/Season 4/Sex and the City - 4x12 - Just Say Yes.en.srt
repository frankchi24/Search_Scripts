1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,029
New Yorkwelcomes and shelters

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,668
the tired, the poor, the persecuted,

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,070
who have been forced to leave their homes

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,992
at the whim of a ruling class.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,188
Therefore, it's ironic that Manhattanites
face the same horrible uncertainty,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,194
knowing that any day they may have
to utter the tragic words...

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,430
My building is going co-op.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,716
Did you get the tomatoes?

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,678
My building is going co-op.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,353
I have to move. This is a nightmare.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,555
Why don't you buy the place?

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,631
Yeah. OK, sure.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,792
- That's a great idea.
- Why not?

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,272
I just charged tomatoes. I'm not
in a position to buy an apartment.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,079
- I am.
- You are?

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,793
I had no idea.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,355
- Do you have a girlfriend, moneybags?
- She's sexy and I like it.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,033
Figures.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,636
Seriously.
Do you want to talk about this?

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,678
You're not buying my apartment for me.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,389
Not for you, for us. I could sell
my place, buy this place

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,835
and that place next door.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,797
We could tear down that wall.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,076
We could live together.

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,391
So then, what?

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,950
Would that make you my landlord
or my roommate?

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,590
- A little of both.
- What would the rent be like?

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,837
Like this?

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,233
Does that include utilities?

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,398
Think about it.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,516
I was tempted by his offer.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,830
We were spending most nights together

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,718
and we were in love.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,155
And moving is a pain in the ass.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,518
So were the hormone injections
Charlotte was facing nightly.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,671
I don't approve of this.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,638
You've got more hormones
than a teenage boy.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,189
This is what we have to do now.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,193
We should go back
to the old-fashioned way.

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,272
- Why not just wait for a stork?
- There's still a chance.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,000
- A very slim chance.
- That's good news.

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,914
If a patient had a slim chance of living,
is that good news?

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,992
Would you tell the family
he's got a shot in hell?

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,277
- Point taken.
- We have to try in vitro.

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,908
It took Peggy Woodruff seven years.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,197
- Who is Peggy Woodruff?
- I met her in the elevator.

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,113
A lot of couples have trouble
conceiving.

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,794
There are six in our building.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,589
What, you put up a flyer?
"We're barren, how about you?"

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,309
We're not barren.
We're reproductively challenged.

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,873
Peggy invited us over Friday
to hear about their experiences.

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,996
As tempting as that sounds,

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,833
we have the Scottish Society
Highland Fling then.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,198
- Do we have to fling?
- Yes, it's a family tradition.

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,875
First comes spring, then comes fling.
We go every year.

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,237
But when are we going to talk
to the Woodruffs?

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,791
I don't want to talk to them.
I'm a doctor. I'm familiar with in vitro.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,351
It's invasive, the success rate is low
and it can take years.

59
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,672
I know. So just in case, I put us
on the list for a Mandarin baby.

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,119
As Charlotte's plan for parenthood
progressed with or without Trey,

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,677
I began to wonder if Aidan's plan
was progressing without me.

62
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,109
He never officially moved in,
but his stuff was everywhere.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,954
- You're getting engaged!
- I threw up.

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,238
- I saw the ring and I threw up.
- That's my reaction to marriage.

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,073
- What will you do if he asks?
- I don't know.

66
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,199
- Just say yes.
- It hasn't been long enough.

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,113
- Has it?
- I got engaged after a month.

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,034
- How long before you separated?
- We're together now.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,873
- When it's right, you know.
- Carrie doesn't know.

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,157
- Carrie threw up.
- So it might not be right.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,357
Maybe it's because
my building is going co-op.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,556
Am I a real estate bride?

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,111
If there were unlimited apartments
in Manhattan, we'd all be single forever.

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,512
- What did the ring look like?
- That's the other thing.

75
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,078
- The ring was not good.
- What do you mean?

76
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,110
It was a pear-shaped diamond
with a gold band.

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,239
- No wonder you threw up.
- It's just not me.

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,676
- You wear gold jewellery.
- Like ghetto gold for fun,

79
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,752
but this is my engagement ring.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,919
I helped pick the ring.

81
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,952
- You knew?
- Aidan wanted a female perspective.

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,318
I was pregnant, shopping for a ring
with a man who's not my baby's father.

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,119
- It's no dream.
- At least you're pregnant.

84
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,831
Are you going to yell at me every time?
We've got seven months to go.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,515
I'll just say, "I'm not ready
to get engaged yet,

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,434
"but I love you and I want to live
with you." How does that sound?

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,194
- Like a no.
- It's a yes to living together.

88
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,193
That's a first for me.
Don't I get credit for that?

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,194
Just try to be nice. Down the road,
you might want to marry him.

90
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,911
I'm going to have to act surprised.
I wonder when it's going to happen?

91
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,789
- Do you know?
- No. I am no longer involved.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,512
Now you're not involved?
Now that I'm stuck with the bad ring?

93
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,071
That's a nice ring. Aidan should have
known that ring wasn't me.

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,596
How can I marry a guy
who doesn't know which ring is me?

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,116
Exactly, honey.
Wrong ring, wrong guy.

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,308
Is it true what Charlotte said?
Do you really know when it's right?

97
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,995
And how do you know?
Are there signs? Fireworks?

98
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,594
Is it right when it feels comfortable

99
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,435
or is that a sign that there aren't
any fireworks?

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,478
Is hesitation a sign
that it's not right

101
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,154
or a sign that you're not ready?

102
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,710
In matters of love,
how do you know when it's right?

103
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,038
Downtown, Samantha was meeting
with Mr Richard Wright,

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,795
the hotel magnate who was fast
becoming the pain in her ass.

105
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,552
You're late.

106
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,395
It took me 15 minutes
to get through your lobby.

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,471
Where's my London hotel?

108
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,235
Bobby De Niro stays at Blakes
and I'm knocked off the page.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,995
He has stayed at my place.
We gave him the penthouse suite.

110
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,551
Did you ask somebody what happened
or spend the morning accessorising?

111
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,156
I talked to the travel editor.
It won't happen again.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,117
I also got a feature
on the Barcelona property out of it.

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,915
Not bad.

114
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,117
- May I sit down now?
- What the hell.

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,509
What's with you?
Female trouble?

116
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
Let's just talk business, shall we?

117
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,791
- You can tell me. I'm human.
- All evidence to the contrary.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,992
I love that you're not scared of me.

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,637
My best friend
might be getting engaged.

120
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,680
She didn't want you as bridesmaid?

121
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,230
Why does everybody have to get
married? It's so cliché.

122
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,188
You're preaching to the converted.
I like to sleep around.

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,828
Whisk somebody off to Rio.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,037
It's the perfect nine-hour flight.

125
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,988
Dinner on the jet,
wake up in Brazil,

126
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,391
spend the weekend
at my little five-star hotel.

127
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,071
Who needs a wife
when you have a life?

128
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,075
That's all I'm saying.

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,593
Miranda had been waiting
for the right place and the right way

130
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,671
to tell Steve about the baby.

131
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,274
- You want sprinkles?
- I'm pregnant.

132
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,476
She settled for "right now".

133
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
- You're what?
- I'm pregnant.

134
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,954
And it's yours.

135
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,079
- That will be $6.
- Are you sure?

136
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,913
I've only had one shot
in the last few months.

137
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,119
- You've only had sex with me?
- It's been a slow summer.

138
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,676
OK, we're done here.

139
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,276
It's good to know my one ball
is still working.

140
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,837
So...what now?

141
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,278
- I'm going to have it.
- When we were together,

142
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,510
you said you weren't ready.

143
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,309
I'm still not ready.
When am I ever going to be ready?

144
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,439
I went into so much debt opening
my bar. Maybe I should sell it.

145
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,912
You don't have to do anything.
I'm going to take care of the baby.

146
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,868
You can visit whenever you want,
but it won't be your problem.

147
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,749
It's my decision and something
I want to do for me.

148
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,957
Then why did you want to talk
to me about it?

149
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,793
I just thought you should know.

150
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,194
I decided to head Aidan
off at the pass

151
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,830
by taking him out to dinner
and accepting his proposal.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,275
So...yes.

153
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,757
I say yes to living together.
We're ready for that step.

154
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,912
We have to work out the money.
We're individuals

155
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,275
but we'll be sharing a life

156
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,237
and an apartment.

157
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,869
So...

158
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,077
Yes, Aidan.
I would love to live with you.

159
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,429
That makes me really happy, Carrie,

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,912
- because there's something else...
- Could you excuse me?

161
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,310
- Are you OK?
- Just going to the bathroom.

162
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
What are you doing?

163
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,236
Are you talking to me?

164
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,958
No, I wasn't. I'm sorry.

165
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,474
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,512
- Did you want dessert?
- No. I would say no to dessert.

167
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,033
All right, then.

168
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,390
Listen, Carrie.

169
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,078
I know that you...

170
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,551
...wanted to pay,
but let me get this.

171
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,439
Your rent's about to skyrocket.

172
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,909
Give me a little something.

173
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,597
Good morning.

174
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,989
Good evening.

175
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,831
Goodnight.

176
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,271
You're learning Chinese?

177
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,635
I want to be able to speak
to the baby.

178
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,398
- Wouldn't we teach it to speak?
- Sometimes you get an older child.

179
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,313
We ought to try to understand
her heritage.

180
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,837
- It's a Mandarin girl now?
- It's mostly unwanted girls.

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,309
But since we're both dark-haired,

182
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,677
people won't immediately know
that she's not ours.

183
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,435
I hope you remembered
to pick up your kilt.

184
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,149
I really don't feel like going
to the fling tonight.

185
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,710
We have to go.
It's a family tradition.

186
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,599
We will not behave
like a typical barren couple.

187
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,638
We can't let this get us down.
We have to live!

188
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,756
Plus, I had a plaid dress made!

189
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,071
Maybe we should cut back
on your fertility drugs.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,956
Just a thought.

191
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,390
It's my first visit.

192
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,073
Taxi!

193
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,753
You've got nobody in there!

194
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,391
Hey, lady!

195
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,916
Need a ride?

196
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,274
Is this a solution
to the cab shortage?

197
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,318
- Just a happy coincidence.
- Admit it:

198
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,789
you drive around looking for me.

199
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,190
You're on my turf.

200
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,233
- You've got the good shops.
- Get in.

201
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,034
- Going home?
- Are you seriously giving me a ride?

202
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,430
- Is it on your way?
- No.

203
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,875
Raoul, East 73rd Street.

204
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,715
- Thank you.
- Raoul and I do this all day.

205
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,553
Picking the ladies up,
dropping them off.

206
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,956
- How have you been?
- Good. You?

207
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,317
- Very good.
- Then I've been very, very good.

208
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,472
- It's not a contest.
- Then I take back one "very".

209
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,518
How are things with Country Bob?

210
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,195
- You know his name now.
- Aidan.

211
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,749
Things are very good there, too.

212
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,876
- What was that?
- What?

213
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,712
That smile.

214
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,156
- I don't think you want to know.
- I bet I can handle it.

215
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,550
- Are you sure?
- What the hell.

216
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,439
- I think he wants to marry me.
- You think or you know?

217
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,592
- I know, actually.
- You've discussed it?

218
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,709
No, it's just the kind of thing
you know.

219
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,599
- Not going to happen.
- Let's not talk about it.

220
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,356
- He's not the guy for you.
- He might be the guy for me.

221
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,511
I'm just not ready yet.

222
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,036
You'll never be ready.
You're not the marrying kind.

223
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,034
And you are?
What does that tell us?

224
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,714
Nobody knows shit?

225
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,668
In any case, I'm not taking
relationship advice from you.

226
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,358
I just offered you a ride.

227
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,237
Spy Girl, did you tell Aidan
I didn't like the ring?

228
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,551
- Did you tell him not to propose?
- I'm out of this now.

229
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,109
Why hasn't he asked me yet?

230
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,840
You're not saying yes.
What's your hurry?

231
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,549
He has the ring.
What if he realised I'm not the one?

232
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,996
- You're not sure he's the one.
- He doesn't know that.

233
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,596
- Unless you told him.
- Hang on a second.

234
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,671
Did someone propose to you?

235
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,311
Why do they call it morning sickness
when it's all day long?

236
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,393
Unless it's as in mourning the loss
of your single life.

237
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,470
Apparently, we've reached the stage

238
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,313
where our lives are making us sick.

239
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,516
Man, that's getting...

240
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,831
- I'm sore from the shots!
- Sorry.

241
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,396
The New York Scottish Society's
Annual Highland Fling.

242
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,715
Any Scot who was anyone was there,
including, of course,

243
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,598
Bunny MacDougal.

244
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,068
I was wondering when you'd arrive.

245
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,073
You missed dinner
and the Loch Leven dancers.

246
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,317
Shoot! Sorry, Mother.
Long day at work.

247
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,677
- Hello, Bunny.
- My dear, don't you look festive?

248
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,595
Trey, you must join your brothers.
They're making fools of themselves.

249
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,791
- Do you know that dance?
- Unfortunately, I do. Excuse me.

250
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,999
It's a Highland Fling, dear.
It's what this event was named after.

251
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,033
For a fling,
it looks like a lot of work.

252
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,317
That's what I used to tell Trey
about you.

253
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,750
They say it was originally danced
on the shield of a clansman.

254
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,354
Do you know anything about clans?

255
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,717
I know this is the MacDougal
clan's tartan.

256
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,758
MacDougal is one of the oldest
highland clans.

257
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,911
We have a very proud lineage,

258
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,073
one I hope you and Trey
will be able to perpetuate.

259
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,756
Some things can't be helped,

260
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,549
but I must tell you
I don't enjoy Mandarin food

261
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,995
and I don't enjoy a Mandarin child.

262
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,671
- That's none of your business.
- But it is my business.

263
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,276
The MacDougal name will be carried on
by sons of your own,

264
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,590
not daughters of the South Pacific.

265
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,718
Would you care for some shortbread?

266
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,598
No.

267
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,829
We can have a Mandarin baby if we want.
No one else has to be involved.

268
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,231
Then let's not involve the Scottish
population of New York.

269
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,073
I'm serious!
I'm doing all the work.

270
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,629
I'm getting the hormone shots.

271
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,271
I am in the chatroom with other
reproductively challenged women.

272
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,513
And I'm learning Mandarin!
All you have to do is jerk off!

273
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,240
- Get a hold of yourself!
- You get a hold!

274
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,709
And keep your mother out of it.

275
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,998
Meanwhile, Samantha's professional
relationship really started to take off.

276
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,757
- I would have taken it off.
- I'll buy you a new one.

277
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,791
Excuse me. We're about to take off.
You need to buckle your seatbelts.

278
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,315
- Thanks, Dwight.
- Sure, Dwight.

279
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,800
Is this a good idea?
You are my boss.

280
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,077
I need you to see my property
in Brazil.

281
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,276
This is on the clock then?

282
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,512
No, but what do you charge
for that sort of thing?

283
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,558
- You couldn't afford it.
- I'm a very rich man.

284
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,518
I'm a very talented woman.

285
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,554
I need you to give me my shot.

286
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,034
For the love of God!
Do we have to do that tonight?

287
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,395
We have to do it every night

288
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,279
if we want to continue
the MacDougal clan.

289
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,637
I said I was sorry.
What else do you expect from me?

290
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,633
Why did you talk to Bunny?
Why not talk to me?

291
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,712
I don't know how to tell you
I'm exhausted.

292
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,031
How much work is a marriage
supposed to be?

293
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,151
This is just a tough phase.
Once we have a baby...

294
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,551
That could take years. I'm 43.
When does it get easy?

295
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,470
- This is what a relationship is.
- This is what our relationship is.

296
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,874
No one else was screamed at
on the dance floor.

297
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,554
I'm sorry.
It's the hormones.

298
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,915
- Stop taking them.
- I can't.

299
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,152
I can't keep doing what we're doing.

300
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,756
I love you, but I don't know
if I'm cut out for this.

301
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,719
I don't think I want to have a baby
any more.

302
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,874
I don't have the energy.
I work hard and I like to play golf.

303
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,510
- I just want to be for a while.
- You don't even want to try?

304
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,638
I don't. I don't want to try.

305
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,992
If it's the right thing, it will happen.
If it's not, it won't.

306
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,034
We've been planning all along
to have a family.

307
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,794
You and I will have to be enough.

308
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,999
I think I could be happy
with just the two of us.

309
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,390
I'm not sure you can, though.

310
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,393
I'm going to get some juice.

311
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,630
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.

312
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,399
Sometimes the question is,
"How do you know when it's not right?"

313
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,996
- lsn't this nice?
- It was nice being in the bed.

314
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,720
When Pete has to go,
Pete has to go.

315
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,871
But why do I have to go?

316
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,477
Make sure some hottie doesn't come
along and steal your man away.

317
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,235
Pete would never leave me.
Pete loves me so.

318
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,233
He does. Don't you, Pete?
Come here.

319
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,675
Pete loves you.

320
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,593
Don't you love her? I love her, too.

321
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,639
- Do you have a baggy?
- This just gets better and better.

322
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,155
Hold this, would you?

323
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,670
Go ahead. Open it.

324
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,318
Oh, my God. It's not...

325
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,394
- It's such a beautiful ring!
- Really?

326
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,038
I had a different one,
then I changed my mind.

327
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,033
This one seemed more like you.

328
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,233
I love you, Carrie.
There's no one I could love more.

329
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,392
I want to live my life with you.
What do you think?

330
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,429
Maybe there are no right moments,
right guys, right answers.

331
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,518
Maybe you just have to say
what's in your heart.

332
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,910
Yes.

333
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,912
Give me.

334
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,829
That night, I surprised myself.

335
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,638
- Who is it?
- It's me.

336
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,759
Miranda was getting a surprise
as well.

337
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,069
- Are you crazy?
- That's your answer?

338
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,516
- Why are you proposing?
- It's what you wanted.

339
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,592
- I don't want to marry you.
- I don't, either.

340
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,435
- Then what are we doing?
- There's going to be a baby.

341
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,276
I don't want to just see you
at the playground. I want to help.

342
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,715
That doesn't mean
we have to get married.

343
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,236
- You're not in love with me.
- Especially not right now.

344
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,992
Say that every day.

345
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,119
When you see me with this baby,
you'll think that you're in love with me.

346
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,511
I've seen you with my dog.
You just seem uncomfortable.

347
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,951
How are we going to do this?
Raise a kid and not be together?

348
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,477
- We'll figure it out.
- We'll figure it out?

349
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,874
Miranda knew Steve
wasn't right for her,

350
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,759
but she wanted what was right
for her baby.

351
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,435
By the way, I know
that's a hand-me-down ring.

352
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,636
I would never say yes
to a hand-me-down.

353
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
- You picked out this ring!
- For Carrie.

354
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,557
Frankly, I can't afford a stupid ring
and a baby.

355
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,631
This is working out already.

356
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,074
There was one person I needed to tell

357
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,471
that, surprisingly,
I was the marrying kind.

358
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,757
Thank God you're here.

359
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,196
- I have something to tell you.
- Aidan left you?

360
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,069
- I'm engaged.
- Fuck you!

361
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,279
Let's have a drink and celebrate.
Two Rubies, please.

362
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,269
He switched the ring on me.

363
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,716
And look! It's a really good ring.

364
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,113
- I've seen it.
- What?

365
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,795
- Somebody had to help the poor guy.
- You want me to get married?

366
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,633
No, but if you're going to ruin
our lives,

367
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,349
I'd at least like to look
at a nice piece of jewellery.

368
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,549
- Are you tanned, lady?
- I was in Rio with Richard.

369
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,269
Rio with the CEO? Mistake.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
