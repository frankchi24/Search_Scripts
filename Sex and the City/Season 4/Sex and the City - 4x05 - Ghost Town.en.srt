1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,031
New York City
can be a terrifying place.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,159
- Just a coffee and a muffin, please.
- That'll be $7.50.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,396
But nothing is more frightening
than running into an ex

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,233
before you've had your morning coffee.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,756
- I burned my tongue!
- I've got to work on that. Sorry.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,195
You look great. How you doing?

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,035
Good. You know, boring.
What's new with you?

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,510
I guess that means
you didn't get the invitation yet.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,989
No. Invitation to what?

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,948
I'm finally doing it.
I'm opening up my own bar.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,318
- Steve, you're kidding! That's...
- Scary, right?

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,155
And it's next Saturday.
I'd love it if you would come.

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,714
- You remember Jessica?
- Yes, sure. Of course, yes.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,156
- You'll come? Next Saturday?
- We'd love to see you there.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,553
She "we'd" him.
Right in front of me.

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,669
I'm still asleep. How can you
have had an emotional drama already?

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,274
No way I'm going to his opening, right?

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,750
Let me think for a second.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,550
What pisses me off is it was me
who told him to open his own bar.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,553
- But do I get any credit?
- I'm guessing not.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,871
It's infuriating!
Why wasn't he so ambitious with me?

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,113
Maybe you inspired him.
Maybe he named the bar Miranda's

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,475
or Hobbes Nob.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,475
He named the bar Scout, Carrie,
after his dog. I'm not going to that.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,519
You have to go. You're friends now.
That's what friends do.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,797
You're my friend.
That means you have to go with me?

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,912
Of course. Absolutely.
That's what friends are for.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,674
- Forget it. I'm not going.
- To what?

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,516
- What is it?
- Steve Brady and...Aidan Shaw!

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,639
How did this happen?
Why are they even friends?

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,997
According to Steve's girlfriend,
Jessica,

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,674
who answered his phone
this morning...

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,196
I love how you say Jessica
like allegedly that's her name.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,035
- Aidan is Steve's silent partner.
- Why didn't I get an invitation?

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,398
- Have mine. I'm not going.
- It's a party. You won't see him.

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,792
It is not a party. It's a parade
of our failed relationships.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,078
Next you'll tell me that my junior prom
date is the bar back.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,550
It's good Aidan invited you.
He wants to be friends.

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,836
I don't know what it means.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,390
- It means I forgive you, please come.
- Nice try. Not going.

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,551
- I'll go.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
You see, Samantha's my friend.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,274
I'm going with Samantha
and her lesbian lover, and I am proud.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,035
Let's not invite Maria.
I could use a night away.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,316
You're not in a Sapphic slump?

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,393
All we ever do is lie in the bath
and talk about feelings.

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,437
That's a relationship.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,752
I don't know how you do it.
All that emotional chow-chow.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,957
- Don't you just hate that?
- Women.

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,399
Samantha was determined to get Maria
out of the tub and out on the town.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,109
Why are we out in this crowd,
with all this smoke,

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,875
when we could be home
relaxing together?

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,079
I thought it would be fun to go out
on dry land for a change.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,030
What's the fun of getting clean
if you can't get dirty first?

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,349
What's it to be? The usual?

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,399
Brian makes the most
dangerous Mojitos in the city.

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,518
Two Mojitos coming up.
On the house.

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,716
- Fun place, huh?
- Hey, gorgeous.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,668
Sean Sullivan!
What are you doing in town?

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,798
Business.
What are you doing Saturday?

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,509
- Saturday?
- We have plans for Saturday.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,871
How about a late run?
I'll call you.

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,348
- What is this late run?
- Doesn't translate.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,911
I didn't know we had plans Saturday.
I'm going out with the girls.

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,311
- Should I come? I'm a girl.
- No, sweetie.

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,119
Since you don't like to go out...

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,999
Here you go, ladies. Enjoy.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,275
I get off at 4:00.

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,356
Samantha had to face her past
and Charlotte was facing her future.

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,318
Now that Trey could get hard
in the bedroom,

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,835
she saw no reason
why their bed should be.

72
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,397
Bunny, hi.
What are you doing here?

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,031
When Trey told me you were buying
a new bed, I insisted he let me help.

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,875
I picked the one he has now,
didn't you know? It's Chippendale.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,589
No. Where is Trey?

76
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,399
Still at the hospital, I expect.

77
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,109
Don't fret. We'll find a mattress
to fit the frame.

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,829
We were hoping to find a bed
that was a little bigger

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,877
and less hard.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,431
My dear, I'm a firm believer
in firm mattresses.

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,637
Look. The perfect dust ruffle.

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,920
Five-pleat, gusseted duster with a foot
drop. I have one just like it.

83
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,915
Actually, Bunny, most of the newer
beds don't even need dust ruffles.

84
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,108
My dear child, you cannot
not have a dust ruffle. It's unsightly.

85
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,996
This is divine. Nice and firm.

86
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,676
Hello, my darling girls.
Sorry I'm late.

87
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,152
- I see you've started without me.
- You must get in and feel this.

88
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,550
It's sublime.

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,711
Hello.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,995
This is comfy, isn't it?
Charlotte, you must try this.

91
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,789
- I was thinking more...
- For heaven's sake get in.

92
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,513
This is heaven.

93
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,155
I'm sorry, this is just way too...

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,632
- Firm? All righty. Something softer.
- Something with a dust ruffle.

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,712
Whatever you say, Mother.
You know best.

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
You hear it too, Fatty?

97
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,356
- I think I have a ghost.
- I think I have to hear that again.

98
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,593
There were weird noises last night.
The cat heard it, too.

99
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,672
If the cat heard it...

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,675
That's not a ghost. That's a weird
neighbour's nocturnal, what have you.

101
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,516
That's what I thought, but this morning
the super let me in upstairs

102
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,797
and there's no one living there.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,152
The place is empty. I know it sounds
crazy, but I could feel it.

104
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,108
- Did the cat feel it too?
- The hairs on my neck stood up.

105
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,956
My grandmother had a ghost.
She had to tell it to leave.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,035
That's what you do. Confront the ghost,
acknowledge it, release it.

107
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,398
- How do you happen to know that?
- Everybody knows that.

108
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,835
Why now?
I've lived there two years.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,197
When I lived alone,
I felt scared all the time.

110
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,828
Now I'm back with Trey, I feel safe.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,833
So I have a ghost
because I'm single?

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,070
That's discrimination.

113
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,193
New York is definitely haunted.

114
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,238
Anyone you have
unresolved issues with

115
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,279
you are bound to run into
until you resolve them.

116
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,000
My relationship with Aidan was dead,

117
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,152
but he was suddenly a presence
in my life again.

118
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,075
Was he there all along? Like the chair
he made that I could never sell.

119
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,879
When a relationship dies,
do we ever give up the ghost?

120
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,591
Or are we forever haunted
by the spirits of relationships past?

121
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,395
Why did you not introduce me
to that Sean?

122
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,630
He's nobody.
Just a guy I used to fuck.

123
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,349
And the bartender man?

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,717
He's nobody.
Just a guy I used to fuck.

125
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,508
Why have you not told these nobody

126
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,831
that you are with somebody now?

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,389
What am I supposed to say?

128
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,236
"Hi, this is my lesbian lover.
PS, I'm done with dick?"

129
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,789
Who said anything about dick?

130
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,669
- I was talking about our relationship.
- Of course you were.

131
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,832
Do you miss the dick?
Is that what this is all about?

132
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,639
It's OK to tell me.
We should talk about this.

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,236
More talking?

134
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,710
OK. I'll talk.

135
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,952
- How many men have you been with?
- How many women have you been with?

136
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,031
12.

137
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,028
You've been with more than 12 men?

138
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,233
Why are we even talking about this?

139
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,198
Why are you so afraid to talk?

140
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,035
- Always pulling away.
- I'm not pulling away.

141
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,119
I'm trying to get closer.

142
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,952
Not like that.
Not with sex.

143
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,392
I cannot just turn it on and off.

144
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,676
After all, I'm not a man.

145
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,191
You know what?
I think I'm clean now.

146
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,716
That night, Charlotte was haunted
by dust ruffles, ducks and Bunny.

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,910
Your mother decorated
this entire apartment.

148
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,834
- Mother does all our houses.
- I should have known.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,039
- Plaid and the mallards.
- You don't like them?

150
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,112
It's like living in the museum
of natural ugliness!

151
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,394
Trey, if we're serious about making
a fresh start with our marriage

152
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,917
and making this our home,
it should reflect our taste, shouldn't it?

153
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,390
- I have no taste, clearly.
- Then my taste for us.

154
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,348
Mother spent a lot of time and money
on this place.

155
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,593
I understand, but I am your wife.

156
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,593
- Maybe I should have a chat with her?
- Let me.

157
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,878
It might go easier.
Tomorrow, when she comes over,

158
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,352
I will sit her down and say
that this is simply not our/your taste.

159
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,390
The animals have got to go.

160
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,517
But the next morning...

161
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,036
Up and at them, George McFaddem.
It's daylight in the swamp!

162
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,997
Trey couldn't talk to anyone.

163
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,513
Hello, Mother.

164
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,716
Darling, what's the matter?

165
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,792
- Are you ill? Let Mother.
- Sore throat.

166
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,239
Charlotte, telephone my house
and tell Geneva to bring over some broth.

167
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,516
And my overnight case.

168
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,194
I know you're busy at the gallery.

169
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,399
I might as well stay
until Trey's recovered.

170
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,473
What's this mallard doing here?
He lives in the study.

171
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,279
Yes, Bunny.

172
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,195
Since I wasn't going to risk an awkward
public confrontation with Aidan,

173
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,794
I wanted to make a gesture,

174
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,988
a small way of saying thank you
for inviting me, for being braver than me

175
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,072
and for suggesting
that we can be friends.

176
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,194
There was no sign of him,
but he was everywhere.

177
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,672
In the mahogany bar, the wood floors,
the carved ceiling.

178
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,753
The whole place looked and felt
just like Aidan.

179
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,076
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

180
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,438
- I couldn't resist a sneak preview.
- Did Miranda come with you?

181
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,071
No, no. I'm not going to be able
to come to the opening

182
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,633
so I just wanted to thank Aidan
for inviting me.

183
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,318
It's a mulberry bush.
Because the bar's on...

184
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,277
Mulberry Street.

185
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,590
Carrie, that's really sweet.
Only...

186
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,592
- Aidan didn't exactly invite you. I did.
- You did?

187
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,356
I thought Miranda might feel
more comfortable with you here.

188
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,671
So Aidan didn't invite me?

189
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,316
No, not exactly, but...

190
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,357
I've got to go.

191
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,999
That night, I wasn't the only one
who was haunted.

192
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,472
One phone call later...
Does the ghost like Oreos?

193
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,076
I'm hoping there is a ghost,
otherwise I'm insane.

194
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,995
- You say that like it's either/or.
- Sorry for making you come over.

195
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,517
I just needed a person here.
The cat's an unreliable witness.

196
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,673
I checked the haunted-house clause
of the best-friend contract.

197
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,717
You're covered.

198
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,030
Meanwhile, across the park,

199
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,910
Charlotte, haunted by Bunny spending
the night, couldn't sleep either.

200
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,591
Bunny! What are you doing?

201
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,274
I remembered I had some Vicks.

202
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,910
- It's the best thing for a cold.
- I gave him some Nyquil.

203
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,153
Nyquil doesn't cure anything.
Except consciousness.

204
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,632
- Shouldn't I do that?
- I've done it since he was a child.

205
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,191
But I am his wife. If anyone does it,
it should be me.

206
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,797
Not on his tummy.
You're trying to break up the phlegm.

207
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,714
- You don't know what you're doing.
- You're being very inappropriate.

208
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,475
I'm sorry,
but this just isn't going to work.

209
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,394
Trey and I are back together.
This is our house.

210
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,950
We will redecorate it
as we see fit.

211
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,953
No more plaid,
no more duck decoys.

212
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,033
From now on, there can only be
one lady of the house.

213
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,274
I've been in his house
far longer than you, my dear.

214
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,113
And unlike you, I never left.

215
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,033
The decoys may come and go,

216
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,715
but I'm going to be here forever.

217
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,431
Samantha, you home?

218
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,398
Come on, baby, open up.
It's me, Sean.

219
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,272
Sean, what are you doing here?
It's three o'clock in the morning.

220
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,910
- Let's fuck.
- How did you even get in?

221
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,436
Your security code's the same.
Can I come in?

222
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,670
Sean, you can't be here.

223
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,479
I got hard
just walking up your stairs.

224
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,596
- You got another guy in here?
- No.

225
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,512
Not another guy, no.

226
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,911
I'm Maria.
Samantha's girlfriend.

227
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,228
Good for you. That's...

228
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,393
Maybe I could come in
and you two could make me a sandwich.

229
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,715
I don't think tonight's
going to be good for us.

230
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,791
I'm only in town for...

231
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,830
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,028
Get away from the door, motherfucker,
before I call the cops!

233
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,872
OK, good night.

234
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,510
With that,
Maria released Samantha's ghost,

235
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,035
and confronted Samantha.

236
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,559
You let men come to your door
in the middle of the night?

237
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,191
- Let it go. It's all in the past.
- No, it's not in the past.

238
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,512
It's serving us drinks,
it's on the answer machine,

239
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,069
at your door
in the middle of the night.

240
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,073
This might be a shock,
but I used to have sex with men.

241
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,232
This man was here
for nothing but sex.

242
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,029
Which I used to enjoy and haven't
had much of in this relationship.

243
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,952
You call this a relationship?

244
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,159
It's tedious, the sex is dwindling,
so from what I've heard, yes.

245
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,440
- If you have something to say...
- I have nothing to say to you.

246
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,230
I am out of things to say to you.
All we do is talk, talk, talk.

247
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,188
The talking has replaced the fucking
in our relationship!

248
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,476
I don't want talk!

249
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,349
I want passion, I want fireworks!

250
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,637
Do you want fireworks?

251
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,234
I'll show you fireworks!

252
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,556
That's fireworks!

253
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,393
What are you doing?
Stop it!

254
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,712
Stop!

255
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,239
My plates!

256
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,791
These are not your plates!
You don't even cook!

257
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,909
You want a little firework?

258
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,155
Another little one?

259
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,550
I didn't leave a card.
He won't know what the plant means.

260
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,150
It's like I plant-bombed him.

261
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,397
- How did the bar look?
- Like Aidan. It's amazing.

262
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,348
- Good for Steve.
- That's convincing.

263
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,750
I'm trying to be happy for him.

264
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,630
He's got his own bar, his own life,
his own Jessica.

265
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,951
And I'm still here. You know?

266
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,750
In the same apartment,
doing the same job, living the same life.

267
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,628
You have something no one has.
A ghost.

268
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,870
You have two ghosts.

269
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,110
At least Big's a friendly ghost.

270
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,238
Aidan, on the other hand...

271
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,312
I'm afraid the way I treated him
will haunt me the rest of my life.

272
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,268
- There's nothing I can do.
- There is. Come to the party!

273
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,000
- He didn't invite me.
- Steve's a good guy.

274
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,469
He wouldn't invite you
if it wasn't OK.

275
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,952
Do you ever think that you might
still have feelings for Steve?

276
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,634
God, no. Why?

277
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,870
Do you? For Aidan?

278
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,712
No.

279
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,478
I don't know. I don't think so.

280
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,836
I don't know.

281
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,957
Thank you.

282
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,393
I left Miranda's early
and got some sleep.

283
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,633
In daylight, it felt like
all my ghosts had disappeared

284
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,917
and I saw the world
exactly as it was.

285
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,077
A few days later,
Trey felt better too.

286
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,398
So did Charlotte,

287
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,394
especially as Bunny had moved
back into her own apartment.

288
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,988
Up and at them,
George McFad...

289
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,357
I brought some muf...

290
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,872
Oh, dear.

291
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,189
I just brought...
I brought muffins for breakfast.

292
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,554
Charlotte didn't know
if it was making love

293
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,110
or making love on a bed
without a dust ruffle that offended,

294
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,308
but their sex-orcism ensured Bunny
never haunted their home again

295
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,516
unless expressly invited.

296
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,070
While downtown, a dearly departed
spirit suddenly reappeared.

297
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,118
It's been two days. I was worried.

298
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,511
- You didn't even call.
- Neither did you.

299
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,235
I brought you a gift.

300
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,677
- Better be dishes.
- Open it.

301
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,038
Maria made one last effort to give
Samantha what she thought she needed.

302
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,110
You bought me a strap-on?

303
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,791
Samantha was touched.

304
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,918
Since she couldn't admit
she was incapable

305
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,038
of being in a relationship
she simply said,

306
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,236
I guess we could give it a try.

307
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,196
That night, despite all my fears
and reservations,

308
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,956
I let Miranda and Samantha talk me
into going to the opening of Scout.

309
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,833
Who are all these attractive people?

310
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,148
We're looking for Aidan, ladies,
eyes akimbo.

311
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,595
That's it. Stealth.

312
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,270
What you doing there, sister?
Doing the robot?

313
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,796
- I threw my back out.
- How?

314
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,597
Fucking Maria with a strap-on.
She did me, I did her.

315
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,275
All that fucking and talking.
Men work so hard!

316
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,716
How does a strap-on work?
Is it belted?

317
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,236
Could we not have the strap-on
conversation now?

318
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,960
This night is hard enough as it is.

319
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,070
- How does it work?
- What did I say?

320
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,708
It doesn't.
Maria and I broke up.

321
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,598
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

322
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,309
Did the strap-on break
the relationship's back? Or just yours?

323
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,996
- Maria thinks I have intimacy issues.
- She's crazy!

324
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,072
I told her I'm not
a relationship person!

325
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,118
- Absolutely.
- You most certainly did.

326
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,919
Then she falls in love with me.

327
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,392
I need a drink.

328
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,872
Is it bad to have a Martini
with a muscle relaxant or good bad?

329
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,749
I don't know. Are you operating
machinery this evening?

330
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,798
Never again.
Where's the bar in this bar?

331
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,430
Miranda was right.
When you see a ghost, you know.

332
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,876
You can feel it.
The hairs on your neck stand up.

333
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,991
That was it? That's all I get?
I don't even know what that was.

334
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,879
- Was that Aidan?
- Does he look better

335
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,110
or have I been with a woman
too long?

336
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,352
I'm going home.
I don't even know why I came.

337
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,479
Because I begged you to.
Let me buy you ladies a free drink.

338
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,550
I'll meet you at the bar.

339
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,199
You came! I'm so glad.

340
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,920
So, what do you think?

341
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,878
I think...

342
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,793
- I think you did good.
- You mean it?

343
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,232
- I did this because of you.
- I didn't do anything!

344
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,870
Are you kidding me?
This whole thing was your idea.

345
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,033
You always said I should start
my own bar. I never forgot.

346
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,909
I just never thought that I could.

347
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,274
Thanks.

348
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
You did good.

349
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,677
Just like that,
Miranda gave up the ghost.

350
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,400
Come on, let's get you drunk.

351
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,351
An hour later,
since my ghost hadn't reappeared,

352
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,593
I snuck out the side door
for some cake and a smoke.

353
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,237
You're not seriously smoking that,
are you?

354
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,629
Is that all you could carry, Carrie?

355
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,308
Now I can't eat my cake.

356
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,757
- Sure you can. Here.
- You got your fingers all in it.

357
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,513
It's my cake!

358
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,229
- So now you want your cake?
- I never not wanted it.

359
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,553
OK, lady. You take the cake.

360
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
You cut your hair.

361
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,078
You have frosting on your lip.

362
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,996
Hey, partner.

363
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,276
It's time for our toast.

364
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,792
I thought you were
the silent partner.

365
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,358
Glad you came.

366
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,870
Good to see you, Carrie.

367
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,830
Good to see you, too.

368
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,119
I had confronted my ghost,
accepted and released him.

369
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,352
But now I was more haunted
than ever.

370
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,354
Because what I felt out there
was no ghost. It was real.
