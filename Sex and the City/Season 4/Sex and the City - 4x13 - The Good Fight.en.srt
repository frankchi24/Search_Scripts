1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,909
Someone once said
that two halves make a whole.

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,788
When two halves move in together,
it makes a whole lot of stuff.

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,314
Where you been
and what you been doing?

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,789
I got coffee and the papers,

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,033
but the more pressing question is:
what have you been doing?

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,158
- I made myself an area.
- I can see that.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,598
I needed a space for work papers
and stuff. Is that OK?

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,038
Sure. It's just that you're blocking
the bathroom door.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,156
Who needs two bathroom doors?

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,154
I do. Me, the one who loves
her two bathroom doors.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,232
- Why do you need two doors?
- If I'm in a hurry,

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,356
it's quicker to use that one.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,035
- It's my escape route, in case.
- In case what?

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,636
In case rapists come in my window.
Boing...I'm gone.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,236
There's a lot of "boinging"
going on in that bathroom.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,915
It's just going to be like this till we
take over the apartment next door.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,277
Would that be happening in the next
five minutes?

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,477
Closing at the end of next week.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,354
Hello, Petie. What's the problem?
It's just boxes, right?

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,149
A plant! The man brought
a living thing into my apartment.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,834
I kill everything I bring in there.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,073
- You said yes and he moved in.
- He's taking over whole areas.

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,629
That's why I've never lived
with a man.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,236
- They're out an hour after I climax.
- You let them stay an hour?

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,393
You'd be surprised how many
can go again after a quick nap.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,189
As soon as I walk in the door,
he's in my face with,

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,433
"Who did you see, where did you go,
what do you know?"

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,559
I need time to decompress,
just be alone.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,633
There have to be some adjustments.
Relationships are hard.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,315
I miss walking into my apartment
with no one there

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,436
and it's all quiet.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,592
I can do that stuff you do
when you're totally alone,

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,753
things you would never want
your boyfriend to see you do.

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,911
- Like masturbate?
- My SSB:

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,719
my secret, single behaviour.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,236
I like to make a stack of saltines
and put grape jelly on them.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,358
I eat them standing up in the kitchen
while reading fashion magazines.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,035
- Why standing up?
- It's weird, but it feels great.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,395
I like to put Vaseline on my hands

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,109
and put on conditioning gloves
while watching infomercials.

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,953
Before I was married,
I used to study my pores

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,477
in a mirror for an hour each night.
I'm afraid Trey will think it's weird.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,269
He would.
You can't do that stuff in front of men.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,592
What about you? Anything
you wouldn't want a man to see?

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,590
No.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,796
I believe her.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,075
Don't we have a rule
about those things?

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,279
It's my boss. I have to take it.
Samantha Jones.

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,270
Richard, it's Sunday.

50
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,998
Fine, I'll see you in an hour.

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,152
He wants me to drop
something off this afternoon.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,677
Nice! A little "skyrockets in flight,
afternoon delight"?

53
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,195
- No, it's just work.
- Hardly.

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,318
- You're sleeping with him.
- You told them?

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,950
I like to gossip on the phone
while pumicing my calluses.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,430
How is he? Spare no detail,
I'm a horny, pregnant person.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,034
I don't want to talk about it.

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,790
Samantha likes a guy!

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,394
- Samantha likes a guy!
- I do not.

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,677
You do or you would tell us
all the dirty details.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,277
We're going to have to ice skate home.
Hell just froze over.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,874
You want details? OK.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,958
He's got the most perfect dick
I've ever seen.

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,509
Long, pink, amazing.

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,316
It's "dickalicious".

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,711
What should I do about Aidan's stuff?

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,472
- The girls are coming over for dinner.
- That sounds like fun. What night?

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,790
Just the girls.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,438
I have so much more free time
now we're not on the baby track.

70
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,589
Some apartments are cluttered with
physical stuff. Others, emotional stuff.

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,716
It's a big readjustment.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,839
I've wanted a baby since I was a girl.
We have a baby room and no baby.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,468
I've got some good news.

74
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,274
Bram Pomander thinks he's snagged us
orchestra seats

75
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,396
to "The Producers" next week.

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,517
Charlotte, yes, we're disappointed,
but life goes on.

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,433
We still have to find a way
to have a giggle.

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,670
Come on, give me a smile.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,354
Investors in Munich.
How do you say "fuck you" in German?

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,188
Impressive.
Why do you speak German?

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,229
A gal has her reasons. That wasn't
"fuck you", it was "fuck me".

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,551
That's a negotiation ploy
I haven't tried before.

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,872
- Where's the magazine layout?
- Signed, sealed, delivered.

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,675
One more thing.

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,473
It was perfect:
long, pink, amazing.

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,598
I thought about you all weekend.

87
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,555
Maybe I can give you something
to think about all evening.

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,794
Bring out that gorgeous dick.

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,589
You're getting down on your knees here?
What if my assistant sees you?

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,713
I dropped my portfolio.

91
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,790
It may take some time to pick up.

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,512
Better get those
while you're down there.

93
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,951
If I'd known you were going to be
so not a loser,

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,114
- I would have changed after work.
- Or put on some fresh deodorant.

95
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,556
Careful. I was a much younger man
when we first set up this blind date.

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,156
You're the one who kept cancelling
to go... Where?

97
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,836
First time, Spain and Rome.
Second time, Luxembourg and Athens.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,279
Walker Lewis, fluent in five languages,
was a State Department interpreter.

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,797
Seriously, Miranda.
Best blind date I've ever had...

100
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,990
...in the continental USA.

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,478
What? Listen,

102
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,474
any reason I can't see you again
before I go to Brussels?

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,719
He is so cute and funny and sexy.

104
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,678
I want to have sex with him,
but I don't know.

105
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,037
Can you fuck a guy when you're
carrying another's baby?

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,158
If one more person
asks me that today...

107
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,869
I'm not in a relationship
with the father of the baby.

108
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,476
I've rarely heard that used as a plus,
but go on.

109
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,996
Is it tacky?
And beyond tacky, is it safe?

110
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,516
- Let's assume he's a great fuck.
- As so many men are.

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,309
Could all that poking
shake the baby loose?

112
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,155
That's silly! Married couples
have sex all the time.

113
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,630
- But what if he's huge?
- As so many men are.

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,156
- Could the dick dent the baby?
- What do you think dimples come from?

115
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,070
- That is so cute.
- I try.

116
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,676
I really need
to have sex with him now.

117
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,116
Next time he's back,
I'll be too big and he won't want to.

118
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,352
Nothing puts a man off sex
like pregnancy.

119
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,268
This is my last chance.

120
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,194
- Last chance for sex.
- You're not on death row.

121
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,794
Yes, I am.
Dead woman fucking.

122
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,758
It's your body, your life.
You do what's best for you.

123
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,911
Easier said than done.

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,073
You can't even ask Aidan not to talk
when you walk in the door.

125
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,832
Hi, Mrs Cohen.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,231
Hold on a second.
Let me help you.

127
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,958
Here we go.

128
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,999
That's a crazy outfit.

129
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,919
- This is my friend, Miranda.
- Hello, Mrs Cohen.

130
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,797
You tell your boy
I'm not leaving for 30 days.

131
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,637
What? But we're closing in a week.

132
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,631
Read the contract!

133
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,597
I didn't think Mrs Cohen could
move any slower,

134
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,876
but apparently she could.

135
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,872
What's up? Where you been?
What do you know?

136
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,952
Brace yourself, partner.
I've been outside.

137
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,148
What's up is old lightning rod
next door informs me

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,630
she will not be leaving
for 30 days.

139
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,788
I was afraid she was going
to do that.

140
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,355
Fuck! What the fuck
are we going to do now?

141
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,629
Thank you! You hate it, too.
I'm so relieved.

142
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,633
I thought you'd already
changed into a pod.

143
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,519
Invasion of the Single Snatchers.

144
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,679
Of course I hate it.
We cannot live like this.

145
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,596
I've got all my boxes in the hall,
you can't get in the door.

146
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,478
Did you see me?

147
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,871
- Every single time.
- We have to move this stuff out.

148
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,828
We could make some room
if we cleaned out your closet.

149
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,398
Careful!

150
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,870
- OK. Damn! My ears?
- Listen to me.

151
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,192
I have laid out clean towels
on the floor of the bathroom.

152
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,751
Gently place the shoes
and boxes on them.

153
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,150
I forgot I had these.
Things are looking up.

154
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,390
How many pairs of shoes
do you need?

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,870
That is not the way
to get out of this alive.

156
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,592
I figure I'll need
about half this space.

157
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,275
- I figure you're mentally ill.
- You never wear most of this.

158
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,115
Yet. I never wear most of this stuff yet.
Some day I will.

159
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,512
Like this?

160
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,036
When and where
were you planning to wear this?

161
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,912
Don't do that.
Don't mock the clothes.

162
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,389
For the record, have worn it.

163
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,348
December '99.
Union Square, book signing.

164
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,189
- We've got to start somewhere.
- I love this outfit.

165
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,589
I realised I was holding onto
a Roberto Cavalli outfit

166
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,320
and throwing away my relationship.

167
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,357
- OK, it goes.
- Good.

168
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,317
Bye, bye.

169
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,033
Stop it! Pete, stop it!

170
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,077
Oh, my God!

171
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,113
Don't even show it to me!

172
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,910
I think I saw turquoise.
That better not be the pair I think.

173
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,593
Goddamit!

174
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,197
- That dog owes me $380.
- Fine.

175
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,874
You can't buy it!
It's circa 1996.

176
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,512
He's a dog. What's he supposed to do
with all your shit lying around?

177
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,240
My shit wouldn't be lying around

178
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,154
if we weren't making room
because your shit is lying around.

179
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,199
- You've got more shit than me.
- Look at this place!

180
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,477
It's loaded with your shit.
Look at this bathroom.

181
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,871
Look at all your shit in my bathroom.

182
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,068
Who needs five almost empty deodorants?
Are you a crazy bagman?

183
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,789
- They're different smells.
- When have you ever worn musk?

184
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,919
Look at this stuff.
You've got old razors, Rogaine...

185
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,952
- I didn't know you used Rogaine.
- It's preventative.

186
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,839
- Is your hair...?
- I don't want to talk about it!

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,675
It seems not only women
have secret, single behaviour.

188
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,035
Don't be going through my stuff!

189
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,715
- You were happy to go through mine!
- Your stuff. Your bathroom.

190
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,678
You always do that.
You never want to let me in.

191
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,356
I don't always do anything
and I have let you in.

192
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,432
You're fighting with me
about a stupid outfit.

193
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,353
Shut up. It's Roberto Cavalli.

194
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,829
I threw it away and I love it.

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,356
- What more do you want?
- Shut up? Shut up?

196
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,078
Yes, shut up.

197
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,836
- You're telling me to shut up?
- Please, just shut up.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,279
I am so sick of your talking all the time.
Don't you ever just shut up?

199
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,317
I'm going to take a walk.

200
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,596
I'm taking a walk.

201
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,275
Stay here with your boxes of shit
and your shoe-eating dog

202
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,752
and knock yourself out putting on
the Rogaine and the speed stick.

203
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,391
This is why I need a second door.

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,831
I heard that!

205
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,151
I used to think people who sat alone
at Starbucks writing on laptops

206
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,118
were pretentious posers.
Now I know:

207
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,955
they are people who have recently
moved in with someone.

208
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,795
I wondered how many of them
were mid-fight like myself.

209
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,114
The hard thing about fighting in
relationships is that there's no referee.

210
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,035
There's no one to tell you
which comments are below the belt.

211
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,317
As a result,
someone usually gets hurt.

212
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,190
The closer a couple gets and the more
stuff they have between them,

213
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,591
the harder it is to figure out
why they're yelling.

214
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,390
When it comes to relationships,
I wondered: what are we fighting for?

215
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,589
Hello, my darling. I'm home.

216
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,713
- Is that a surprise for me?
- Yes, it is.

217
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,394
It's just a little silly something.

218
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,835
- What is it?
- Open it.

219
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,794
It's a cardboard baby.

220
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,748
I saw it in the window of a novelty
store next to the hospital.

221
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,639
Now we can relax
because we have one.

222
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,030
Oh, dear...
It was supposed to be funny.

223
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,350
I thought we'd have a chuckle.

224
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,476
Don't talk to me.

225
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,155
It was a novelty store.
The clerk said that...

226
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,276
But to Charlotte,
it was hitting below the belt.

227
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,512
If the meat is a quarter
of an inch thick...

228
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,994
Across town, Miranda decided
it was time to put on the gloves

229
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,469
and come out swinging.

230
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,033
Hi, Walker. Miranda. Before you leave
for Brussels on Monday,

231
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,034
how about getting together Friday night?
My apartment, call me.

232
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,830
Pregnant or not, Miranda had needs
and decided to stop fighting them.

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,878
Surprisingly,

234
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,874
Samantha developed some secret,
single behaviour of her own.

235
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,312
Seven hours
and a landslide of lattes later,

236
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,836
I vibrated home prepared to admit
how silly I'd been.

237
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,394
That was, until he wasn't prepared
to admit how silly he'd been.

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,075
He yelled, then I yelled.

239
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,198
It's been three days
and nothing, not a word.

240
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,999
I'll be damned
if I say I'm sorry first.

241
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,631
Trey and I hardly ever yell.
WASPS don't yell, it's genetic.

242
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,190
- More salad anyone?
- No! What's the main course?

243
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,353
Relax. Chew. You'll get laid.
You're not meeting him till 10:00.

244
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,511
Beef with Thai noodles.

245
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,797
Richard is thinking
of opening a hotel in Thailand.

246
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,718
Sweetie, it's perfectly OK
to like a guy.

247
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,270
For the last time,
the only thing I like about Richard

248
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,149
is his big, throbbing, rock hard,
perfect dick.

249
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,839
- I forgot it was ladies' night.
- Trey, you shouldn't be here.

250
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,752
Good evening, everyone.

251
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,999
Hello, Missus.
Still mad, I see.

252
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,916
- I suppose she told you about the baby.
- No, I didn't.

253
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,878
I never want to think about it again.

254
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,679
I was trying to make Charlotte laugh...

255
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,479
- It's not funny.
- Maybe they'll think it is.

256
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,672
We were so tense
about not being able to have one

257
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,549
that I gave Charlotte a cardboard baby.
Isn't that funny?

258
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,233
You're funny. A cardboard baby.
That's funny, right?

259
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,550
It's not funny ha-ha, but silly.

260
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,793
They sell them in novelty stores.

261
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,430
Other people buy them
and the clerk said it was funny.

262
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,876
- Maybe you have to see it.
- Don't bring that in here!

263
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,235
- It's silly.
- Not to me, it isn't.

264
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,075
How would you feel if I gave you
a cut-out of a flaccid penis?

265
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,993
It's not so funny now, is it?

266
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,993
Don't you bring that flat baby in here!

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,471
- How dare you talk to me like that?
- They know about your penis problems!

268
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,154
We were in the middle
of a WASP nest.

269
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,515
This is unforgivable.

270
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,958
You're unforgivable for denying me
a baby because of your spoiled needs.

271
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,270
I'm spoiled?
You are spoiled.

272
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,079
Ever since we moved back in...

273
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,958
Samantha Jones.

274
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,319
Richard, hello.
No, it's not too late to call.

275
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,199
- Everything but a baby!
- We're going to go.

276
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,191
Good!

277
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,989
Don't talk to my friends like that!
With no baby, they're all I have.

278
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,789
You are the man
who gave me a cardboard baby!

279
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,235
- It was funny!
- No, it wasn't!

280
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,472
Goodnight.

281
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,515
What's so important
that it couldn't wait until...?

282
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,477
This.

283
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,834
Let's get something straight.
I want no part of that.

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,833
That turns everything
into a big mess.

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,310
We are work and sex.
Nothing more.

286
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,395
Now kindly take off those pants
and show me your dick.

287
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,351
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

288
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,879
That's what I'm talking about.

289
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,510
Seeing a bantamweight fight
like Charlotte and Trey's

290
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,470
made me thankful that Aidan and I were
still in the banter-weight division.

291
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,191
I'm sorry, too.

292
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,472
That night, I slept in my clothes.

293
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,754
Trey and his baby
slept in the guest room

294
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,868
and Charlotte no longer cared
what Trey thought.

295
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,476
Fuck me! Fuck me
like there's no tomorrow.

296
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,634
For her last meal, the condemned
woman had seconds...

297
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,237
...and thirds.

298
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,474
Samantha met the dawn after a night
of SSB:

299
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,949
sexy, swimming behaviour.

300
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,117
- Dance with me.
- What did I say?

301
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,236
I'm your boss.

302
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,555
It's an order.

303
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,552
Dance.

304
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,032
Samantha finally threw in the towel.

305
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,193
All this time, she'd been trying
to make him just a perfect dick,

306
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,751
fighting her feelings that
he might be the perfect Richard.

307
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,310
Back at the Bradshaw/Shaw residence,
it was business as usual.

308
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,631
What's up, where you been,
who did you see?

309
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,988
- I need you to do something.
- What?

310
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,271
I've never lived with anybody

311
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,876
so I don't know how to say
this correctly, but...

312
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,192
I need you to not talk to me
for one whole hour.

313
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,748
I know that sounds selfish,

314
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,230
but it's just what I need.
Is that OK?

315
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,152
Good.

316
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,031
We don't have any other rooms yet,
so I'm going to close these.

317
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,990
Then it's like I'm not here.

318
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,797
For one whole hour, I'm not here.

319
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,751
Thanks.
I love you.

320
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,114
What are you doing out here?

321
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,431
That's the thing about needs:

322
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,798
sometimes when you get them met,
you don't need them any more.

323
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,591
As our 30 days wore on,

324
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,196
Aidan and I miraculously managed
to not kill each other.

325
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,351
But, as I predicted,

326
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,390
the plant was not so lucky.
