1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,755
In life, sometimes we find ourselves

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,797
at a crossroads.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,476
In New York, that crossroads
tends to be busy and very loud.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,434
Sorry! You're waiting.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,114
I know, I'm ten minutes late.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,748
- Well, I'm three weeks late.
- What?

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,469
- I'm pregnant.
- Spare change?

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,234
- I'm sorry.
- I've got it.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,837
You are beautiful ladies.
You'll make some man very happy.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,634
You're pregnant? Really?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,633
No, I thought it might be
a fun thing to say.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,792
You're sure?

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,518
I took three EPT tests

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,432
and I'm coming from my doctor.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,558
That's why we're meeting at 23rd
and I'm in Hell.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,235
When have you been having sex?
I did not mean that the way it sounds.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,674
Steve.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,108
- You're sleeping with Steve?
- Slept, once, singular.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,794
It was a mercy fuck.
He only had one ball.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,916
I guess that's all he needed.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,433
No kidding!

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,909
Apparently the other one was ornamental.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,958
- Why didn't I use a condom?
- You didn't use a condom?

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,429
He has one ball, I have a lazy ovary.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,592
In what twisted world
does that create a baby?

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,558
It's like the Special Olympics
of conception.

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,233
Have you told him?

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,356
Why would l? I'm not having it.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,990
- Is it OK not to tell him?
- I don't know. Is it?

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,517
While Miranda took a pregnant pause,

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,869
Charlotte got an unpleasant surprise
of her own:

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,637
her period.

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,030
Charlotte brought party favourites.

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,829
- I'll never get pregnant.
- Would you move the Tampax?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,436
When I think of all those women
every day getting pregnant.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,717
- I've been trying for five months.
- You'll get pregnant.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,158
When? A woman of 35 has only
a 30% chance of conceiving.

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,869
- The numbers go down from there.
- Numbers can be wrong.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,510
How do you explain the number
of crying children on planes?

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,956
- This is not a laughing matter.
- I thought this was brunch,

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,237
- not a fertility seminar.
- Let's all just...

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,750
Shall we get you a menu?

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,832
It's me.
I probably can't have a baby.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,312
- Don't say that.
- Trey is fine. I know it's me.

45
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,040
- It's not you.
- Then what is it?

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,512
I hear stories about people getting
pregnant just looking at each other.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,037
I do it on my head, on my side,
on the top, on the bottom.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,272
- On the top, then the bottom...
- This is brunch talk.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,150
Do you know how many times we have
done it without a condom? 73.

50
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,756
Have you any idea
how much semen that is?

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,992
No. Samantha, rough estimate?

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,116
Enough to know that it's me.

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
In my 20s I worried I'd get pregnant.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,355
I could have been screwing
everything in sight!

55
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,272
Coulda, woulda, shoulda.

56
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,796
I should have been so lucky
to get pregnant by mistake.

57
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,793
What's with the eyes, Miranda?

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,598
Nothing.

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,275
You haven't said a word
and you're making the eyes.

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,635
- It's nothing.
- You think I'm pathetic.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,268
- It's not about you.
- What's not about me?

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,228
I cannot think of a worse time
to tell you this.

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,552
- What the 'F' is going on?
- I'm pregnant.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,629
- Steve.
- Mercy fuck?

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,114
He only has one ball!

66
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,077
Have a sip of water.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,470
How could you do this to me?

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,756
Stop, please.

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,593
What are you going to do?

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,113
You're not going to consider
having it?

71
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,953
This is not in my plans right now.

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,113
I feel awful talking about this
in front of you.

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,114
Then I'll leave. You can sit here
and have your abortion talk.

74
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,669
Charlotte, please sit down.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,116
She didn't mean it.
All she can think about is babies.

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,840
- She makes me sound...
- Don't do that.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,118
It's less than a desirable situation,
but it happens.

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,669
- We've all been there.
- I haven't!

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,956
I've had two.
What about you?

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,678
One.

81
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,513
Right, that waiter at TGl Fridays.

82
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,513
Can we not make this worse
than it was?

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,434
He was a waiter at the Saloon.
And let me remind you:

84
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,990
in 1988,
the Saloon was very happening.

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,071
Apparently.

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,990
Ready yet? 20 minutes.
Let's go!

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,829
- What?
- Nothing.

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,431
What?

89
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,078
Are you cuckoo now?
Are you going cuckoo on me?

90
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,915
I want to tell you something,

91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,231
but you have to swear
you won't tell anyone.

92
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,875
- I promise.
- Here.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,116
- Swear on Chanel.
- I swear.

94
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,031
Miranda's pregnant
and she's having an abortion.

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,274
Charlotte's devastated because
she's been trying to get pregnant.

96
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,716
- This is bad all round.
- Come here.

97
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,995
If Miranda doesn't want the kid,
can't she give it to Charlotte?

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,357
No. It's not like a sweater.

99
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,515
Who's the guy?

100
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,677
This is why you can't tell anyone.

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,592
It's Steve.
And he doesn't know!

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,751
Come on!

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,878
- I feel like you just trapped me.
- I had to tell you.

104
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,079
It's all I could think about.
I can't even pick a shoe.

105
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,710
She's going to do it
without telling him?

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,553
- What?
- It's his baby too.

107
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,190
Technically, it's not going
to be anybody's baby.

108
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,796
So it's all her decision?

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,509
Seems like the guy gets the shit end
of the stick.

110
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,875
It's a tough situation.
I don't know.

111
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,668
You ever had one?

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,434
No. God, no.

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,553
Thank God.

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,473
- lsn't that one adorable?
- Which one?

115
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,870
The red one. I love it.

116
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,112
The Birkin bag?
That's not even your style.

117
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,236
It's not the style.

118
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,836
- It's what it means.
- It means you're out 4,000 bucks.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,151
When I'm carrying that bag,
I'll know I've made it.

120
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,074
- The visiting hours are over.
- Bye-bye, Birkin.

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,199
I'm going with Miranda when she goes.

122
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,555
I was alone and it was awful.

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,236
- Why didn't you ask somebody?
- It's not a thing you publicise.

124
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,870
I lied to Aidan about having one.

125
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,316
It just came out.
I think he seemed relieved

126
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,472
that he could still think of me
in a certain way.

127
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,631
I don't know why I lied.

128
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,315
Maybe you still want him
to think of you in a certain way.

129
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,472
It happened.
You made the right decision.

130
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,835
But I never told the guy.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,389
You can't go down that road.

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,633
Did you really want to have a child
with a guy who serves burgers?

133
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,076
I could have a 13 year-old child!

134
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,755
But then I wouldn't have known you.
Can you imagine it?

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,229
No, I can't.

136
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,313
- I should have told Aidan.
- Coulda, woulda, shoulda!

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,552
So many roads,
so many detours.

138
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,315
So many choices,
so many mistakes.

139
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,429
As we drive along the road called life,
occasionally a gal will be a little lost.

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,912
When that happens, she has to let go
of the "coulda, shoulda, woulda"

141
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,036
and just keep going.

142
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,830
As we speed along to the destination
called "Who We Hope To Be",

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,549
I can't help but whine:
are we there yet?

144
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,196
For a publicist like Samantha, the road
to success was paved with stars.

145
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,920
Case in point:
lunch with Lucy Liu.

146
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,119
- I had no idea you were from New York.
- I'm a New York girl from Queens.

147
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,397
That's amazing!
I don't get Queens from you.

148
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,916
Look, bitch.
Don't start with me, right?

149
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,798
That's good.

150
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,679
Here's what I need.

151
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,073
I'm looking for someone from New York.
My last PR guy was a total liar.

152
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,834
I'm a big girl.
I can take the truth.

153
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,156
You want the truth?

154
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,437
Your last Golden Globe dress
was a disaster.

155
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,509
That's what I thought,
but the queens said it was fierce.

156
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,798
A girl from Queens should know better
than to listen to queens.

157
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,111
Another thing: I was a waitress.

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,118
25%. Very nice.

159
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,317
When I'm representing you,
it's class all the way.

160
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,236
- It's 4,000.
- I know.

161
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,356
And there's a waiting list.

162
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,149
- Five years.
- For a bag?

163
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,515
It's not a bag.
It's a Birkin.

164
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,236
Samantha was never one
for waiting in line,

165
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,675
so she cut right to the front.

166
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,913
It's not for me. It's for Lucy Liu.
I'm her press rep.

167
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,072
I would love her to carry this bag
to a premiere.

168
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,119
It would be photographed to death.
Does that make a difference?

169
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,476
Let me get Francesca,
our press rep, on the phone.

170
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,677
Would you?
How very helpful.

171
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,917
Over on Park Avenue,

172
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,629
Charlotte decided she couldn't wait
any longer either.

173
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,156
I'm calling to make an appointment
with Dr Peck.

174
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,153
We're having...

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm having some difficulty.
I think I need some fertility testing.

176
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,639
I would like to make an appointment
with Dr Genya.

177
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,030
I need to come in for a...

178
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,317
...procedure.
I'm pregnant and l...

179
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,151
...need not to be.

180
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,078
A few days later, Samantha
went down a road she shouldn't.

181
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,558
Hello. Francesca?
Samantha Jones.

182
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,952
Question: how long does Lucy Liu
have to wait for that Birkin?

183
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,270
If they're so hard to get,

184
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,309
why did I just see a fucking nobody
carrying the exact one we want?

185
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,632
Lucy Liu is a big fucking star!
She wants that bag.

186
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,349
Is Hermès French for
"we take our fucking time"?

187
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,476
Thank you so much.

188
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,917
My God! You scared me.

189
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,719
Sorry.
It's not a breaking and entering.

190
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,440
Your guy needed to take a leak.

191
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,040
- So what's new?
- Nothing.

192
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,748
Absolutely nothing.

193
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,875
- So how are things?
- The bar's busting my hump.

194
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,996
It's pretty good.

195
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,152
- How's Miranda? Is she OK?
- What do you mean?

196
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,756
- She never calls me back.
- She's great.

197
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,119
She must be pretty busy.

198
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,069
Did you tell him?
About Miranda and the...?

199
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,271
Are you sure?
He's asking about Miranda.

200
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,399
- He always asks about Miranda.
- You told him, didn't you?

201
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,393
It's OK.
I can't keep secrets, either.

202
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,154
- I didn't tell him.
- He's looking at me funny.

203
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,436
He looks that way at everyone.

204
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,319
I didn't tell him,
but he deserves to know.

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,916
- I don't agree with what she's doing.
- It's nothing to do with you.

206
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,834
Hey, chief. You told me.
I'd as soon not know any of it!

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,551
Sometimes you get in situations
that are hard.

208
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,999
We shouldn't be having this conversation
with him in the next room, so just go.

209
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,758
Go. He's probably listening.

210
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,796
- What's bugging you?
- Nothing.

211
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,351
Let's go!

212
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,748
Tell Miranda I said hi.

213
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,749
I'm on a wait list.
My regular doctor doesn't do them.

214
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,959
"No judgement". She said it
like it was all one word.

215
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,429
"l don't perform them.
No judgement."

216
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,195
I'm waiting to see
if another doctor can fit me in.

217
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,593
- Have you thought about telling Steve?
- No. Why would I tell Steve?

218
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,399
Maybe he has a right to know.
No judgement.

219
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,471
It sounds like judgement.

220
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,152
I told Aidan. I had to.

221
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,151
He'll tell Steve!

222
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,915
- I made him swear. On Chanel.
- If he took the oath of fabric....

223
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,516
He had strong opinions about the guy
having the right to know.

224
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,195
I didn't think this could get any worse,
but it has.

225
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,989
- Now I have to think about Steve?
- Wouldn't you want to know?

226
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,152
I don't even want to know
and it's me!

227
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,793
Did you tell that guy
from TGl Fridays?

228
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,394
It was the Saloon!
No, I didn't.

229
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,836
I was 22.
We barely knew each other.

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,549
We slept together once
after a drunken night at the Tunnel.

231
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,553
The Tunnel?
No judgement.

232
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,030
- Maybe I should have told him.
- I'm not telling Steve.

233
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,919
He'd want me to have it.

234
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,469
You know what? You're right.

235
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,438
Forget my life.
I'm having Steve's baby.

236
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,318
Pizza for everybody!

237
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,238
Everything looks just fine.

238
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,276
It looks good.

239
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,869
- No, sorry. Spoke too soon.
- What is it?

240
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,192
Your blood and mucus tests show
elevated anti-sperm antibodies.

241
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,078
Is that bad?

242
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,198
It will be more difficult
to conceive naturally.

243
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,557
- How much more difficult?
- I'd give it a 15% shot.

244
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,149
I would not suggest you wait much longer
before you explore in vitro.

245
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,070
After they learnt about their detour
on the road to baby,

246
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,870
Trey had to go back to the hospital.
Charlotte decided to walk home.

247
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,274
- "Oh, hi?" Are you kidding me?
- What do you mean?

248
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,670
You saw me
and walked the other way.

249
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,355
I didn't see you,
I just changed direction.

250
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,638
You don't return my calls
and now you pretend not to see me.

251
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,473
I really can't see you right now.

252
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,074
You have to,
I'm standing right here.

253
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,075
I'm sorry about this whole thing,
but it's not a personal attack on you.

254
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,916
- I don't want to talk about this.
- This is hard for me too,

255
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,517
worrying that you hate me because
you think you can't get pregnant.

256
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,195
- I can't get pregnant.
- If I can, you can.

257
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,070
No, I can't.
I just came from the doctor.

258
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,873
My body is attacking Trey's sperm.

259
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,271
15% chance of ever having a baby!

260
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,793
- Is it OK if I go now?
- Sure.

261
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,476
- Shall I walk with you?
- No, I just want to be alone.

262
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,759
I'll walk a little way behind you
in case you want to talk.

263
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,229
No, I'm OK.

264
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,869
Charlotte walked all the way home.

265
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,508
Even though she never turned back,

266
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,558
she knew Miranda was behind her.

267
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,191
That's Lucy Liu!

268
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,072
Sorry I'm late.

269
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,391
- Don't worry about it.
- Look what I got.

270
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,348
A man dropped it off at my hotel
this morning. Hermès.

271
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,991
It's a Birkin. Not really my style,
but it's a free bag.

272
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,628
It's not exactly free.
I paid for it.

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,473
- That's my bag.
- What do you mean?

274
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,950
There was a five-year waiting list.
I used your name.

275
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,795
Cutting to the chase, yes.

276
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,713
As long as we're cutting to the chase,
the PR rep from Hermès called

277
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,872
and told me my rep yelled "fuck"
at her 12 times.

278
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,838
Is that your idea of class?

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,993
- I have never used the 'F' word!
- Who the fuck are you kidding?

280
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,789
Yes, I called to check on the bag.
You know what?

281
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,112
I was on my cell.
Maybe she picked up a crazy person.

282
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,877
One time, I got this woman screaming
from somewhere in New Jersey.

283
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,552
The only thing worse than a liar
is a bad liar.

284
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,315
- I won't need your services any more.
- I am telling the truth.

285
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,033
If I was as bad an actress as you,
I'd still be working at TGl Fridays.

286
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,274
That's my fucking Birkin!

287
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,069
There went Lucy Liu,
all because of a Lucy lie.

288
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,833
Meanwhile, I found myself
back at a familiar crossroads:

289
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,470
the corner of Columbus and 1988.

290
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,357
It was amazing.
It hadn't changed at all.

291
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,080
Same table, same menu...

292
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,551
...same waiter.

293
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,675
Burger medium-well, calamari.

294
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,478
I couldn't believe it.

295
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,155
His roller skates were gone,
his hair was thinner,

296
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,312
but it was definitely Chad.

297
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,480
"Drunken night at Tunnel" Chad.

298
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,792
- You ready to order?
- Hello, there.

299
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,158
Our soups of the day are lentil
and tortilla.

300
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,309
Chad?

301
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,478
It's me, Carrie.

302
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,074
Bradshaw.

303
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,874
We met 13 years ago.

304
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,033
I came in a few times,
half lemonade, half ice tea.

305
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,310
And then there was that night
at the Tunnel.

306
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,994
Tunnel?

307
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,278
- I never went to Tunnel.
- You went to Tunnel.

308
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,670
Sorry, Cherie. I don't remember.

309
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,037
- It's Carrie.
- Right, Carrie.

310
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,910
I'll take the lentil soup
and some crackers.

311
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,116
Crackers come with.

312
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,749
Was I at least smart enough
to try something?

313
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,310
No. You were the perfect gentleman.

314
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,874
I stayed in 1988 long enough to realise
I had made the right decision.

315
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,873
Even though I was sitting
in the same seat,

316
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,952
I was in a totally different place.

317
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,796
Do you suffer from headaches,
allergies, diabetes?

318
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,110
No, no, no.

319
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,714
Bad judgement with old boyfriends?
Yes.

320
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,713
I think I can write that in.

321
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,196
Does it hurt?

322
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,990
Not really.
Mostly it's just unpleasant.

323
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,436
What about after?
How long until I feel back to normal?

324
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,115
- You'll have to ask them.
- How long until you felt normal?

325
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,316
Any day now.

326
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,634
I'm doing the right thing.

327
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,314
- Right?
- I cannot answer that.

328
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,040
- What do you think?
- What do you think?

329
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,111
Want to go one more round?

330
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,477
Charlotte has a 15% chance,
so she's really trying.

331
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,316
What if I wake up at 43 and find
that my one semi-decent ovary gave up

332
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,675
- and I can't have kids?
- 43?

333
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,195
That's my scary age.

334
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,677
Mine's 45.

335
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,759
This happened against the odds.

336
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,549
My stupid egg found its way
to the three sperm he had left.

337
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,471
God, Carrie.

338
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,830
Is this my baby?

339
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,349
- What am I waiting for?
- Sweetie, do you want to leave?

340
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,953
No.

341
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,509
I can't have a baby.

342
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,275
I could barely find the time
to schedule this abortion.

343
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,431
Miranda Hobbes?

344
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,316
Motherfucker!

345
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,799
- Take it easy. Sip slowly.
- I'm OK.

346
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,710
- Little pillow here.
- I got it.

347
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,752
I thought flowers might do whatever
they do in a situation like this.

348
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,517
I felt the same about lemon strudel.

349
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,390
- How are you feeling?
- Pretty freaked out.

350
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,519
Charlotte, I didn't do it.

351
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,353
I'm keeping the baby.

352
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,071
Oh, my God.

353
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,437
We're having a baby?

354
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,468
And with those four little words,
three aunts were born.

355
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,437
As for me, I shoulda left Miranda's
earlier so I woulda been on time.

356
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,590
Ten minutes late. That's the charm in me.

357
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,558
They wouldn't seat me
till my party was here.

358
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,154
- I'm your party?
- Excuse me?

359
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,038
Here she is.

360
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,794
We let the table go.
There'll be a wait.

361
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,469
- We can go someplace else.
- And wait there?

362
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,837
- We'll be at the bar.
- I'll put your name on the list.

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,719
There's a wait to wait?

364
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,838
We'll be outside.
Don't forget us.

365
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,791
Excuse me.

366
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,911
- How's that beer?
- That's classy. No waiting.

367
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,190
Nice!

368
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,077
I lied to you.

369
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,038
I did have an abortion.

370
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,191
The condom broke.

371
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,749
That's another lie.
There was no condom.

372
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,356
- Why all the lying?
- I'm afraid you'll judge me.

373
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,956
For being 18 and sleeping
with a guy without a condom,

374
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,554
getting pregnant and not telling him.

375
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,393
There. That's the whole truth.

376
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,074
Except that I was twenty...

377
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,992
...two.

378
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,833
22. I should've known better.

379
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,595
- Is your name really Carrie?
- Yes.

380
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,034
Are you judging me?

381
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,989
- I was no angel.
- Did you get a girl pregnant?

382
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,912
No, not that I know of.

383
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,791
It must be nice to be
a guy sometimes.

384
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,350
Am I still your girl?

385
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,795
- Your table is ready.
- Be right there.

386
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,433
Another thing:
Miranda's keeping the baby.

387
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,789
Don't tell Steve.
It's not our business.

388
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,355
They say life is what happens
when you're busy making other plans.

389
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,988
But sometimes in New York,

390
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,312
Iife is what happens
when you're waiting for a table.
