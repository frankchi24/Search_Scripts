1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,432
No matter how well
you think you know New York,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,070
there's always somewhere
or someone new to discover.

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,755
I was on my second date
with Ray King, who lived in Queens.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,198
It felt like our fourth as we'd been
to three jazz clubs in one night.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,271
I can't sing but I can chop.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,830
- Where does one learn this skill?
- Jersey Shore.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,309
- That's where you're from?
- Listen.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,756
This lick right here
is why I wanted to play the bass.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,872
Man! How about that?

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,715
Jesus, that's sweet. Listen to that again.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,472
How about that?

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,792
This might be a good time to tell you.
I don't like jazz.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,078
Why would you say
something like that?

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,153
You can't follow it
and there's no melody.

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,958
It's all over the place.

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,430
You've got to stop trying to make it
be something else

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,593
and appreciate it for what it is.
I wish I had my bass.

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,995
Come here. You be the bass.

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,516
Don't I have to be
in the Musicians Union?

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,956
- You play all those instruments?
- I learn a few notes,

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,510
I get bored, I move on.
Listen to the bass.

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,234
The beauty of jazz
is that it can go anywhere.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,190
It can go from here...

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,391
...to here...

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,631
...to here.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,351
It was then I started to appreciate
a little type of music

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,511
we call jazz.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,752
- What did you do last night, Carrie?
- I listened to jazz.

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,235
What is so funny about jazz?

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,757
Here it is.

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,192
Last night, with Ray, I had...

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,472
...the most intense orgasm
of my entire life.

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
I did my laundry. Continue.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,117
It doesn't make sense.
We've only been on two dates.

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,070
- Yet you had sex with him.
- Can we let Carrie talk about the sex?

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,674
The mind-blowing sex.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,594
I realise that this next statement
makes me a bit of a freak,

38
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,111
but I usually have to be in love
with someone to have such an orgasm.

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,478
- You should see someone about that.
- What the hell is going on?

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,791
- Maybe Ray is the one.
- Your clitoris thinks so.

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,669
It was probably a fluke.
I'm going back tomorrow to find out.

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,389
- l, on the other hand, am on strike.
- What does that mean?

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,869
I'm not having any more sex.

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,871
That's a slump.

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,510
It might have started as one,
but I'm in control now.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,309
I refuse to have sex
until conditions improve.

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,914
How many people will be affected?

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,072
So far just the one,
but I'm optimistic.

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,437
I can't go on any more bad dates!

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,469
I'd rather be home alone than out with
a guy who sells socks on the lnternet.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,108
I'm dating someone.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,310
- Someone I actually like.
- Good!

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,629
Maria.

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,877
My Maria, from the gallery?

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,750
She's my Maria now.
We're having a relationship.

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,718
Yes, ladies. I'm a lesbian.

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,908
Wait a second!
You're in a relationship?

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,233
She just walked in
so get those looks off your faces.

59
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,791
- You know Charlotte.
- Sure.

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,192
- And this is Carrie and Miranda.
- Really good to see you!

61
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,999
I see you told them.

62
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,870
How does that work? You wake up
one morning, and you're a lesbian?

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,157
I forgot to tell you.
I'm a fire hydrant!

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,199
I'm a shoe. I always wanted
to be one and now I am.

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,318
She's not a lesbian.
She just ran out of men.

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,836
Then you go on strike,
you don't eat pussy!

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,878
Did you just say, "eat pussy"?

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,077
I did, but just for emphasis.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,513
The truly amazing thing is
I had the news tonight!

70
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,912
- I had the most intense...
- Mind-blowing was the word.

71
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,790
...orgasm of my life and Samantha
still managed to up-sex me.

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,514
They met at my gallery.
I introduced them.

73
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,636
You're a pimp.

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,233
Later, inspired by Samantha's
exploration of new territory,

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,995
Charlotte felt it was time to conquer
some old territory:

76
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,551
the bed, where she and Trey
had so much trouble as man and wife.

77
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,392
Here we are.

78
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,195
Shall we have a glass of wine first?

79
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,432
- I'm fine, unless you...
- No, no. I'm OK.

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,397
If you don't feel ready...

81
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,718
Just because she was on strike
didn't mean she had to do without.

82
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,398
And Miranda discovered
the perfect relationship.

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,396
Jon Stewart and chocolate éclairs.

84
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,995
Charlotte and Trey enjoyed a sweet
ending to their evening as well.

85
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,230
Not bad, huh?

86
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,153
That was almost mind-blowing.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,711
Charlotte was relieved.
Now they had fixed the bedroom problem,

88
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,668
she was ready to move back in
to the other rooms as well.

89
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,594
So, what are you thinking?

90
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,151
I'm thinking I've never seen
my John Thomas so hard.

91
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,154
At times I felt like it was going
to rocket right off.

92
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,118
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know.

93
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,392
Should l...?

94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,758
Do you...?

95
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,080
- Are we ready to...?
- Go again?

96
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,792
Houston, we don't have a problem.

97
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,308
Three, two, one, blast-off!

98
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,990
- Who is it?
- It's Ray.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,309
Hi, come on up.

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,072
Shit.

101
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,239
Did you and the girls run
down the street talking about me?

102
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,960
- Maybe.
- How many blocks?

103
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,671
- Two. OK, nine.
- Honestly, I'm a little hurt.

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,470
After all the hours I've listened
to you talk about your relationships.

105
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,473
- You do that?
- I make the courtesy call!

106
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,915
"Do you think you love him?"

107
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,675
You just caught us off guard
with the lesbian thing.

108
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,355
- It's a label, like Gucci or Versace.
- Or Birkenstock.

109
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,389
It's not about being gay or straight.
Maria is an incredible woman.

110
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,471
She's got passion, talent,

111
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,437
- intelligence...
- A vagina.

112
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,039
Vagina schmagina.

113
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,192
Schmagina?
Is that what lesbians are calling it?

114
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,434
- We haven't even had sex yet.
- You really are in a relationship.

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,115
Yes, I am, Carrie.
Life is not all about sex.

116
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,316
Tell that to her schmagina.

117
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,316
I want a bourbon
and I want to go down on you.

118
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,436
Not necessarily in that order.

119
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,873
I really want it to be special
the first time.

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,032
I'm sure that it will be special.

121
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,070
I'm sure it will be special.

122
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,437
- Because...
- Is Ray there?

123
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,593
No, no, Samantha. I'm listening.
I'm listening.

124
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,309
I thought about what Samantha said.

125
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,552
She wasn't having sex
as she wanted a relationship.

126
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,793
I hoped mind-blowing sex
would become a relationship.

127
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,795
We've got a relationship without sex
and sex without a relationship.

128
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,428
Which had a better shot at survival?

129
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,070
I had to wonder. What comes first:
the chicken or the sex?

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,757
That night,
I decided to really talk to Ray.

131
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,276
We needed to catch the relationship
up to the sex.

132
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,715
That was the plan.

133
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,678
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait!

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,549
I asked you a question.
Where did you go to school?

135
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,790
All over.

136
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,477
Freckles on the legs.
Nothing wrong with that!

137
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,837
It was my best relationship ever.

138
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,356
Over at Casa de Lesbo...

139
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,988
That coq au vin was amazing.

140
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,869
You can paint, you can cook,
you can do everything.

141
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,119
But you brought
the most incredible dessert.

142
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,631
A bite.

143
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,633
Samantha decided
if she was going to be gay,

144
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,791
she'd be gay all the way.

145
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,398
I might not be much in the kitchen,

146
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,711
but I'm more than enough
in the bedroom.

147
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,716
Samantha...
It's not really working for me.

148
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,393
It was a phrase Samantha
had never heard in bed before.

149
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,473
Honey, I've never gotten
any complaints from the men.

150
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,676
Well, men.

151
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,195
I want you to look at me,

152
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,395
connect with me.

153
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
This is lovemaking.

154
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,636
It's not a porno flick.

155
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,358
I want to show you.
I'm going to lay down,

156
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,715
and I want you to look
at my buceta.

157
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,951
It's a Portuguese word for pussy.

158
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,632
Miranda, still off sex
and on chocolate,

159
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,999
couldn't order the seven éclairs
she wanted so she asked for just one.

160
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,472
One cake, please.
Which do you recommend?

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,758
The Louvre, Monsieur Payard's
signature chocolate cake.

162
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,518
Sold.

163
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,958
- That'll be 74.50.
- As in 74 dollars and 50 cents?

164
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,075
Yes.

165
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,028
Miranda decided
she didn't need a cake that badly.

166
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,914
Especially when she could make one
for under $5.

167
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,629
Every once in a while,
a girl has to indulge herself.

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,833
- Trey, I'm on the mallard!
- What? Sorry.

169
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,955
He hasn't asked me to move back.

170
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,114
We make love all over the apartment
then I get a cab home like some hooker!

171
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,670
- Can't you bring it up?
- No! The penis works now,

172
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,956
I don't want to scare it.

173
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,476
Why can't I have
the relationship and the sex?

174
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,313
Where's the lesbian du jour?

175
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,156
When she gets here,
we have to talk about her relationship.

176
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,914
She wants us to take it seriously.

177
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,117
It isn't a relationship.
She's doing it to bug us.

178
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,794
I don't know.
They haven't had sex yet.

179
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,078
- She wants it to be special.
- Really?

180
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,628
This is the healthiest thing
Samantha's done in a long time.

181
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,917
Does anybody want to split
the chocolate pudding?

182
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,036
Morning, ladies!

183
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,118
Tell us about the relationship.
How are things going?

184
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,836
Did you know that when a vagina
gets engorged,

185
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,675
it expands to the size of a fist?
It's like a fabulous cave!

186
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,832
- I guess they've had sex.
- Apparently so.

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,118
- We have three holes down there!
- Enough about your relationship.

188
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,238
There are places
a dick just can't go!

189
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,709
Some dicks manage just fine.

190
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,590
- Maria has ten dicks.
- For the record, you started this.

191
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,470
I am sorry,
but a finger is not a dick.

192
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,949
It's more like a third of a dick.

193
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,793
Technically,
Maria has three and a third dicks.

194
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,713
I can tell you right now.
This...

195
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,035
...is not the same as this.

196
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,831
Put that away.

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,072
I'm just saying
size has nothing to do with it.

198
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,596
- What's happening to you?
- I'm getting an education!

199
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,038
I know all there is to know
about the glorious buceta.

200
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,156
That's Portuguese for pussy.

201
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,471
Buceta, schmagina,
let's call the whole thing off.

202
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,430
The most important thing is that Maria
has taught me to connect during sex.

203
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,512
It's not just some animal act.

204
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,195
It's about two people, making love.

205
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,068
I couldn't pick a shirt.
Come in.

206
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,117
I'm making margaritas.

207
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,353
Look what I bought today.
My first jazz CD.

208
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,989
You've got to hear that on vinyl.

209
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,679
Wait, Ray.

210
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,034
Ray! Stop!

211
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,195
Don't play anything.
Don't scat, don't chop, don't blend.

212
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,397
Could we just sit and talk for a while?

213
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,834
The gotta-talk girl.

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,594
You're thinking,
"Where's this going?"

215
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,354
I'm not that girl.
I'm not any girl.

216
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,476
I just want to talk.

217
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,675
You know, talk.

218
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,231
Where are you from? You said
something about the Jersey Shores.

219
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,111
I spent a couple of summers there. Used
to go skeet shooting with my buddies.

220
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,432
- On the Jersey Shore?
- Upstate New York. And pull!

221
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,558
Why no skeet in the city?
I love the skeet!

222
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,280
I should open one in New York.

223
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,910
Canned corn. When did you last
have that? It sounds good.

224
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,150
- You hungry?
- No, because...

225
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,072
I had a potpie in Vegas once,
loaded with corn.

226
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,437
As Ray talked,
I realised he wasn't spontaneous

227
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,433
and unpredictable and thrilling.

228
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,160
He was a guy with ADD.

229
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,198
What relationship could I have
with a guy I couldn't talk to?

230
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,673
I'd have to end it.

231
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,189
You like pies?

232
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,789
Want to play me?

233
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,672
Eventually.

234
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,471
Meanwhile, uptown,

235
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,436
Trey had one last chance
to ask Charlotte to move in.

236
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,955
I'm just going to say it.

237
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,670
Next time I'm hard, would you
consider measuring my John Thomas?

238
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,308
What? No!

239
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,835
I understand.
It's juvenile, I know,

240
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,072
but I've just never seen it
like this.

241
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,275
I'm taking a shower.

242
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,590
Charlotte never cared much
about penises

243
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,832
and now
a penis was running her life.

244
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,639
Forget it.

245
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,756
As Charlotte lathered up,
she started to get lathered up.

246
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,471
Who did he think he was?
They were husband and wife.

247
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,791
What the hell was going on
in this nightmare?

248
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,473
I am tired of being married
to your penis!

249
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,677
I am a person!
This should be a relationship!

250
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,274
I am done walking on eggshells!

251
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,752
Don't talk about moving in
in front of the penis, it might go soft!

252
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,391
The penis likes this but not that,
and the penis wants to be measured!

253
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,755
- It was just a thought.
- Here's another.

254
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,515
- Shove this marriage up your ass!
- Charlotte, don't go.

255
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,992
I'm going home to my apartment,
where I have a lease.

256
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,829
I hope that you and your penis
have a very lovely night!

257
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,072
Meanwhile, Miranda was getting
fed up as well, with herself.

258
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,395
Hi, it's me. Leave a message.

259
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,394
I know you're probably busy
having mind-blowing sex now,

260
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,155
but I feel you need to know
your friend Miranda Hobbes

261
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,677
has just taken a piece of cake
out of the garbage and eaten it.

262
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,153
You'll need this information when you
check me into the Betty Crocker Clinic.

263
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,713
That night, Miranda realised she'd used
chocolate as a substitute for sex

264
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,236
and now she needed
a substitute for chocolate.

265
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,240
The strike was officially over.

266
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,919
That's perfect!

267
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,232
Just when she thought
she knew everything about women...

268
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,477
...Samantha caused
the very elusive female ejaculation.

269
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,598
- Was that good or bad?
- That was very...

270
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,398
...good.

271
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,189
Samantha got
the relationship and the sex.

272
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,597
In fact, a little more sex
than she'd expected.

273
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,875
I want some water.
You want some water?

274
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,398
Be right back.

275
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,516
Next morning, I had a new thought.

276
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,798
Maybe Ray was like jazz. Instead
of making him be something else,

277
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,191
I needed to appreciate him
for what he was:

278
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,920
truly mind-blowing sex.

279
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,518
Unfortunately, I got the feeling
Ray had stopped playing me

280
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,875
and moved on to another instrument.

281
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,278
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

282
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,068
You left something at my...

283
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,437
At the apartment.

284
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,230
Charlotte,
I want you to move back in

285
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,960
and get rid of this old apartment.

286
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,839
And stay all night, every night.

287
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,959
And wake up next to me every morning
and be my wife.

288
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,956
You do?

289
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,035
I talked it over with my penis,
and we both agree.

290
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,477
I don't want to lose you again.

291
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,318
Charlotte York MacDougal...

292
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,669
...will you remarry me?

293
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,799
Yes, Trey MacDougal.
I will remarry you.

294
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,356
Walking home from ADD,
Another Dating Disaster,

295
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,956
I worried that there's a reason
it's called mind-blowing sex.

296
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,432
Maybe that physical connection
obliterates any intellectual one,

297
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,036
or maybe it's possible to find both.

298
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,795
That's what I was hoping
because great sex is great,

299
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,714
but I still like a song
with a melody I can sing to.



9999
