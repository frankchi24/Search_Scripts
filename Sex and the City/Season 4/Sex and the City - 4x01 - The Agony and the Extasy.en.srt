1
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,996
If you are single, there is one thing you
should take with you on a Saturday night:

2
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,116
your friends.

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,111
Why are we walking so fast?

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,157
Are we in that big of a hurry?

5
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,596
- Don't you guys want to go?
- I did until I saw this invitation.

6
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,398
Let me see that.

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,473
"Two souls, one thought".
That is sappy, totally not like Danny.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,713
Must have been her idea.
"Two souls, one pushy fiancée".

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,112
It's beautiful! A big romantic gesture
to express how they feel.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,239
If two people have only one thought,
something is very wrong. Cab.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,278
I remember Danny
having more than one thought.

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,557
- They all involved going up my ass.
- You had sex with Danny?

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,271
He's cute, straight, and we've known
him for ten years. Haven't we all?

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,637
- That weekend I was bored.
- Just a New Year's Eve kiss.

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,473
- I showed him a boob in a checkroom.
- Just one?

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,712
I sensed he couldn't commit.
We're over here.

17
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,316
Baby lamb chops!
This is quite a spread.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,278
Two souls, one big budget.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,159
There he was, the fiancé du jour.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,790
- Look who's here!
- Congratulations!

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,838
- Thanks. My other half, Hailey.
- Congratulations!

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,356
- Hailey, this is Carrie and Charlotte.
- Miranda.

23
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,279
Right! Sorry,
I'm just a little overwhelmed.

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,275
- Couldn't remember my name?
- You should've shown him both boobs.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,635
Across the room
from the two-soul couple...

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,429
I wanted a Grey Goose on the rocks
a fucking hour ago. Chop chop!

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,431
...a man with no soul.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,431
Phil, what is it that you do?

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,876
I'm a TV agent
and I fucking love it.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,077
What a beautiful wedding ring.
Where's your husband?

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,118
He's not here.

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,076
We're taking some time apart.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,279
We're separated, not legally.
Nothing legal! God, no!

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,591
We're just taking some time
to figure things out.

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,675
We got married really fast. Love
at first sight, didn't think it through.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,479
So now we're talking
and trying to figure out what he...

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,918
What we, he and l, really want.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,957
We love each other so much,

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,272
but that doesn't mean
a marriage is working, does it?

40
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,637
We had some problems
in the bedroom,

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,031
but it was more about the fact
that we got married so fast.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,079
So we're trying to figure things out,
nothing physical.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,196
It's better if we just talk.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,956
So we are talking till we figure it out.
So no, he's not here.

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,634
OK. I have to...

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,110
Don't talk to her.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,350
Charlotte realised that she and Trey
were two souls with too many thoughts.

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,479
The minute we met,
I knew we were meant to be together.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,633
- I could stop looking. I had found him!
- Congratulations!

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,951
- What about you guys?
- I'm not dating anyone.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,873
And you, Miranda?
Seeing anyone special?

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,476
No, but I am seeing
a whole bunch of unspecial guys.

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,795
It's a requirement to date me,
"Special? Sorry, move along,

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,430
"but if you have unspecial friends,
give them my number."

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,478
I'm serious! Do any of you
have an unremarkable friend

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,313
or maybe a houseplant
I can go to dinner with?

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,191
She's hilarious!

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,070
What was going on in there?

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,073
Your comedy routine
should have a two-drink minimum.

60
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,198
We were in a group
of married or engaged women.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,272
- Just trying to avoid the pity party.
- It was a cocktail party.

62
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,036
- We were the only single people.
- We're the only single people anywhere.

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,991
You didn't see all those
"Don't worry, you'll find someone" looks?

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,957
No, didn't see them.

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,476
Society views single people our age
as sad and pathetic.

66
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,189
I don't need that, so I go
on the offensive and make them laugh.

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,271
OK, Shecky.

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,877
Sometimes I think couples look at us
and wish they had our lives.

69
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,953
No. We make them uncomfortable
and they don't know what to say.

70
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,032
- You're sure you're not overreacting?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,477
Coming!

72
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,713
God!

73
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,438
Yes!

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,154
What are we doing?

75
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,591
Charlotte. I thought it was
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,435
I cannot go to any more parties
until I know what we're going to do!

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,431
- About what?
- Us!

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,834
I've been up for hours trying to figure
out if we should stay together.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
I don't want to confuse you,
so I made notes.

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,598
- You made notes?
- It helps me to be clear.

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,512
One: sex life.

82
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,796
The sex we had on the floor
of your apartment was quite good.

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,838
One time does not a marriage make.

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,673
Come inside.
We can rack up a new score.

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,912
Two: you only want me
when you can't have me.

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,873
Did you make a note that mentions
how beautiful you look tonight?

87
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,998
We have some big decisions to make.

88
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,591
Trey!

89
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
- You have a boner!
- You're so beautiful.

90
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,597
I can't discuss my notes
if you have a boner!

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,753
- Come inside.
- I can't. We're separated!

92
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,638
- I have more notes!
- May I take off your panties?

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,472
- Don't.
- All righty.

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,232
You didn't want to be married.

95
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,631
Now I don't know
if I want to be married!

96
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,115
Trey, are you...?

97
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,078
That night, neither Charlotte
nor Trey came inside.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,358
I'm not quite sure what to say.

99
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,637
I'm sorry, Charlotte.
May I get you a hankie?

100
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,396
It's too late for a hankie.
This isn't working.

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,875
Whatever this is we're doing,
it isn't working.

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,753
Please stop calling me. I'll call you
when I figure out what I want.

103
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,551
Charlotte, I love you.

104
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,316
Send me the dry-cleaning bill?

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,553
Trey may have had a lot of flaws,
but bad manners wasn't one of them.

106
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,311
It was a lovely, uneventful
Saturday morning.

107
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,313
Three lattes, two newspapers and...

108
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,200
...one dating-service application.

109
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,999
"Dear single".
You don't even have a name?

110
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,438
- I'm single, I don't deserve one.
- That's a postal drive-by shooting.

111
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,639
I thought those 57 menus daily
from Hunan Munan were annoying.

112
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,314
"Don't let your soul mate slip away."

113
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,391
It's almost a threat.

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,633
"We have him, but hurry
because he's slipping... There he goes."

115
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,951
Soul mates only exist
in the Hallmark aisle.

116
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,035
I disagree. I believe there's one perfect
person out there to complete you.

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,113
If you don't find him, you're incomplete?
It's so dangerous!

118
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,638
There's only one out there?
Why don't I shoot myself right now?

119
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,395
I like to think people have
more than one soul mate.

120
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,711
- I've had hundreds.
- You miss one, along comes another.

121
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,950
That is not how it works.

122
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,037
But you're saying you're not enough.

123
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,589
- Are you enough?
- Today she's too much.

124
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,073
The bad thing about the perfect soul mate
is that it's so unattainable.

125
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,196
You feel bad about yourself.

126
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,670
That makes the gap between the Holy Grail
and the assholes even bigger.

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,673
I don't care.
I believe in soul mates.

128
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,149
I thought Trey was mine,

129
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,835
but I don't think that a soul mate
would...on your leg.

130
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,350
There's got to be
that someone out there for me.

131
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,193
- Maybe I should keep looking.
- Here you go.

132
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,869
- Let's fill this out.
- I'm not in the mood.

133
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,713
- Not for you, for her.
- No!

134
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,030
Yes!
Age, check box:

135
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,317
20 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 34.

136
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,710
No, not after next week.

137
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,599
Birthday girl, 35.

138
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,230
- 35 to 44.
- Honey, welcome to my box.

139
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,439
Soul mate. Two little words,
one big concept.

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,151
A belief that someone, somewhere,
is holding the key to your heart

141
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,790
and your dream house.
All you have to do is find them.

142
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,315
So where is this person?

143
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,597
And if you love someone
and it didn't work out,

144
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,069
does that mean
they weren't your soul mate?

145
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,155
Were they just a runner-up
in the game show "Happily Ever After"?

146
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
As you move
from age box to age box

147
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,873
and the contestants
get fewer and fewer,

148
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,828
are your chances of finding
your soul mate less and less?

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,594
Soul mates:
reality or torture device?

150
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,752
What about a birthday dinner?
Il Cantinori, something nice.

151
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,595
I'm not sure I want to do anything
I'm kind of into laying low.

152
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,116
- Laying low or feeling low?
- No, I'm fine.

153
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,033
You've got to do better than that!

154
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,671
You've got to grab 35 by the balls
and say, "Hey, world, I'm 35!"

155
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,752
I'll put the dinner together.
You just show up.

156
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,117
Just close friends.
Very fabulous light.

157
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,114
All right. That sounds fun.
Thank you.

158
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,351
Should I invite Big?

159
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,353
Are you trying to kill me
on the way to lunch?

160
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,432
Technically you are friends now, right?

161
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,752
A phone call here and there.
Do you think I should invite him?

162
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,799
How should I know? When I'm done
with them, I'm done with them.

163
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,239
Maybe not. I think he's in London.
Let's keep it to low-maintenance friends.

164
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,668
- Welcome. Come in.
- He is hot!

165
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,116
- He is a priest.
- He is a hot priest!

166
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,159
Look at his robe.
It's so Robin and his Merry Men.

167
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,918
You tell them, Friar Fuck!

168
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,879
OK, Sister. Let's go.
I won't lose my table at Pastisse

169
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,191
- so you can cruise a holy man.
- What street are we on?

170
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,040
That Sunday, Samantha went to church.

171
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,470
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

172
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,871
I noticed all the good work
you do in the neighbourhood

173
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,352
- and stopped to see if I could help.
- We could use a hand in the kitchen.

174
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,549
I'm in public relations.
I could put a benefit together,

175
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,836
something classy, respectful.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,117
I can guarantee Donald Trump
and Marlo Thomas.

177
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,352
Thank you,
but we're a little more low-key.

178
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,559
We're more about collecting food
to feed to the needy.

179
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,792
So...I love your robe.

180
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,916
This is what we wear.

181
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,313
I'm in the Franciscan Order,
founded by St Francis. The robe is...

182
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,191
- Do you really want to hear about this?
- Tell me more about this St Francis.

183
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,478
He lived his life based on the vows
of poverty and chastity.

184
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,992
St Francis giving his coat to the poor.

185
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,392
Samantha Jones, public relations.

186
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,472
If you change your mind
about the benefit...

187
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,074
...or anything.

188
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,630
And just like that,
Samantha went from Mr No Soul

189
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,716
to Mr All Souls.

190
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,676
After church,
most people go out for pancakes.

191
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,354
Samantha wasn't most people.

192
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,549
Your face is glowing.
Did you get a facial or something?

193
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,757
- I masturbated all afternoon.
- All right, then.

194
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,037
- Seriously? All afternoon?
- Two, two and a half hours.

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,589
Who has the time?
I like to get in and get out.

196
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,594
I enjoy a quickie too,
but when it's good, I go with it.

197
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,194
I masturbated to my priest.

198
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,316
- Your priest?
- Friar Fuck!

199
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,472
We might have to get Charlotte
a crash helmet.

200
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,232
You have a priest?

201
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,554
She wants him but she can't have him.
It's all very "Thorn Birds".

202
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,792
He tears the food I'm carrying
out of my arms,

203
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,875
rips open my dress, lays me down
in the street and enters me.

204
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,508
What do you do for the next 140 minutes?

205
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,797
Stop! You're talking about a priest!

206
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,155
I can masturbate to whomever I like.

207
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,392
It's imagination.
It's fun and perfectly healthy.

208
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,870
- Who do you all fantasise about?
- Russell Crowe.

209
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,032
- Jinx! You owe me a Coke.
- That's amazing.

210
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,112
What did women do
before Russell Crowe?

211
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,510
George Clooney.

212
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,309
Clooney's like a Chanel suit.
He'll always be in style.

213
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,917
I masturbated to a bus boy who was rude
to me once. What does that mean?

214
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,155
Fine, the cheese stands alone.

215
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,517
Charlotte, get that judgmental
puss off and join in.

216
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,151
- Who do you fantasise about?
- No, it's private.

217
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,470
It can't be worse
than a priest and a bus boy.

218
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,156
We're not moving on till you tell us
about one of your masturbation guys.

219
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,313
It's not guys.
Lately it's just one man.

220
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,233
- LL Bean?
- No.

221
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,631
Trey.

222
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,998
And we have really perfect sex.

223
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,478
What do you think it means?

224
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,831
This is 459-1905. I'm not in,
so please leave a message.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,312
I think you're still in England,
but l...

226
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,758
It's midnight here in New York
and it's my birthday.

227
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,150
I am officially old.

228
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,189
So I felt the need to call
someone...older.

229
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,836
Some friends are giving me a dinner
tomorrow. Actually, it's tonight.

230
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,709
You're a friend,
so if you are back in town,

231
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,589
it's going to be at ll Cantinori
at 8.30.

232
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,673
And if you're still in London...

233
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,239
...then cheerio, old chap.

234
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,789
The next day, on Wall Street...

235
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,749
Sheila! Hi! How are you?

236
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,198
I'm fantastic! Joe and l
just got back from New Orleans.

237
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,590
Are you seeing anyone special?

238
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,751
Miranda wasn't feeling very Shecky.

239
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,875
No, I'm not.

240
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,589
He's out there.
You just haven't met him yet.

241
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,355
Maybe, maybe not.
I don't know if I believe all that.

242
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,353
Maybe there isn't someone
for everyone.

243
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,594
There it was: the truth.
No Hallmark hope, no two-drink minimum.

244
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,116
How is Joe? You've been married
for how many years now?

245
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,274
Five! I bet you're thinking,
"Where are the kids?" I said to Joe,

246
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,274
"We can have kids or gorgeous fabric
without chocolate stains."

247
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,910
Miranda realised
it's not just about being single.

248
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,914
Everyone has a sore spot
that needs a comedy routine.

249
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,238
And so Miranda laughed.
Not because it was particularly funny,

250
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,834
but because it was kind.

251
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,150
They told me you were inside.
Am I disturbing you?

252
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,598
May I join you?

253
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,235
I was thinking about you yesterday.
You and the work that you do.

254
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,794
I was at the market.

255
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,314
They're LeSueur peas.
They're the best.

256
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,109
That's very kind. Thank you.

257
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,478
I have a confession to make.

258
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,030
I think about you
other places than the market.

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,036
Do you ever think about me?

260
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,510
I believe that God made the body
and it's perfect in its splendour.

261
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,509
But I am not of my body.

262
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,716
My life is about other joys.

263
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,076
Samantha wondered if the hot monk
was her soul mate

264
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,437
as he was certainly unattainable.

265
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,717
I arrived at my party
after a day of shopping.

266
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,836
With no true soul mate,

267
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,515
I spent the day with my shoe-sole mate,
Manolo Blahnik.

268
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,150
- Good evening, can I help you?
- Bradshaw. Party of ten.

269
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,832
You're the first to arrive.
Follow me, please.

270
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,872
It's 8:45.
The reservation was for 8:30?

271
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,838
That's right. Here you go.

272
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,831
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

273
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,517
- Would you like a drink whilst you wait?
- A Shirley Temple, please.

274
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,752
Once everyone's here,
we'll be drinking lots of champagne.

275
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,593
Good. Great. Excellent.

276
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,357
20 minutes later, still no party.

277
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,712
Still alone.
Did anyone call asking for Bradshaw?

278
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,792
Not that I'm aware of.
Let me check.

279
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,871
OK, thanks.

280
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,672
- Can I bring you some champagne now?
- No, not yet.

281
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,637
Good. Great. Excellent.

282
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,797
25! Fuck, I'm old!

283
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,358
Sorry for holding the table.
I can't imagine where everybody is.

284
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,478
- There's only one ll Cantinori, right?
- Yes.

285
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,032
The woman with the birthday cake
is here

286
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,156
and she needs to be paid.

287
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,993
I'll just get my purse.

288
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,396
After I paid $70
for my own birthday cake,

289
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,994
I was totally out of the party mood

290
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,516
so I decided to go home
and kill myself.

291
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,752
What are you doing?
Look where you're standing!

292
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,798
Get the hell off there!
No, the other way!

293
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,269
The other way, for Christ's sake!

294
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,789
For crying out loud! Shit!

295
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,356
- I'm sorry.
- Marilyn Monroe, get off the road!

296
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,317
I'm sorry!

297
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,477
Shit! I'm sorry!

298
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,874
By the time I got home, I had fallen
into an emotional hole so deep

299
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,476
only a fireman without a collarbone
could rescue me.

300
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,392
You have 14 messages.

301
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,195
I'm trapped at work,
I'll be ten minutes late. See you soon.

302
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,157
Carrie, I'm in traffic.
They're paving Fifth Avenue!

303
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,278
Don't wait for me, happy birthday!

304
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,198
I'm stuck in traffic, I can't spell ll Cantinori
for the idiot at 411, get a cell phone.

305
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,311
Carrie, it's Stanford.
I'm at the wrong place.

306
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,519
Did you know there's a Mexican
restaurant called El Cantinoro?

307
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,516
I'm here.
They said you left.

308
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,399
Where are you?
We're still here.

309
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,233
We're coming uptown to meet
you at the coffee shop.

310
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,356
- 20 minutes.
- End of messages.

311
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,672
It's just me!
It's just me, Charlotte!

312
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,559
I just aged 35 more years.

313
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,159
- What are you doing here?
- I'm taking you to the coffee shop.

314
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,438
No, I'm going to bed.
I am not in the mood to be with people.

315
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,875
You have to come.
It's your birthday.

316
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,468
I am aware of that!

317
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,757
The longer I sat at the table,
the more alone I felt.

318
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,388
It really hit me:
I am 35 and alone.

319
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,076
- You are not alone.
- No, I know I have you guys.

320
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,879
I hate myself for saying this, but...

321
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,994
...it felt really sad

322
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,072
not to have a man in my life
who cares about me.

323
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,313
No special guy
to wish me happy birthday.

324
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,353
No goddamn soul mate.

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,595
I don't even know
if I believe in soul mates.

326
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,149
Don't laugh at me, but maybe we could
be each other's soul mates.

327
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,838
Then we could let men be just
these great, nice guys to have fun with.

328
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,760
That sounds like a plan.

329
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,670
- I'm 35. 35 is not 25.
- Thank God!

330
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,513
I'm 35!

331
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,391
Shut the fuck up. I'm 140.

332
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,796
Happy birthday, baby.

333
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,552
Get in.

334
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,595
- It's after 12. You're late.
- Not really. I'm on London time.

335
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,833
- London is five hours ahead.
- In that case, I'm really late.

336
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,073
I can't believe you actually
got out of the car and got balloons.

337
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,277
I didn't. Raoul did. Good man.

338
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,558
So...

339
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,235
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

340
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,914
You don't have to give me
an exact number.

341
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,310
Pick a box.
30 to 35?

342
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,472
35 to 40? 40 to 45?

343
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,556
Really? 40 to 45.

344
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,837
I don't know what you mean.
I had something in my eye.

345
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,833
How do you feel about soul mates?

346
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,549
Well, I like the word "soul".

347
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,395
I like the word "mate".
Other than that, you got me.

348
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,748
- Did you have a nice day?
- I had a fabulous day.

349
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,030
Good for you.

350
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,317
As Big's car drove away,

351
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,870
I realised having three soul mates
already nailed down

352
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,114
made it a lot easier to spot those great,
nice guys to have fun with.
