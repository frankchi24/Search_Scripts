1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,516
One of the best things about New York
is that on any night

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,511
there are a million things to do.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,312
One of the worst things about New York
is trying to pick one.

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,749
Those floors next door
are in worse shape than yours.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,150
Shall I try to get us into "Town."?

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,472
That restaurant in Chambers Hotel
with the period in the name - Town, period.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,677
It's supposed to be amazing,
exclamation point.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,308
You know what sounds
amazing to me?

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,636
A hot shower,
watching the game,

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,632
bucket of KFC, mashed potatoes, biscuits.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,678
- It's Saturday night.
- It's finger-lickin' good.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,677
K, period! F, period! C, period!

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,751
Get over here and do me!

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,876
Is that your standard greeting?

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,235
I thought it was Richard.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,755
He said he'd call back four hours ago!

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,399
I've been waiting.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,791
My dinner's arriving in a bucket.
Do you want to go out?

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,838
Immediately! I'll conference in the others.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,992
It's the only way to do three-way
phone sex.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,596
- York/MacDougal residence.
- It's for me! I've got it!

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,911
- First time we've talked today.
- We're going out.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,878
- Who's on the phone?
- All of us. It's the future!

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,794
- Why are you calling so late?
- It's 7:30. Were you asleep?

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,839
I'm pregnant. I'm spending my last
months of freedom in bed.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,152
- Don't spend them alone in bed.
- Go on without me. Save yourselves!

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,678
We're all going. We have to stop
ourselves becoming officially boring.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,990
I say we go dancing.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,994
But not somewhere where no one's
interested because I'm fat.

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,869
- You're not fat, you're pregnant.
- Men will be lining up at the door.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,077
I know exactly where we should go!

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,312
That night, we answered
the age-old question:

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,871
"Where are all the hot guys?"
The hot gay guys.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,357
They were at the hot gay club,
Trade.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,270
- I feel like we don't belong here.
- That's because we're wearing shirts!

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,637
Why don't straight men
have bodies like this?

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,749
If straight men could have sex at the gym,
they'd work out all the time too.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,831
I've had sex at the gym.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,560
Samantha's motivating the masses.

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,190
- I'm going to the ladies.
- Me, too. I bet there's no line.

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,635
We'll meet you at the bar.

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,350
- It's Anthony!
- What are you doing here?

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,398
We're just shaking things up.
You remember Carrie?

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,758
- Love what you're almost wearing.
- Day-Glo underwear. Look into it.

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,708
This is my friend Gordon,
design editor for "House & Garden".

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,633
Oh, my God!
I love that magazine!

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,553
I used to wear my mother's pearls
and flip through it!

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,915
Me, too!

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,435
I've got a great "before" apartment.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,751
You should see Charlotte's apartment.
It's gorgeous!

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,032
We're doing an urban issue.
Maybe I'll check it out.

52
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,874
If my apartment could be
in H&G magazine, I'd be in heaven!

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,157
You are pretty.
Do you want to dance?

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,400
How long have you worked there?

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,438
- I wind him up, she cashes in.
- You two together?

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,353
I'm hoping we will be around 3:30.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,308
- Dance?
- No, you kids go have fun.

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,233
- Watch out for the fairy.
- Which one?

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,079
- Attention, gentlemen. Ladies present.
- Sorry.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,278
There's no ladies' room because...

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,911
Excuse me. Thanks!

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,913
Don't mind me. Just looking.

63
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,992
It's like being a diabetic
at Baskin-Robbins.

64
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,278
Sir... Hello?

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,231
Excuse me! Over here! Hello?

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,392
Anybody?

67
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,756
- What do you need?
- A penis, evidently.

68
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm trying to order a Dirty Martini.

69
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,517
A Dirty Martini
for the lovely Carrie Bradshaw.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,433
- Thank you.
- Oliver Spencer.

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,912
I've been here six months. Your
column is my New York survival guide.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,390
You're a dead man.
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,313
- What do you do?
- I'm a shoe distributor.

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,756
- It would be cruel to kid me.
- All the top lines.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,835
- Offices here, Sydney and Milan.
- So you get a discount?

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,468
For special friends and columnists.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,550
- Cheers.
- Cheers to you.

78
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,351
- What's this?
- What?

79
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,509
That.

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,314
This.

81
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,268
- I keep forgetting I'm engaged.
- You can't go off the market!

82
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,274
- I'm allowed to see other gays.
- Let me take you to brunch.

83
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,635
I'll give you my card.

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,236
What's this? A goody-bag?

85
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,153
I was at a film release party earlier.

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,676
- "Jocks & Cocks 4".
- They said it was a Merchant lvory.

87
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,196
Would I enjoy this
if I missed one, two and three?

88
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,717
Yes, but you'd want to see those
eventually. Very important films.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,276
Max! Hi.

90
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,275
Max was a junior associate
at Miranda's firm. And apparently gay.

91
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,477
- I had no idea.
- I didn't know you were a gay man.

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,795
I'm here with friends and there's no
ladies' room because...

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,791
Listen, Miranda.

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,549
I'd prefer if we didn't make
an issue out of this at work.

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,633
I wouldn't want the older partners
to treat me differently.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,475
I totally understand.
Between you and me, I'm pregnant.

97
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,349
And unwed. You should spend
less time in gay clubs.

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,308
- Seriously, good for you.
- That remains to be seen.

99
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,268
I haven't told anybody at work.
Goodbye to all the good cases

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,910
and eventually the buzzards
will start vying for my office.

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,799
It is a very nice office.

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,038
What did I miss?

103
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,998
I peed in the men's room
and outed a co-worker.

104
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,948
- I got a phone number and some porn.
- I saw two dicks and took "X".

105
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,636
- And I almost slept through this.
- You took ecstasy from a stranger?

106
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,758
He was a friend of my friend Bobby's
friend Bobby.

107
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,674
Then you know it's safe.
Will we be going to a rave later?

108
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,628
No, but I might visit Richard.
Sex on "X" is meant to be amazing.

109
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,395
- It releases all your inhibitions.
- You have inhibitions?

110
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,669
- Oh, my God. Look!
- Three dicks and counting!

111
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,676
They say opposites attract.

112
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,391
They don't mention that opposites
also tend to have opposite views

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,075
on what constitutes
a rocking Saturday night.

114
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,270
How was your night?

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,195
I've got a goody-bag.
Know what's in it?

116
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,397
Come on. I had to fight
a foreigner for it.

117
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,631
Come here.

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,755
Just tuck in here
and let's go to sleep.

119
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,914
- I'm not tired yet.
- You will be.

120
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,797
Hey, you. I had five cocktails.

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,516
I danced with a lot of fine,

122
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,353
half-naked men.

123
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,757
If you were to wake up right now,
I can almost guarantee

124
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,593
you would be in for some F...

125
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,197
...U...

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,714
...N.

127
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,393
I ate too much chicken, I think.

128
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,834
Will you rub my belly, baby?

129
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,551
I know it was wrong to compare,

130
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,076
but I felt like I had spent the evening
in a Calvin Klein ad

131
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,152
and now I was back to baseball,
buckets and BVDs.

132
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,195
Meanwhile,
Samantha was having excellent sex.

133
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,834
That was amazing!

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,629
You were amazing.
I love you, Richard.

135
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,236
I'm in love with you.

136
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,076
- You told him you loved him?
- It was the "X" talking.

137
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,916
- All I wanted was to have sex.
- Then what did he say?

138
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,278
- Nothing. He just went to sleep.
- Is it possible he didn't hear you?

139
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,159
He heard me.
Can I get a cab?

140
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,472
If he was a gentleman,
he'd pretend it never happened.

141
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,030
- But you did have sex?
- Of course we had sex.

142
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,988
Aidan and I didn't.
He fell asleep and I watched gay porn.

143
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,594
That's what happens
when you say "l love you".

144
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,036
- So do you love him?
- Who the hell knows?

145
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,078
- Maybe the "X" knows.
- It makes you giddy.

146
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,915
I was in love with the taxi driver,
the doorman, his sweater!

147
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,150
But you only said it to Richard.

148
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,518
I am never taking "X" again.
It is a dangerous drug!

149
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,196
That afternoon, I was high on another
feel-good drug: the new gay friend.

150
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,716
- Could you be more fantastic?
- They say you can't meet men in bars!

151
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,997
It was true last night.
I wanted to meet someone new.

152
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,038
Just a shag.
I've got a boyfriend in Sydney.

153
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,431
The only person I met was you.
Not that I'm disappointed.

154
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,388
Your boyfriend doesn't mind
if you date other men?

155
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,236
- Not date. Have sex with.
- Right. The international gay rules.

156
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,109
Blow jobs only. No last names.
The gym is a free space.

157
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,511
Don't show up at the same place
with the same shirt.

158
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,148
I crossed over into another
set of rules.

159
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,199
You've worked out more options
than "till death do us part".

160
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,999
I find that a little limiting.

161
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,355
I know monogamous gay couples.

162
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,399
But I'm a realist. I don't expect
to get everything from one man.

163
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,313
I shouldn't say this
to someone wearing a ring.

164
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,993
What's with you and this ring?

165
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,390
You haven't even mentioned him.

166
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,394
- What's Aidan like?
- He's very tall.

167
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,714
And incredibly kind.

168
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,278
And...

169
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,273
...handsome.

170
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,033
Why would you leave that at home?

171
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,953
He wanted to stay in
with a bucket of chicken.

172
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,910
He would have made my dad so proud!
Have you been to Bungalow 8?

173
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,995
No, but I hear it's a pretentious,
tiny club you need a key to get into.

174
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,116
- I have a key.
- When are we going?

175
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,878
If it isn't little Carrie Bradshaw!

176
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,476
Young Stanford! How are you?

177
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,837
At the moment, confused.
Who's this?

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,310
- Oliver Spencer, Stanford Blatch.
- Pleasure to meet you.

179
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,517
I don't mean to be rude,
but I must go to the men's room.

180
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,513
- I've just been. You'll love it.
- Really?

181
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,319
- I'll be right here.
- I'll be right back.

182
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,998
So...

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,074
I saw how you were behaving.
You're sleeping with the beautiful man.

184
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,519
- The beautiful man is gay.
- Damn. An accent always throws me.

185
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,673
He's only been here six months.
I picked him up at Trade.

186
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,950
- You went there without me?
- It wasn't the same.

187
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,430
I was prepared to lose you to Aidan,
but this...

188
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,158
Is just brunch.

189
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,515
- I'm green with envy.
- You are!

190
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,309
Fine. Have your beautiful brunch
with your beautiful man

191
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,711
then go home to your other
beautiful man. Greedy!

192
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,355
I started to think about restlessness
and relationships.

193
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,750
Once we've found what we want,

194
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,469
why are some of us reluctant
to let go of our single selves?

195
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,110
Is single life in New York
such a flurry of fun and friends

196
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,831
that settling down fills us with the urge
to shake things up again?

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,958
Why does becoming a couple
imply settling down?

198
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,954
Maybe we shouldn't expect
to get everything from one man,

199
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,477
but feel comfortable getting
different things from different people.

200
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,679
But when do separate interests
become separate bedrooms?

201
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,914
To be in a couple, do you have
to put your single self on a shelf?

202
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,389
Miranda's workaholic single self
was a thing of the past.

203
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,551
Now she was sleeping for two.

204
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,156
It's finally happening.
Stern, Hawkins, Ericsson

205
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,754
is moving into the future!

206
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,435
- Excuse me? We're moving?
- Casual Friday!

207
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,034
The entire partnership OK'd it.

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,510
Finally. I've been working on this
for two years.

209
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,953
- Right. Great.
- Thanks!

210
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,759
And...

211
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,876
...congratulations!

212
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,996
Did you tell Celeste I was pregnant?

213
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,789
- Yes, but only in your defence.
- What?

214
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,999
She was telling everyone
she saw you sleeping at your desk,

215
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,469
and that you might be an alcoholic.

216
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,750
- You told her I was pregnant.
- lsn't that better?

217
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,956
No. Not at a law firm, no.

218
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,918
Sorry. I told her it was a secret.

219
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,914
She can't keep a secret.
She's probably told everybody.

220
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,755
How would you like it if I told
everyone that you were gay?

221
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,914
Casual Friday has arrived.

222
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,314
Great. Maybe next
you can call my grandparents.

223
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,475
- Gay porn!
- What was your first clue?

224
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,393
You said we were watching
an independent film.

225
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,270
Relax. I've watched it already.
This is really funny!

226
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,199
That's the way to do it.
No "l love you", just good old fucking.

227
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,830
I am not in the mood for gay porn!

228
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,396
- Not in the mood for gay porn?
- You won't know how it ends.

229
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,189
"House & Garden" wants to shoot
my apartment. Trey doesn't care.

230
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,636
We turned off porn
to talk about a magazine?

231
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,075
He never cares about what I want.

232
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,277
Anthony is more excited about it
than Trey.

233
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,113
Gay men understand what's important.

234
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,430
Clothes, compliments and cocks.

235
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,956
And clubs. Oliver's taking me
to Bungalow 8 tomorrow.

236
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,112
You're cheating on Aidan
with a gay man.

237
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,158
Gay boyfriends
are the loophole of monogamy.

238
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,550
Mine outed me at work.
Then I outed him.

239
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,599
Even my gay relationships
are dysfunctional.

240
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,992
Aidan loves to stay in and I love
to go out. He's fine with that.

241
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,516
It's the greatest relationship ever
or we're headed...

242
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,433
For separate bedrooms, like me.

243
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,752
We're in different places.
Trey's content with what we have,

244
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,117
so I am a bad person for needing
to have a baby.

245
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,118
You're not.
You're a person with needs.

246
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,353
- Let's just watch that movie.
- I thought you'd never ask!

247
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,670
Samantha and Richard were taking care
of business, but not each other.

248
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,152
No more charity crap if we can't
get publicity. Steve Martin was there.

249
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,551
- He's the toast of New York!
- The toast of "The New Yorker".

250
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,833
Are we going to talk about this?
The thing I said the other night.

251
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,639
Samantha, you were high on "X".
Believe me, I've been there!

252
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,638
Good. OK, then.

253
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,116
Once it was clear that her
"l love you" didn't matter,

254
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,794
Samantha realised
she wished it did.

255
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,350
- You'll yell at "The Times"?
- I already did.

256
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,636
Did you need something else?

257
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,959
She wanted to say it wasn't the drug,
but she ignored her real feelings.

258
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,714
Fuck you at my place,
eight o'clock?

259
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,518
Sounds good.

260
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,517
On Casual Friday,

261
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,878
Miranda and Max came out of the closet
with their casual clothes.

262
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,919
Miranda showed up
as a proud single-mother-to-be.

263
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,311
Max showed up as a proud gay man
with a sense of style.

264
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,756
But when they saw Max's
sense of style,

265
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,275
that was the end of Casual Friday.

266
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,796
- Pretty.
- For the photo-shoot tomorrow.

267
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,074
Would you please move your stuff
out of the guest room?

268
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,277
- They're photographing in there?
- I don't know.

269
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,750
It doesn't look good
with us sleeping in separate rooms.

270
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,753
No, it doesn't, does it?

271
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,196
They want us to dress nicely
but not too formal.

272
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,708
- I'm in the picture?
- They want to photograph both of us.

273
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,668
- Why?
- They think we're the perfect couple.

274
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,917
I know.

275
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,557
But I promised
and they're coming.

276
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,316
- I don't want to do this.
- It's just one picture.

277
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,393
- It's important to me.
- I don't want to do this any more.

278
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,949
You were so angry at me.

279
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,276
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,597
I want a baby. I thought
that's what you wanted, too.

281
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,631
So did l.

282
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,438
I don't think
I should have to give that up.

283
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,231
You shouldn't.

284
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,632
You can have the apartment.
I'll move back in with mother.

285
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,235
Their separate interests had become
more than separate bedrooms.

286
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,551
They'd become a real separation.

287
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,037
Meanwhile, I tried to find a way
for my single self

288
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,475
and my couple self to coexist.

289
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,312
There you go.

290
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,076
- Where are you going all dressed up?
- I told you I was going out.

291
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,789
- I have to see Bungalow 8.
- What's that, a play?

292
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,997
It's a hot club. I need to know
about these things.

293
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,789
Some people consider my column
a New York survival guide.

294
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,349
What's going on here?

295
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,479
It's just something I'm trying.
It's closer to my heart this way.

296
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,152
- Are you going out with the girls?
- This guy, Oliver Spencer.

297
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,038
- A guy?
- He's gay.

298
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,077
Cool.

299
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,708
I am done for the night.

300
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,116
Do you want me to jump in the shower,
and come with?

301
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,397
I don't know. I don't know
if he can get us both in.

302
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,949
- We can get in anywhere.
- You need a key.

303
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,509
A key? Give me a break!

304
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,195
That kind of attitude
is not appreciated at Bungalow 8.

305
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,113
Why do you even buy into that shit?

306
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,714
Let's just go out to dinner.

307
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,678
I can't. I told Oliver.

308
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,150
All right, all right.
Don't forget your key.

309
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,710
We're very exclusive.
We might not let you back in.

310
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,037
Now I feel bad.
I discouraged him from coming.

311
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,510
- Call and have him join us.
- It's not his scene.

312
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,194
Then break it off.
This is Bungalow 8!

313
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,750
What's a relationship compared
to a night with strangers?

314
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,911
Oliver Spencer and date.

315
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,911
I'm your date?

316
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,438
There's one problem with having
a handsome gay man as your date:

317
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,955
other handsome gay men.

318
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,271
- I love those open-toed sandals.
- I can get you a pair.

319
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,034
- What size?
- 11.

320
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,393
Ollie? Is there anything to eat
at Bungalow 8

321
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,790
or is food so very last year?

322
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,678
You're in the middle of a spa session,
so I'm going.

323
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,756
You're going?

324
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,198
I left a gorgeous man at home
to come here and be your date.

325
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,716
I'm guessing Size 11 did as well.

326
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,155
I'm not really sure why I'm here.

327
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,438
Because you're fantastic.
I'm sorry I was neglecting you.

328
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,550
I'm very bad.
Kiss and make up?

329
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,679
If it isn't Mr and Mrs Down Under!

330
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,992
I'd been so preoccupied with my gay
boyfriend I forgot my gay husband.

331
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,790
- You remember Stanford from brunch?
- It was more than just brunch.

332
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,078
He's just a pretty face.
He doesn't love you like I love you.

333
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,119
I knew this woman when she took
the subway and wore Candies.

334
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,191
I never wore Candies.

335
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,557
Pink suede Candies,
and I adored you anyway.

336
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,510
How dare you try to steal her away
with your probably fake accent!

337
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,990
- I didn't know she was spoken for.
- She is.

338
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,515
All right. Kiss and make up?

339
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,988
Then I realised my single self life had
a shelf life that had just expired.

340
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,276
- OK, I'm going.
- OK.

341
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,432
No, stay.
We only just got here.

342
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,076
- Let me buy you another drink.
- I want to go home.

343
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,550
And the surprising thing was,
I did.

344
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,836
Honey, I'm home.

345
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,316
How was the Bungalow?

346
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,156
I've seen better.

347
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,392
Why do you own "Jocks & Cocks 4"?

348
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,158
More research
for the survival guide.

349
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,278
Really? What did you learn?

350
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,069
Give me some of that.

351
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,593
Big thank you to our gay friends.

352
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,676
That's the thing about Manhattan.
The exclusive clubs

353
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,310
only have a couple of members
and they're hard to find.

354
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,874
Next morning, "House & Garden"
came to Charlotte's house.

355
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,838
Fork, fork, knife, spoon!
Are these people crazy?

356
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,232
This is perfect. Upper East Side
breakfast for two. I love this china.

357
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,276
Thanks. It's our wedding china.
Anthony?

358
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,191
Could I talk to you a minute?

359
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,230
I'll be right back.

360
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,111
Is he cute or what?

361
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,038
- Trey and l...
- Splitting up. I knew it!

362
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,875
I don't think he's going to be
in the picture. Should we cancel?

363
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,032
Cancel?
"H&G"! Do it without him!

364
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,158
- Won't just me look bad?
- lt'll look beautiful.

365
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,949
He's the heart surgeon,
but you're the heart of this.

366
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,839
Look what you did to this place!

367
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,710
You could take any guy off
the street and make him wonderful.

368
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,350
You deserve more than that
stick-up-his-ass preppie.

369
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,955
Get in here and have breakfast.

370
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,638
- Gordon, it's just going to be...
- Are we ready for the picture?

371
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,512
One minute.

372
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,108
You don't have to...

373
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,875
This is important to you.
I at least want to do this.

374
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,360
Handsome husband,
beautiful wife...

375
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,589
...having breakfast!

376
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,958
Smile.

377
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,908
Trey had moved out by the time
the magazine came out,

378
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,913
but little girls
in their mothers' pearls

379
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,834
saw the picture and thought:
"That's what I want."

380
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,428
That's the thing
about relationships:

381
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,990
sometimes they look prettier
from the outside.

382
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,871
And what's inside
can be different than it seems.
