1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,598
Just after ten, I was dressed to the nines
at Brasserie Eight And A Half.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,672
On the corner of Right Now
and Everyone Was There,

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,990
it was the place to see
and be seen.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,310
Look at that one.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,674
Mary, hail a cab!

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,400
- Do you think he's a model?
- A model what?

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,711
A model citizen? A model home?
A model aeroplane?

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,236
He's the dirty-haired Gucci guy
with clean hair.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,915
He's so versatile!
Why don't you say hello?

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,629
He's gorgeous.
He'd only be interested if I paid him.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,439
There's no need to enter Hookerville.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,239
Carrie, I know what I look like.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,958
Then you can't see what I see.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,390
Lynne Cameron was a sought-after
fashion show producer,

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,597
as valuable to a show's success
as Valium or Velcro.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,036
I just told Damian
you have just saved my life.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,431
- I did?
- Sorry. This is my boyfriend, Damian.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,673
I say "boyfriend" loosely
as Damian is clearly a homosexual.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,877
In that case, this is my boyfriend,
Stanford.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,316
You have to be in this fashion show
I'm doing.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,233
A mix of models
and stylish New Yorkers.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,109
No one is more New York
or has more style than you.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,716
- Lynne, I'm a writer.
- You're doing my show,

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,189
if I have to hunt you down,
skin you alive

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,079
and have a model wear you.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,713
I'll call you.
Could this place be any louder?

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,949
- I am so coming.
- To what? I'm not a model.

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,554
Then you can't see what I see.

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,796
I'll start with a salad, with extra
blue cheese dressing. Thank you.

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,235
Are the vegetables all organic?

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,473
They have beef potpie on the menu.
What do you think?

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,950
I'll just have a cup of hot water
with lemon. Thank you.

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,635
- lsn't it hard to eat just organic?
- It is so hard.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,518
Last night,
I kept thinking about a Big Mac.

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,353
I finally had to go out
and pick up a guy.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,114
- Talk about a Happy Meal!
- You look great.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,271
Your body is amazing.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,353
I hope so. I'm having nude photographs
taken on Wednesday.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,996
Are you going to hand them out
to prospective dates?

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,551
This is not about a man's approval.
This photo is just for me.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,951
When I'm old,
I can look at it and say,

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,839
- "Damn, I was hot."
- lsn't that narcissistic?

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,436
No one thinks seventh grade pictures
are narcissistic.

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,989
- You weren't naked in that!
- That we know of.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,199
I like my body.
I'm getting these pictures taken.

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,797
You're my hero. It's fantastic
you can put it out there.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,236
I can't even say yes
to a charity fashion show.

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,630
New York Style?

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,917
It's huge!
All the top designers are doing it!

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,355
They want you to be a model?

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,149
It's a mix of real people and models.
I know the producer.

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,632
- Do it! You live for fashion.
- I do not live for fashion.

53
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,917
How many shows did you drag me to
in fashion week?

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,198
- Eight. What's your point?
- So why not be in one?

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,990
I do not belong on a runway.
Runways are for models. Not writers.

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,278
How is strutting down a runway
different to strutting down 5th?

57
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,311
- Strut? Do I strut?
- It would be fun!

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,359
I was a teen model when the Ralph Lauren
store opened in Newhaven.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,592
Amazing. I'm keeping my lunch down.

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,392
I cannot imagine walking down a runway
while people judge me.

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,791
- No one would judge you!
- We always judge models.

62
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,474
But you're one of the real people.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,475
People might think I can't see
the difference between a model and me.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,428
Who cares what people think?
This is a fabulous opportunity!

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,036
- You could probably keep the clothes.
- I thought of that!

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,351
- I'd do it in a New York minute.
- So would l.

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,280
What do you think, mutey?

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,836
While Miranda would never dream
of walking on a runway,

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,878
she had no problem running on one.

70
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,030
You were on that treadmill
for over 30 minutes.

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,270
That's illegal at Crunch Fitness.

72
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,830
I'm starting to train
for the marathon. First time.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,195
Good for you.

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,114
I was captain of my school track team,
but marathon...

75
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,150
- I'm Dave.
- Miranda.

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,552
- Have a good workout.
- That's it?

77
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,796
- Is there more?
- I hope so.

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,079
I've been watching you for months.
I think that you are very sexy.

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,075
- So what's the problem?
- He said, "l think you're very sexy."

80
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,835
And?

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,356
I was wearing no make-up
and an old three-dollar shirt.

82
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,990
- Nice.
- I can't believe he thinks I'm sexy.

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,311
- I'm hanging up now.
- No, I'm serious!

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,075
Smart, yes. Sometimes cute,
but never sexy.

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,438
Sexy is what I try to be
after I win them over with my personality.

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,909
You win men over
with your personality?

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,509
- They want you to be a model?
- I'm hanging up now.

88
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,752
Later, I got to thinking
about Narcissus,

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,515
a man so consumed with his own image
he drowned in it.

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,639
Did he have no friends
to mirror a healthier view of himself?

91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,351
And why can we see our friends perfectly
but not ourselves?

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,957
No matter how hard we look,
do we ever see ourselves clearly?

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,314
Samantha, however,
saw herself a little too clearly.

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,948
Tiger has a variety of music choices

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,795
to ease you into the shoot
and make you more comfortable.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,794
- I've got some Steely Dan...
- I'm comfortable.

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,638
Camera, Tiger.

98
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,915
- Tiger.
- Yeah, sorry.

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,317
- Do you like your gynaecologist?
- She's amazing. Why?

100
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,472
- I want to see someone else.
- What's happening?

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,555
- Trey and I are just talking...
- What's happening with your vagina?

102
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,279
I'm not bugged.
It's just us listening.

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,433
Maybe a yeast infection,
but my gynaecologist says no.

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,071
- What are the symptoms?
- Can't you just call me with her number?

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,312
Do you know anyone
Stanford could go out with?

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,314
If we don't find him someone,
he'll start dating hookers.

107
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,198
Exactly.

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,352
Charlotte, would you say
that I'm strutting right now?

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,958
Charlotte decided that for Stanford
it had to be someone cute, with style.

110
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,318
Someone like Anthony Marantino,
her wedding gown stylist.

111
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,517
- What?
- Anthony, it's Charlotte York MacDougal.

112
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,193
Sorry, I thought it was my mother.

113
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,150
15 phone calls to make sure I get her
the cheapest possible sheets!

114
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,029
- I wondered if you were dating anyone.
- I'm dating everyone. Why?

115
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,634
I have this friend, Stanford.

116
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,189
- What's he look like?
- He is adorable.

117
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,510
Who would play him?
In a movie?

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,393
I don't know. Ed Harris.

119
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,279
- A younger Ed Harris.
- That's hot.

120
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,989
Miranda ended her first date
with Captain Crunch.

121
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,993
- That was fun.
- I hope I didn't talk too much.

122
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,994
The only words you said all night were,
"That was fun."

123
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,595
You are so sexy.

124
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,035
You don't think so?

125
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,516
Maybe he was right. Who was Miranda
to argue with the Captain?

126
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,829
Miss Motherfucker, why have you
not returned my last 200 phone calls?

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,357
Lynne, I really don't think
that I should do this show.

128
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,718
I am not a model.
As much as I would like to think...

129
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,348
You're in or out.
I don't have time for this.

130
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,990
I'm sure Dolce & Gabbana
can find someone else to dress.

131
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,470
- Dolce & Gabbana?
- The designers pick who to dress.

132
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,756
Dolce & Gabbana picked me?

133
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,356
Yes, and those are some picky ltalians.

134
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,428
Do you think that I would be able
to keep the outfit?

135
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,388
- What's up, love?
- I'm coming.

136
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,958
Me likey!

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,677
Perfect in the bust and the waist.
Turn, love. Do we likey?

138
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,593
No likey the length.
Have to take it up.

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,552
I know I'm too short.

140
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,998
But I'm very, very comfortable in heels.
The higher the better.

141
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,073
- Feel free to put me in big shoes.
- Walk, love. Walk.

142
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,672
- Heidi wouldn't need it taken up.
- Heidi Klum?

143
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,473
Yes. Turn, love, turn.

144
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,029
- And trot back.
- Trot?

145
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,794
Trot.
Good, good, good.

146
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,238
- Look what the pussy's dragged in.
- Hello, Oscar.

147
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,277
We just call me "O" now.

148
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,876
- Who's this?
- Carrie Bradshaw. New York model.

149
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,669
Model? God, no.
No, no. I'm a writer.

150
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,753
- I'm Paul Denai, the photographer.
- Sure, I love... Sorry.

151
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,799
No, I'm sorry.
I know your photographs.

152
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,270
I'm doing a behind-the-scenes book
about fashion week.

153
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,113
Do you mind if I shoot your fitting?

154
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,476
Sorry, that was...
I wasn't ready. Go ahead.

155
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,428
- That's the point. I like to surprise.
- I could surprise you, love.

156
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,637
Now, what's your opinion, love?

157
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,997
- Me love or him love?
- You, love.

158
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,069
- Whatever you think.
- No, I've got something better.

159
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,315
That was bad.

160
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,597
I'm very uncomfortable
having my picture taken.

161
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,639
Then how did you end up
in a fashion show?

162
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,791
I'm in it for the free goods.

163
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,910
Maybe if I explain how a camera works
over a glass of wine sometime?

164
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,229
I've never been a gal
to turn down a free lesson.

165
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,676
- Or a free dress.
- Here it is. Do we likey?

166
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,036
We likey!

167
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,878
And speaking of uncomfortable...

168
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,029
You can put your legs down now.

169
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,158
- It is not a yeast infection.
- It's not?

170
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,278
I have a file of women
all with the same symptoms.

171
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,719
They all think it's a yeast infection
but it's not. It could be vulvodynia.

172
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,033
- Is it serious?
- No, just uncomfortable.

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,478
We can control it.
I'll prescribe a light antidepressant.

174
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,398
- But I'm not depressed.
- It's not for you. It's for your vagina.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,752
Your vagina is depressed?

176
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,559
The mood elevator
corrects the imbalance.

177
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,871
- How do you know it's depressed?
- There are symptoms.

178
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,874
- It can't meet its deadline?
- It always wants to go to Krispy Kreme?

179
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,679
It's so funny!
My vagina is depressed!

180
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,351
- Stop. I might have vulvodynia.
- Vulvo-what-ier?

181
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,115
Every day
I have to keep a vagina journal.

182
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,034
A "Dear Vagina, why so blue?"
kind of journal?

183
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,636
"Dear Vagina,
guess who I have a crush on?"

184
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,634
No. More like:
"ltchy today. Not itchy."

185
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,951
- Sounds like a bestseller.
- Ready to order?

186
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,069
We're still waiting, but could I have
a hot water and some lemon?

187
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,869
I'm fine but Charlotte,
maybe your...would like some fries?

188
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,316
- I guess not. Thank you.
- Sorry I'm late.

189
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,359
I had to pick up
my nude contact sheets. Look!

190
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,351
Only until the food arrives.

191
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,512
Charlotte, I want your professional
art eye opinion.

192
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,070
That's not very arty.
I can see your...everything.

193
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,078
The full frontal.
I did that to warm up.

194
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,631
- You should have warned me.
- What's the problem? It's just a vagina.

195
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,713
It's magnified.
I've never even seen mine that close.

196
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,635
- Never been up close and personal?
- Have you seen yours that close?

197
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,157
You've never looked at yourself
with a hand mirror?

198
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,959
I insist you go home now
and take a look!

199
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,396
Better yet, take my compact
and visit the ladies' room.

200
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,630
I don't want to look.
I think it's ugly.

201
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,710
Maybe that's why it's depressed.

202
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,350
What did I miss?

203
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,149
On their second date,
Miranda did most of the talking.

204
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,959
She was feeling confident and sexy.

205
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,114
I like my life. I love my job,
I love my friends.

206
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,829
She couldn't believe how comfortable
this new Miranda felt.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,434
And I love meeting new people...

208
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,878
...Iike you.

209
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,029
Miranda had no idea
what had changed.

210
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,076
I want pure class.
I'm thinking ash

211
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,676
or a charcoal grey matt
inside the frame.

212
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,554
On either side?

213
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,439
Although Samantha had done
the photo for herself,

214
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,318
she still wanted to be desired by men.

215
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,630
Charcoal would bring out the grey.

216
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,918
The matt should stop an inch
from my breast. Right here.

217
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,196
See my breast?

218
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
Then stop around here,
near my ass.

219
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,959
See that? Right near my ass.

220
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,479
How's next Thursday?

221
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,838
Whatever.

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,198
You took this one of Cindy Crawford.
"Photo by Paul Denai."

223
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,396
How can you remember?
It was the '90s.

224
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,552
It was '92.
I loved her beauty mark so much.

225
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,631
I used to pencil one on,

226
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,395
then move it around
whenever I had a blemish.

227
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,912
It would be here and then here.
Sometimes it would be here and here.

228
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,594
- Here's another one. Man!
- I can't believe you have this book.

229
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,992
Are you crazy? I love this.
When I moved to New York, broke,

230
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,472
sometimes I would buy "Vogue"
instead of dinner. I felt it fed me more.

231
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,868
I used to do
all that high fashion shit,

232
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,919
but the behind-the-scenes stuff I'm doing
now is much better. More real.

233
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,798
Real?

234
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,192
The reality of people
and all their little flaws.

235
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,510
The flaws make them beautiful.

236
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,433
Forget reality,
tell me about the models.

237
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,433
Who's a big bitch
and who's a bigger bitch?

238
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,433
Sorry. I never click and tell.

239
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,593
- Why are you so fascinated by models?
- I just love them.

240
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,917
- They're beautiful.
- Let me show you something.

241
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,752
You show me one model

242
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,310
who's more alive

243
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,119
or more beautiful than her.

244
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,910
- Which one is your new boyfriend?
- It was only one kiss.

245
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,038
So predictable,
a model dating a photographer.

246
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,634
Stanny, I'm a model!

247
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,593
Excuse me.

248
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,109
I may have a stroke.
Do I look all right?

249
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,714
I'm nervous about this fix-up.

250
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,348
You look fabulous.
Everything's fabulous.

251
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,717
- I can't think about it. I'm a model.
- A supermodel!

252
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,873
I made them put me in super high heels.
I'll be so swell!

253
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,476
Supermodel and supersize it, please!

254
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,154
I'm Carrie Bradshaw.
Where do I go?

255
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,552
- Over with the non-models.
- What's her problem?

256
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,073
- Gucci and Tucci and Dior.
- Oh, my!

257
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,192
Look. This is the Polaroid
of the dress.

258
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,435
We likey!
That's a fashion thing.

259
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,991
Here's one of Frank Rich.
And Fran Lebowitz.

260
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,914
- These are the other real people?
- OK. What's wrong?

261
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,560
Frank Rich? Fran Lebowitz?
Dolce & Gabbana couldn't get Ed Koch?

262
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,793
- Gucci got him. What's the problem?
- I feel such an idiot.

263
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,793
- I convinced myself I belonged here.
- You do!

264
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,317
- Can I go home?
- No. The show is timed per model.

265
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,870
- I'm a non-model.
- But you're fabulous.

266
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,112
Lighten up.

267
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,035
So you're not Heidi Klum,

268
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,715
but you're the modeliest
of the real people.

269
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,672
He told me I was sexy
and then he didn't want to kiss me.

270
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,229
Was it me?
Suddenly I wasn't sexy?

271
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,710
- What does it mean?
- Who knows? These are men.

272
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,795
You can lay your pussy in front of one
and still not know what he's thinking.

273
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,912
Just when I thought
it couldn't get worse...

274
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,116
There's been a change.

275
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,397
You're not wearing this.
You're wearing this.

276
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,473
I'm going need to speak to someone.

277
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,596
I had to lose the dress.
Dior have something similar.

278
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,556
- It's a fashion house of cards, love.
- I can't wear jewelled underwear.

279
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,030
I just want you to look at them.
Aren't they fantastic?

280
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,512
How can I make this clear?
Me no likey.

281
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,919
Paul, can you do something?
Not that.

282
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,711
- You'll love them, love.
- I'm going to faint.

283
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,509
I can't wear jewelled panties
and strut out in front of Frank Rich.

284
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,911
I respect Frank Rich.
He's a writer.

285
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,992
You're not just wearing panties.

286
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,357
They come with a fantastic coat.
Try them on.

287
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,478
I have a certain look, you know?

288
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,031
And I really don't think
that jewelled panties is it.

289
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,070
If you look like a whale,
we won't send you out there.

290
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,913
Come out or I'm coming in.

291
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,069
God!

292
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,391
Fantastic. The hair's all wrong.
We need big hair.

293
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,913
Big hair.

294
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,160
Charlotte, this is so exciting.

295
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,997
Stanford Blatch,
this is Anthony Marantino.

296
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,674
- Marantino? Is that ltalian?
- Sicilian.

297
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,996
Is that different?

298
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,074
Yeah.

299
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,312
I'd better go check on Carrie.

300
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,838
Ed Harris? Ed Harris?
Try Ed l-have-no-Harris.

301
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,911
- I thought you'd hit it off.
- Because we're both gay?

302
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,355
Let me clear something up for you.

303
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,229
I'm a nice package.
Good arms, a high, tight ass.

304
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,914
I could do a lot better.

305
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,393
Ten minutes
and ten hair extensions later...

306
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,350
I can't believe she'd set me up with
a queen. She thinks I'd date a queen?

307
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,230
I don't have time to decipher
levels of queendom right now.

308
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,676
Would you please get me
another champagne?

309
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,354
- That is big hair.
- Thank you.

310
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,636
Orlando, she looks fabulous.

311
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,952
Now, love, we need big eyes.
Kevyn Aucoin, Carrie Bradshaw.

312
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,759
Nice to meet you.
Ready for make-up?

313
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,309
I know you're a genius,
but here's the thing. I'm a writer.

314
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,029
I love your column.
Don't worry, you'll look fabulous.

315
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,595
- Nobody is listening to me.
- You are fabulous.

316
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,992
- Get Samantha. She'll tell me the truth.
- I can't. That queen's out there.

317
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,832
Go!

318
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,516
Crisis.
Carrie needs to see you backstage.

319
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,471
Where's Her Highness?

320
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,995
Your little friend. Where is he?

321
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,950
- He had to go.
- Why? He didn't like me.

322
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,874
No!
He had a decorating emergency.

323
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,828
I've been rejected by someone
I wasn't interested in.

324
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,560
I hate when that happens.

325
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,639
We're OK to go.

326
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,509
Lights, go.
Music cue four. Go.

327
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,917
Gucci.

328
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,514
Tell me the truth. People don't mean it
when they say that, but I do.

329
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,716
Honey, you're a model!

330
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,510
- You'd tell me, right?
- Absolutely. You're a model!

331
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,638
I'm so tall!
The shoes were my idea.

332
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,949
I've got to get out there.
Go, model.

333
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,275
You're Heidi Klum!

334
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,311
- Those are fantastic!
- Really?

335
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,756
- Do I look OK?
- You look fabulous.

336
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,433
Thanks. Let's go.

337
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,753
- Wait until you see our gal.
- Really?

338
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,150
- When is she coming out?
- She's next!

339
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,119
Carrie, go.

340
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,032
Didn't I tell you?

341
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,038
Fuck me hard.

342
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,439
Heidi, go.

343
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,509
My God!
She's fashion road kill.

344
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,276
Stop taking my picture.

345
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,639
I had a choice. I could leave the runway
and let my inner model die of shame,

346
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,839
or I could pick myself up,
flaws and all, and finish.

347
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,435
And that's just what I did.
When real people fall down in life,

348
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,190
they get right back up
and keep on walking.

349
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,673
Katya, go.

350
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,796
My act of bravery inspired three
other people to acts of bravery as well.

351
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,236
Miranda faced her fear
of knowing the truth.

352
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,069
I'm confused. We had a good time,
then you never called.

353
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,518
I never called because you never called,
and that's fine,

354
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,514
but I just have to know:
did I do something?

355
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,794
I don't know.
We were sitting on the couch

356
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,232
and you seemed
a little full of yourself.

357
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,239
OK. Glad we straightened that out.

358
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,113
Cheeseburger and fries.

359
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,956
Samantha faced her fear of what real
food would do to her perfect figure.

360
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,635
- Thanks.
- Nice ass.

361
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,714
I didn't tip you enough.

362
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,793
And Charlotte faced her fear
of seeing herself.

363
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,474
Just like Narcissus before her,

364
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,758
Charlotte became so mesmerised
by what she saw that...

365
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,789
As for me, I tucked my jewelled
underwear and inner model away,

366
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,111
and went back to my life
as a real person.
