1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,595
Someone once said that when
one door shuts, a window opens.

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,276
Big and I had shut our door, but
our window was blowing a great breeze.

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,873
- People don't dress up any more.
- With waistcoats.

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,238
And watch fobs.
I'm going to bring back the watch fob.

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,029
A man with a plan.
Smoke, please.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,954
Now that Big and I weren't playing
the dating game, we could just play.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,475
It had never been better.

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,912
Where is it?

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,432
Impressive.

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,160
The ladies enjoy sleight of hand.

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,756
And the watch fob.

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,237
Meanwhile, 35 blocks north
at Dr and Mrs Young's cocktail party

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,312
another set of ex's
were enjoying the view.

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,756
See all the greens in the hillside?
It's beautiful.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,515
What's beautiful is your ass in that skirt.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,638
Now that they had opened
the door of communication,

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,234
Trey wanted to get in...everywhere.

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,233
I could do some dirty things to you now.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,597
We're at a cocktail party
and I'm your estranged wife.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,036
My estranged wife has a fine ass.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,317
It's great how up for things
you've been lately,

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,550
but we are in public.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,871
So let's get our coats
and go back to your place

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,191
because my ass will be damn fine
there too.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,870
- Her radiologist is full of himself.
- His wife is worse.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,589
They were passed over for three co-ops
because of their dog.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,115
That's what you get with Pekinese.

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,716
Certain behaviour
stops you getting into a co-op.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,714
And certain behaviour is assured
to get you kicked out.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,919
There's an entire surgical staff
in the next room!

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,709
- This is an emergency.
- At least close the door.

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,919
While Charlotte walked through her door,
I kept mine firmly closed.

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,036
OK then, Houdini.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,072
- I'll walk you up.
- I've got it from here.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,870
Then I'll watch from down here
in case you trip.

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,669
What's with the...?
There'll be no...

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,236
You're the boss.
But I'm always available for the...

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,118
Nighty-night.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,392
Nighty-night.

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,314
Have you guys ever done it
in a restaurant bathroom?

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,517
- Somewhere over Chicago.
- Restaurant bathroom!

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,229
- It involved warm nuts.
- How about a coatroom?

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,595
- Lotus.
- My last birthday party.

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,830
I'm out. Syrup!

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,594
Is this theoretical
or are you getting busy?

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,878
Trey and l. Coatroom. Friday.
Bistro bathroom last night.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,077
- But he couldn't...
- He can. All over Manhattan.

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,470
This is a happy development.

49
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,838
- No. We're not even together any more.
- It doesn't sound like it.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,992
We should be getting to know
each other again, not...

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,835
- Fucking against a hand drier?
- This is so confusing.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,434
Are we dating or back together?

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,034
Is he my boyfriend or my lover?

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,318
Or my ex-husband, whom I have sex
with occasionally in coatrooms?

55
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,675
- And bathrooms.
- All of the above.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,311
- Who cares? Just enjoy it.
- I need to know where we're going.

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,553
We'd like to know too
because you'll be having sex there.

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,111
He's my husband. We were defined
by law. Now it's all so hard.

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,989
- Thank your lucky stars.
- So what did you do this weekend?

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,991
Monkey Bar.

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,232
- Fun! With whom?
- Big.

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,998
The bar, not the bathroom.

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,389
So you and Big are really friends
or something?

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,429
Friends...or something. Shouldn't you
define what you're doing with him?

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,195
- Charlotte didn't have to.
- Charlotte married the guy.

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,351
We're undefinable.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,799
I am not sleeping with him.
We're just...hanging out.

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,516
It's fun. Now the pressure is off,
we're enjoying each other. It's good.

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,229
It's a slippery slope.
You have to have boundaries.

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,789
Yeah, we might actually have fun!

71
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,713
- Have fun. Not amnesia.
- Exactly.

72
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,431
Can we lighten up
on the boundary talk?

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,556
I'm fine.

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,756
Are you thinking
about sleeping with him?

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,399
You hesitated.

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,590
I was swallowing.

77
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,477
The Eskimo have hundreds of words
for "snow".

78
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,598
We have three times as many
for "relationship".

79
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,753
The more words we invent,
the harder it is to define things.

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,230
When you can date without sex,
screw without dating

81
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,871
and keep sex partners as friends
long after the screwing is over,

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,679
what really defines a relationship?

83
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,314
That night, Miranda let her boundaries
down with Doug, a New Yorker cartoonist.

84
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,994
They had been dating for a month.

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,913
Miranda didn't know what they were,
but it felt good.

86
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,310
It was a morning of firsts.

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,677
It was the first time
Doug had spent the night....

88
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,954
...and the first time
a man had peed in front of her.

89
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,640
That night,
we went to Charlotte's gallery

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,349
for an exhibition by Brazilian artist
Maria Diega Reyes.

91
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,036
He just whipped it out. I'm brushing,
I look over and he's peeing.

92
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,875
At least he's your boyfriend.
Only a boyfriend would do that.

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,271
I don't want one who does that.
It's never OK to do that.

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,228
Wait your turn, shut the door,
do your business.

95
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,277
This is perfect.

96
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,876
Ms Boundaries
has found Mr No Boundaries.

97
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,312
- Do you like it?
- I do.

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,472
- It's the artist's favourite.
- Do you know her?

99
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,155
- I am her.
- I'm sorry. I should have...

100
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,276
- Samantha.
- Maria.

101
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,195
I have a bone to pick with you.
I came ready to buy. There's nothing left.

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,158
That's never bad news
for the artist.

103
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,950
But I have many more in my loft.
If you ever want to take a look...

104
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,874
I will and soon,
before those get sold as well.

105
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,792
It's a deal.

106
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,839
Now a non art-related question.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,195
Where are all the hot guys?

108
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,200
It is stunning. All of it.

109
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,193
I'm so proud of you, chica.

110
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,272
Enjoy!

111
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,190
It's my ex.

112
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,557
And about the hot guys...

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,392
No hot guys.

114
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,393
That's good for you.
But what's in it for me?

115
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,350
The next night, my ex introduced me
to a tiny jazz club in the East Village.

116
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,997
- Aren't these cats amazing?
- Cats?

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,436
Loosen up, baby.
We're below 14th Street.

118
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,792
There I was, inches away from
my ex-boyfriend, friend, whatever,

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,872
Iusting after a bass player.

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,748
Want another drink?

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,314
Do you want another drink?

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,958
Thank you.
We're going to take a short break.

123
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,999
If you're nice,
we'll play another set or two.

124
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,031
Everyone in the universe wanted me
to define my relationship with Big.

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,552
- What do you think?
- I like it, baby.

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,478
Didn't think I had that
groovy jazz club in me, did you?

127
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,754
You were really great.

128
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,673
- I was just trying to keep up.
- You were great.

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,559
- You know jazz?
- No.

130
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,473
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, I own the place.

131
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,030
It's the only way
they'll let me play. Ray King.

132
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,708
Hi, I'm Carrie. Carrie Bradshaw.
Jazz neophyte.

133
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,279
- Sorry, this is...
- You're running low. Joey, Glenlivet.

134
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,153
- So, you own this place?
- I do. And one uptown.

135
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,629
Hell of a lot of mortgages.

136
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,155
Well, I've got to go.

137
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,835
- Heading uptown?
- Yes. Do you need a ride?

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,594
- That would be great.
- I'll call my car.

139
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,718
- There are cabs outside.
- So we'll take a cab.

140
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,235
OK. Take a cab.

141
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,919
- Your bass is going to be OK?
- It sleeps at the club all the time.

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,789
Sometimes it even hooks up
with the snare drum.

143
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,349
Cabs are bullshit.

144
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,434
Can I get your number?

145
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,273
Yeah, sure.

146
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,594
I'm a writer with no pen.

147
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,870
- Thank you.
- No problem.

148
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,514
- 6739.
- I know.

149
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,070
This is me.
Thank you.

150
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,831
Nice to meet you.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,877
Nice to meet you.

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,989
What are you doing?

153
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,630
- What do you mean?
- Now he'll think we're together.

154
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,473
- You like the pork-pie hat?
- That's not the point.

155
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,076
- He had some breath on him.
- His breath was fine.

156
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,472
Are you kidding? It was like he had
a bad burger with BB King in '75.

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,395
All right. We've got to figure out
what we're doing here.

158
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,994
- What are we doing?
- What are we?

159
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,470
- We're friends. How's that?
- What kind of friends?

160
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,394
Friends who listen to jazz,
friends who eat pizza,

161
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,232
friends who...

162
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,550
No, there will be no...

163
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,400
Carrie likes a jazz man. Jazz!

164
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,710
I'm going upstairs.

165
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,269
- Suit yourself.
- I have to go to sleep.

166
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,510
Nighty-night!

167
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,109
But I couldn't sleep. My bizarre
ménage-à-taxi was haunting me.

168
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,558
When I hear that song,
I think of you.

169
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,996
- I don't even know you.
- That's good.

170
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,396
Can you hang on a second?

171
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,154
- What are you doing?
- I can't talk now.

172
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,880
- You're on the other line?
- Yes, I am.

173
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,474
- Pork pie?
- I've got to go.

174
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,551
Tell him he needs mints.

175
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,280
Carrie likes a jazz musician.

176
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,033
Sorry.

177
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,797
No problem.

178
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,431
I'd like to take you out
on Saturday night.

179
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,832
- You won't have to listen to me play.
- I'd like that.

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,911
Great.

181
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,549
- Don't bring the angry guy.
- He's not so bad.

182
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,755
See you.

183
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,273
OK.

184
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,834
- What do you want?
- What do you see in that guy?

185
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,434
He knows when to say goodbye.

186
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,758
Next morning, Miranda decided I might
be right that she was Ms Boundaries.

187
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,152
Perhaps she couldn't throw
the boy out with the toilet water.

188
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,392
She would have to let down
her boundaries

189
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,711
and there was no better time
than the present.

190
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,351
Hi! You scared me.

191
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,033
- You got any bagels?
- Top of the fridge.

192
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,997
Cool.

193
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,390
- What about filters?
- Above the coffee-maker!

194
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,109
While Miranda tried to do her business,
Samantha helped Maria with hers.

195
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,477
- Am I doing this right?
- Don't think. Just do it.

196
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,235
Painting is like eating.
Like sex.

197
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,516
I can do that.

198
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,877
I came to buy art, not make it.

199
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,589
This is a Brazilian thing.

200
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,752
Everyone that crosses my door
has to help.

201
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,876
But you have a choice.

202
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,715
You can make a painting
or you can do my laundry.

203
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,911
Not going to happen.

204
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,871
- You're buying one of my paintings?
- You're buying my next manicure.

205
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,916
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,789
Do we...

207
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,428
Do we need to talk about this?

208
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,630
Do we?

209
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,073
I've done the girl thing once, twice,

210
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,516
usually involving a guy
and a couple of Quaaludes.

211
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,355
It was nice, really.
Really nice for the guy. But...

212
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,755
I'm not a relationship person.

213
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,876
And you're really something.

214
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,508
Could we be friends?

215
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,399
It depends.

216
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,476
In my language, "friends" translates
to "a person with a warm heart...

217
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,433
"...that buys a lot of my art."

218
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,670
- What's Portuguese for "work at it"?
- Working it.

219
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,875
The next day, I found the perfect colour
on me and something else on Charlotte.

220
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,391
Excuse me, but is that a hickey?

221
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,994
Let me see!

222
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,718
That's so retro!

223
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,509
- Trey and I made out in the movies.
- That is retro.

224
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,478
That's not all we did.

225
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,598
In the middle of the movie,
I gave him a blow job.

226
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,228
In the theatre.

227
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,757
You're right. Once I stopped trying
to define it, I realised it's great.

228
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,118
Congratulations. You've got a nice,
healthy relationship.

229
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,912
Charlotte realised if Samantha
defined her relationship as healthy,

230
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,755
she had one sick relationship
on her hands.

231
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,676
The next day, as Trey looked for action,
Charlotte looked for answers.

232
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,638
Trey, please, not here.

233
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,756
- Shall we go to a movie?
- No!

234
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,072
We're five blocks from your place.
We'll get in our old bed

235
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,152
and we'll really make love
like man and wife.

236
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,955
Why? Why can't we wait?
It's five stupid blocks!

237
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,997
What is wrong with us?

238
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,914
Are you scared our old bed
will bring back the same problems?

239
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,755
Let's not discuss this
in front of the driver.

240
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,037
You just wanted to have sex
in front of him!

241
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,552
Just like that, Charlotte
slammed the door on her and Trey.

242
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,712
It's me.

243
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,872
If we were to, say,

244
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,270
make love in my bed,

245
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,715
could we still do it in a taxi?

246
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,312
We'll see.

247
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,869
All righty, then.
Call you tomorrow.

248
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,114
Evidently, when Charlotte closed
the taxi door, she opened a new window.

249
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,638
Next morning, Miranda got up early
to pee in peace and make Doug coffee.

250
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,952
- Smells great!
- It's the cinnamon I add to...

251
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,197
When Miranda left the door open
for peeing,

252
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,670
she opened the door
for everything else.

253
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,432
Sometimes I like to add
a pinch of nutmeg to my coffee...

254
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,556
Maybe it was narrow-minded,

255
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,918
but an open-door dump
was worth dumping someone over.

256
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,197
The thing about New York
is everyone is always going.

257
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,591
Tonight, it was to the opening
of Tao.

258
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,796
Ray's and my first date.

259
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,197
Everyone was there.

260
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,510
Everyone.

261
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,478
So what? This is the only restaurant
in New York opening tonight?

262
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,279
Burger King had
a line around the block.

263
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,112
You remember...?

264
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,360
- This is Sha.
- Sha?

265
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,750
The Y is silent.

266
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,311
Thank God, you're finally here!
I got the last table.

267
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,559
There we were: me, my ex,

268
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,793
the jazz guy, the model, the lesbian
and her friend Samantha.

269
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,879
- She's a supermodel.
- Super for you.

270
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,238
- Will we ever get our Mee Krob?
- Oh, I love that! It's their specialty.

271
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,437
Is there any more wine in there?

272
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,198
Thanks.

273
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,432
I'll be back.

274
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,272
Look at me.
I grabbed some Mee Krob.

275
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,231
Mee Krobilicious!

276
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,632
- How did you get this?
- The chef worked at one of my clubs.

277
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,033
- You know all the right people.
- I got the "in" on the noodles.

278
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,431
If it's OK with you,
I'm going to camp here for a while.

279
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,876
- It's OK by me.
- That table is bad.

280
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,314
Yeah, man.

281
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,074
Good thing we weren't hungry.

282
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,473
- I'm going to go to the bathroom.
- Turn right at the Buddha, honey.

283
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,995
So, just to get things straight,

284
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,675
you and Carrie
are just friends now, right?

285
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,592
You're available?

286
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,839
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,431
If you're just friends,
what exactly do you think you're doing?

288
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,198
She might come off
like she's strong and over it,

289
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,358
but she's fragile,
and she's my best friend.

290
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,798
- So I suggest you back off.
- Can't we all just get along?

291
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,836
Excuse me.

292
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,476
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

293
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,837
I'm sorry.
That guy's not good for her.

294
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,116
I'm going to go.

295
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,636
No, don't go.
We can get another table.

296
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,439
I lied.

297
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,239
I can't just be your friend.

298
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,117
What I saw back there...

299
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,158
You...
You are magnificent.

300
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,519
How do you say that?
You kick ass!

301
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,117
I see where this is going.

302
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,593
You don't do relationships
and it would be very bad for me.

303
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,320
So we can't even be friends?

304
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,951
I'm going to go in here and you,
you go back there.

305
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,675
You're really something.

306
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,278
Right then and there, Samantha
decided to let down her boundaries

307
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,513
and open herself up to the possibility
of a relationship...

308
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,151
...with a woman.

309
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,833
And in a different bathroom...

310
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,999
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK. Come in.

311
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,559
Come in.

312
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,634
- Want some?
- No. All set, thanks.

313
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,638
- You can go. It's OK.
- I don't really have to go.

314
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,629
He talks about you.

315
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,872
Did you two used to date
or something?

316
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,555
Something like that.

317
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,992
I'm going to...
My date's waiting for me.

318
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,358
Sorry.

319
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,712
I couldn't avoid it. Everywhere I went,
I was confronted by my Big relationship.

320
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,556
I just left Silent Y in the bathroom.
Apparently the '80s are back.

321
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,229
We're going to go.

322
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,676
Ray and I were going to go first.

323
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,231
See you later.

324
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,678
You know what I love about this city?

325
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,469
Everything can sound like a jazz riff.

326
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,399
That garbage truck is...

327
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,517
Really? Because I get more of a...

328
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,357
Like a...

329
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,472
- I don't know.
- You really don't know jazz, do you?

330
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,872
I just scatted on my first date.
Give me some credit.

331
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,874
Somewhere between the Mee Krob
and the model, I was dating again.

332
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,678
It was nice.

333
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,592
This is me.

334
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,550
You know what you are?

335
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,597
You're...

336
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,594
Doo-doo-den back at ya.

337
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,550
With every second of our kiss,
it was becoming clearer:

338
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,188
I really liked this guy.

339
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,432
Maybe that's it.

340
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,116
What ultimately defines a relationship
is another relationship.
