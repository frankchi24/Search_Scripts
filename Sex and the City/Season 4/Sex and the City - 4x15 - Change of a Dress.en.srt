1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,436
When a marriage breaks up,
there are numerous ways to cope.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,477
You can cry, you can move.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,473
It's left right, not right left.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,791
Or, as Charlotte did, dive in
to a new routine. A tap routine.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,192
I feel good. I even signed up
for sculpture and tap dancing class.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,717
- You can't do one without the other.
- Everyone tells me to grieve.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,715
I don't need time. This divorce
is going to be clean and swift.

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,835
Oh, my God!
I thought that was you!

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,470
There it was. The unmistakable
voice of Susan Sharon.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,518
- So what's new?
- Same old same old.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,069
Just writing, gallivanting, eating.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,434
The usual.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,631
You're forgetting
the most important thing.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,271
- They're engaged.
- You're getting married?

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,192
Oh, my God!

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,874
Oh, Aidan. Mazel tov.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,270
Let me see. Where's the...?

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,352
It's here.
It's right here. See?

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,349
Why is it round your neck?
Is that what people do now?

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,513
No, it's just me.
It's closer to my heart this way.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,558
So, spring wedding?
Fall wedding?

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,157
- Where are you doing it?
- We haven't thought about that stuff.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,110
You'd better chop chop, missy.
These places book up...years and years.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,678
OK, the wedding...

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,676
The next morning,
a hotel mogul and his publicist

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,434
began another gruelling day at work.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,596
- Can I help you?
- You're gorgeous.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,512
Tell me something I don't know.

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,752
As intimate as their personal
affair had become,

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
when it came to business, Samantha
remained cool and professional.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,116
Guess Who?
Sightings...

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,118
In theory.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,553
- JJ Mitchell.
- JJ, Samantha Jones.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,598
I have your column.
I'm very disappointed.

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,276
I thought you'd suck my dick for getting
Richard's name in the paper.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,592
We'll talk about your dick later.
Richard and Bebe London? Bullshit!

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,275
I know he's canoodling with one woman
and it's not her.

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,830
Guess which publicist
can't keep track of her client?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,231
Guess which two-bit columnist
talks out of his ass?

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,437
I'd rather be talking
out of your ass, Jonesy...

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,036
JJ Mitchell says you canoodled
with Bebe London. He's an idiot.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,395
All press is good press, right?

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,716
- So you were canoodling?
- Is that a problem?

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,876
No, I just need to get all the facts
so I can do my job.

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,479
Take a break
and get that sexy ass in here.

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,633
To drown out thoughts of Richard
canoodling with Bebe London,

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,075
Samantha focused on her canoodle.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,073
In a more modest shower uptown...

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,790
- Have we met?
- Can I get in?

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,236
Got a guy coming round.
It's really coming along over there.

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,710
The walls are coming down,
the wash-and-dryer's on the way.

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,637
Oh, the washer and dryer I've been
dreaming about my whole New York life!

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,191
Here's something else to chew on.
How about Hawaii?

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,079
- As what, the 50th state?
- As in we get hitched.

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,835
Grab a couple of friends,
down some Mai Tais, tie the knot.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,232
- We can get Maui-ed.
- Did you just pun in the nude?

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,035
What did I tell you about that?
Give me the soap.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,232
- What do you think?
- About Hawaii?

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,113
Do I look like a
surf's-up kind of bride to you?

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,119
- My grass skirt days are over.
- How about Aspen?

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,951
Christmas time in Aspen.

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,954
You, me, a polar bear, a judge.
How does that sound?

63
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,159
For a shower
with so little water pressure,

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,675
I felt a ton of it on my shoulders.

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,317
Here's the spine, right here.
Isn't that incredible?

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,119
Here's the heart beating.

67
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,592
- See?
- Kind of. I think so.

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,555
Do you want to know the sex?

69
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,437
Sure?

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,708
It's a boy.

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,439
It's a boy!
How do you feel?

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,992
Great! A boy!

73
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,310
Boy, oh boy.

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,874
- I just faked a sonogram.
- I'm sorry?

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,192
I was lying there,
getting a guided tour of my uterus.

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,990
- She tells me I'm having a boy...
- Oh, my God! Miranda!

77
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,720
- You're having a boy!
- You see? That.

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,919
That's what she wanted,
but I couldn't get it up so I faked it.

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,517
What does a fake sonogram look like
in case I ever need to do it?

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,951
Everyone is glowing about my pregnancy.
When will l?

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,874
I get the same every time
someone hears I'm engaged.

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,749
I'm supposed to be excited
about picking a date and a place.

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,514
I just want to lie down
and take a nap.

84
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,559
- I feel like a deadbeat bride.
- So don't do all that stuff.

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,950
I'd better do something soon.

86
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,398
I'm getting the feeling
my grace period is O-V-E-R.

87
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,190
I don't even want to look for a dress.
Me! No dress! What's wrong here?

88
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,239
Maybe it's like the dentist.
You put it off and put it off.

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,392
Finally you go
and afterwards you feel great.

90
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,835
I have to go to the dentist.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,753
Wait.
I'm having a radical idea.

92
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,992
There's a horrible bridal shop
two blocks away.

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,799
- We could go...
- How do you know this?

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,032
Every time I pass by it,
I go bleugh!

95
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,671
You could try on the worst dress.
Face the dragon, get it over with.

96
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,469
Then I'll treat you to a Tasty Delight.
It's aversion shock therapy.

97
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,234
You want me to try on
a bad wedding dress?

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,676
You'll have to do better
than Tasty Delight.

99
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,195
I'll try one on, too.

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,472
Ladies.

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,872
My friend Miranda is getting married,
so we want something special.

102
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,076
We're in kind of a hurry.

103
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,310
For Carrie here,

104
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,472
we were thinking of something
with a lot of bows.

105
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,677
We want her to look like
a giant cupcake.

106
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,959
Which one of you is getting married?

107
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,793
We both are.
We do everything together.

108
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,238
Miranda has everything but the gown.
And the groom.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,391
Is this a lesbian wedding?

110
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,916
No. It's a very straight-laced,
conservative crowd.

111
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,676
- A lot of Wall Street types.
- I'll see what I can find.

112
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,673
Your rehearsal dinner's going to rock.

113
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,117
On the count of three.

114
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,600
One, two...

115
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,872
Look at you!

116
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,589
Stop! I'm going to pee in this thing!
Look at you!

117
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,911
Hold still! You need a veil.

118
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,392
Look. Look!

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,636
I look beautiful.
You can't tell I'm pregnant.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,109
The sleeves balance out the tummy.

121
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,910
This is too tight. I can't breathe.
Can you get it off me?

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,913
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding!

123
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,392
- You don't want her to come back.
- Get it off! I can't breathe!

124
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,916
There's a million buttons.

125
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,868
- Your back is all wet!
- Just get it off! Rip it off!

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,716
Oh, my God.

127
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,836
What just happened?

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,788
- I can't get married.
- This is all your fault!

129
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,270
- You took her to that dump?
- It was an experiment.

130
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,557
- It went awry.
- Let's just slow down.

131
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,713
- Let's not do anything rash.
- Rash. Exactly. Look at this.

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,590
My body is literally
rejecting the idea of marriage.

133
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,399
Once you get a rash,
it's time to go.

134
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,395
It's not him, it's me. I'm missing
the bride gene. I should be studied.

135
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,757
- I don't want to get married either.
- Ever?

136
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,391
Why do we have to get married?
Give me one good reason.

137
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,839
Aside from not wanting to die alone,
which is something to think about.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,470
When it was good,
it gave me a sense of security.

139
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,031
But I feel secure now.
Things are great with us.

140
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,714
- "lf it ain't broke..."
- Don't marry it!

141
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,156
- What are you afraid would change?
- I don't know.

142
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,276
Nothing? Everything?

143
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,797
- Every bride feels that way.
- Why aren't they speaking up?

144
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,397
I'm going to ask you an unpleasant
question. Why did you ever say yes?

145
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,630
Because I love him.

146
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,554
A man you love kneels in the street

147
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,553
and offers you a ring.
You say yes.

148
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,349
Get married and hope it works.
If it doesn't, get divorced.

149
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,670
Take tap with Bojangles here.

150
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,914
I can't take a vow of forever
if I mean for the foreseeable future.

151
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,640
- I can't do that to Aidan.
- Talk to him.

152
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,950
How do you talk about this?

153
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,114
"Hi, Aidan. I've been having
some doubts." It will break his heart.

154
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,999
I shouldn't have said yes.
I'm a bad person.

155
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,516
In a court, reasonable doubt
gets you off for murder.

156
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,399
In an engagement,
it makes you a bad person.

157
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,677
Everyone has anxiety about weddings.

158
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,798
Maybe your anxiety threshold is low.

159
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,192
Interesting theory. Do you think
the dress is still in that dumpster?

160
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,235
After being hit by a bridal wave,

161
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,076
I tried to get my mind around
the concept of happily ever after.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,878
As progressive
as our society claims to be,

163
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,635
there are still life targets
we're all supposed to hit.

164
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,475
Marriage, babies,
and a home to call your own.

165
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,916
What if instead of a smile,
you break out in a rash?

166
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,117
Is something wrong with the system
or is it you?

167
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,910
Do we really want these things?
Or are we just programmed?

168
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,795
In a crisis, people always tell you
to listen to your gut.

169
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,032
Mine was telling me
to start smoking again.

170
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,556
Marlboro Lights, please.

171
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,950
But I decided
not to throw it all away.

172
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,954
Actually, just these.

173
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200
While Aidan worked on the apartment,

174
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,079
I worked on reprogramming
my attitude.

175
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,754
Could I be a spring bride?

176
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,031
Happy bride?

177
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,837
Peekaboo bride?

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,115
Stop!

179
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,633
Aidan, stop it!

180
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,595
- Did I knock something down?
- I'm freaking out.

181
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,192
I can't. I cannot...

182
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,830
I'm having a very strong reaction
to all this change.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,755
- Don't freak out.
- I am. It all feels really fast.

184
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,833
- I told you about the hole.
- It's not just the hole!

185
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,913
- It's...
- What?

186
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,080
It's the marriage stuff.

187
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,149
I love you and I'm sorry if I'm not
supposed to talk to you about this,

188
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,713
but I have to.

189
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,952
Come here.
Sit down on the floor.

190
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,190
What's happening?

191
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,319
I didn't want to say anything,

192
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,358
but then that thing
came through my wall.

193
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,668
I don't think that I'm ready
to get married yet.

194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,311
Do you hate me?

195
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,029
You're catching me
a little off guard here.

196
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,990
- I know. I just...
- No, I hear you.

197
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,236
I need a minute here.

198
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,590
Is it because I said
we could get Maui-ed?

199
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,274
Thank you for making a joke.

200
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,073
Let's slow it down.

201
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,879
How much time do you need?

202
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,717
Six months?

203
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,312
Nine months?

204
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,952
- End of the year?
- Which year?

205
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,392
Do you just need some time?

206
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,791
Yeah. I think so.

207
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,439
We'll get there.

208
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,630
Thank you, Aidan.

209
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,154
Thank you for listening.

210
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,593
See the washer-and-dryer
out there?

211
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,430
I love you.

212
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,833
The next day, Miranda enjoyed
a moment of solitude with her bills

213
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,195
and her cleaning lady.

214
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,432
Magda, I'm going to pay you
for a whole month, OK?

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,198
Look what I found on kitchen counter.
Is beautiful!

216
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,750
- Did they tell you boy or girl?
- Yes, it's a boy.

217
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,593
A boy!
A boy is coming into the house.

218
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,275
The boy is highest blessing.
It's good luck.

219
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,236
Smile.

220
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,194
Smile.

221
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,798
Smile for a boy.

222
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,712
A boy!

223
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,711
A boy!

224
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,953
While Miranda had tea for one,
Charlotte did "Tea For Two".

225
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,271
You're coming across the floor.

226
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,349
Steps up a step for you,
steps up a step for me.

227
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,149
Now two by two. Go!

228
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,994
Next pair.

229
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,513
Nice.

230
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,637
Very nice.

231
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,875
You with the flowers. Go!

232
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,077
- I don't have a partner.
- Just go it alone.

233
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,832
And go!

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,514
I don't want to go it alone.

235
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,955
You'll be fine. Come on, flowers.

236
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,596
I can't do this!

237
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,797
I shouldn't have to.
I deserve a real partner.

238
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,872
- And this song is hurtful!
- Should I stop?

239
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,835
You should think about people
who are getting divorced

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,278
and come here to have fun
and to feel good about themselves!

241
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,753
In her attempt to skip over her grief,

242
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,196
Charlotte tapped into her pain.

243
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,074
The next week, we all gathered
at the Black and White ball,

244
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,073
Richard Wright's charity fundraiser.

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,037
Aidan looks so handsome in a tux!

246
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,875
- How's he doing?
- He's good.

247
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,397
Still a little thrown by the change
in plans, but good.

248
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,791
- I hope I did the right thing.
- You followed your feelings.

249
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,191
That's always the right thing to do.

250
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,316
I'm drinking Seltzer.

251
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,553
I'm in a formal gown with elasto waist.
I really fit in here.

252
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,475
Do you realise you're growing
a tiny penis inside you?

253
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,519
- That's so sci-fi.
- My God, you're having a boy!

254
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,319
Are you so excited?

255
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,832
Two glasses of French fizz
and a soda for you.

256
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,673
Did you know Miranda's
having a boy?

257
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,117
I'm going to hurt myself.

258
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,754
I trust you're finding something
noteworthy for your column?

259
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,879
Look at you! I can think of a few other
places to put my column.

260
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,429
- Dream on.
- Never hurts to ask.

261
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,512
I'm sure you know,
but guess which hotel king

262
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,355
is having very private relations
with a very public woman?

263
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,476
The cat's out of the bag.

264
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,712
It's out of the bag.
Look at them together.

265
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,396
Judith McBain, she's insatiable.

266
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,439
Word is, they've done it
in every one of his hotels.

267
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,752
- Excuse me.
- Good chatting with you, Jonesy.

268
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,832
Samantha could handle the press,
but not the truth.

269
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,438
Fucking Richard is fucking everyone.
For the first time, I actually give a shit.

270
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,513
I think I have monogamy.
I must have caught it from you.

271
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,116
There are a lot of guys here,
but I don't want to fuck them!

272
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,236
Not him or him.

273
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,676
What about this guy here?
He asked if I knew you.

274
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,796
No, I'm not interested.
Dammit, I'm not well.

275
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,270
- At least you're not divorced.
- Tell Richard how you feel.

276
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,230
I can't do that. He likes me
because I'm immune to this bullshit.

277
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,234
There goes Judith McBitch
heading for Richard.

278
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,517
I'm going to go over there
and be completely calm

279
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,194
and completely professional.

280
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,990
Millions of people suffer from monogamy.
There is no known cure.

281
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,071
I'm so sorry.

282
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,798
- Great turnout.
- This is purely professional.

283
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,876
- How many women are you fucking?
- This isn't the Black and Blue ball.

284
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,551
As your publicist, I must tell you
all this bed hopping is tacky.

285
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,631
It makes investors nervous...

286
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,191
- It makes you nervous, too.
- As your publicist, yes, it does.

287
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,830
So grow up. Stop fucking other women.
Just fuck me.

288
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,833
Come on.

289
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,276
We're not the monotonous...
I mean, monogamous type.

290
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,635
Maybe I am.

291
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,391
Gorgeous, I'm not.

292
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,032
Fine.

293
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,598
Got any good dish for me?

294
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,034
In fact, she did.

295
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,317
Samantha gave JJ an exclusive,

296
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,950
just to prove to herself
that she was not.

297
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,469
Shit! Just a minute.

298
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,791
It wasn't the first time
a guy went soft on Samantha,

299
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,758
but it was the first time
she didn't care.

300
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,876
This never happens to me.

301
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,271
I can give you a list of women
it's never happened with.

302
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,829
That won't be necessary.

303
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,798
I want you to call Anna Bonny
at 9577297.

304
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,110
Or Lisa Yelland at 459...

305
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,831
There you are.

306
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,199
I was too quick back there. If someone
can keep monotony interesting...

307
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,316
Man of the hour.

308
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,956
You'll never change.
I wouldn't want you to.

309
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,951
Let's stay as we were.

310
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,476
This doesn't count.
He couldn't even stay hard.

311
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,790
Good seeing you, JJ.

312
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,988
Don't say it, Limp Dick!

313
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,879
That's a very good look for you.

314
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,476
I think we both look sharp tonight.

315
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,837
You've never looked prettier,
my friend.

316
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,832
Let's get married tonight.

317
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,992
You've got this beautiful
white dress on,

318
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,391
I've got this tux for another 13 hours.

319
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,196
Let's just do it!

320
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,796
Let's get in a cab. Airport. Vegas.

321
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,710
No muss, no fuss.

322
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,555
- Aidan, this isn't funny.
- Seriously. Come on!

323
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,190
We can get married tonight.

324
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,437
We wake up tomorrow, it's done.

325
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,718
We're still us.
We don't even have to tell anybody.

326
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,389
- What about what we discussed?
- You're just scared.

327
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,869
Yes, I'm scared.

328
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,555
- We talked about this.
- No. You talked and I listened.

329
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,269
I looked at you tonight
from across the room

330
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,749
and I thought: "l love her.

331
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,992
"She loves me.
What are we waiting for?"

332
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,118
Because I need more time.

333
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,512
What's going to change?
I don't have any tricks up my sleeve.

334
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,877
- This is who I am.
- This isn't about you.

335
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,235
I'm not ready for marriage.

336
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,393
I am. I'm sorry
if that scares you, but I am.

337
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,997
People fall in love, they get married.
That's what they do.

338
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,549
Not necessarily.

339
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,119
Why can't we just keep things
the way they are?

340
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,068
- Just live together.
- I don't want to live together.

341
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,153
I've had girlfriends for 20 years.
I want you to be my wife.

342
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,709
You're pushing me.

343
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,190
Maybe you need to be pushed.
It's just a piece of paper.

344
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,319
If it's just a piece of paper,
then why do we need it?

345
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,710
Because I need it!

346
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,589
I want to make this official,
lock this thing down.

347
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,070
I want the whole world to know
that you're mine.

348
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,834
Who else's would I be?

349
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,157
Oh, my God.

350
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,709
- You still don't trust me.
- The ring's not even on your finger.

351
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,917
I am yours.
There is nobody else!

352
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,959
I love you, but I can't marry you
to make you trust me.

353
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,071
Look at me.

354
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,078
Look at me
before we make a huge mistake.

355
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,351
If you don't want to marry me now,
you'll never want to marry me.

356
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,831
- That's not true.
- I think it is.

357
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,633
I'll sleep in the other apartment
tonight.

358
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,870
Really?

359
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,192
- Yeah, really.
- Just for tonight?

360
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,274
I can't believe I'm back here again.

361
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,799
We had left the land of black and white.
Now everything was grey.

362
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,272
On the outside, Miranda's
maternal gene might never kick in.

363
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,956
But that night, she felt a real
kick from deep inside.

364
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,269
There are some walls you can push
through and some you can't.

365
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,076
That was the only night we would ever
spend on the other side of the wall.

366
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,632
The next day, Aidan moved out.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
