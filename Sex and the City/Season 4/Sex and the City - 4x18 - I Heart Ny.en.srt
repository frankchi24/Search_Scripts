1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,273
There is a time of year in New York when,

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,590
even before the first leaf falls,

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,955
you feel the seasons click.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,954
The air is crisp, the summer is gone.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,270
For the first night in a long time,

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,396
you need a blanket on your bed.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,154
It brings up other needs as well.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,516
- What are you doing?
- Is this who I think it is?

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,513
- Who do you think it is?
- Princess Grace of Monaco.

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,557
She's dead.

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,756
So you understand my surprise.

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,195
What's shaking, kid?

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,591
- It's fall.
- I thought it was lndian summer.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,917
Then I guess I should take off
my moccasins.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,748
Are you still smoking?

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,952
Yes and no. I'm bad.

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,469
- Are you alone?
- Yes, ma'am.

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,550
I can't sleep.
I'm feeling a little lonely.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,591
- Do you ever feel lonely?
- No.

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,918
Can I come over?

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,035
Sure.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,674
To be clear, it's just
to keep each other company.

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,593
I always enjoy company.

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,635
- Get it while it's hot!
- I thought it was a company visit.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,678
- All your furniture is gone.
- See?

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,434
This is why I'm leaving New York.
The crime.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,833
- Leaving New York?
- I'm moving.

28
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,311
- You are not moving.
- Tell that to my realtor in Napa.

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,672
Napa as...

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,308
...as in California?

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,313
I bought a vineyard.
Half a vineyard.

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,315
Technically, it's three-quarters,
but there's a dispute over a hillside.

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,992
Take this pizza
and put it someplace.

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,358
- Moving when?
- Monday at 5:00.

35
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,512
If I hadn't happened to call tonight,

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,592
you were going to go away
without telling me?

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,038
I'm not big on goodbyes.
I would have called you.

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,795
From where?
A wine vat somewhere?

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,149
You can't leave New York.
You're the Chrysler building.

40
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,198
It would be all wrong in a vineyard.

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,749
Arrivederci, baby.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,630
- But...why?
- I'm tired of old New York.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,271
If you're tired, you take a "napa",
you don't move to Napa.

44
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,752
I need a cocktail.

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,349
And downtown, another woman
was feeling deserted.

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,350
- Hey, gorgeous!
- Don't gorgeous me.

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,674
I've eaten half a box of chocolates.
When I get cellulite, it will be your fault.

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,355
- I got held up.
- The telephone. Have you two met?

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,511
I was busy.

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,720
What's up? Besides me.

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,032
I don't like being kept waiting,
especially when I have a gift for you.

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,556
Is this an actual gift
or are we talking sex?

53
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,433
- What's the occasion?
- National "Richard's a prick" day.

54
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,469
I saw it and I thought of you.
Do you like it?

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,039
Very much.

56
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,913
It was the closest Samantha had come
to giving her heart to a man

57
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,435
in a long, long time.

58
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,068
It would be perfect right there.

59
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,674
You kept nothing to sit on,
but you have your records?

60
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,400
I know what's important.

61
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,915
Blood, Sweat & Tears?

62
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,153
- Shouldn't this be in a museum?
- Be nice.

63
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,075
Henry Mancini!

64
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,515
Exactly how old are you?

65
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,036
It was my parents'.
Don't knock it till you've heard it.

66
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,157
- Easy, Pops!
- Just give me the record.

67
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,189
I've been thinking.
You can't slink out of town this way.

68
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,512
We have to do it up right.
A proper goodbye.

69
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,638
You and me and New York.
You owe it to us.

70
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,632
By "us"
I mean New York and myself.

71
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,956
How's that wine?

72
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,113
- It's from my vineyard.
- In that case, I hate it.

73
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,275
- You can't be serious!
- Wait, wait.

74
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,996
So corny.

75
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,994
It's classic. Listen.

76
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,075
This was my parents' favourite song.

77
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,153
They used to put it on
before they went out on the town.

78
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,557
Listen. Did you hear that?

79
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,114
When I was little I thought it was
"two twisters". You know, the twist?

80
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,949
It was the 60s
and my parents had the moves!

81
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,595
See? I got you.

82
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,154
Thank you for the company.

83
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,276
That's it?

84
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,192
- You can stay.
- No, I'll see you Sunday night.

85
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,988
Don't disappoint us.
And by "us" I mean you and me.

86
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,269
That pizza will be fantastic
for breakfast.

87
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,996
Next morning, I broke the news.

88
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,913
Going, going, gone.
It's the end of an era.

89
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,719
Where do people go
when they leave New York?

90
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,995
The real world?

91
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,152
A homeless man showed
me his dick. That's real.

92
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,677
- Big wasn't going to tell you?
- No, but he said he'd call.

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,310
Like guys you have a second date with
and never see again.

94
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,870
- I pretend they died.
- Now the tough question.

95
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,554
Should you sleep with him
one last time?

96
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,439
Going-out-of-business sex.
What do we think?

97
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,831
- OK, Quick Draw, give it a second.
- No.

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,118
We like each other, we respect
each other. It could be nice.

99
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,077
Romantic.

100
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,834
You had sex with Steve.

101
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,436
Sex with an ex can be depressing.

102
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,512
If it's good, you no longer have it.
If it's bad,

103
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,275
- you just had sex with an ex.
- It wouldn't be bad.

104
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,831
I'm just saying.

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,471
Aren't you afraid you'll be pulled back
into all that Big stuff again?

106
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,235
- No. He's not Niagara Falls.
- lsn't he?

107
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,595
You're not giving me any credit.

108
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,070
This is not two years ago.
Things have changed.

109
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,711
Big and I are different.
I feel safe around him.

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,756
He's like...

111
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,639
...this great man in my life
and he's leaving.

112
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,030
Use a condom,
that's all I'm saying.

113
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,752
I don't know how you survived it.
This love stuff is a motherfucker.

114
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,673
- Did you say "love"?
- What the hell.

115
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,469
My name is Samantha
and I am a love-aholic.

116
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,198
It's infuriating.

117
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,478
Where can this go? No one makes
relationship things work, do they?

118
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,677
They're the same people
that leave New York.

119
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,469
I'm surprised Big is moving.
I always thought... Never mind.

120
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,951
You always thought what?

121
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,192
I always thought you two
would end up together.

122
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,148
- How?
- They made mistakes, but...

123
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,552
If she was going to wind up with anybody,
it was Aidan.

124
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,438
This is very informative.

125
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,955
You don't have enough distance
to have sex with your ex.

126
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,556
Thanks for the sound advice.

127
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,838
- I haven't had sex since my ex.
- It's the only way to move on.

128
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,190
Use a condom.

129
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,236
Later that night,
I got to thinking about fate,

130
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,439
the concept that we're not responsible
for the course of our lives,

131
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,149
that it's all predestined,
written in the stars.

132
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,356
Maybe that explains why,

133
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,751
if you live in a city
where you can't see the stars,

134
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,151
your love life tends to feel
more random.

135
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,278
Even if every kiss, every heartache,

136
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,238
is pre-ordered
from some cosmic catalogue,

137
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,473
can we still take a wrong step
and wander off our personal Milky Way?

138
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,838
I couldn't help but wonder: can you
make a mistake and miss your fate?

139
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,070
If you look at how brilliantly
Monet suggested glimpses of sky

140
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,471
and the luscious, tactile quality
of the canvas,

141
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,397
you can see how he established his fate
as one of the true poets of nature.

142
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,597
Charlotte's fate led her
to the Museum of Modern Art.

143
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,479
We'll move on to the Pollock.

144
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,518
- Weren't you here last Sunday?
- I love the lmpressionists.

145
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,798
And I'm trying to get up the courage
to invite you to dinner.

146
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,919
- That's very sweet, but...
- But you have a boyfriend?

147
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,152
Actually, no. No boyfriend,

148
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,154
I was just separated
and I'm not really ready to date yet.

149
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,233
I understand. I went through
a divorce last year. I'm Eric.

150
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,632
Viewing Jackson Pollock's "One"
is an almost overwhelming ex...

151
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,270
And, speaking of overwhelming exes,
there was Charlotte's, with his mother.

152
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,637
I detest Monet. Such a sap.

153
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,315
Mother, you have got to learn
how to form an opinion.

154
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,674
OK, enough Pollock.

155
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,116
Follow me as we move on
to Paul Gauguin. Now!

156
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,996
Come on!

157
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,357
I changed my mind.
I'll have dinner with you.

158
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,355
To avoid her ex, Charlotte ran all
the way into the Expressionist era.

159
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,711
On the Upper West Side,

160
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,190
two other exes were dealing
with A, B and Cs.

161
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,830
"Connect part C
with bracket B and bolt three."

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,959
Now you're not even making sense.
That can't be right.

163
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,318
"Connect part C to bracket B,
using bolt three."

164
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,197
Hand me bolt three.

165
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,198
Aren't you going to point out
you were right?

166
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,396
You have 40 pounds on me.

167
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,392
- I was thinking of Danny.
- Danny who?

168
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,233
For the baby. Danny Hobbes.

169
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,313
- I like that.
- Did you have any ideas?

170
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,635
Paul.

171
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,918
Paul's a big name in the Brady family.
My dad and my grandad.

172
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,309
Well... Paul.

173
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,758
But they're dead.
You didn't even know them.

174
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,797
Danny's better.

175
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,791
"Danny, you want to go
shoot some hoops?"

176
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,632
It sounds right.

177
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,799
Good.

178
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,996
We're making something
for little Danny.

179
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,833
- Don't cry, Steve.
- Sorry.

180
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,513
I've got work to do here.

181
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,629
If you want out of this, say it.

182
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,270
- I don't want sex and I want out?
- What about yesterday?

183
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,590
- We were at the opera.
- I was bored.

184
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,355
I fucked you for three hours
when we came home.

185
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,715
Why haven't you hung the hearts?
It's been laying there for days.

186
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
- I'm not sure it belongs here.
- Or I don't?

187
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,990
Samantha, a stranger to love,
didn't do it very well.

188
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,597
The weather this morning didn't
say anything about a shit storm.

189
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,070
Where were you at lunch?
I stopped by and you weren't there.

190
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,595
- I was eating.
- Eating who?

191
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,832
I saw you get into a cab
with a woman in "fuck me" heels!

192
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,112
Listen, Richard, tell me you're sleeping
with someone else

193
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,236
and we'll call it a day.

194
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,559
The hearts would be better in the den.

195
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,431
I had a salad and salmon.
The woman is a business associate.

196
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,312
I do not want out of this, but if you do,
this is a good way to go.

197
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,438
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,116
She was an interior designer.
You believe me, right?

199
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,278
Yes.

200
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,876
Yes, I do.

201
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,794
He's ploughing someone else.
How could he not be?

202
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,758
You're not cheating on him.
Miracles happen.

203
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,388
I'm going to follow him.

204
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,350
He won't know it's me. I got a wig
from the Raquel Welch wig line.

205
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,239
The Raquel Welch wig line?

206
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,188
Sassy shag, chestnut brown.
Very realistic for synthetic hair.

207
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,271
Why are you doing this?

208
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,159
I can't carry on
and have my heart broken.

209
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,675
If he's cheating on me,
I have to know.

210
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,389
If you love him, don't you think
there's a chance

211
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,835
that he might love you too?

212
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,832
I stole his key. I'm going to check
his answering machine.

213
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,992
I do not have bail money.

214
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,470
Hello, lover!

215
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,553
I am needing those for my last
Big night on the town.

216
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,996
- What are you doing?
- Drinks, dinner, dancing.

217
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,993
- Very old New York.
- I meant sex or no sex.

218
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,357
I'm just getting around
to picking the shoes.

219
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,559
We never really agreed on what
we wanted out of the marriage.

220
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,393
My wife and l,
different backgrounds.

221
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,439
You'd think we'd see
that was going to be the problem.

222
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,556
But no.

223
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,996
- We were in love.
- Love, right?

224
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,311
Love is tricky.

225
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,517
It's so hard to see
clearly through it.

226
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,349
Exactly.
It's like a fog or something.

227
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,314
You're very sweet, Eric.

228
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,316
After dinner, Charlotte invited Eric
home for coffee and...

229
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,477
The "and" being "I'm determined
to move on from my ex" sex.

230
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,997
This place is huge.
You live here alone?

231
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,276
It's not that big.

232
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,955
Not that big? Was your ex
a king or something?

233
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,196
- He's a doctor.
- Look at the size of this place.

234
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,397
I live in a studio.
You're rich.

235
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,516
My ex-wife was an Orthodox Jew,
you're a rich girl.

236
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,309
Why can't I find a woman
who's compatible with me?

237
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,917
I'm not really feeling that well.
Maybe you should go.

238
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,039
Christ, it's huge!
It goes all the way back there.

239
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,112
- Follow me.
- Good idea.

240
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,955
Charlotte realised she may be ready
to deal with her marriage past,

241
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,678
but not her dating future.

242
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,513
I had a lovely dinner. Bye!

243
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,356
Contrary to popular opinion,

244
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,355
I have given myself permission
to sleep with Big, if it feels right.

245
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,239
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

246
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,678
- You're a big girl.
- Can I get that in writing?

247
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,630
It'd better stop raining before tonight.
I have these amazing shoes.

248
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,790
- Are you having a baby?
- Damn! And that was just a kick.

249
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,590
Wait till the labour starts.
I'm getting a little freaked.

250
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,274
Will you be in the room with me?

251
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,434
Steve's good, but he's emotional.
I need something normal to look at.

252
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,549
I'm there purely for decoration.
I'm not cutting any umbilical anything.

253
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,151
That night, after the rain,
after the dinner, after the dancing,

254
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,117
I took Big for a ride.

255
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,994
I can't believe
you actually talked me into this.

256
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,232
A buggy ride in Central Park.

257
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,073
- Very corny.
- Nope, classic.

258
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,756
What are you going to do out in Napa,
besides watch grapes shrivel?

259
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,475
Work, smoke cigars,

260
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,279
- look at the stars.
- I give it a week.

261
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,750
New York.

262
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,911
New York!

263
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,559
Aren't you going to miss it?

264
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,228
But I will miss you, kid.

265
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,436
Very much.

266
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,995
Your cell phone's ringing.

267
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,879
I don't have a cell phone.

268
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,030
Jesus! That is me!

269
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,352
Miranda gave me one because,
you know...

270
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,998
How the hell does this thing...?

271
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,438
Thank you.

272
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,275
I'm in labour. Meet me
at Mount Sinai at 99th and 5th.

273
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,309
- Is Steve with you?
- He's on his way from the bar.

274
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,358
- Are you OK?
- So far.

275
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,432
I've got a cab.
I've got to go.

276
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,592
Miranda's in labour.
I have to get to Mount Sinai.

277
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,478
Excuse me?

278
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,110
We need to get to 99th Street
and 5th Avenue in a hurry.

279
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,033
I can't leave the park.
I'll get a fine.

280
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,668
- What's your name?
- Bobbo.

281
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,278
Here is 400 bucks.

282
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,680
See what you can do.
Bobbo?

283
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,638
One short carriage ride later...

284
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,708
You leave tomorrow at five?
How about lunch around two?

285
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,917
You're leaving me alone
with a horse and buggy?

286
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,277
- Thanks for the ride, Prince Charming.
- Any time.

287
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,435
81st and Park, Bobbo.

288
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,036
You will do anything
to stop me from having sex with Big.

289
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,191
- You look pretty.
- So do you.

290
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,389
Shouldn't you be lying down
or biting on a leather strap?

291
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,358
I'm trying to get my water to break.

292
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,717
It's better than having them
break it for you.

293
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,512
What can I do?

294
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,513
When this gets going, don't let
anyone get all cheerleadery on me.

295
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,990
I don't want any
"You can do it, push, push" shit.

296
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,278
Thus, with a destroyed pair
of Christian Louboutin's,

297
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,874
began Miranda's delivery.

298
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,998
It would continue
into lunch hour the next day.

299
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,079
There she was.
Miss Sassy in her shag,

300
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,438
trying to catch Richard
with his lunch time shag.

301
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,948
- Follow that car!
- Are you kidding me?

302
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,637
Just go.

303
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,597
One cab ride
and a breaking-and-entering later,

304
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,038
Samantha found herself
at Richard Wright's bedroom door.

305
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,513
You bastard!

306
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,114
Who the hell are you?

307
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,829
It's just sex. I love you.

308
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,431
She was right about Wright,
but now she wished she was wrong.

309
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,792
Now your heart's broken too!

310
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,112
Who was that?

311
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,919
The baby was almost as stubborn
as Miranda.

312
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,799
- You're doing good there.
- That's right.

313
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,758
You're almost there.
Now push, push!

314
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,356
- Push, push, push!
- Nurse?

315
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,875
Don't say that.

316
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,271
OK, Miranda.
One more deep breath, and go.

317
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,393
Oh, my God!

318
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,028
Oh, my God, there he is!

319
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,637
And he's perfect.

320
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,189
Yes, he's perfect!
He's perfect!

321
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,314
Nurse?

322
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,438
He's got ten toes, ten fingers.

323
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,352
Two balls.

324
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,755
- That feels good.
- You did so good.

325
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,757
And just like that, life comes in
and things begin to change.

326
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,471
It's weird.

327
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,074
It's like suddenly
there's a giraffe in the room.

328
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,793
I was thinking Brady.

329
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,871
Brady Hobbes.

330
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,994
That's a fabulous hat.

331
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,156
He's really teeny
and he has red hair!

332
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,754
Really? That is so cute!

333
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,674
I have to go.
I still have a chance to catch Big.

334
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,913
Here comes Raquel Welch.
She'll tell you. I'm late.

335
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,197
- Why are you wearing that wig?
- My hair looks like shit.

336
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,476
Miranda has a son.

337
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,870
Just what the world needs.
Another man.

338
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,519
Let's go see the baby!

339
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,119
Not so fast.

340
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,830
It's not even five.

341
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,198
What is this?

342
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,395
It was official:
a new season had begun.

343
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,993
Maybe our mistakes
are what make our fate.

344
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,879
Without them,
what would shape our lives?

345
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,158
Perhaps if we never veered off course,
we wouldn't fall in love

346
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,959
or have babies or be who we are.

347
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,033
After all, seasons change.
So do cities.

348
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,839
People come into your life
and people go.

349
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,835
But it's comforting to know the ones
you love are always in your heart.

350
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,195
And, if you are very lucky,

351
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,828
a plane ride away.

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
