1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,518
One frazzled Friday, four girlfriends
came from four different directions:

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,638
the East Side, the West Side,

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,756
Park Avenue and Samantha.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,156
It was the ultimate power lunch,
also known as the power catch up.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,118
I'll start. I can sum up my life
in one breath.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,477
Work, work, Au Bon Pain, work.
And you?

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,676
Let's see.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,355
Aidan, Aidan, this pimple, Aidan.
We don't need an hour.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,479
I cannot believe you made these.
I love you not working.

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,278
You can be my wife.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,034
I thought I'd have more free time,
but decorating is stressful.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,077
There are 40 kinds of dimmers.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,389
Remember when the economy was good
and we had a table?

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,593
Are you a janitor now?

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,833
I know, it's ridiculous. I need seven
to get in Aidan's building.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,037
- He gave you his keys?
- Yes, but I make him come to mine.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,270
He buys two-in-one shampoo.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,796
- Does he have your keys, too?
- All two of them.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,158
- You exchanged keys? That's big.
- That's the opposite of Big.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,279
Good for you. It took me six months
to give my cleaning lady a key.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,070
I happen to have the key
to a lasting relationship right here.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,553
1,001 sexual positions.

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,349
I got it on the corner, $1.50.
I love this city!

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,116
- Whose legs bend back that far?
- It's like sex for the boneless.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,397
That's what I love
about this guy Nick I'm seeing.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,711
- He's de-boned?
- He's the wrestling coach at NYU.

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,950
He's like a rubber band.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,831
Congregants, please refer
to position 91 in your prayer books.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
And let us say amen!

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,758
I came home to find Aidan
in the most shocking position of all:

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,797
cooking to the oldies.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,509
You're deflowering my pristine kitchen.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,837
Fajitas!

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,393
Carrie, meet my George Foreman Lean
Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machine!

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,358
- George, Carrie.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,835
- What you doing back there?
- Just looking for something.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,118
- Not in front of George.
- Leave George out of it.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,794
That's it. You're going down!

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,631
- What about the fajitas?
- Fuck the fajitas!

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,476
If giving a man your keys

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,474
means unlocking the door
to home cooking and great sex,

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,473
why were so many
independent women...

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,995
It's not done yet.
Don't read it.

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,593
Oh, my God.

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,158
Oh, my God!
Come back.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,557
What is this?
Why is this happening?

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,632
My computer just crashed,
right in the middle...

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,190
Just relax, darling.
Breathe and reboot.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,276
That always works
on my computer.

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,111
Let's get your manual out.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,398
I don't have a manual.
I got rid of it in a feng shui attack.

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,313
- I want to kill myself!
- Hang in there, sugar.

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,755
This thing's just faking you out.

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,079
Aidan, please.
Stop touching it.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,357
Stop it! You don't know
what you're doing!

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,591
We rushed my '98 laptop
in my '99 Pashmina to Tekserve.

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,513
Can you please not do that?

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,390
- 64?
- God! Come on.

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,070
- Number 64!
- Yes! Hi. Thank God.

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,199
- Please tell me that you can fix this.
- We tried a few home remedies.

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,875
One at a time.
Which one of you crashed?

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,828
I did. It's mine.
It's mine, but he did something.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,470
- Tell him what you did.
- I hit Ctrl Alt Delete.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,279
That only works on PCs.

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,750
You a PC user?
Then you're not compatible.

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,633
Tell me exactly what happened
right before you crashed.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,918
I was just typing.
He came over and kissed me

68
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,548
and then I got the bomb.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,473
Not "the bomb".
Not the good kind.

70
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,393
Do you think that this is funny?

71
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,075
- I'm just trying to...
- You are mortifying me.

72
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,156
When was the last time
you backed up your work?

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,079
- I don't do that.
- You don't back up?

74
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,514
Anything else before we go in?

75
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,390
Yes. A mean little man popped up
with 'X's where his eyes should be

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,314
and his tongue was
hanging out the side of his mouth.

77
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,357
He didn't have a tongue.

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,830
That's a Sad Mac.
You should have told me that before.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,434
Why? What does that mean?

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,750
It could be your motherboard,

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,913
could be bad RAM.
We'll keep it here, run some tests.

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,629
I'm Dmitri.
I'll call you if we find anything.

83
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,599
If?

84
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,069
78! Number 78.

85
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,556
What if everything
I've ever written is gone?

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,314
When did you last back up?

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,031
No one talks about backing up. You've
never used that expression before.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,557
But apparently everybody's
secretly backing up their work.

89
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,119
Where are you?

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,909
At the hospital in Philadelphia.
My mom had a heart attack.

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,914
Oh, my God! And you let me
go on about my stupid computer?

92
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,275
That's very upsetting.

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,716
Is she OK? How could you go
without telling me?

94
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,668
I had to hurry. I didn't know
how bad it was till I got here.

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,230
- How bad is it?
- They keep telling us different things.

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,679
She's pretty out of it, but she woke up
long enough to veto my lipstick.

97
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,152
Is there anything I can do?
I'll come and keep you company.

98
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,073
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

99
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,109
Miranda, the doctor's waiting.
Don't use that cell phone in the hospital.

100
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,271
She called me!

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,000
Now my sister's mad at me.
I've got to go.

102
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,799
You'll keep me posted, right?

103
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,829
Meanwhile, Charlotte's afternoon
was filled with ovulating and decorating.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,630
She was 12 days into her cycle
and three rooms into her lighting project.

105
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,469
She had become
a bona fide dimmer expert.

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,672
Samantha called in
a bona fide positions expert

107
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,752
who came fully equipped.

108
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,792
It turns out a half-nelson
was very much like position 411.

109
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,591
One half-nelson, one full orgasm.

110
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,152
- It's me. I'm sorry to wake you.
- That's OK.

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,309
- My mom died.
- Oh, my God.

112
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,234
She was stable last night

113
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,356
and we all went home.

114
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,637
Then they called
and said she was crashing.

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,109
By the time we got back,
she had died.

116
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,919
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

117
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,870
I just wish we hadn't gone home.

118
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,952
Nobody wanted to,
but they told us to get some sleep.

119
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,829
I'm sure that she knew on some level
that you were with her.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,992
But I wasn't with her.
Nobody was.

121
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,309
- What can I do?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

122
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,236
I'll be fine.

123
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,316
The funeral's on Tuesday
and I don't have anything to wear.

124
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,153
I didn't think I'd be going
to a funeral.

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,110
I'll be there. I'll bring something
from your apartment.

126
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,077
Don't bother.

127
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,518
I'm going to go out and buy a shitty
black dress I'll never wear again.

128
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,117
- I'd be happy to do it.
- No, don't do anything.

129
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,632
I'd better go.

130
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,509
- Miranda, I'm so sorry.
- Thanks. I've got to go.

131
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,199
Miranda's mother died.

132
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,913
- Come here. You OK?
- I'm fine.

133
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,752
Do you know when the funeral is?
I'd like to go.

134
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,396
I don't know.

135
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,872
You don't have to.
I don't really know.

136
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,675
Where have you been?
Where's Miranda? I'm starving.

137
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,910
What's wrong?

138
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,715
Miranda's in Philadelphia.
Her mother had a heart attack.

139
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,875
She died early this morning.

140
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,750
She wasn't even sick.

141
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,396
I can't believe it.
Poor Miranda. How is she?

142
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,471
I don't know.

143
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,037
She's not good.

144
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,919
I just felt so awful for her
and l...

145
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,234
I didn't know what to say.

146
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,034
You know Miranda.
She was trying to be so strong,

147
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,079
but she sounded so alone.
I kept saying all the wrong things.

148
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,674
No, I'm sure you didn't.

149
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,269
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,392
The first thing we should do is send
some flowers.

151
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,075
Or a fruit basket. Or muffins.
What do you think?

152
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,639
- Are you all right?
- What?

153
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,435
I'm fine. Flowers are fine.
Just tell me who to send the cheque to.

154
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,076
I'm just hungry.

155
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,990
Charlotte showed her support for Miranda
by becoming the Martha Stewart of death.

156
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,755
I want the clear Cellophane
and the navy ribbon.

157
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,798
Samantha, have you called Miranda?

158
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,111
She thinks that it would be faster
to take the train.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,198
We're going to the funeral?
I thought we were just sending flowers.

160
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,511
Of course we're going.
You should call her.

161
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,832
- She'd really like to hear from you.
- But what am I going to say?

162
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,468
You could say,
"I'm so sorry for your loss.

163
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,235
"l love you. I'm here for you."
That's enough ribbon!

164
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,756
"You're in my thoughts.
May she rest in peace..."

165
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,514
Fine, I'll call her. Goodbye.

166
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,839
In times of sorrow, some people
have trouble reaching out.

167
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,873
Samantha wasn't one of those people.

168
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,951
Want to wrestle?

169
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,679
Keep doing that!
Keep doing that!

170
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,157
But today,

171
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,073
something was just out of reach.

172
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,392
So they tried another position,
299.

173
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,756
I'm almost there.

174
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,953
Just hang on one more second.
One more second!

175
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,396
Hang on.
Hang in there. Stay with me.

176
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
Stay. Just like that.
Just like that.

177
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,673
Get them off me!
You're distracting me.

178
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,234
When none of those worked,
they went back to old faithful, number 17.

179
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,834
OK, now, that's it.

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,276
Now we got it. Here we go!
Home free!

181
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,512
Just keep doing
exactly what you're doing,

182
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,558
exactly what you're doing.

183
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,109
Exactly what you're doing.

184
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,319
Don't stop. Don't stop.

185
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,555
Don't stop. Don't stop.

186
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,757
- Don't stop!
- I have to be at the cleaners' by five.

187
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,114
OK, stop.

188
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,951
Make it very clear
to the Philadelphia florist.

189
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,475
Tasteful. All white.

190
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,076
Casablanca lilies,
Calla lilies and phalaenopsis,

191
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,198
- I don't want any crap.
- You told her.

192
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,954
These flowers will be on the altar.

193
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,157
It's important that they represent us.

194
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,318
I don't know.
I'm not even listening.

195
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,596
I lost my orgasm.

196
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,558
- In the cab?
- What do you mean?

197
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,951
I spent the last two hours fucking
with no finale.

198
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,999
- Sometimes you just can't get there.
- I can always get there.

199
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,275
- Every time you have sex?
- She's exaggerating.

200
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,550
Please say you're exaggerating.

201
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,598
I have had to polish myself off
once or twice,

202
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,469
but yes: when I RSVP to a party,
I make it my business to come.

203
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,155
I've been a no-show
on more than one occasion.

204
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,074
- Sex can be great without an orgasm.
- That is a crock of shit.

205
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,312
- She has a point.
- What's wrong with me?

206
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,118
Listen.

207
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,229
You've got plenty of orgasms
under your belt. You're going to be fine.

208
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,673
Let's retrace your steps.
Were you on top?

209
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,637
How is that relevant?

210
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,156
- You can have them on the bottom?
- Top, bottom, upside down.

211
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,153
- Now you're showing off.
- I'm asking for help!

212
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,075
I'm sure it will pop up
when you least expect it,

213
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,719
Iike...

214
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,234
-...jury duty.
- Unless...

215
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,072
What?

216
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,153
I read an article about a woman
who had orgasms all the time.

217
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,792
Then, boom!

218
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,077
Orgasms stopped.
For good.

219
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,269
It was like
she had used them all up.

220
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,270
That's the meanest thing
you've ever said to me.

221
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,237
Meanwhile in Philadelphia,

222
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,632
Miranda needed a shitty black bra
to go with her shitty black dress.

223
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,518
Can I help you?

224
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,672
No, I'm looking for this in 36A
in black.

225
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,150
- You don't look like a 36A to me.
- Well, I am.

226
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,398
Excuse me? Lucille?

227
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,711
I've been a 36A my whole life.
I know what size I am.

228
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,474
I didn't think so.

229
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,232
Try these.

230
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,710
- There is no way that I'm a 34B.
- Just try them.

231
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,916
- How's it going in there?
- Fine. Everything's fine.

232
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,870
From the age of 14, Miranda had a
no visitors policy in dressing rooms.

233
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,911
How's that working out?

234
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,833
Her mother never observed it.
Neither did Lucille.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,788
- I don't need any help.
- You say you don't,

236
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,430
but you were picking the wrong size.
This one fits you.

237
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,353
I can adjust my bra straps
by myself.

238
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,988
Please get your hands off my breasts!

239
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,118
I'm not being fresh.
I think I know what's best.

240
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,396
No, you don't!

241
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,199
I think that I know
what's best for me.

242
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,559
Suddenly, Miranda realised she would
never fight with her mother again.

243
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,154
I'm sorry.
It's not you.

244
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,834
My mother just died and...

245
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,272
- Come here.
- No, I'm fine...

246
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,069
There behind the curtain,

247
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,630
Miranda found a kind of support
that actually fit her.

248
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,590
This is perfect.

249
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,197
You were right.

250
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,232
Thanks.

251
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,231
Wait. Wait!

252
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,310
You're always sneaking up on me.

253
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,270
Surprise!
It's your new computer.

254
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,152
- It's blue.
- It's more fun than your old one.

255
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,276
It's like a little purse.

256
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,954
That's a very expensive purse.

257
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,599
- When did you get that?
- Today.

258
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,231
And I got you one of these zip drives.
So you can back up your work.

259
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,836
I don't even know how to use that
and I don't need it.

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,116
My own system works fine.

261
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,319
- Right! Are you sure about that?
- Yes, I am.

262
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,319
I'm not ready for a new computer.
I'm waiting to hear about my old one.

263
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,789
My whole life was on that computer.

264
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,317
I get it. It's all you.

265
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,479
I'm not part of this.
You don't want the laptop.

266
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,599
- You don't want me at the funeral.
- I gave you my keys!

267
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,115
Your keys? Great!

268
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,919
Now I can get into your front door!

269
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,875
How do I get into there?

270
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,115
I'm sorry, but I've been taking care
of myself a long time.

271
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,429
You may not like it,
but this is how I deal with things.

272
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,469
Here's your receipt. You can do
what you want with that computer.

273
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,438
Meanwhile, Samantha was
troubleshooting her own laptop.

274
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,273
She was determined
to just relax, unwind...

275
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,236
...and let the rest of the world
fall away.

276
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,153
What?

277
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,835
I'm picking up bagels for the train.
You're sesame, right?

278
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,310
- Have you called Miranda yet?
- No, I have whole-wheat.

279
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,029
I haven't called her
because I don't want to bother her.

280
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,351
Charlotte, I'm masturbating.

281
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,637
I told you
I'd be doing that all day today.

282
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,035
By nightfall, Samantha
called off the search party.

283
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,709
Somewhere in the city of lost dreams
and missing persons,

284
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,678
Samantha's orgasm remained at large.

285
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,031
Next morning, my own search party
called with news of a breakthrough.

286
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,518
You remember me?

287
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,798
I'm number P438W.
You have my computer.

288
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,676
Here's what we could recover
from your hard drive. Look familiar?

289
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,150
There it was. My past.
It was a mess.

290
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,270
Can you tell me why this happened
in the first place?

291
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,477
We don't know.
Sometimes these things crash.

292
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,430
We can replace your motherboard,
but you have to get a backup system.

293
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,079
Pick out a zip drive, start saving.
Then you won't lose everything.

294
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,273
You saved your warranty, right?

295
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,077
It's me.
The girl who doesn't back up.

296
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,236
This is my attempt
to breathe and reboot.

297
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,553
- Are you smiling at all?
- I'm listening.

298
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,389
I'm just on my way to Philly.

299
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,791
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

300
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,473
This is hard.

301
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,837
We're going to run into stuff
that's hard.

302
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,798
- That's why I was trying to help.
- I know, but...

303
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,950
If you start helping me and then I get
used to having that help...

304
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,639
No good can come of that.

305
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,590
What happens
when you're not around one day?

306
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,069
- Where am I going?
- I don't know.

307
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,597
You could be out of town or be busy.

308
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,150
Things fall apart.
We could fall apart.

309
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,880
- I know that.
- Then what?

310
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,837
Then I guess we'd be
a couple of Sad Macs.

311
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,315
Philadelphia. Just a hop, skip, cab,
a Metroliner and another cab away.

312
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm not going to find my orgasm
in this town.

313
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,515
We're at a funeral!

314
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,671
I'm so sorry.

315
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,991
I'm so sorry.

316
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,871
You look great.

317
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,396
Well, she does.

318
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,510
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

319
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,559
But everybody is concerned
about me because I'm here alone.

320
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,793
I didn't realise I needed a date
for my mother's funeral.

321
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,748
My sister and her husband want me
to walk with them down the aisle.

322
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,198
God forbid I should walk it alone.
That would be the real tragedy.

323
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,514
Ignore the coffin. There's a single,
35-year-old woman walking behind it!

324
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,636
Coming, Betsy.

325
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,871
This is hard.

326
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,115
"You look great" was not
one of the things I told you to say.

327
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,278
Excuse me, Betsy? I'm Charlotte.
We spoke on the phone.

328
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,238
I wanted to say again
how sorry I am

329
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,709
and to make sure the flowers worked out.

330
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,396
Yes, thank you.
In fact, there they are now.

331
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,476
I said tasteful!

332
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,799
Now we know what
$500 worth of glitter looks like.

333
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,838
Death is the eternal mystery.

334
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,478
It defies our comprehension.

335
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,950
There are no explanations,
no answers,

336
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,271
no magic words to soothe us.

337
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,079
You're a spiritual leader.
Make it up.

338
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,313
The flowers were supposed to say,
"We're so sorry. We love you",

339
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,711
not "You're dead. Let's disco!"

340
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,998
...from her daughter Betsy
and her husband David,

341
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,551
her son John and his wife Miranda,
her daughter Catherine...

342
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,631
Did he just say...?

343
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,476
No spiritual stuff and he can't
keep the family tree straight?

344
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,995
This guy's a hack.

345
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,071
After the burial,

346
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,153
John and his wife Miranda
invite you back to their home.

347
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,839
Directions can be found
as you exit the sanctuary.

348
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,958
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,031
Thank you.

350
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,678
Finally Samantha found
the release she needed.

351
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,152
She cried for what she couldn't say
and didn't even know she felt.

352
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,270
There's the kind of support you ask for
and the kind you don't ask for.

353
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,990
And then there's the kind
that just shows up.

354
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,074
After all, computers crash,
people die, relationships fall apart.

355
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,396
The best we can do
is breathe and reboot.

356
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,351
And when that fails,

357
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,513
a zip drive can provide
a surprising amount of comfort.

358
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,635
So can a boyfriend...

359
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,398
...if you can learn to let him.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
