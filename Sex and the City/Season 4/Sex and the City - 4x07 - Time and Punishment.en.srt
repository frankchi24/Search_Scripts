1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,869
Once Aidan and I were back together,

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,191
it seemed nothing had happened
to break us apart.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,479
It's me. Go ahead.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,952
Hey, kid. What's shaking?
I'm back in town. Call me, baby.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,717
I'm not...

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,515
A little machine
with a big message.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,671
- Something happened.
- Something bad?

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,912
Big called while Aidan and l
were making love.

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,433
Something bad.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,034
- The machine picked up.
- What did you do?

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,873
Nothing.
We just kept making love.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,271
He could keep going after that?
He's a keeper.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,432
- Never mind him. How did you do?
- I finished.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,956
I had to. I haven't worked that hard
since my SATs.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,429
This is awful.
Did you talk about it?

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,670
No. We just went to sleep.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,911
When I woke up, Aidan was
on the other side of the bed.

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,436
Usually he sleeps next to me,
right here.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,355
- And I just get in his little nook.
- Maybe he's sleeping differently.

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,318
Or maybe he'll never forget
what happened.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,632
Every time the phone rings
he'll think it's Big starting affair two.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,192
That's a big maybe.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,990
I was hoping we could start fresh.
Now we'll have to talk about it.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,799
You're going to explain about Big?

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,157
Unless Hallmark makes
a "Sorry I cheated" card.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,598
No one wants to hear about
their lover's past lovers. Leave it.

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,833
It's on my answering machine.
I have to talk about it.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,877
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,030
- Can I change the subject?
- I'll pay you a million dollars.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,311
- I'm thinking about quitting my job.
- Did you get a better offer?

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,950
No, I mean stopping working.
Altogether.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,750
Really?

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,152
I've been driving myself crazy
trying to get everything done

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,515
- and Trey suggested...
- Trey suggested?

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,073
He mentioned
that maybe I might quit.

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,074
I have been driving myself crazy.
And for what? The gallery?

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,470
What has the gallery
ever done for me?

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,200
- But you love your job.
- I know.

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,079
But there's much more
I could do with my life.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,878
Like what?

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,838
Soon I'll be pregnant.
That'll be huge.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,437
I'm redecorating the apartment
and I want to learn lndian cooking.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,434
Sometimes I walk by one of those
Color Me Mine pottery places

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,593
and I'll see a woman having
a lovely afternoon glazing a bowl.

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,796
That would be a nice change.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,758
And I wanted to volunteer
at Trey's hospital,

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,388
raise money for the paediatric
AlDS wing.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,713
The cooking and AlDS stuff is great,

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,348
but Color Me Mine?

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,159
If I was walking by
and saw you in there,

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,754
I'd just keep on walking.

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,718
Anyway, that's what I'm thinking.

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,910
You're not just having
a bad workweek?

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,071
No, that's not it.

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,915
I'm quitting. That's what I want to do.
I'm quitting.

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,958
Be damn sure before
you get off the Ferris wheel,

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,352
because the women waiting to get on
are 22, perky and ruthless.

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,199
You seem to have
a lot of opinions today.

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,909
I'm telling you.
Just forget it ever happened.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,640
Later, I got to thinking about relationships
and partial lobotomies,

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,076
two different ideas that might be
perfect together

62
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,196
Iike chocolate and peanut butter.

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,433
Think how much easier it would be
if there was some surgical procedure

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,956
to whisk away all the ugly memories
and mistakes

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,669
and leave only the fun trips
and special holidays.

66
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,673
But until that day arrives,
what to do?

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,753
Rely on the same old philosophy
of forgive and forget?

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,798
Even if a couple can manage
the forgiveness,

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,509
has any ever really conquered
the forgetness?

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,558
Can you ever really forgive,
if you can't forget?

71
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,318
To Samantha Jones,
some things were unforgivable.

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,110
Taking someone else's cab
was at the top of her list.

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,555
- I was here first!
- Sorry!

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,996
I don't think so. Get out!

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,836
I'm not getting out.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,357
West 12th and 9th Avenue, please.
I hope you enjoy the ride.

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,518
He did.

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,838
And in a far less friendly bed uptown,

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,753
I was even farther from the nook.

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,596
I still wasn't sure.
Maybe I was overreacting.

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,275
- 8:10. I've got to get to the gym.
- You don't have to go right now.

82
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,149
- You want me to get all soft again?
- I liked you all soft.

83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,958
I didn't.

84
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,479
Give me a good-morning kiss.

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,598
You might want to brush
your teeth first.

86
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,794
That settled it.
He wasn't forgiving or forgetting.

87
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,315
Speaking of not forgetting...

88
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,838
- You were so judgmental yesterday.
- Excuse me?

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,152
- You think I'm one of those women!
- One of what women?

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,710
One of those we hate,
who just works till she gets married.

91
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,838
- It's 8:15.
- That's not a response!

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,230
It's an 8.15 am response.

93
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,989
The women's movement
is supposed to be about choice.

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,311
If I choose to quit my job,
that is my choice.

95
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,677
The women's movement?
I haven't even had coffee yet.

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,876
It's my life and my choice!

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,477
Charlotte, this isn't about me.
This is your stuff.

98
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,835
Admit it!
You're being judgmental!

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,276
I'm dripping all over,
and you're calling my judgmental.

100
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,877
If you have a problem quitting your job,
take it up with your husband.

101
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,996
See! "Your husband!"

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,640
There's nothing wrong
with having a husband.

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,313
I'm hanging up.

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,393
Don't you dare!
And stop saying "Charlotte" like that.

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,950
I am quitting my job
to make my life better

106
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,033
and do something worthwhile
like have a baby and cure AlDS.

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,555
You're going to cure AlDS?

108
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,314
Good for you.
Just don't be disappointed

109
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,268
if all you wind up with is a ceramic mug
with Trey's name on it.

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,158
Take that back!

111
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,517
Don't you dare hang up!
I'm interviewing for my replacement.

112
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,116
- I need you to get behind my choice.
- You get behind your choice.

113
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,238
I am behind my choice!
I choose my choice!

114
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,756
I don't have time for this.
I have to go to work.

115
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,151
- Some of us still have to work.
- I choose my choice!

116
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,516
Fuck! Jesus!

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,989
When in a hostile situation,

118
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,470
some women, like Charlotte,
confront it head on.

119
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,232
While others...

120
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,712
Fresh juice?

121
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,714
- Where did you get that?
- I ran down to the Korean.

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,919
- Dressed like that?
- It caused quite a stir.

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,997
Will you help me patch up, buddy?

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,869
I got a big tense meeting
with my editor in an hour.

125
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,634
This feels like a two-patch day.

126
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,553
Notice how much better I'm doing
this time? No cheating.

127
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,472
I think I finally kicked
that bad habit.

128
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,710
Now I'm practically perfect,
don't you think?

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,956
That kind of hurt.
What was that?

130
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,032
I was making sure
it was on good and tight.

131
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,232
- Are you mad at me?
- Why would I be mad at you?

132
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,717
Excuse me.

133
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,989
- About the other night.
- What the fuck...?

134
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,039
This goddamn milk is bad.
You just let it sit in there?

135
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,433
It's not you. I'm just a little pissed off
because of work.

136
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,875
I got to strip these pieces.
The chemicals are toxic.

137
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,554
- There's no one to watch Pete.
- I'll watch Pete.

138
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,235
Dog walking's not your favourite
thing to do, Carrie.

139
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,475
You love Pete, I love Pete.
That's just the kind of girlfriend I am.

140
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,114
How about I take my tall drink of water
out to dinner tonight?

141
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,477
Some place super nice,
where the milk is fresh.

142
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,279
I'm meeting some buddies
at Steve's bar.

143
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,237
Is it a night with the guys
or can girlfriends crash?

144
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,678
You can come. Don't come.
Whatever. Do what you like.

145
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,320
You go have fun with the guys.

146
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,751
My neck is out. Charlotte called
and I was drying my hair.

147
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,639
My body is fucked up
because of the marathon.

148
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,677
I'm sorry. Can I help?

149
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,230
I don't know.
It hurts to even hold the phone.

150
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,833
Come over.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,912
- I have a...
- Thanks!

152
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,911
Shit!

153
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,272
Miranda's neck is out.

154
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,638
I'm worried that it's too late
for me to cancel my meeting.

155
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,030
I'll check on Miranda for you.

156
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,916
- You would?
- Sure.

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,798
Thank you.

158
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,829
You are a great, great boyfriend.
You know that?

159
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,514
I mean it. You're the best.

160
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,478
Where's your keys?

161
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,831
20 minutes later, Miranda's neck
had gone from bad to worse.

162
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,471
- Carrie?
- It's Aidan. Carrie sent me.

163
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,790
No, don't come in.
I'm naked.

164
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,635
What? Jesus!

165
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,919
My neck pulled again and this is
the only way I felt comfortable.

166
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,752
I'll get up.

167
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,589
- Don't get up, I'm coming in.
- No! Don't come in! I'm fine.

168
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,871
- I can't get up.
- OK, I'm coming in.

169
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,796
- I am mortified.
- Relax. I'm looking the other way.

170
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,034
- I'll lift you up.
- You'll see everything.

171
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,873
Nothing I haven't seen before.

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,508
Nice smell.
That's the April-fresh stuff?

173
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,759
Are you ready to be lifted?
Here we go.

174
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,112
All right, put your... There you go.

175
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,872
All right.

176
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,669
Let's get you up.
On three. One, two, three.

177
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,276
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

178
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,556
Snug as a bug in a rug.

179
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,192
Samantha was right.

180
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,876
Every aspiring "gallerina" in New York
wanted Charlotte's job.

181
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,957
She was determined to find
the perfect replacement.

182
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,352
Someone bright, someone smart,
someone like Charlotte.

183
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,798
BA in Art History, minor in Finance.
Same as me.

184
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,475
"Career objectives:
to own my own gallery."

185
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,474
That is amazing. I had the same
objective on my first résumé.

186
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,110
- Did you ever own one?
- No.

187
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,635
I found I loved it here so much
that it felt like my gallery.

188
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,793
You've done an amazing job.
It's my favourite space.

189
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,515
I shouldn't tell you this
with a line of people out there,

190
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,194
- but you're hired.
- I am?

191
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,957
Thank you, thank you!

192
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,873
- Do you have any questions?
- Just one.

193
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,157
Why are you leaving
this fantastic job?

194
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,790
I'm married
and we're planning on a baby.

195
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,188
Also, I'm on the board of the Lenox
Hill Paediatric AlDS Foundation.

196
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,030
Charlotte heard herself lie.

197
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,115
She couldn't bring herself to say
her new résumé objective would read:

198
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,829
"Wife, mother
and part-time bowl glazer."

199
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,873
That night, I decided to interrupt
guys' night

200
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,271
to give Aidan a quick "Thank you
for helping Miranda" kiss.

201
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,354
- You're my hero.
- What's new, pussycat?

202
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,478
Not only are you great to me,

203
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,950
but you're great to my friends
as well.

204
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,312
Who's a better boyfriend than you?

205
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,319
- I'm back! Where were we?
- I was up to three peanuts.

206
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,357
You think you're hot stuff?

207
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,119
Peanuts?

208
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,956
Shayna's teaching me to play jacks
with peanuts. I'm at threesies.

209
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,156
Hi, I'm Carrie.

210
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,671
Carrie, hi.

211
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,195
I'm sorry. That's Shayna.

212
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,470
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm not staying.

213
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,791
I don't want to interrupt
the night with the guys.

214
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,349
So where are the guys?

215
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,718
The guys blew me off so I came
to hang out with my buddy Steve.

216
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,794
And Steve... I'm sorry...

217
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,390
Where's Steve?

218
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,519
He went to get a burrito. Shayna and l
are looking out for the joint.

219
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,797
All right, I'm up. Twosies.

220
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,076
- Twosies!
- Look out!

221
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,473
- That was good.
- That was very good.

222
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,273
Miranda says that you were amazing.

223
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,556
He helped my girlfriend.
Took her to the chiropractor.

224
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,030
- You got us a nice guy here.
- Shucks, ma'am!

225
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,751
So how was Miranda?

226
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,715
No work or running for a week.
She has to wear a foam collar.

227
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,950
- What do you call four?
- Foursies.

228
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,671
I'm going to go.

229
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,591
- Can you excuse us for a second?
- Sure.

230
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,035
- What is going on?
- What's up?

231
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,394
You tell me.

232
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,994
You do your thing.

233
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,116
I don't have to work tomorrow.

234
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,953
- Come over if you want.
- I'll come over.

235
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,190
Good luck with foursies.

236
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,636
Nice to meet you, Shayna.

237
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,471
I'll see you later.

238
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,115
Let's go.

239
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,350
Watch and learn, young buck.

240
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,035
But Aidan never showed up.

241
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,598
And at about 3:00 am, it became
very clear that I was being punished

242
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,876
for my big mistake.

243
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,873
That cowl-neck look
is on the way out.

244
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,751
- How are you, sweetie?
- I slept sitting up like the Elephant Man.

245
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,595
- I brought you bagels to cheer you up.
- That's so nice of you!

246
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,399
Aidan never came over last night.
He said he would, but he didn't.

247
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,676
When I called him this morning,

248
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,709
he said he thought "come over"
meant today, not last night.

249
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,872
- This is bullshit.
- That's what I think.

250
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,396
No, you! You are bullshit!

251
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,154
Your bullshit cheer-me-up
bagels are a decoy

252
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,871
so you can talk about Aidan.
You didn't even bring cream cheese.

253
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,716
I got the good bagels.

254
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,317
It's bad enough you send your boyfriend,
but now the bullshit bagels!

255
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,392
- So you don't want one?
- If you fell,

256
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,199
I would never send
my boyfriend to help you.

257
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,193
Yes, I know I don't have a boyfriend.

258
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,319
What's the problem?
Aidan's better in a crisis than I am.

259
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,675
I can't even remember cream cheese.

260
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,597
He saw me naked. Your boyfriend saw
me naked on the floor on a bath mat!

261
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,797
- Did he tell you that?
- No, he's a gentleman.

262
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,951
Well, he did!

263
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,589
I get it. I'm sorry.

264
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,389
I will never send a boyfriend
to do my job again.

265
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,074
Do you want toasted?

266
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,437
If I still even have a boyfriend.

267
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,030
He's having an affair
with a waitress at Scout.

268
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,670
You cheating on him
does not mean he'd cheat on you.

269
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,035
I'm going to burn your bagel.

270
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,590
- It's just a matter of time.
- He's not having an affair.

271
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,512
He's not like that.

272
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,592
He's the good guy
and I'm the bad guy.

273
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,558
The bad guy just has to take it, right?

274
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,433
You should have seen the way
he was acting. He's torturing me.

275
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,114
And I deserve it.

276
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,670
- I deserve it, right?
- I'd shrug, but it hurts.

277
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,039
Got any jelly?

278
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,557
I wish I knew the name of that cab driver.
I'd send him a bottle of wine.

279
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,870
That was really great.

280
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,474
You're a wild man.

281
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,797
Speaking of wild,

282
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,078
it's getting too wild down there.
Might be time for a wax.

283
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,992
See you soon.

284
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,876
It's my week between waxes and this
asshole thinks I'm George of the Jungle!

285
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,794
You should see his bush.
I need a weed whacker to find his dick.

286
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,669
Please keep it down.
We're on the Upper East Side.

287
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,799
Men! We have to run to Helga
the hot waxer, but them?

288
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,033
How would they like it if we told
them to shape their hedge?

289
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,556
Plant their bulbs?
We are talking about gardening?

290
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,235
- Don't start me on his back hair!
- Wait a second. Pete has to go.

291
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,119
This is lovely.
Why are you even walking this mongrel?

292
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,239
I'm proving to my boyfriend
I am trustworthy, loving and kindly.

293
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,550
Do not take your anger out on Pete.

294
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,998
Watching his dog take a dump
will make the memory of Big fade?

295
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,153
- Couldn't hurt.
- Come on! The dog, the waitress.

296
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,629
I don't know that anything happened.

297
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,679
- How long will you punish yourself?
- Until I'm back in the nook.

298
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,229
You may never get back in the nook.

299
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,234
Don't say that.
I know it's true, but don't say it.

300
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,916
I'm not a dog expert,
but is that normal?

301
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,152
He's got the runs!

302
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,117
- Poor Pete.
- Poor me!

303
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,995
He must be sick or something.

304
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,549
I love you,
but this is not my scene.

305
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,518
You're not going to just leave me here?

306
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,392
Sweetie, you're not done yet.

307
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,950
- Pick up after your dog.
- He's not my dog.

308
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,794
I wondered just how much shit I was
willing to put up with for my mistake.

309
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,958
Pete's poo-poo platter
continued for so many blocks

310
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,111
I got worried and took him home.

311
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,111
Your dog got sick.
I'm leaving. Taxi!

312
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,352
Will you hold this?
Carrie, stop!

313
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,235
- What are you doing?
- Toxic chemicals?

314
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm taking a break.

315
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,237
She just happened
to be there with coffee?

316
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,193
- I diapered your dog!
- Keep your voice down.

317
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,031
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. We're friends.

318
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,510
Why don't you just fuck her?
Then we can both be bad.

319
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,271
Nothing happened.

320
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,991
I thought about it.

321
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,356
- Do you want to come in?
- I'm too pissed to come in.

322
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,829
I hate that he calls here.

323
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,788
Nothing's happening.
Or will ever happen.

324
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,874
You have to know that.
I would never do that to you again.

325
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,032
Never.

326
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,953
I don't want you to see him
ever again.

327
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,151
I can't do that.

328
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,552
He's in my life.

329
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,110
Not the same way you are.
But he is.

330
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,315
Aidan, you can't keep punishing me.

331
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,278
And I can't keep punishing me.

332
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,991
I made a mistake and I am sorry.

333
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,632
I know you can't forget
what happened,

334
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,638
but I hope that you can forgive me.

335
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,075
You have to forgive me.

336
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,794
You have to forgive me.

337
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,754
You have to forgive me!

338
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,311
You have to forgive me, Aidan.

339
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,356
You have to forgive me.

340
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,034
You have to forgive me!

341
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,839
You have to forgive me.

342
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,390
You had a lot of nerve
telling me to get a wax.

343
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,996
If you were in Aruba,
the natives could bead your back.

344
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,154
It's not just there. Every time
I blow you, I feel like I'm flossing.

345
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,877
I'm sorry, baby.

346
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,395
Is there anything I can do
to make you forgive me?

347
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,872
Samantha forgave and Brad got
a lesson he never forgot.

348
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,752
Look how much bigger
my dick looks!

349
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,668
Soon Charlotte's last day came.

350
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,628
- Seven should go on the north wall.
- It's better on the south.

351
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,109
You're 22.
What do you know about life?

352
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,556
I mean, art. I'm sorry.

353
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,835
I'm just freaked out.

354
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,914
This is a big transition in my life.

355
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,833
If it's any consolation,

356
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,879
my mother worked. It would have been
nice to have her home.

357
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,076
- Don't forget the alarms.
- You're not finishing the day?

358
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,755
I think I'm done.

359
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,751
Good luck.

360
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,991
Charlotte left her past
to pursue her new life objectives.

361
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,311
Be a good mother, cure AlDS...

362
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,475
...and prove Miranda wrong.

363
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,197
You'd better move my meetings
to the end of the week. I'm not 100%.

364
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,394
Still wearing the brace.

365
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,828
For the first time in her life,

366
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,390
Miranda learned the joys of cooking
and of not working.

367
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,912
She'd have to go back eventually,
just to prove Charlotte wrong.

368
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,196
As for Aidan, he and I weren't
quite back to where we were.

369
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,749
We might never be there again.

370
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,230
But we were in a new place,
a more honest place.

371
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,395
And somehow, over time, I had made
my way back into the nook.
