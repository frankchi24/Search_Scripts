1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,038
Although there are over
eight million people on Manhattan,

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,318
there are times when you still feel
shipwrecked and alone,

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,268
when even a resourceful survivor
puts a message in a bottle

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,034
or on an answering machine.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,710
This is Aidan.
I'm not in. Leave a message.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,679
Strong arms! Strong arms!
Earth to heaven!

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,434
Every movement has a meaning!

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,229
What did it mean that I wanted
to talk to my ex-boyfriend?

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,392
I've been making faux calls to Aidan.

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,473
When you have no idea
what you'd say if he answered.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,838
- It's emotional Russian roulette.
- You call and hang up?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,594
- That's pretty much it.
- Why do that?

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,753
I don't even know why I'm telling you.
Don't tell anybody else.

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,033
Carrie, tell them.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,637
That I'm not doing African dance again
or that you can't keep a secret?

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,758
- Carrie's calling Aidan.
- And hanging up!

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,835
- Why are you calling him?
- I think I want him back.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,753
How do I do this?

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,072
First, you have to accept
that he might not want to hear it.

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,913
I accept that.
How do I do this?

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,038
You don't. One word: granola.
So not you.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,830
He stripped her floors! Just get rid
of the turquoise and the tummy.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,391
The tummy is gone. At that thing
last week, he looked disturbingly good.

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,791
- He's the new improved Aidan.
- Low-fat granola.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,238
He looks good, but that's not why
I want him back. I miss him.

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,198
Did you miss him before you saw him?

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,557
I miss him.
I have missed him for months.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,393
You need a safe approach
in case he rejects you. E-mail him.

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,712
I'm an old-fashioned gal.
I prefer calling and hanging up.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,997
You've got to get online,
if only for the porn.

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,994
- Please stop sending me those.
- It's funny!

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,311
I can't get e-mail just for Aidan.
That's pathetic.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,758
- You can shop online!
- No, shopping is my cardio.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,515
I know what you do.
Don't call him. Don't e-mail.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,549
Just show up at his furniture store
wearing these.

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,676
- What are those?
- Fake nipples!

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,674
- Why are we carrying them?
- They're a promotional thing.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,673
Is there a Nipple Council?

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,674
Nipples are huge right now.
Open any magazine.

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,515
It's not that cold.
They're tweaking or wearing these.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,435
- I want to see how they work.
- Samantha already leads with her breasts.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,037
- Miranda, you try them.
- That I'd like to see!

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,751
I'm not certain, but I think my
boobs were just insulted. Cover me.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,471
That's it.

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,396
That's obscene! Walk.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,310
We have replaced Miranda's nipples
with rubber ones.

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,755
Let's see what happens.

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,475
I want my nipples back.

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,953
The next day, sans nipples,
Miranda's cardio put mine to shame.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,636
Training for the marathon wasn't the only
thing getting her heart rate going.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,189
- Are you in the right group?
- Ten-minute mile?

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,430
- I was here last week.
- I know,

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,433
but we never get any cute guys
in this group.

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,720
- They're in the seven-minute group.
- So I'm the cutest of the slow guys?

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,432
Knee surgery.

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,749
- Have you run the marathon before?
- The past four years.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,753
- What about you?
- First time.

58
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,435
- We should train during the week.
- Are there runs then?

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,068
I don't know.
I meant the two of us.

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,595
Sure. That would be great.

61
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,639
Miranda was thrilled,
but she still wasn't sure

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,713
if he was interested in anything
more than a running buddy.

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,399
Uptown, Charlotte's marathon
redecoration continued.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,438
I can't believe I questioned
this wallpaper.

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,309
I love this wallpaper!
And I love you.

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,356
I guess we're done with this room.
Time to move on to the study.

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,789
One room in every marriage
forces the question,

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,111
"How long do we want it to be
just the two of us?"

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,317
It's right off our bedroom, so...

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,636
What do you want to do
with the room?

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,870
It could be a good room for a...

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,156
...B-A...

73
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,912
B-Y?

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,228
We already have enough bathrooms.

75
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,632
Trey and Charlotte
were finally on the same page

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,394
and the page had a baby on it.

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,030
Meanwhile, Samantha went shopping,
nipples blazing,

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,795
and picked up a '94 Cabernet
and an '84 Harvard MBA.

79
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,918
This is nothing! It's a blip!

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,594
No, we can't retract it!

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,355
Warren Dreyfous founded
a communication strategy firm

82
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,798
that made the Exxon oil spill
an incident rather than a debacle.

83
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,269
I've got to go.

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,399
Next time, talk to me
before you talk to the press.

85
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,798
Sorry about that.

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,520
About the phone
or staring at my nipples?

87
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,274
About talking on the phone.

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,958
That night, I tried to compose
my first e-mail,

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,033
a witty, yet sexy,
yet sensitive note to Aidan.

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,832
"l miss you."

91
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,712
"Do you miss me?"

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,198
Across town, Samantha was getting
some male as well.

93
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,239
As a lover,
Warren was fantastic,

94
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,439
but as a communication strategist,
he made one major mistake.

95
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,354
Samanfa, does your 'gina-wina
want a widdle visit

96
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,875
fwom my Mister-Mister?

97
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,074
He didn't say that?

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,676
It's not what he said,
it's how he said it. In baby talk.

99
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,479
How can they think baby talk's sexy?

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,111
It's like putting ketchup on prime ribs.
"Stop! You're ruining it!"

101
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,113
It's such a shame.
This guy is hot!

102
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,919
I had to sit on his face
to shut him up.

103
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,833
Some men use baby talk
to avoid intimacy.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,039
- Others don't respond to e-mail.
- Aidan still hasn't replied?

105
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,350
14 hours, but who's counting?

106
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,112
Oh, my God!

107
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,915
- lsn't this adorable?
- lsn't it a wee bit small?

108
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,873
Guys, Trey and I are trying
to have a baby.

109
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,677
- Why?
- Shouldn't you wait a while?

110
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,752
- You just got back together.
- I can't wait!

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,435
I'm the oldest woman I know
who doesn't have a baby!

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,797
The oldest married woman
who wants one.

113
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,952
- I'm very happy for you.
- Thanks.

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,477
I won't become a mother
who only talks about Diaper Genies.

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,835
Good!

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,592
Look over here!

117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,399
What the hell's a Diaper Genie?

118
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,518
Someone you hire to change
your kid's diaper?

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,599
Tricia Watson was
one of those hip moms

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,639
for whom Barneys would always
be stores, not dinosaurs.

121
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,429
Cliff told me you and Trey
are back together. I'm so glad.

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,956
- This is Mary Elizabeth.
- Hello, I'm Charlotte.

123
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,350
Pleased to meet you.

124
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,717
- Trey and I are trying to get pregnant.
- Great!

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,352
Come over for dinner this week.
We just redecorated our dining room.

126
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,956
I'd love to, but try finding
a sitter for three kids.

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,430
I can't believe I'm 34
with three kids!

128
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,639
I invited the Watsons
and their kids for dinner Tuesday.

129
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,198
Charlotte, 35 with no kids,
decided it was time to get serious.

130
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,277
Next day, I worked on a little piece
I was calling

131
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,954
"36 Hours And Still No Response
From Aidan."

132
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,756
The lndians had to wait
up to six months for a response.

133
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,435
It took me six months to realise
I wanted to be with Aidan

134
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,194
and now I couldn't wait.

135
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,319
Are all these improvements
helping us communicate?

136
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,349
In matters of love, do actions
really speak louder than words?

137
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,752
I decided to take action
and this time he answered.

138
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,838
- Why won't you answer my e-mail?
- Who is this?

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,151
It's Carrie.

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,113
I was just asking if you got my e-mail.

141
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,397
Shoegal.
That's my screen name.

142
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,155
- I got it and deleted it.
- That's not very neighbourly.

143
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,359
I get so much junk mail.
If I don't know an address...

144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,476
I have the opposite problem.

145
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,155
I've had one e-mail from Miranda
and a welcome from AOL.

146
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,231
What did it say?

147
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,473
Just how to use the different features
and, you know, "welcome".

148
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,232
No, the one you...

149
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,836
The one l...?
The one to you.

150
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,757
It doesn't matter.
Do you know what I was thinking?

151
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,480
You, Steve, Miranda and me
could go out.

152
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,236
Just as a...fun group thing.

153
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,597
- Sounds good.
- Great. So I'll set it up?

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,999
Meanwhile, Miranda's run
led to "want to come up for coffee?"

155
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,597
and led her to believe that Marathon
Man could be more than a running buddy.

156
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,591
- I'm all sweaty.
- You taste great.

157
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,598
Did you get my e-mail
about our double whatever?

158
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,833
- Yes, and I'm ignoring it.
- I'm not impressed with e-mail.

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,072
- Why would I go out with Steve?
- You're not.

160
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,959
You're my air bag in case of impact.

161
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,317
Steve's going as Aidan's air bag.

162
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,951
Would you explain that to Steve?
I'm dating other people now.

163
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,678
Marathon Man?

164
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,389
- We slept together after our run.
- I guess he was interested.

165
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,472
- Did he live up to his nickname?
- It was good.

166
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,269
Except he kind of...Iicked my butt.

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,675
- Be specific. The cheeks?
- It was more localised than that.

168
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,032
Wait a minute.
Are we talking tuchus-lingus?

169
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,033
I'm afraid so.
And it was weird.

170
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,839
It's weird, right?
Are we doing this now?

171
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,310
- If the guy's willing, why not?
- Anyone other than Samantha?

172
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,349
I never had a guy
do the TL on me.

173
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,390
One time it almost happened,
but I got the feeling he lost his way.

174
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,438
Trey likes to do it.

175
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,192
We're married.

176
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,512
I'm definitely in the slow group
if even Charlotte is open to it.

177
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,513
Something's happening
with men and the ass.

178
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,595
The last few guys I've been with
were much more eager to attend to it.

179
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,639
How did they get the message
that the ass is now on the menu?

180
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,997
One loud mouth guy found a woman
who loved it

181
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,276
and said,
"Women love this!"

182
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,635
- Who is this guy?
- Who's the woman?

183
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,951
Don't knock it until you try it.

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,873
Maybe I shouldn't have
pulled away so fast.

185
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,350
Am I out of the ass loop forever?
I can't ask for it.

186
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,469
Just lean into it! No words necessary.
He'll get the signal.

187
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,279
But then do I have to reciprocate?

188
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,113
No. I would never do it
back to them

189
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,032
- Neither would l.
- Me neither.

190
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,111
You wouldn't?

191
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,597
That night, Charlotte performed
a more traditional wifely duty.

192
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,194
She cooked dinner for their guests.

193
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,078
Go ahead, everyone.

194
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,756
This looks amazing, Charlotte.

195
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,913
- Trish is amazed that anyone cooks.
- Three kids keep her busy.

196
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,594
I don't want to sit next to the lady!

197
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,352
That's one.

198
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,033
- How many does he get?
- 45.

199
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,952
I don't want to!

200
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,914
- We can rearrange.
- It's fine.

201
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,553
- Do you need your inhaler?
- He's asthmatic.

202
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,554
- Won't play much sport.
- Not all boys have to play sports.

203
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,314
Don't talk to me like you do
the kids.

204
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,038
Up here!

205
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,519
- Fancy shoes, Hank.
- They used to be mine.

206
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,956
- He won't go anywhere without them.
- Don't talk like that!

207
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,395
Don't talk to me like that!

208
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,836
That night, Trey and Charlotte
didn't have sex

209
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,355
or the next night, either.

210
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,956
This time, inaction was speaking
louder than words.

211
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,715
The pest-control guy
sticks some dead ones on a strip...

212
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,917
I, on the other hand,
was full of words.

213
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,833
I say to him,
"Sir, what are they?"

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,788
He says, "l don't know. That's why
I'm sending them to the lab."

215
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,474
This is New York.
He's a pest guy.

216
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,837
He doesn't know what I've got
and that isn't good!

217
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,868
- I've got to take a leak.
- I was going to go.

218
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,110
Men don't do that.

219
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,475
- Women can, men can't.
- You should go.

220
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,996
- Break with convention.
- I'm man enough.

221
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,233
We're already partners in a bar.
People are going to talk!

222
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,595
We're going to the bathroom.

223
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,917
Aidan needed an air bag
in the bathroom.

224
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,877
I think I'm OK.

225
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,033
- I mean I think you can go.
- I don't even get flan?

226
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,273
If you don't leave now,
we'll have to end the night together.

227
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,275
Hug, share cabs. Then I won't have
any time alone with him.

228
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,148
Can you take Steve with you?

229
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,434
Thank you for walking me home.

230
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,797
You live near the restaurant.
It's the least I could do.

231
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,036
- Good to see you tonight.
- I want to get back together.

232
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,115
I was afraid you were going to say
something like that.

233
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,718
I was willing to try
the friendship thing,

234
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,348
but I can't do
the relationship thing.

235
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,875
But you...

236
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,832
You put your hand on my hand.

237
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,151
- What?
- At the restaurant. You...

238
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,880
I was trying
to make you comfortable.

239
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,715
You just seemed so nervous
telling that bug story.

240
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,877
Then I guess I should...

241
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,316
Good night.

242
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,396
Good night.

243
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,711
Miranda didn't answer her phone.
I left a message

244
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,111
and started to send her
a desperate e-mail.

245
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,669
I was about to call you.
I was lM-ing with Marathon Man.

246
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,310
Interesting. Will your tuchus
be wanting lingus?

247
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,439
If things work out between us,
we never had that conversation.

248
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,752
- He's coming over.
- You'll be having dessert after all.

249
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,515
What happened to my air bag?
Steve tried to kiss me!

250
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,433
Aidan kissed me!
We miss-kissed.

251
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,310
I wasn't going to, but then he kissed me.
What does that mean?

252
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,832
God, he's online!
Can he see me?

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,639
- Step away from the computer.
- I'm going back.

254
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,234
- To Aidan's?
- I know he's home.

255
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,277
Send him an e-mail.

256
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,193
He'll say that he doesn't want
to see me,

257
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,989
but I know he does.
His words said no, his kiss said yes.

258
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,469
That's the defence of date rapists.

259
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,234
I know he still feels it.

260
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,395
When men attempt bold gestures,
it's generally considered romantic.

261
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,797
When women do it, it's often
considered desperate or psycho.

262
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,520
I was hoping to prove
I was neither.

263
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,118
Hi, again.

264
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,236
You haven't been out here
since I went up, have you?

265
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,073
- No! I went home.
- And you came back?

266
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,118
I came back.

267
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,709
You see, I think...

268
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,993
I feel fairly certain that there is still
something between us.

269
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,395
I had a nice time tonight with you.
I did.

270
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,516
But I want to leave it at that.

271
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,196
Can I come up and talk to you
for a few minutes?

272
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,593
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Because of what might happen?

273
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,235
Because it's not a good time.

274
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,632
I know that you're probably scared.
I would be too.

275
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,076
But it's different now.
Things are different.

276
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,358
I'm different.
Wait a second.

277
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,275
Cigarettes. Gone.
Seriously, all bad habits gone.

278
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,117
This is a whole new thing
because I miss you. I've missed you.

279
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,239
It's not just because you look
so good, but you do.

280
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,235
I lie in bed at night and I think
about us, about you holding me...

281
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,789
You broke my heart!

282
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,315
Samanfa,
I wuv your titty-witties!

283
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,076
As I was wishing I had said nothing,
Samantha decided to say something.

284
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,875
You're a great fuck,
but I don't need the baby talk.

285
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,589
You don't have to call these titty-witties.
They're my breasts.

286
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,513
You don't have to say
anything about them.

287
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,274
It's just sex and it's fine.

288
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,075
Would you please come out of there?
Can we talk about this like adults?

289
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,310
We're not finished.

290
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,199
I was very closey-wosey.

291
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,509
OK, you can call them titty-witties.

292
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,592
I'm leaving.
I've got an early day tomorrow.

293
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,877
Don't pout!
We were having such a nice time.

294
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,235
It was only a suggestion.

295
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,675
Where are my shoes?

296
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,197
Samantha realised she wore the nipples
and attracted a big baby.

297
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,479
Speaking of babies,
Charlotte and Trey still were not.

298
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,952
This was delivered today.

299
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,554
I ordered it a week ago. They needed
time to engrave it. I totally forgot.

300
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,599
"We had each other,
and then we had you,

301
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,673
"and then we had everything.
Love, Mommy and Daddy."

302
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,950
It's completely premature.
I was just so excited.

303
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,510
And now?
Do you not want a baby any more?

304
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,111
Of course I do. Don't you?

305
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,158
We stopped trying
after the Watsons came over.

306
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,518
Kids don't even want to sit by me.

307
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,034
I want to sit next to you.

308
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,476
I knew Cliff and Tricia when they got
married. They were so in love.

309
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,114
And now they're just...

310
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,071
Parents.

311
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,716
Maybe if we only have one child?

312
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,190
One to start.

313
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,356
See how we do. Besides...

314
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,719
Then Trey told the lie that all
parents-to-be have to tell themselves.

315
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,872
Our kids will be different.

316
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,600
The experience had them
a little rattled,

317
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,912
but that night Trey and Charlotte
made love and possibly a baby.

318
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,915
Downtown, Miranda seemingly had
her communication problem licked.

319
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,549
She felt like she should do
something in return.

320
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,913
- Would you like a massage?
- I would love one.

321
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
I don't want to do that!

322
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,835
Why didn't you just say
you weren't interested?

323
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,438
This time,
we didn't need any words.

324
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,993
You want to do this to make up
for the past? Relieve your conscience?

325
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,072
Because we're OK?

326
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,519
I've mentally kicked your butt
all over Manhattan.

327
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,518
I'm fine now.

328
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,753
No.

329
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,398
No, I just...

330
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,511
I love you.

331
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,160
I still love you. I just...

332
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,751
I wish that I could be
your girlfriend again.

333
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,600
I need to think about that.

334
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,797
His actions said he still loved me
or maybe he just missed me.

335
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,999
Or maybe he needed closure.
Maybe I'd never know.

336
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,598
The next morning,
due to sheer embarrassment,

337
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,228
Miranda got what she needed:

338
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,712
a running buddy who pushed her
into the nine-minute mile group.

339
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,035
I still had no response
from Aidan.

340
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,834
Carrie! You up there?

341
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,595
- OK, let's give it a shot.
- Really?

342
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,075
- Do you want to come upstairs?
- I promised Pete a walk.

343
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,353
- You want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

344
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,272
Let's go for a walk.

345
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,233
Don't move, OK?

346
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,716
I'll be right there!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
