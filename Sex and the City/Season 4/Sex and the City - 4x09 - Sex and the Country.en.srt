1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,078
For most New Yorkers, Manhattan
is the centre of the civilised world.

2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,957
For a privileged few,

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,111
Manhattan is merely a place to kill time

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,114
between weekends at their
fashionably rustic country homes.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,714
The place looks great.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,871
I was willing to forego the privilege.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,474
- That's the "before" picture.
- Sorry!

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,670
- That's the "after".
- Could I see the "before" again?

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,752
You have to be there to appreciate it.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,151
- I can appreciate it from here.
- Luckily, you won't have to.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,915
- You're coming up there next week.
- I am?

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,152
I wish I could, but I have a meeting

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,276
with my editor in town next week.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,829
It's only 40 minutes away.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,956
Take the train in for your meeting

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,554
and back when you're done.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,075
You've just thought of everything,
haven't you?

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,196
Pack your bags, little lady.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,590
You're coming to the country with me.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,509
That's Miranda. We'll talk later.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,511
Nothing left to talk about!

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,238
Yes, there is!

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,153
- I'll be right down.
- I'm coming up.

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,228
I'm what you call
a bona fide city girl.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,551
I'm a girl about town. I'm the kind of girl

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,872
that goes to a late movie
in the middle of the week. I'm crazy!

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,951
I know it.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,270
Could you tell Steve
to call his insurance company?

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,750
They still think I'm his
"in case of emergency" person.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,876
He needs to update that file.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,271
He wants to talk to you
about some stuff, too.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,272
Like what?

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,873
Some stuff.

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,235
What is he going to tell me?

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,109
Now that Jessica's gone,
he wants to see me again?

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,592
- That he's still in love with me?
- Steve's got testicular cancer.

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,157
That I'm a horrible selfish bitch?

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,348
A few blocks south, Charlotte was also
in a compromising position.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,273
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't stop.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,399
- It's a fertility exercise.
- I know a better one.

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,309
Not yet! My basal body temperature
reading says I ovulate in five days.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,438
That's perfect.
We have five days to practise.

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,594
We can't! You need to conserve your
juices so they'll be at their most powerful.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,512
Darling, I'm juicy now.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,432
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,388
We've been trying for three months.
I don't want to take any chances.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,076
- Can't it wait until Saturday?
- We'll be in Connecticut with Mother.

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,030
I know. I was thinking we could
stay here and concentrate on this.

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,876
She's expecting us. If we miss
the orchid show, she'll be devastated.

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,918
Then we'll have to have sex
at your mother's.

51
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,032
People having sex in Connecticut?

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,112
There's a first time for everything.

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,234
It's no big deal.
The doctor said it's very trendy now.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,915
- Lance Armstrong had it...
- Everybody's getting it.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,356
- It's the TiVo of cancers.
- It's no big deal.

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,752
You've just got to snip one of those guys
out of there and I'm done.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,753
So it's stage one?
I looked it up on the Net.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,430
- I guess so.
- You guess so? You don't know?

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,755
Sure. It's stage one.
You have the operation.

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,277
Stage one: the cancer hasn't spread
to the lymph nodes, has it?

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,718
Your doctor gave you an ultrasound?
A CAT scan?

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,829
You know... I turned my head, I coughed,
he poked around a little.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,992
Who the hell is this doctor?

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,720
He's nice.
I got him through my HMO.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,677
Then he must be good.

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,871
I talked to some guys in my office
who've been through this...

67
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,156
I used a pseudonym.

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,596
They gave me the name
of a specialist who...

69
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,035
You don't have to do anything.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,237
I have a doctor.
It's no big deal.

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,233
Will you stop saying that?
It is a big deal.

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,518
This isn't your crazy yellow toenail.
This is cancer.

73
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,434
The longer you wait
to find out what's going on,

74
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,593
the more likely it is that the cancer
will spread and you will die.

75
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,194
It is a big fucking deal!

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,391
I made him cry.

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,156
First, I yelled at my friend, the cancer
patient. Then I made him cry.

78
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,871
It's understandable, you just lost
your mom. You have pent-up anger.

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,474
Maybe.
But mostly he pissed me off.

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,995
He needed a kick in the ass.

81
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,234
You know what you need? A weekend
with me at Aidan's country house.

82
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,960
You're not actually going, are you?

83
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,069
If you mean being taken against
my will and kidnapped, then yes.

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,596
This weekend,
I'm a hick town hostage.

85
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,069
I can't go. Steve has cancer.

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,516
Somebody has to make him
feel bad about it.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,399
You're at the Connecticut compound?

88
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,716
Come on! It's like living in Paris
and going to Provence for the weekend.

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,431
What is it with weekends? Every guy
I've fucked since Memorial Day

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,716
wants to know about my weekend.

91
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,113
They just don't get it. My weekends
are for meeting new guys.

92
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,840
So that's a no?

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,833
I'll have to brave the wilderness
on my own.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,468
Not on your own. With Aidan.

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,756
I love Aidan.

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,276
Aidan loves the country
so maybe I'll love the country.

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,513
- Because Aidan loves the country?
- Apparently that's how it works.

98
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,956
You need to pretend to be someone else
to be in a relationship?

99
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,398
No. I believe the word
you're looking for is compromise.

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,028
Trey loves golf
so I'm taking lessons.

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,998
Trey loves Bunny
so I'm ovulating at the orchid show.

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,234
- Which hick town is it?
- It's too terrible and too ironic.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,310
It's Suffern.

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,471
Suffern, New York.

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,718
Sounds like you'd better take
some Bufferin to Suffern!

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,311
We're home.

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,837
There's a lake right over there.
One mile.

108
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,712
This floor's original.
It dates back to 1874.

109
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,237
The plumbing's 1974,
so it needs some work.

110
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,190
I put in a hot water heater.

111
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,920
What do you think?
Scary as you thought?

112
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,548
No. God, no.

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,438
It was scarier.

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,876
Good. Let me stick this stuff
in the back

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,635
- and I'll give you the grand tour.
- I'll be here.

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,270
There I was: trapped in a cabin
outdated even by Civil War standards,

117
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,796
when I could have been
cocktailing and sample saleing.

118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,514
What is it? What happened?
Are you OK?

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
No! Oh, my God!

120
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,950
There was a huge, giant squirrel
in that window.

121
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,189
That's my squirrel.
I've been sneaking him nuts

122
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,112
hoping he'd make friends.

123
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,636
You can't be friends with a squirrel!

124
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,076
A squirrel is just a rat
with a cuter outfit.

125
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,392
That's my squirrel? Any more surprises
I should know about?

126
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,994
Let's see, just...

127
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,838
Hours later, we discovered
one satisfying way

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,152
to pass the time in the country.
Just not enough time.

129
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,995
There I was, miles from home,
hours from sleep,

130
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,392
with no one to talk to, nowhere to go,
and nothing to do except...

131
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,912
Three hours, two mosquitoes
and one too many vodka Kool-Aids later,

132
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,596
I finally found an outlet for my computer,
but not my frustration.

133
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,234
Relationships, no matter how good,
are inevitably a series of compromises.

134
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,077
How much of ourselves should we be
willing to sacrifice for the other person?

135
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,268
In a relationship, when does the art
of compromise become compromising?

136
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,235
Meanwhile,
back in the civilised world...

137
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,039
What are you doing next weekend?

138
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,152
What did I say?

139
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,596
Tired of being the
"wake up and smell the coffee" girl,

140
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,399
Miranda invited Steve for tea
and sympathy.

141
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,518
Or, in Steve's case,
Chinese food and chop sake.

142
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,353
I thought you hated these movies.

143
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,911
But you don't and the guy
at Video Village said this one rocks.

144
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,039
- You want the last spring roll?
- No, that's yours.

145
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,714
I don't want it, you have it.

146
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,589
They forgot the tea!
Did you want tea? I could make some.

147
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,591
I'm outta here.

148
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,637
- Where are you going?
- Home.

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,156
Think I want to be treated
like some cancer patient?

150
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,515
What are you talking about?

151
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,275
Why don't you want the last spring roll?
You eat all the spring rolls!

152
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,318
I'm sorry, I felt bad.

153
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,268
In the park you needed a shoulder
to cry on and I was a bitch to you!

154
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,237
You were.

155
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,439
Thank God. Now I have a doctor
who knows what he's doing,

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,398
I've got my operation
and insurance to pay for it.

157
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,836
So thank you for being a huge bitch.

158
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,352
Give me that spring roll.

159
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,712
At the MacDougal's Connecticut
compound,

160
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,678
Bunny gave Charlotte
a tour of her nursery.

161
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,356
Since my boys have all grown up,
my orchids have become my babies.

162
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,637
This year, Waxy Hanahan's
Chocolate Oncidium

163
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,439
will be no match for my Rising Suns.

164
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,433
- They're exquisite.
- I'm pleased you think so.

165
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,114
I've repotted this one for you.

166
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,794
- I couldn't.
- But I insist.

167
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,714
A gift in anticipation
of the great gift you're giving me.

168
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,031
- What gift is that?
- A grandchild, my dear.

169
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,832
Don't be cross with Trey
for telling me.

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,949
He knows I'm anxious to have a wee
MacDougal to carry on the family name.

171
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,155
I couldn't get any sleep.

172
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,551
- The silence is deafening.
- You are in the country.

173
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,793
Then I go to take a shower
and there's no water,

174
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,918
so now he's working on the pipes
all day.

175
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,117
I had to leave the house
before I dehydrated.

176
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,758
I'd like a cheeseburger, large fries
and a Cosmopolitan.

177
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,117
- What?
- A strawberry shake, please.

178
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,795
- Where are you?
- The Frozen Cup in HoHoKus.

179
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,191
I had to drive to New Jersey
to get cell service.

180
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,512
The only way to get anything to eat
is to make it yourself

181
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,676
and I'm in no mood for Bisquik.

182
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,960
Bunny's picking out schools for her
grandchild and I'm not even pregnant.

183
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,873
She didn't let the cook
put shrimp in my omelette.

184
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,077
A cook? How far is my country
from your country?

185
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,834
How is the house?

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,878
There's squirrels everywhere.
It's Animal Farm.

187
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,953
- Four legs good, two legs bad.
- You didn't say that to him?

188
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,157
He thinks I love it.
I don't know why I'm here.

189
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,393
- You're keeping him company.
- I'm trying, but he's out hoeing.

190
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,279
So try harder. Go hoe!

191
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,958
Are we going to be schlepping
these railroad ties over to the mud hole?

192
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,752
- Yes, ma'am. Don't hurt yourself.
- I'm not going to hurt myself.

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,990
All right. Ready?

194
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,953
- You OK?
- Fine. It's just mud.

195
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,117
Go! Go, go, go!

196
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,399
Shit!

197
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,034
I'm not being helpful any more.
Maybe I should get back to the city.

198
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,956
I have that meeting to get ready for.

199
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,156
And several showers to take.

200
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,039
Four hours later,
I kissed Aidan goodbye

201
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,510
and had a New York steak
with my New York ex.

202
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,877
I tried, but nature and me:
it's unnatural.

203
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,113
I love being with Aidan. There's no one
in the world I would rather...

204
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,758
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,469
- Is it OK to talk to you about this?
- Go ahead. I'm OK.

206
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,428
I'm glad we can talk about this.
If you ever meet someone...

207
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,750
I met someone.

208
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,595
Who is she?

209
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,593
If I tell you,
you can't tell anyone.

210
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,831
Is she your imaginary girlfriend?

211
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,677
She's an actress.
Willow Summers.

212
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,559
She's not an actress,
she's a movie star!

213
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,473
Did you see that spy-girl movie?
She was good.

214
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,950
But she wears many wrong things
on the red carpet.

215
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,712
I cannot believe you're dating someone...

216
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,312
...named after a tree!

217
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,869
- She's really something.
- How did you meet her?

218
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,635
She came up to me
at her premiere and asked for a light.

219
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,191
She said, "l have two vices.
Smoking and green-eyed men."

220
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,955
- She's a smoothie.
- We talked, had a few...

221
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,190
Went up to her hotel,

222
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,471
dress comes off...
Red panties.

223
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,599
Kept her high heels on.
I lifted her up, put her on the bed...

224
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,149
OK! That's plenty! Thanks.

225
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,108
That was about 30 seconds.
I think I did pretty good.

226
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,308
- How's the stock market treating you?
- I can't get her out of my head.

227
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,709
She's crazy about me.
Willow Summers is crazy about me!

228
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,474
- Someone's crazy.
- I'm not kidding.

229
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,349
- When I walked home from her hotel...
- You walked?

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,909
I thought, "This is something."

231
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,230
There's something here.

232
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,992
Connection.

233
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,516
The red-panty, green-eyed connection.

234
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,514
I think I'm in love.

235
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,791
I realised I'd gone from pretending
I didn't hate the country

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,436
to pretending I didn't hate
listening to Big's Willow talk.

237
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,196
I may have been back in the city,
but now I was really Suffern.

238
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,637
One thing was clear:
I had to get back to the country.

239
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,395
But I wouldn't rely on it
to provide the entertainment.

240
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,597
I would take it with me,
otherwise known as...

241
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,512
...Samantha.

242
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,276
- What's next, Samantha?
- You've got to be kidding me.

243
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,637
- We're baking a pie here!
- You are. I'm just baking.

244
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,952
It's hotter here than outside.
Can't we turn on the air conditioning?

245
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,917
One cup of milk.

246
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,311
No, we can't.
There is no air conditioner.

247
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,310
Or milk, for that matter.

248
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,436
What time's the next train?

249
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,071
You can't go! You have to entertain
me when Aidan goes to bed.

250
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,152
You lured me here
under false pretences.

251
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,074
- I told you it was rustic.
- Don't kid yourself. It's a dump!

252
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,550
Aidan worked very hard on this place.

253
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,076
He put that hot water heater
in by himself.

254
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,276
With his own bare hands.

255
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,035
Actually, I was wearing gloves
at the time, but thanks.

256
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,350
- Is it hot in here or is it me?
- It isn't you.

257
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,231
I'm preheating the oven.

258
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,279
It couldn't be any hotter in here.
Or could it?

259
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,316
Who's the farmer with the delts?

260
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,036
Young MacDonald?

261
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,910
That's Luke Gilmore.
Came out here after the market crash.

262
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,277
He doesn't say much.
Keeps to himself.

263
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,876
- What does he do out here?
- Push-ups by the look of him.

264
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,874
What are you up to, Sammy Jo?

265
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,432
If we're going to bake us a pie,
we're going to need us some milk.

266
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,709
Anybody home?

267
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,351
- You lost?
- No!

268
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,308
I'm staying next door
and I'm baking a pie from scratch.

269
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,552
I realised I'm fresh out of milk.

270
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,391
Help yourself.

271
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,152
- From New York City?
- Yes.

272
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,279
But only until I can afford
a little farm all my own.

273
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,834
Ever milk a cow before?

274
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,318
But something tells me
I'd be very good at it.

275
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,154
Squeeze off the milk
with your thumb and forefinger,

276
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,596
then roll down into a fist.
Squeeze and roll.

277
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,477
Squeeze and roll.

278
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,155
Squeeze and roll.
I think I can do that.

279
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,277
Squeeze and roll.
Squeeze and...

280
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,756
I usually get a little warning
before that happens.

281
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,640
I guess it just takes practice.

282
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,029
Anything else need milking?

283
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,711
While Samantha worked up an appetite,
Charlotte's eggs were ready.

284
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,236
- I'm in the bath.
- It's time! I'm ovulating!

285
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,154
Get out of the tub, get into this bed,
make love to me right now.

286
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,996
I was just telling Trey

287
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,709
how much you remind me of myself
at your age.

288
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,715
There you are.
What are you doing here?

289
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,872
- What were you doing up there?
- What do you mean?

290
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,838
Your mother was watching you bathe!

291
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,913
She was not watching me.
We were talking while I was in the bath.

292
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,594
I don't know how you were brought up,

293
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,278
but that is not acceptable bath-time
behaviour past the age of five.

294
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,718
If you think I'm bringing a child into that,
that I'm that kind of mother,

295
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,438
think again.

296
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,751
She raised you like that,
but I am not your mother.

297
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,111
I was raised by a woman named Eva Neil.
She was my nanny.

298
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,232
I don't remember ever seeing
my mother

299
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,836
except after her tennis lesson
and before cocktails,

300
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,436
when she drew me a bath
and told me how she spent her day.

301
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,955
So I know, I have always known,

302
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,476
that you could never be
that kind of mother.

303
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,313
That's my ovaries. I'm ovulating.

304
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,877
I'd better get to work.

305
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,591
I have to do it in the right position.
Wait. I have to get my legs up.

306
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,878
While trying to make a baby,
Charlotte and Trey destroyed Bunny's

307
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,477
and Waxy Hanahan's Chocolate Oncidium
won first prize once again.

308
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,515
Back in New York, the patient Steve
was greeted by a patient Miranda.

309
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,313
You're up. How are you?

310
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,317
On drugs.

311
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,711
- How long you been here?
- Not long. A while.

312
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,836
Is that OK?

313
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,233
- I talked to the doctor.
- How's he?

314
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,154
He said everything looked pretty good
down there.

315
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,390
I told him I'd seen better.

316
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,390
- Sorry.
- Visiting's over.

317
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,075
- You'll have to leave now.
- I'm sorry. I don't think so.

318
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,596
- Are you a family member?
- I'm his "in case of emergency" person.

319
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,990
It's OK if you want to go.

320
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,391
Shut up
or I'll give you a sponge bath.

321
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,676
20 minutes.

322
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,876
Drink your juice.

323
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,236
Meanwhile, on his farm,

324
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
Young MacDonald had Samantha.

325
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,196
That was good!

326
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,194
You're a man of few words,
but they're all the right ones.

327
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,158
What are you doing next weekend?

328
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,116
Look! I made crust!

329
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,670
Now we just have to put apples in
and it's pie.

330
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,274
- Look at that.
- You don't understand.

331
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,238
The only thing I have
ever made in a kitchen

332
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,598
is a mess and several fires.
Feel like peeling some apples?

333
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,275
- I feel like taking a shower.
- Now?

334
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,319
You've been outside all day.
I've been cooped up in here.

335
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,994
We'll do it together.
It'll be fun.

336
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,399
- Are you OK?
- No, I am not OK!

337
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,476
I burned my legs!

338
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,277
I hate that squirrel!
I hate this oven!

339
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,670
I hate...this!

340
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,831
House. You hate the house.

341
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,560
- I hate the house.
- Thank you.

342
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,473
I'm sorry, I just...

343
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,349
I don't belong here.
I don't know where anything goes.

344
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,399
And I've burnt my legs.
It really hurts.

345
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,238
Jump up here.

346
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,557
There it is.

347
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,631
Is that better?

348
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,357
I'm sorry.

349
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,349
I don't hate the house.
I hate the squirrel!

350
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,840
The squirrel's not so bad.

351
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,390
The house will get better, you'll see.

352
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,712
Maybe I should just come
up on the weekends.

353
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,713
Or every other weekend.

354
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,594
I don't have to come at all.

355
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,997
Weekends are good.

356
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,073
One slow train ride and two fast-food
apple pies later...

357
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,993
This is surprisingly delicious.

358
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,915
Why make one when you can buy one
so perfect and individually sized?

359
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,510
Wait a minute. Hold still.

360
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,309
- Souvenir?
- I am never leaving this city again.

361
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,788
Actually, the country's looking
pretty good to me now.

362
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,112
- So you'll be back next weekend?
- Not next weekend, no.

363
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,078
So when are you going back?

364
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,440
Are you going to finish that pie?

365
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,512
In the end,
Aidan and I compromised.

366
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,071
He spent money on air conditioning
and I spent enough time in Suffern

367
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,755
to realise that city girls are just
country girls...

368
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,391
...with cuter outfits.
