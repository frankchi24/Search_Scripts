1
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:52,141
Manhattan, for millions of our forefathers,
the gateway to hope...

2
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,483
...opportunity and happiness
beyond their wildest dreams.

3
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,159
Today, that hope is still alive.
It's called The First Date.

4
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,860
On Saturday nights,
every restaurant in Lower Manhattan...

5
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,455
...resembles its own little Ellis Island.

6
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,559
Hordes of single women crowded
into a hot, cramped space...

7
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,697
...hoping to make it to their
final destination: the state of matrimony.

8
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,742
Or at least to get a hot meal in transit.

9
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:22,279
Samantha didn't believe in The First Date.
But she did believe in sex after it.

10
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,185
I think you missed a drop.

11
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,620
Harrison was a very successful litigator...

12
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,851
...who took steam baths
with Ron Perlman...

13
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,191
...and owned an apartment
on the 39th floor of Museum Tower.

14
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,355
An excellent first-date pedigree.

15
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,800
After dinner, Harrison invited
Samantha up to see his view.

16
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,672
I think you should know
my specialty is sexual harassment.

17
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,175
Really. So is mine.

18
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:57,479
This is a classic case:
a classic case of entrapment.

19
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:03,255
Beautiful woman, mind-altering wine....
I could claim temporary insanity.

20
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,084
I do have a prior record
of driving men a Iittle crazy.

21
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
You fit the profile.

22
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,021
Most sexual harassment cases
are brought by older women.

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:23,632
-I'm sorry?
-No offense, but what are you: 40, 41?

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,138
Samantha had celebrated
her 35th birthday...

25
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,510
...for as long as we could remember.

26
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,881
-I'm just gonna freshen up.
-I think you're pretty fresh already.

27
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,573
Hey, sexy, I'm over here.

28
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,737
There, next to his Brooks Brothers suits...

29
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,341
...was the world's
smallest cedar-lined den of inequity.

30
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:07,911
SIap me.

31
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,347
-You've got to be kidding.
-C'mon.

32
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,591
SIap me hard.

33
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,888
Apparently the view left
a little to be desired.

34
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,763
The next night, Samantha invited us
to a party she was throwing...

35
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,466
...for the new coffee-table book du jour.

36
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,268
The book was awful,
but the hors d'oeuvres were fabulous.

37
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,778
Give him credit. Takes a Iot
of work to get rigged up Iike that.

38
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,477
Most of my first dates
don't even open the cab door.

39
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,646
-What if he's still there?
-The super'd find him eventually.

40
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,919
You see, this is why I don't date.
The men out there are freaks.

41
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,425
That's completely unfair.

42
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,690
If a man is over 30 and single,
there's something wrong with him.

43
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:54,164
It's Darwinian. They're being weeded out
from propagating the species.

44
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,168
-What about us?
-We're just choosey.

45
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,306
I'm getting more shrimp.

46
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,567
You know what the worst part
of the date was?

47
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,238
Harrison actually thought I was 40.

48
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,648
-Really?
-Really.

49
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,350
Do you think I Iook 40?

50
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,080
If Samantha's past four birthdays
taught me anything...

51
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,021
...it was that there is only one answer
to this question.

52
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,649
You don't Iook a day over 35.

53
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,930
This is a great party. I just met
the most amazing guy, Mitchell Saylor.

54
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,200
When Charlotte really liked a guy,
she said his whole name.

55
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,068
It helped her to imagine
their future monogrammed towels.

56
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,469
Mitch Saylor?

57
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,566
-Yeah, do you know him?
-Honey, I know of him.

58
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,475
What is that supposed to mean?

59
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,015
Ladies, I suggest
you join me in the bathroom.

60
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,651
-He's Mr. Pussy.
-Mr. who?

61
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,846
Suddenly, Charlotte's towels
were looking very different.

62
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,413
He's renowned,
he Ioves going down on women.

63
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,325
-He's so cute to be so nasty.
-That's disgusting!

64
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,829
-I told you there'd be something.
-He's a Iegend.

65
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,694
He's just amazing at eating pussy.

66
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,361
-Would you please stop calling it that?
-Fine. Going down, giving head.

67
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,996
-Eating out?
-Shouldn't it be eating in?

68
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,630
Stop it!

69
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,243
-You do do that, right?
-Of course!

70
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,270
I don't have to talk about it.

71
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,578
Reality was, the only thing that went down
with regularity on Charlotte's dates...

72
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,515
...was a Gold American Express card.

73
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,544
Forget it. I'm not dating anyone
who is known as Mr. Pussy.

74
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,556
-Why not?
-Maybe I want more than that.

75
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,789
Sweetie, if a man is good at that,
there is nothing more.

76
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,726
Amen.

77
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:35,063
You have to be talking about Mitch Saylor.
He's unbelievable.

78
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,765
I dated him for a month.

79
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,334
He was so good,
I actually passed out when I came.

80
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,574
Enjoy.

81
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,514
The guy's got good word of mouth.

82
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,346
My God, right over there. That's him.

83
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,101
Unlike Miranda, I wasn't ready to accept
that all single men were freaks.

84
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:19,873
I was so optimistic, I had actually agreed
to go on my first blind date in two years.

85
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,611
P.J. was a very successful
independent-movie producer.

86
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,313
His documentary on endangered seagulls
had just aired to excellent reviews on PBS.

87
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,118
So, documentary films. That must be fun.

88
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,055
Let's be realistic. I'm only doing
this docu bullshit to earn a rep.

89
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,825
UItimately, I want to parlay into
the action-movie arena to make money.

90
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,958
I'm not afraid to say it. I Iove money.

91
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,559
I'd sell toilet bowls
if it'd make me a millionaire.

92
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,367
-What about the seagulls?
-Fuck the seagulls.

93
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,040
Step right up, folks.

94
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,272
Two vodkas and a $12 pasta
buys your admission to see...

95
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,541
...The Man With No Soul.

96
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:03,278
Observe if you dare, this chilling sight.
Bachelor Number Two seemed promising.

97
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,450
Just so you know,
I can't see a movie without popcorn.

98
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:11,620
I'm a Junior Mints kind of guy.
This relationship is probably doomed.

99
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,767
You want to Iean a Iittle closer?
Maybe hear our entire conversation?

100
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,534
Why don't you and your fucking girlfriend
just sit on our Iaps at the movie?

101
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,236
Then you won't miss a fucking word, dick!

102
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,317
Ladies and gentlemen,
stand far away from....

103
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,087
The Man With Two Faces.

104
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,790
They say the third time's the charm.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,929
Max was a broker
who made $2 million on bonds last year.

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,860
We had a great dinner in Little Italy.

107
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,592
Not only did Max have $2 million...

108
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,002
...he also appeared to have
a lending library in his pants.

109
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,974
Parents, please keep the kiddies away
from the cage of...

110
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,411
...The Man Who Steals
Cheap Used Books for No Reason.

111
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,379
Okay, now I was afraid.

112
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,778
Apparently the men in the dating world
had devolved since the last time I visited.

113
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,255
Maybe Miranda was right.

114
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,685
They never should've outlawed
freak shows...

115
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,024
...because at least then the freaks
were rounded up in one place.

116
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:21,533
Now they're out there among us,
roaming free. Is it true?

117
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,535
Are all men freaks?

118
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,339
Apparently Charlotte's week
went a little better than mine.

119
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,908
On Monday night, she was finally ready
to let Mitch under her sheets...

120
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,115
...way under.

121
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,130
Sorry. It tickles.

122
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,999
Just relax.

123
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,894
Relax.

124
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,539
That night Charlotte came harder
than she ever had before.

125
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,506
That is, until Tuesday.

126
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,184
-Yes!
-Wednesday.

127
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,420
Thursday.

128
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,125
-Friday.
-God!

129
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,890
Friday.

130
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,928
God!

131
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,193
Friday.

132
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,572
That night, Charlotte saw God seven times.

133
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,466
For a lapsed Episcopalian,
it was a very Good Friday.

134
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,378
If Mitch was a freak, Charlotte was ready
to run away and join the circus.

135
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,862
Meanwhile, all I wanted to do
was run away.

136
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,072
Rough night?

137
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,617
Bad date.

138
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,288
Been there.

139
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,715
He was a kleptomaniac.

140
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,655
Last month, I went out with a woman
who slept with her shoes on.

141
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,167
Hi, Carrie.

142
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,665
Ben.

143
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,175
I was instantly attracted.

144
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,643
But I was pretty sure
I could feel webs between his fingers.

145
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,082
So when did you guys all become freaks?

146
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,307
Us?

147
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,019
No. The Shoe Woman
seemed totally normal.

148
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,182
Then a month in, I discover she's a freak.
They hide it really well.

149
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,593
That's why I don't date anymore.
Women are bizarre.

150
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,496
-Thank you.
-Sometimes in a good way.

151
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:20,835
I once saw the world's fattest twins
at a state fair. They were both married.

152
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:26,382
-Their wives were very skinny.
-Maybe it was an optical illusion.

153
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,086
Maybe.

154
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,594
-Would you have dinner with me?
-I thought you didn't date.

155
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,626
-I don't. It would be a non-date.
-A non-date.

156
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,869
Maybe.

157
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,445
-Is that a yes?
-Let's call it a non-no.

158
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,542
And it was then
that the most freaky thing happened.

159
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,779
There in the middle of Manhattan...

160
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,790
...two complete strangers gave out
their unlisted phone numbers.

161
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,560
Meanwhile, Samantha was about
to have her own chance encounter.

162
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,458
-Samantha?
-Monica.

163
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:21,466
-Look at you. You Iook amazing.
-Don't I? It's the work.

164
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:26,811
I had the fat from my ass injected
into my face. Look, Iike a baby's bottom.

165
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:31,344
-Unbelievable.
-Isn't it? Fat from my own ass.

166
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,279
The best part is, you get to eat
Iike a pig before, fatten up your ass...

167
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,720
...and then a week Iater it's in your face.

168
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,952
Gotta go, bye.

169
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,428
An hour later,
Samantha had her first Big Mac...

170
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,729
...and an appointment with the most
expensive plastic surgeon on Upper Fifth.

171
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,798
Meanwhile, I had my own ass to be
obsessed with and it belonged to Ben...

172
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,331
...an editor at a hip political magazine,
who made me laugh.

173
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,774
This is me.

174
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,979
Then I guess this is goodnight.

175
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:09,754
Normally I'd try to get upstairs,
but since this is a non-date....

176
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,756
So no kiss.

177
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,392
Maybe a non-kiss.

178
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,640
There was nothing "non " about it.

179
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,676
A week and three non-dates later...

180
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,216
...Samantha summoned us
to make an announcement.

181
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,719
You've got to be kidding.

182
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,484
It's sitting in a fat repository
in Queens as we speak.

183
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,558
And in three days, it will be in my face
and I will Iook fabulous.

184
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,856
I can't believe it.

185
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,889
We keep hiding the fat in our ass
and you're putting it right on your face?

186
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,698
I just have to wear this girdle
for a week to keep my skin tight.

187
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,798
Look at that.

188
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,945
That's a girdle with a hole.

189
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,709
Of course it has a hole.
It's for peeing, etcetera.

190
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,815
Etcetera?

191
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,843
Last night I slept with
a Calvin KIein model. I've never felt sexier.

192
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,982
-I think the fat's already gone to your head.
-Could you put your skirt down?

193
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,788
-Whatever happened to aging gracefully?
-It got old.

194
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,331
I got to go.
I'm meeting Mitch at my apartment.

195
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,228
-So how is he?
-He is amazing.

196
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,831
He makes me happy. I think we have
a chance at a future together.

197
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,472
-You and Mr. Pussy.
-His name is Mitchell.

198
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,543
Hang on, honey.
You don't fall in Iove with Mr. Pussy.

199
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,473
You enjoy him and then set him free.

200
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,673
To Samantha,
Charlotte had committed the ultimate sin.

201
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,547
She was Bogarting Mr. Pussy.

202
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,713
He's a freak! Aside from technique,
what do you know about him?

203
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,722
-Do you talk?
-Do you even fuck?

204
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,916
-Stop it.
-Sweetie, Miranda has a point.

205
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,986
Have you guys had dinner together?
Have you seen a play, anything?

206
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,690
No, but we could.

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,332
You know what?
You've fallen into the sex haze.

208
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,839
Where the sex is really great
and you start acting Iike a crazy person.

209
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,431
You imagine
the relationship is something it's not.

210
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,545
Charlotte's not having a relationship,
she's having multiple orgasms.

211
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,643
He makes me happy.

212
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,412
Hoping to prove Miranda wrong...

213
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,319
...I had convinced her to come out
on a double non-date...

214
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,856
...with Ben 's friend, Luke.

215
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,085
Things were actually going
remarkably well.

216
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,593
-Favorite ice cream?
-Strawberry.

217
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,660
-I see, you're boring.
-I Iike to see it as traditional.

218
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,700
Traditional? Traditional can be good.

219
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,236
Nothing makes you feel like
more of a non-couple...

220
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,295
...than creating another non-couple.

221
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,637
Unfortunately, our smugness
was a little premature.

222
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,076
-What are you doing this weekend?
-Big plans.

223
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,047
I'm gonna go see
my granddad in Connecticut.

224
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,176
-Connecticut?
-What's wrong with Connecticut?

225
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,417
I hate the country.
I haven't Ieft Manhattan in 10 years.

226
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,683
-And you're proud of that?
-Everything you want is right here.

227
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:08,156
Culture, food, the Park,
cabs at 3:00 a.m. Why Ieave?

228
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,332
Perhaps to experience
a world outside Manhattan.

229
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,503
There is no world outside Manhattan.

230
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,467
I'd unwittingly set Miranda up
on a date with Manhattan Guy.

231
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,638
A genetically mutant strain
of single men that fed on Zabar's...

232
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,342
...and midnight shows at the Angelica.

233
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,845
No, thanks.

234
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,980
I Iike the city.

235
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,419
I also happen to Iike the country.
This does not make me a freak.

236
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,927
You're obviously not from here.

237
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,057
I have to go feed my cat.

238
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,069
Miranda had invoked our code phrase.

239
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,300
Honed over years of bad parties,
awful dates and unending phone calls.

240
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,707
Unfortunately, I wasn't ready
to accept defeat.

241
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,474
-I thought you already fed your cat.
-I have to feed it again.

242
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,183
Cat people are freaks.

243
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,415
-Where are you going?
-Home.

244
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,858
The man has not Ieft Manhattan
in a decade. He's obviously a freak.

245
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,590
And by the way, if Luke is a freak,
Ben is bound to be a freak, too.

246
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,657
You can tell everything about a person
by who their friends are.

247
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,730
God, I hope not.

248
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,684
That night, I couldn't get Miranda's
freaky comment out of my head.

249
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,663
Is there anything weird about you
I should know...

250
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,598
...before this gets any more compromising?

251
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,093
Now that you mention it, there is.

252
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,747
It's adorable.

253
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,822
It's a souvenir from a drunken
bachelor party a few years ago.

254
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,083
My friend's marriage didn't Iast,
but Tweety Bird did.

255
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,860
So what about you?

256
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,961
-You're probably perfect?
-No.

257
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,265
Three stitches.

258
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,474
I got into a fight with a third-grade bully.

259
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,742
You're scrappy.

260
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,981
I Iike scrappy.

261
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,551
And then The Amazing Tattooed Man
made love to me.

262
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,729
And it didn't feel weird at all.

263
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,695
While Miranda was busy
feeding her pussy...

264
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,998
...Charlotte was trying to do
everything but.

265
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,663
Did you ever go to summer camp?

266
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,831
There, over the exotic-fruit plate...

267
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,707
...Charlotte tried to make
a relationship happen.

268
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,976
I Ioved camp. I went to this place
in Maine called Minihaha.

269
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,852
We used to play these big games
of color war. I was always a Red.

270
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,045
It was so much fun.

271
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,092
And then they made us stop
because they said that it glorified warfare.

272
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,058
You're awfully quiet tonight.
What are you thinking about?

273
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:38,807
Charlotte realized Miranda was right.
She had stayed too long at the fair.

274
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,138
From that moment on, Charlotte
couldn't be in the same room with a fig.

275
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,979
Some people might call that a little odd.

276
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,245
Meanwhile, Samantha was about
to get her own special showing.

277
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,415
Voila.

278
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,551
I Iove it! What else can you do?

279
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,886
To Samantha,
surgery was like being at Barneys.

280
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,363
Once you're in the door,
you might as well shop.

281
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:06,132
We can always Iift a Iittle here.
Take care of these Iines.

282
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,900
Here....

283
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,940
In five years we can augment the breasts.

284
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,245
Pick them up a Iittle.
In 10 years, tummy tuck.

285
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,211
Lipo.

286
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,347
The hip and the thigh area.

287
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,322
Doctor, you're needed on the phone.

288
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,696
Knee Iift.

289
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,612
Samantha felt like
she had walked into a fun house.

290
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,270
Only it wasn't particularly funny.

291
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:14,099
I'm Iate for my soccer game.
Stay here. I'II be back in two hours.

292
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,205
It had happened.
We had done it and now I really liked him.

293
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:26,411
I was deep into the sex haze
and completely freaked out.

294
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,854
There had to be something
sick and off about him.

295
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:35,325
If the rest of the species had devolved,
Ben would have to be a freak to survive.

296
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,228
I had to find out what was wrong
before I wasted the next six months.

297
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,663
It started innocently enough.

298
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,792
I just wanted to see what the guy ate...

299
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,631
...Iistened to...

300
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,499
...dated.

301
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,165
Then it took on a life of its own.

302
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,711
Somewhere in this hip,
normal-looking apartment...

303
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,940
...was the clue to Ben 's inner freakiness.

304
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,605
And I wasn 't gonna rest until I found it.

305
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:20,596
There it was, taunting me.
Ben 's secret box of freakdom.

306
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:25,004
Home of illicit photos, love letters,
maybe an old marriage license.

307
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,492
What the hell are you doing?

308
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,567
I don't know.

309
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,834
I can't explain it.

310
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:58,843
I guess I was Iooking for something.

311
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,271
Something?

312
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,408
Something freaky.

313
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,892
It's my Cub Scout badge collection.

314
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,439
I was gonna skip the game to be with you.

315
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,474
I thought you were actually a normal one.

316
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,273
I was.

317
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,844
I'm gonna go.

318
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,080
Good idea.

319
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,627
That was the day
I came face to face with my freak.

320
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,534
The frightening woman
whose fear ate her sanity.

321
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,280
The truth is, it isn't just the men.
It's all of us.

322
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:14,011
Anyone who's single in Manhattan
gets a little freaked out from time to time.

323
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,249
But we keep trying,
because you have to figure...

324
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:22,316
...if the world's fattest twins can find love,
there's hope for all of us.

325
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:28,093
Somewhere out there is another little freak
who will love us, understand us...

326
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,593
...and kiss our three heads
and make it all better.

327
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,532
And in the meantime,
we always have Manhattan.
