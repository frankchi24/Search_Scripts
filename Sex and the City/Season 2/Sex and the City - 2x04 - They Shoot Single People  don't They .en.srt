1
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,977
In life,
certain events come along so rarely...

2
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,181
...that when they do,
special attention must be paid.

3
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,983
Events like Halley's comet, solar eclipses...

4
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,896
...getting that second latte for free.

5
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,256
One night at a salsa club
in very downtown Manhattan...

6
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,996
...four single girlfriends found
themselves without a relationship...

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,063
...at the exact same time.

8
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,210
She's not bad.

9
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,938
-Here's to us without men.
-Hear, hear.

10
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,803
I'm not toasting to that. It's bad Iuck.

11
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,479
If I end up old and alone, it's all your fault.

12
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,176
Sweetie, we're all alone,
even when we're with men.

13
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,979
You tell her, Mr. Sister.

14
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,781
My advice to you, is to embrace that fact...

15
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,449
...slap on some armor
and go through Iife Iike I do.

16
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,426
Enjoying men but not expecting them
to fill you up.

17
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,128
-Except when, well, you know....
-We know, we know.

18
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,495
Excuse me,
I was wondering if you'd Iike to dance.

19
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,470
Thanks, but tonight it's just us girls.

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,135
I'm William, one of the club owners.

21
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,636
Samantha.

22
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,278
If you ever feel Iike a dance,
we could have some fun.

23
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,016
I'm impressed, not dumping us for a guy.

24
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,076
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?

25
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,090
I'm going. I'm getting my picture taken
for the magazine article in the morning.

26
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,420
What magazine article?

27
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,357
AII press needs to be cleared through me.

28
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,621
New York Magazine.

29
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,163
They're doing a profile
of 20 Manhattan singles...

30
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,722
...and it's called "Single and Fabulous."

31
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,936
Why wasn't I picked?
I'm single and I'm definitely fabulous.

32
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,498
I was picked because Stanford's new
boyfriend is the assistant photo editor.

33
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,805
You can't Ieave. We never go dancing.

34
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,437
-Come on, one more drink.
-AII right, one drink.

35
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,706
To hot men.

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,947
One drink turned into many,
and before I knew it...

37
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,950
...I was dragging my tired, yet single
and fabulous ass home at dawn.

38
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,926
I decided my best bet
to avoid looking like I'd been up all night...

39
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,226
...was to stay up all morning.

40
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,735
It's Stanford. You're 40 minutes late.

41
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,297
I'm at the photo shoot
and everyone's freaking out!

42
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,240
-I'm there, 20 minutes.
-20 minutes!

43
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,744
I said 20 minutes!

44
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,911
I could not get a cab.

45
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,124
What did you do, Iet one drag you here?

46
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,953
Stop, I was up all night.
I need a coffee the size of my head.

47
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,389
-Carrie, this is Nevin.
-Gosh, hi.

48
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:56,162
Stanford has told me so much about you.
It's really nice to finally meet you.

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,000
Hello, you're about a fucking month Iate!

50
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,334
Follow me.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,801
Don't Iook at me, you're the one
who's about a fucking month Iate.

52
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,710
My poncho!

53
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,108
Hi, I'm so sorry.

54
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,275
-Could you sit?
-Sure.

55
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,016
There's gonna be time for makeup, right?

56
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,119
Thank God!

57
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,060
I wanna do a few test shots
before I check the Iighting.

58
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,323
Coffee.

59
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,199
-Do you mind if I smoke?
-I don't care if you shoot up.

60
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,503
I never keep people waiting.
I got to bed really Iate Iast night.

61
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,441
And it's my personal belief,
I Iapsed into a coma.

62
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,836
Thank you.

63
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,744
They only had decaf.

64
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,212
Being single and fabulous
also frees up one's weekends.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,725
Saturdays usually spent browsing with him
in Soho are left for practical things...

66
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,386
...Iike power walking with your single
and fabulous girlfriends.

67
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,556
We're walking too slow.
We're not burning off anything.

68
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,260
Let's gossip to get our heart rates up.

69
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,163
Miranda.

70
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,461
Josh, hi. How are you?

71
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,004
Good, great. Training for the Marathon.

72
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,940
Right, I forgot you do that.

73
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,839
Five years in a row.

74
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,875
You've got my number, give me a call.

75
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,610
Cute. Who's that?

76
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,452
An ophthalmologist
I once faked orgasms with.

77
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,657
We're officially stopping.

78
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,127
The idea that Miranda would fake anything
stopped me cold.

79
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,629
I only slept with him twice.

80
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,633
The first time I faked it
because it was never gonna happen.

81
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,295
The second time I faked it
because I did the first time.

82
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,359
Naturally.

83
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,669
I didn't wanna fake it again,
so I just forgot to return his call.

84
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,834
You broke up
with an ophthalmologist over that?

85
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,607
-Orgasm, major thing in a relationship?
-But not the only thing.

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,673
Orgasms don't send you Valentine's cards
and don't hold your hand in a sad movie.

87
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,775
Mine do.

88
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,944
You're seriously advocating faking?

89
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,548
No, but if you really Iike the guy,
what's one Iittle moment of....

90
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,854
...versus spending the whole night
in bed alone?

91
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,417
These are my options?

92
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,190
Who's to say that one moment is any
more important than when he gets up...

93
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,392
...and pours you a cup of coffee
in the morning?

94
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,332
Let's go!

95
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,270
I'II take an orgasm over a cup
of French drip Colombian any day.

96
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,341
For me, it's a toss-up.

97
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,599
The usual, please.

98
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,544
Having smoked all my cigarettes
during our workout...

99
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,979
...I stopped for fresh supplies when....

100
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,184
There I was...

101
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,125
...hanging right next to
Martha Stewart Living...

102
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,086
...Carrie Bradshaw,
dying of embarrassment.

103
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,827
"Single and Fabulous?"

104
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,426
There was no question mark implied.

105
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:49,134
I would never agree to be in an article,
"Single and Fabulous?"

106
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,807
I was set up.

107
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,812
I agree. You're single, fabulous and fucked.

108
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,041
Not after that picture I won't be.

109
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,549
They said, "Single and Fabulous!"

110
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,519
They did not say, "Single and Fabulous?"

111
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,517
That question mark is hostile.

112
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,489
Can't we sue them or something?

113
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,890
-For what, mis-punctuation?
-It's too Iate.

114
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,896
I'm all over the city Iooking Iike something
that got caught in a drain.

115
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,233
You know what? I just quit smoking.

116
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,064
"Single was fun at 20.
But you wanna ask these women:

117
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,900
"'How fun will all night
club hopping be at 40?"'

118
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,940
-Who's out all night?
-Who's 40?

119
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,272
Do you know what I say,
"Fuck them, exclamation point!"

120
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,608
-Fuck them!
-Fuck them!

121
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,245
Charlotte said, "Fuck."

122
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,011
Every couple of years,
an article Iike this surfaces...

123
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,951
...as a cautionary tale
to scare young women into marriage.

124
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,989
I'm a cautionary tale? Shoot me.

125
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,651
"Filling their Iives with an endless parade
of decoys and distractions...

126
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,718
"...to avoid the painful fact
that they're completely alone."

127
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,286
How is that helping?

128
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,064
This piece of trash has nothing,
I repeat, nothing to do with us.

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,299
-Exactly, we are single and fabulous.
-Absolutely.

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,373
But I had a sneaking suspicion
they didn't quite believe it.

131
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:02,213
Somehow, the question mark had leapt
off my cover and on to each of them.

132
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,340
Because, within a week...

133
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,748
...Miranda met Josh for old time's sake.

134
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,818
Samantha met William for a dance.

135
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,454
And Charlotte met a deadline head-on.

136
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,431
So, I'm moving to Salt Lake City.

137
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,633
What? Why?

138
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,899
The acting thing in New York
is definitely not happening.

139
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,032
I've a chance to get on a Christian
soap opera if I move out West.

140
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,441
A Christian soap opera?

141
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,874
The Days of our Mormon Lives
or some shit.

142
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,507
Hand me that receiver cable.

143
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,645
The....

144
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,282
What'II you do around here without me?

145
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,691
Tom was an out of work actor friend
Charlotte had come to depend on...

146
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,720
...to do the occasional male things
she needed done around her apartment.

147
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,790
Because he was an out of work actor,
he had a lot of time.

148
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,770
And because he had a lot of time,
he had a lot of tools.

149
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,098
Okay.

150
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,968
That is the VCR.

151
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,342
After I rewire your Iamp, I'm out of here.

152
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,280
Unless you have something
else you need done.

153
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,182
Charlotte made a decision.

154
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,748
She decided she wasn't gonna let
her Mr. Fix-It get away.

155
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,989
While women are certainly
no strangers to faking it...

156
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,556
...we faked our hair color, cup-size.
Hell, we've even faked fur.

157
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,535
I couldn 't help but wonder,
has fear of being alone...

158
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,868
...suddenly raised the bar on faking?

159
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,301
Are we faking more than orgasms?

160
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,139
Are we faking entire relationships?

161
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,940
Is it better to fake it than be alone?

162
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,284
My boyfriend and I were really compatible
except for one thing:

163
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,820
He Iiked thin, blond, Waspy types. So...

164
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,283
...now I am.

165
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,948
I think my wife's an idiot.

166
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,016
Every day with her
is Iike a trip to Idiot Island.

167
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,091
I don't tell her how I really feel.
I'm pretty sure she'd Ieave me.

168
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,933
I don't understand sign Ianguage.

169
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,640
A glamorous city like New York
offers a sea of single and fabulous things...

170
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,804
...for the fabulous and single to do.

171
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,337
As Iong as the magazine's on newsstands,
I'm not going out in public...

172
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,850
...for fear of being scorned
and chased with sticks.

173
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,547
One, one! I'm not smoking.

174
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,814
Look.

175
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,620
He climbs on top of her,
next thing you know, she's coming.

176
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,127
No wonder they're Iost, they've no idea
there's more work involved.

177
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,824
Still faking it?

178
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,928
-Is he that bad in bed?
-No, he's just....

179
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,401
He's a guy.

180
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,928
They can rebuild a jet engine,
but when it comes to a woman....

181
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,067
What's the big mystery?
It's my clitoris, not the Sphinx!

182
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,668
You just found the title
for your autobiography.

183
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,840
It's really not their fault.
They don't come with a manual.

184
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,440
If I had a son,
I'd teach him all about the vagina.

185
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,509
If you had a son, we'd call social services.

186
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,248
The other night, he told me...

187
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,189
...he really Iikes that I can come
while he's fucking me.

188
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,783
How can he believe that that's all it takes?

189
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,590
Because you're faking it!

190
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,457
I'm really hating myself right now.

191
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,959
Could you please just tell me why?

192
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,867
He's a nice guy. He means well.

193
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,795
It's codependent coming.

194
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,637
Well, I have to go. I got a date.

195
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,268
I'm meeting William after work,
and then, who knows?

196
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,182
From the way he dances, I'm fairly certain
I won't have to fake anything.

197
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,418
This is a great club.

198
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,253
Wait until you see my club
in the Hamptons.

199
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,791
Salsa East.

200
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,453
-Do you Iike the Hamptons?
-No, Iove...

201
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,625
...Iove the Hamptons.

202
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,164
I'm renting a great house in East Hampton.

203
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,167
We can go out on the weekends.

204
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,593
We can go sailing...

205
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,334
...and cook big Iobsters.

206
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,570
We can walk on the beach....

207
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,171
At first Samantha listened,
fascinated, detached.

208
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:59,047
It was rare to hear a man use
the "we" word, so comfortably so early on.

209
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,780
Or, we could just Iay around and do this.

210
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,349
Whatever we want.

211
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,957
Pretty soon she gave in.

212
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,656
She lay back,
opened up and let the "we" wash over her.

213
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,431
Hello.

214
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,774
Guess where I'm spending the summer?

215
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,474
-I don't know, Gucci?
-East Hampton.

216
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,574
William's renting a house
and he's inviting me for the summer.

217
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,211
-Isn't it a Iittle early?
-Honey, no.

218
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,051
AII the great places are taken by January.

219
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,217
I mean, early in the relationship.

220
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,925
You should have heard him Iast night.
"We" can cook, "we" can swim.

221
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,428
He's a "we" guy.

222
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,093
So he's a "we" guy, who cares?

223
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,300
"We" are going to spend
the summer in East Hampton.

224
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,133
And the "we" I'm referring to right now...

225
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,172
...is you and me.

226
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,607
They say that every great actor
knows when to stop performing.

227
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,078
I'm getting close. Come with me.

228
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,041
Come with me.

229
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,952
For Miranda,
it was that Saturday night at exactly 10:40.

230
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,714
Come with....

231
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,393
God.

232
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,706
Is everything all right?

233
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,373
Are you sure? You didn't come.

234
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,708
Did you?

235
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,035
No.

236
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:41,510
Did I do something wrong tonight,
because you came every other time.

237
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,626
What? Tell me.

238
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,962
I didn't exactly come all those other times.

239
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,589
You faked it?

240
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,664
How many of the other times?

241
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,535
AII of the other times?

242
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,509
Do you have a physical problem
or something?

243
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,870
What makes you assume it's me?

244
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,338
No offense, it's just....

245
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,384
Nobody I've ever slept with
has had to fake it.

246
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,215
A Iot of women fake it
and until five minutes ago...

247
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,915
...you didn't know I was faking it, so....

248
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,480
What are you saying?

249
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,686
AII the women I've slept with
have been faking it?

250
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,434
What are you Iooking at?

251
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,730
Nothing, I was just running
a Iist in my head.

252
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,569
Look, Josh.

253
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,374
A woman's anatomy
is a Iittle more complicated--

254
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,241
I know all about a woman's anatomy.
I'm a doctor.

255
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,109
You're an eye doctor.

256
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,882
Give me some tips.

257
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,180
-Pardon me?
-Tips to get you off.

258
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,818
I am nobody's charity case.
I run the Marathon for Christ's sake.

259
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,428
Do you know how the clitoris works?

260
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,485
Yes.

261
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,155
-Do you know where it is?
-Yes.

262
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,826
It's about two inches
from where you think it is.

263
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,268
-My God.
-Relax, I'II show you.

264
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,765
Later that week, I went over to Charlotte's
to see some of Tom's handiwork.

265
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,870
After we finish with the Iighting,
we'II move to the kitchen.

266
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,710
We're retiling everything.

267
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,218
First Samantha and now Charlotte went
"we, " "we, " all about her home.

268
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,687
That's amazing! How will you
get all that done before you Ieave?

269
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,348
I'm not Ieaving.

270
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,521
I've decided to stay.

271
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,487
I have to go to my place
and get a voltmeter.

272
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,620
Okay.

273
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,660
-I'II be right back, okay?
-Bye, honey.

274
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,664
"Bye, honey?"

275
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,641
When he told me he was Ieaving,
I suddenly had feelings...

276
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,768
...what if he was the one?

277
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,746
He'd been under my nose the entire time
and I'd never even seen him.

278
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,979
I Iet the "almost-40-out-of-work-actor"
thing get in the way.

279
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,117
He is strong and masculine...

280
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,622
...and he can fix things around the house.

281
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,589
You can't create a relationship with a guy
just because he can caulk your tub.

282
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,493
Yes, you can.

283
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,500
As I walked home,
I couldn't help but wonder...

284
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,562
...when did being alone become the
modern day equivalent of being a leper?

285
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,666
Will Manhattan restaurants
soon be divided up into sections?

286
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,678
Smoking, non-smoking, single, non-single?

287
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,375
The usual, please.

288
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,550
Then I had a frightening thought.

289
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,747
Maybe I was the one who was faking it.

290
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,987
All these years faking to myself
that I was happy being single.

291
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,992
Yes, it's me.

292
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,001
And there it was, pity.

293
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,136
Pity from the man
who sells me my Marlboro Lights.

294
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,203
It was the final straw.

295
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:53,207
I decided I wasn 't gonna let a magazine
or my friends or the Surgeon General...

296
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,303
...stop me from being who I was:

297
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,248
Single and fabulous, exclamation point.

298
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,842
-Tartini?
-Excuse me?

299
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,816
Tartini: cranberry flavored vodka.

300
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,347
I've been out of commission for four days
and there's a new drink?

301
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,520
I invited Stanford to join me
at a fabulous party downtown...

302
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,088
...to honor the fabulous conceptual
photographer Ellen von Unwerth.

303
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,400
Unfortunately, he invited
his new boyfriend, Nevin "von Bitchy."

304
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,400
-Hi, I hate you.
-Join the club, I hate me, too.

305
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,465
I'm so sorry about the cover.
I had nothing to do with it.

306
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,407
Who cares?

307
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,571
Next week you'II have a coke-dealing
slumlord on the cover.

308
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,012
You are fabulous.

309
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,548
Excuse me.

310
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,518
You realize you'II have to dump him.

311
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,556
I can't. We're getting a summer share
in Sagaponack.

312
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,653
Tartini!

313
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,923
While Stanford and I did downtown...

314
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,929
...Samantha was uptown waiting for
William at her favorite romantic restaurant.

315
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,131
AIone?

316
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,800
No, I'm waiting for someone.

317
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,742
At first she thought
she had the wrong time.

318
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,476
When he still wasn't there
20 minutes later, she called her machine.

319
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,983
No message.

320
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,349
I don't know what's keeping him.

321
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,019
Could you ask the waiter
to bring me a red wine?

322
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,150
She hadn't expected
to be caught out in public alone...

323
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,925
...without a book, project,
or any of her "dining-out-alone-armor. "

324
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,458
She had nothing to do
but sit and wait for him.

325
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,469
By now she knew that "we" William
wasn 't ever gonna show up.

326
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,008
He was one of those men
who faked a future...

327
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,636
...to get what he wanted in the present.

328
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,541
More water?

329
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,775
No. No more water.

330
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,414
She felt exposed, vulnerable, like a fool.

331
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,520
My God, people are Iooking.

332
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,220
-I'm so embarrassed.
-It's okay.

333
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,723
-Where's the Iadies' room?
-This way.

334
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,425
Show me the way.

335
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,936
You okay?

336
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,403
Thank you. You're very sweet.

337
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,105
I'm not usually Iike this.

338
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,379
I can't believe I fell for some guy's Iine.

339
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,607
But sometimes you just need to hear "we."

340
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,150
You know?

341
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,181
Samantha let the Pakistani busboy
kiss her.

342
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,395
After all, he'd been so sweet
and attentive with the bread.

343
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,624
You take me home, you're not alone.

344
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,493
As Samantha looked into his sweet
and hopeful eyes, she realized something.

345
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,504
No matter how much it hurts...

346
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,735
...sometimes it's better
to be alone than fake it.

347
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,222
Meanwhile, downtown,
I heard the funniest thing...

348
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,661
...I'd ever heard from a man I just met.

349
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,722
My God. I'm sorry, your pants.

350
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,061
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

351
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,034
Well, fuck you.

352
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,031
Exclamation point.

353
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:14,110
Okay, you Iittle Tartini.
Time to go home. You've had enough.

354
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,372
-C'mon, it's early.
-It's 2:00 a.m. on a Tuesday.

355
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,145
Just go. Go, go, go home.

356
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,945
Take your tired, fabulous ass home.

357
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,682
I want to meet cute guys.

358
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,589
Everyone here is gay, gay, gay.

359
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,220
I don't think so.

360
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,466
Need a Iight?

361
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,267
His name was Jake.

362
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,042
He was everything
I was looking for that night.

363
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,174
Single, straight and a smoker.

364
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,786
There wasn't quite as much smoke uptown.

365
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,085
How's that? Is that better now?

366
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,924
How about now?

367
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,619
Miranda's two-day tutorial
with her ophthalmologist...

368
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,823
...had turned lovemaking
into a kind of naked eye exam.

369
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,163
Maybe we should just try
and Iet it happen for a second.

370
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,960
I wanna do it right.

371
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,629
How's that?

372
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,903
Even with all Josh's good intentions,
Miranda found herself no closer.

373
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,738
She realized she was not a jet engine.

374
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,373
She was a lot more complicated.
It would never work between them.

375
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,612
I'm close, are you close? I'm close.

376
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,554
She wanted to give him something
for learning so much and trying so hard.

377
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,921
So, Miranda came.

378
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,628
She came out of retirement
for one final performance.

379
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,496
I'm the man.

380
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,711
-Wanna go for a ride in my Porsche?
-Fabulous.

381
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,985
I need some smokes.

382
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,120
Do you want anything?

383
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,463
I'II be right back.

384
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,511
How you doing?
I want a pack of Marlboro Lights.

385
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,975
I looked at myself in the mirror.

386
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,518
What had I been so afraid of all week?

387
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,279
I was still young, still desirable.

388
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,587
I would never wind up alone.

389
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,226
Is this you?

390
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,424
And there it was.

391
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,292
My question mark staring me
right in the face.

392
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,400
Was that me?

393
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:55,864
If I went home with him, it'd be the only
time I'd ever had sex to validate my life.

394
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,799
The question mark would no longer
be a question, it would be a fact.

395
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:03,212
-I gotta go home.
-No way, I'm not Ietting you out.

396
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,477
Fine.

397
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,929
I think I should go to Salt Lake City.
Give it a try.

398
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,826
No, really?

399
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,400
Charlotte was faking it.

400
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,803
She'd realized two days ago,
while she had no problem faking orgasms...

401
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,171
...she could never fake intimacy.

402
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,701
My heart's still in acting.
I'm not ready to Iet it go.

403
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,345
Tom was faking, too.

404
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,351
He was mostly just sick of New York
and needed an excuse to leave.

405
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,319
I'II miss you.

406
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,017
I'II miss you, too.

407
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,059
It was a perfectly timed double fake.

408
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,325
Under other circumstances,
they could've shared a long life together.

409
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,693
Over the next week,
things returned to normal.

410
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,237
Miranda, babe, it's Josh.
I'm home. Give me a call.

411
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,133
Miranda forgot to return Josh 's last call.

412
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,009
Samantha made peace
with her feelings about "we" William.

413
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,780
And Charlotte learned you don 't
have to rely on men 's affections...

414
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,979
...to get things fixed around the house.

415
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,248
You can pay them.

416
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,085
As for me, after I was recycled...

417
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,124
...I decided instead of running away
from the idea of a life alone...

418
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,721
...I'd better sit down
and take that fear to lunch.

419
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,289
-Waiting for someone?
-No, it's just me.

420
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,567
Thanks.

421
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,765
So, I sat there and had a glass of wine...

422
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,301
...alone.

423
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,503
No books, no man, no friends, no armor...

424
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,871
...no faking.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
