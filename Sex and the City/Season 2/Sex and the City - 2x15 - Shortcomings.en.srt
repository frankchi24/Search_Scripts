1
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,010
Everyone has a worst nightmare.

2
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,984
For some, it's bathing-suit season.

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,355
For others, it's that your birth certificate
can never be legally destroyed.

4
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,987
For Miranda, it was family hour at her gym.

5
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,821
What the....

6
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,640
Kiddy Jazzercise,
Aerobics Room 1, five minutes.

7
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:20,670
On Sundays, her neighborhood became
occupied territory under siege to children.

8
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,975
They were everywhere:

9
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,881
Movie theaters, restaurants,
bookstores, hair salons....

10
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,943
Starbucks was basically
a stroller parking lot.

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,252
Was it too much to hope
for one small space to call her own?

12
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,086
Don't touch it, please!

13
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,692
Is there a problem?

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,700
No, it's just that
he really Iikes to push the button.

15
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,061
Fine, I'm in kind of a rush. Push One.

16
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,702
Simon, this pretty Iady said
that you could push the button.

17
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,436
-So sorry.
-I'm sure it's just a phase.

18
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:59,012
Yeah, the guilty, overindulgent
phase of a D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,590
-Daddy.
-Simon, we're not being very nice to....

20
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:15,032
-That sounds Iike a princess name.
-Stop talking.

21
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,204
I'm going to bite you.

22
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,673
-Do you want to go to the toy store Iater?
-Yes.

23
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,573
Then don't bite me.

24
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,474
I am in violation
of every parenting book ever written.

25
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,116
-Do you have kids?
-No.

26
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,346
Married?

27
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,588
-Here we are.
-At Iast.

28
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,894
Any chance I could persuade you
to take another ride?

29
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,802
His name was Roger Cobb.

30
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:58,207
It only took him another floor and a half
to ask Miranda for her phone number.

31
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,576
The whole thing might have been
very romantic...

32
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,740
...if Simon hadn 't peed in his pants.

33
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:07,149
I don't wear vintage clothes,
I hate flea markets, I don't collect antiques.

34
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,417
Is it too much to ask that he not be,
I don't know, used?

35
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,824
Before it goes any further, just make sure
his parts are still under warranty.

36
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,963
-It's Iike chewing somebody else's gum.
-Divorced men do come with baggage.

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,660
Baggage is one thing.
But when they come with kids....

38
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,998
Especially kids with bladder control issues.

39
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,501
Here's what I think.

40
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,735
Round up all the divorced men
and keep them in a pound.

41
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,834
That way, you get their whole history
before you take one home.

42
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,573
If a man is divorced,
it doesn't mean he has a problem.

43
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,912
Like my brother Wesley.
He just separated from his wife, Leslie--

44
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,120
-Wesley and Leslie? I don't think so.
-What is that, marriage by Mother Goose?

45
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,558
Definitely a candidate for the pound.

46
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:51,154
I was going to ask you to meet him 'cause
he's coming to visit, and now forget it.

47
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,667
We want to meet Wesley
of Wesley and Leslie.

48
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,201
And p.s., does he work for Nestle?

49
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,568
My brother's very important to me.

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,370
I won't have him subjected
to scrutiny and ridicule.

51
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,577
-I'II be Scrutiny. You be Ridicule.
-I always have to be Ridicule.

52
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,478
Why can't you be Ridicule for once?

53
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,538
I know.

54
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,887
As for me, rather than sort
through the half-off bin...

55
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,513
...I was dating
someone brand-spanking new.

56
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,126
I met Vaughn Weisel at a P.E.N. Iuncheon
a month ago.

57
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,752
It's amazing how much better looking
fiction writers have become.

58
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,059
Still up for a movie?

59
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,125
I just gotta drop these books
by my parent's place. It's on the way.

60
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,364
-GQ called.
-They want you to write something?

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,465
They want me to wear something.

62
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,205
It's so great to be a writer these days,
there's so Iittle writing involved.

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,510
Don't be photographed
in anything sleeveless.

64
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,278
No one who went sleeveless
ever won a Pulitzer.

65
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,819
It's just a Iittle tip from me to you.

66
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,921
Nice townhouse.

67
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,516
-Come on in, this will only take a second.
-I'm not dressed for family.

68
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,029
Can you just drop them
through the mail slot?

69
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,122
If I'm here and I don't say hello...

70
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,930
...I'm Iooking at two months minimum
hard family time.

71
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,232
AII right. Yeah, okay.

72
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,131
Thank you.

73
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,939
Mother, I swear, you are the only person
who can kill a cactus.

74
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,672
This is Carrie.

75
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:20,048
Tell your sister to stop bringing me plants.
They get suicidal around me.

76
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,679
I have to talk them down from the Iedge.

77
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,789
-Those books you asked me to sign....
-Duncan, Vaughn's here.

78
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,424
And he brought a girl!

79
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,055
-Hi. Wallis Weisel...
-Hi.

80
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,325
-Have we met?
-No, I don't think so. Carrie Bradshaw.

81
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,337
My God. Duncan, get your ass in here.

82
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,934
I just Iove your column.

83
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,272
I Iove to hear that.

84
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,249
-Mom, we can't stay.
-The hell you can't.

85
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,616
You know what you should write about?
Re-virginization.

86
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,618
Did you know there are women
who are actually having...

87
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,319
...their vaginas re-stitched
to make them Iike new again?

88
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,389
Aren't they clever?

89
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:07,194
If you're wondering, Mom just finished
a documentary on genital mutilation.

90
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,427
Which I still haven't gotten your notes on.

91
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,164
I told you, I can't bring myself
to Iook at that thing.

92
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:17,073
And I typed all his short stories for him
when he was 12. Duncan, Iook.

93
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,676
Do you know who this is?
Carrie Bradshaw.

94
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,409
-She writes that column we Iove.
-What are you doing Thursday night?

95
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,651
Laundry.

96
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,379
I teach a seminar at Columbia
on Cultural Zeitgeist.

97
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,217
I'd Iove to have you come speak.

98
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,384
Mr. Self-Involved here
didn't tell us he was dating an icon.

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,623
-Icon?
-You are an icon. You are.

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,526
-Who brought a girl?
-This is my other sister.

101
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,330
Franny, this is Carrie.

102
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,096
-What's up?
-What's up?

103
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,729
-Hey, mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

104
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,566
Franny and Zooey?

105
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,936
What can I say?
J.D. Salinger used to get me high.

106
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,981
And then she'd call me at 3:00 a.m.,
"I Iove you."

107
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,945
Good for you.
Beautiful and she thinks I'm funny.

108
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,616
You're hilarious. Put your tongue back
in your head and the Iox on the table.

109
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,251
Come on, everybody,
Iet's have something to eat.

110
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,788
-We have to go.
-Come on, please.

111
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,999
We'II stay.

112
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,733
I mean, really,
within the space of five minutes...

113
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,538
...I had next week's column, an invitation
to speak at an Ivy League university...

114
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,670
...and access
to the entire Zabar's fish counter.

115
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,781
Leave now? Was he nuts?

116
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,450
Have you ever gone out
with someone who had a kid?

117
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,050
No, but I've never gone out with someone
I met on an elevator either.

118
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,594
That's a first for me, too.

119
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,688
I met a woman on an escalator once,
but it didn't Iast Iong.

120
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,359
It was over by the time
we got to Ladies Lingerie.

121
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,369
I dated a man once
who wore Iadies' Iingerie.

122
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,100
That was kind of the problem there.
I'm kidding.

123
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:00,277
-'Cause I'm wearing panties now.
-You're kidding, right?

124
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,208
Look what I found.

125
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,512
-Can you say you're sorry?
-No!

126
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,813
Are you okay?

127
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,880
Fortunately, I mostly use
the right side of my brain.

128
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,256
It must be hard,
having a social Iife as a single parent.

129
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,229
It is, I got to buy protective helmets
for all my dates.

130
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,698
Where's mine, by the way?

131
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,535
The truth is, I didn't really have
a great social Iife before Simon either.

132
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,805
I'm just one of those weird male
aberrations who prefers to be married.

133
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:39,941
I Iike stability and routine. I Iike knowing
there's people waiting for me at home.

134
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,085
-I guess that makes me sound pretty dull.
-Are you kidding?

135
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,091
You're the Heterosexual Holy Grail.

136
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:53,361
Miranda wondered how a vintage man
might look on her modern couch.

137
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,193
-Here.
-Thank you.

138
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,631
Probably not the best time
to ask you to dinner.

139
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,208
While Miranda was dealing
with queasiness...

140
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,337
...Charlotte was handling depression...

141
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,644
...which she felt could be solved
with a homemade muffin.

142
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,116
Here you go. Just Iike Nana used to make.

143
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,085
Charlie, the muffins are great,
but I'd much prefer a nice dry martini.

144
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,556
But Nana always made muffins
to cheer you up.

145
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,955
That was pre-Leslie. Post-Leslie,
I need a cocktail. Where's your vodka?

146
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,188
-I don't have any.
-And you call yourself a Wasp.

147
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:32,167
I don't see why you two can't work it out,
you had the most beautiful wedding.

148
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,170
We'II have an even Iovelier divorce.

149
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,903
I can't believe you're willing
to just throw it all away so easily.

150
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,037
Relationships take work.
You need patience and understanding.

151
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,546
When was your Iast
Iong-term relationship?

152
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,417
Just eat your muffin.

153
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,193
The afternoon had been
like six hours of foreplay.

154
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,098
Some men seduce
with dim lights and soft music.

155
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,340
Vaughn seduced
with chocolate chip cookies and relatives.

156
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,551
It was inevitable this would happen.

157
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,150
I just didn't know
it would happen so quickly.

158
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,122
I'II get a tissue.

159
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,875
Get out now,
before he stains all your sheets.

160
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,144
Come on, that's harsh.
It could be he was just nervous.

161
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,684
First time is always weird.

162
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,347
-He probably had something to drink.
-We'd spent the day with his family.

163
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,583
The guy could not get
his Cadillac into the garage.

164
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,560
I'm sorry, I hate being right about this.

165
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,028
Samantha was the General Patton of sex.

166
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,900
She didn't send her troops
into battle if she thought they would lose.

167
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,124
I Iike him.

168
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,135
That's swell, but it doesn't
get the cream in the cupcake.

169
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,673
But the thing I Iike best about him
is his family.

170
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,140
Anyone there you can fuck?

171
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,637
What? I'm trying to be helpful.

172
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,273
I'm telling you, this family is Iike....
They got charisma.

173
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,943
Like Tom Cruise,
they're the Tom Cruise of families.

174
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,421
I'm sure the family is supposed
to be the obstacle to a relationship...

175
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,787
...not the attraction.

176
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,326
I fucked a guy once
because his family had a pool.

177
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,994
He was pretty much of a nerd, but I'd go
over there and get all cocoa-buttered up.

178
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,399
His mom Ioved me. She was always
serving me Kool-Aid and chips.

179
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,302
-Kool-Aid?
-Yeah, Kool-Aid, I was 13.

180
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,932
And honey, you should have seen my tan.

181
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,876
In my mind, the complications of making
a relationship work...

182
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,346
...had just expanded exponentially.

183
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,080
When you date someone, how many
people become emotionally involved?

184
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:05,248
When you sleep with someone,
are you screwing the family?

185
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,891
While I was still on the fence
about Vaughn...

186
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,623
...I had no doubt about
my feeling for his mother.

187
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,358
I was in love with her.

188
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,595
Then we were in Nicaragua
with the Peace Corps.

189
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,565
That's where Vaughn was born.

190
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,004
I can't get over it. You've had five Iives.

191
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,071
I can barely make one happen.

192
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,007
Don't pull that self-effacing shit with me.

193
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,605
I see you. I know what you've got going.

194
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,414
What? What do I do?
I write this Iittle column.

195
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,887
It's a contribution.
You are putting it out there.

196
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,588
You're part of a dialogue.

197
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,183
If it wasn't for you...

198
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,857
...we wouldn't know half the things we do
about other people's sex Iives.

199
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,234
-Thanks a Iot.
-I'm teasing.

200
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,864
No, it's wonderful
to be frank and honest about sex.

201
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:59,638
That's how I raised my kids.
Sex was always a part of the discussion.

202
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,239
When they were 2 years old, they knew
the proper names for their body parts.

203
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,648
None of this "pee-pee"
and "wee-wee" crap.

204
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:11,247
And as a result,
they can talk to me about anything.

205
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,683
When Franny told me she was a Iesbian...

206
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,751
...I said, "Great, just as Iong
as you're not a Republican."

207
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:23,763
-May I just say I Iike you very much.
-That's dear, thank you.

208
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,464
Did you talk to Leslie today?

209
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,408
No. I talked to her Iawyer.
Do you want to know about that?

210
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,537
I'm giving her the house
and she's giving me an ulcer.

211
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,174
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Tonight we'II have fun.

212
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,184
You'II finally meet my friend Carrie.

213
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,686
We'II go out, have dinner,
maybe go to a club....

214
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,744
Shit.

215
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,762
This is my wonderful brother, Wesley.

216
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,236
-Nice to meet you.
-Good Iooks run in the family.

217
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,769
-Can I get you Iadies a drink?
-Cosmopolitan.

218
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:02,896
Ditto.

219
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,202
-How are you enjoying New York?
-Excuse us.

220
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,609
Why is she here?

221
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,283
That's our friend.
I believe you remember Samantha.

222
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,518
You know how she gets.
Look! She's doing it already.

223
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,182
They're talking.

224
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,829
Samantha says there's
a great jazz bar that we should go to.

225
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:32,199
-I just don't think I'm up for it tonight.
-Then maybe we'II just go.

226
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,139
Talking and going to hear jazz.

227
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,644
I think I have your son's SIinky
embedded in my back.

228
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,682
I Iike to brand my women.

229
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,718
I'm going to use the bathroom,
and then I really will go.

230
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,894
-Daddy?
-No, Simon!

231
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,529
Daddy!

232
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,029
Shit.

233
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,873
I'm sorry. I was peeing,
and I didn't want him to see me.

234
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,974
I was afraid he'd see me...

235
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,578
...and then he'd be drawing pictures for
a child psychologist and nobody's happy.

236
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,715
-I'II get a Band-Aid.
-He's hurt. He might need a stitch.

237
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,553
-I'II go with you to the emergency room.
-No!

238
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,690
Just go.

239
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,397
PIease, just go.

240
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,231
One thing about families...

241
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:42,502
...if no one's sorry to see you go,
then you're probably not coming back.

242
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,842
The next morning,
Charlotte was in for a rude awakening.

243
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,947
Where do you keep your coffee filters?

244
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,511
Just tell me if I'm warm.

245
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,479
My brother? You slept with my brother?

246
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,648
Honey, what a doll. He really--

247
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,228
Is your vagina
in the New York City guidebooks?

248
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,198
It should be, it's the hottest spot in town!
It's always open!

249
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,035
What's going on?

250
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,538
What did you say?

251
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,012
She was in my kitchen,
she was wearing your shirt, I snapped.

252
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,821
Who asked you to butt your nose
into my.... Samantha, wait! Don't go!

253
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,557
I didn't know your mom
was nominated for an Oscar.

254
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,461
Best Documentary Short.

255
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,634
I just Iove that she still has
so many ambitions for herself.

256
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,232
I'm not really in the mood
to talk about my mom.

257
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,444
I'm not really in the mood to talk at all.

258
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,252
Don't touch it!

259
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,684
What was the documentary short
about anyway?

260
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,151
Good, you're back.

261
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,553
I swear to God, if you hand me a muffin,
I'm out of here.

262
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,264
You don't know Samantha. I do.

263
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,290
She has so many notches on her bedpost,
it's almost whittled down to a toothpick.

264
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,734
It was fun.

265
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,328
I know.

266
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,102
You had your Iittle fling, now you can
go back to Leslie and work it out.

267
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,942
We're not working it out.
You think you know Wesley and Leslie?

268
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,205
Let me tell you about Wesley and Leslie.

269
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,946
Leslie's frigid and before Iast night,
Wesley hadn't gotten Iaid in two years.

270
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,119
-My God.
-I was going out of my mind.

271
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,249
I've seen a pastor. I've seen a shrink.

272
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,955
But until I saw Samantha,
I didn't realize what I really needed: sex.

273
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,959
-So it was a good thing.
-It was a frigging great thing.

274
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,398
That Samantha....

275
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,127
You've really got a good friend there.

276
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,838
It's Charlotte.

277
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,556
-That was a terrible thing I said.
-Yes, it was.

278
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,221
If you'II excuse me...

279
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,625
...I have another tour group coming
through my vagina in 10 minutes.

280
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,993
I'm so sorry.

281
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,158
-You said what you came to say?
-Wait!

282
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,102
I wanted to give you this.

283
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,743
Samantha was touched.

284
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,907
She realized
this was Charlotte's way of saying...

285
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,550
"... Thank you for fucking my brother. "

286
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,984
Get in there.

287
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,885
Hey, kids! Funtastics on Three.

288
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,924
Miranda decided she had ceded
enough territory to the invading troops.

289
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,499
Do you mind?
He really Ioves to push the button.

290
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,267
Yeah? So do I.

291
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,150
That is so sexy.

292
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,645
You in bed with my book.

293
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,950
It's really great.

294
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,895
-Do that again.
-What, turn the page?

295
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,094
Baby.

296
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,497
Again.

297
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,507
Wait, stop.

298
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,083
Let's just take this nice and slow.

299
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:29,250
You tell me if you're feeling too excited
and we'II take a Iittle break.

300
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,489
Why?

301
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,489
Because I think we both
really want this to work.

302
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,098
I Iove that you get so turned on by me...

303
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,240
...and I am very turned on by you.

304
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,347
Maybe we've just been
in too much of a rush.

305
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,381
-Forget it.
-No, I don't want to forget it. Come here.

306
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,021
-Let's talk about it.
-No! I don't want to talk about it.

307
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,083
I think we have to.

308
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,056
Why does everything have to be about sex!
I am so sick of talking about sex.

309
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,725
I've been talking about it since I was 2.

310
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,795
So Iet's go.

311
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,197
My parents are expecting us.

312
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,469
Duncan and I went down to
the Neil Simon Theater and spent $65--

313
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,570
$75.

314
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,908
To see a British movie star
simulate a blowjob.

315
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,642
I wonder if that's what Neil had in mind.

316
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,424
-Did she show her tits?
-No. How's the pickled herring?

317
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,292
It's very good.

318
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,523
Franny tells me that you two
are going camping this weekend.

319
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,224
-Where's the scallion cream cheese?
-It's out there on the table.

320
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,463
I don't see it.

321
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,333
Then check the refrigerator.

322
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,341
-Why is he so edgy?
-I have no idea.

323
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,508
-Don't Iet him pull that moody shit on you.
-I know. It's such a pose.

324
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:01,348
Since he got published,
he's suddenly this tortured artist.

325
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,650
-Where's the cream cheese?
-It's out there.

326
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,933
Why buy this shit if you can't remember
the one thing that holds it all together?

327
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,001
Let's deal with what's really upsetting you.
Shall we?

328
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,676
If everything's on the table, why don't we
start with some scallion cream cheese?

329
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:39,085
Jenna and I looked at each other
like two foreigners without visas.

330
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:47,194
You know what, I think I'd better go.
I've got a deadline.

331
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:56,306
I'II go. Thank you for Iunch, for everything.

332
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,681
What happened?
Everything was going so well.

333
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,647
It really wasn't.

334
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,453
I know what it is.
His Iast girlfriend wasn't as discreet.

335
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,394
I don't want to get in the irony.
He writes short stories.

336
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,665
This has officially become too weird.

337
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,895
Really, in a situation Iike this,
you gotta Iaugh.

338
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,907
AII right, it's a problem.
But you'II work it out.

339
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,339
He won't even talk about it.

340
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,675
-You want me to talk to him?
-No.

341
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:46,148
-I can't discuss this with you.
-You can! You and I can discuss anything.

342
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,653
So your sex Iife isn't so great. So what?

343
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,256
Seventy-seven percent
of all marriages are sexless.

344
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,597
Other things are so much more important,
Iike family.

345
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,901
Then I saw that the person I really
had to break up with wasn't Vaughn.

346
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,704
It was his mother.

347
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:12,212
I would still Iike us to be friends.
No, I mean that.

348
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,987
And what happens
when you meet somebody else?

349
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:19,521
I can tell you now, they won't have
a mother Iike me. You know that.

350
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:26,189
You know that we have something.
What we have is very special.

351
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,962
AII right, well.

352
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,465
Call me sometime.

353
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,310
-I will.
-Sweetie.

354
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,614
Wallis was right. The most
important thing in life is your family.

355
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,519
There are days you love them,
and others you don't.

356
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:57,460
But in the end, they're the people
you always come home to.

357
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,997
Sometimes it's the family you're born into.

358
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:03,727
And sometimes it's the one
you make for yourself.

359
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,969
-What are you doing here?
-Come here.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
