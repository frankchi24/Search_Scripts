1
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,916
There is nothing more humiliating for
a woman than a visit to the gynecologist...

2
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,349
Do you need more OrthoNovum?

3
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,913
...unless it's having to tell
your gynecologist...

4
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,050
...you don 't need the pill anymore.

5
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,321
Actually, I'm going off it.

6
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,191
-Are you trying to have a baby?
-No!

7
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,727
I sort of jumped the gun going on it
in the first place because Steve...

8
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:17,038
...the guy that I went on it for, the first
real relationship I've had in years, is over...

9
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,739
...and I don't need a daily reminder
that I'm not having sex.

10
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,578
So that's the story with the pill.

11
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,181
Okay, I'm quiet now.

12
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,146
Just when Miranda thought
she'd hit rock bottom...

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,952
...she discovered
a new geological layer of humiliation.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,194
We got your tests back
and everything Iooks fine.

15
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,518
Great!

16
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,431
Just one small thing.
It appears you have a Iazy ovary.

17
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,593
A Iazy ovary?

18
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,833
Your right ovary
has stopped producing eggs.

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,065
Is it possible it's just on strike?

20
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,801
I know what this is.

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,679
My right ovary has given up hope
that I will ever get married and have kids.

22
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,280
It's Iike a case you know
will settle out of court. Why bother?

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,919
-The Ieft one still believes.
-I'm a biological underachiever.

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,322
It's ironic because that ovary
went to Harvard.

25
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,658
I have a tilted uterus.

26
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,694
The sperm have to jump over
that hurdle to get to my egg.

27
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,165
But once they get there,
there will be an egg.

28
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,637
I need a new gynecologist.
Do you Iike yours?

29
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,104
Not right now. No.

30
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,674
At Ieast she's a woman.

31
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,336
I tried to go to a man,
but it was too strange...

32
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,871
...him spending all that time down there
and Ieaving without an orgasm, and a bill.

33
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,678
Here. I'm going to get this.

34
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,610
I don't think these are accepted here.

35
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,357
I'm spending the night at Big's.

36
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,861
After all this time,
you don't have so much as a drawer there?

37
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,396
Big is weird about stuff.

38
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,661
AII men are. That's why
you have to just stake out some territory.

39
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,204
-It's not a Iand run, it's a relationship.
-Exactly! Talk to him about it!

40
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,365
With Big, I think it's best
to walk softly and carry a big purse.

41
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,674
Yes, she shouldn't Ieave anything there
to remain a creature of mystery.

42
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,511
What's the big mystery?
He knows she wears underwear.

43
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,548
I never Ieave underwear
because I never see it again.

44
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,154
-What happens to it?
-Nothing. I never go back.

45
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:13,591
Isn't it a Iittle expensive disposing of
Iingerie every time you sleep with a guy?

46
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,092
That's why I stopped
wearing underwear on dates.

47
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,222
That's why I'm never borrowing
a dress from you again.

48
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,496
I once found another woman's underwear
in a man's bed.

49
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,059
Maybe it was Samantha's!

50
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,167
Once in Steve's bathroom, I found
one of those hair scrunchies from the '80s.

51
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,305
I'm not sure what was more disturbing:
the fact that he had a girlfriend before...

52
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,214
...or the fact that he dated someone
who wore a scrunchie.

53
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,151
Half my music collection was Ieft behind
by past boyfriends.

54
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,655
-I always give that stuff back.
-I don't.

55
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,655
I consider it a parting gift.

56
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,956
"Thanks for playing.
Here's Hootie and the BIowfish."

57
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,825
They're sexual souvenirs.

58
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,955
Okay, then I want a T-shirt that says:

59
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,535
"I dated a bartender
and all I got was this Iousy ovary."

60
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,198
The next morning at Big's,
I started to think.

61
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,039
If the things we leave behind...

62
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,478
...become the archeological relics
of our sexual history...

63
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,244
...I should be able to leave something.

64
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,657
Ancient man left cave drawings
to prove they existed.

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,354
I left a Hair Pro 1200.

66
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,792
And I didn't stop at that.

67
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,644
Man may have discovered fire...

68
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,544
...but women discovered
how to play with it.

69
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,446
Charlotte was making history as well.

70
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,351
Tired of the Neanderthals
she'd been dating...

71
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:52,915
...she spent her night with a gay friend
who catered parties for the gallery:

72
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,017
Dessert chef, Stephan Bodean.

73
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:58,359
I had no idea that Betty Buckley
was so talented!

74
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,797
PIease! She is the cat's pajamas.

75
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,465
Why do people say that?

76
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,163
I have no idea.
Maybe because she was in Cats.

77
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,632
Let's start another one.
Like, "She's the dog's tuxedo."

78
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,508
-Thank you so much for inviting me.
-No, please.

79
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,946
Thank you for accepting
my Iast minute invite.

80
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,951
My friend Don canceled
and we had had tickets forever.

81
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,384
Call me anytime.

82
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,218
It's refreshing to go out
with a man I can talk to.

83
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,048
-You want to grab a cappuccino?
-No, I've just got to get on home.

84
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,992
-You're uptown?
-Yeah, and you're....

85
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,588
Chelsea. I'II hail you a cab.

86
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,008
-Or you could get one yourself.
-It helps to show a Iittle Ieg.

87
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,874
You know, I tried that and nothing.

88
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,876
Thank you. Goodnight.

89
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,526
Goodnight.

90
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,033
What happened? What do you think?

91
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,267
I am so confused.
Is he gay or is he straight?

92
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,203
It's not that simple anymore.

93
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,833
The real question is:

94
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,505
Is he a straight gay man,
or is he a gay straight man?

95
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,607
The gay straight man was a new strain
of heterosexual male...

96
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,176
...spawned in Manhattan
as the result of overexposure to fashion...

97
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,246
...exotic cuisine, musical theater
and antique furniture.

98
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,458
Hopefully, he's a gay straight man...

99
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,994
...meaning he's straight
with great gay qualities.

100
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,620
Whereas a straight gay guy...

101
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,598
...is just a gay guy
who plays sports and won't fuck you.

102
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,726
He must be a gay straight man because
he asked Charlotte out for a second date.

103
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,272
Unless he's a straight gay man in denial.

104
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,701
But Saturday night wasn't even a date.

105
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,040
I didn't wash my hair
and I wore my glasses!

106
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,739
Are those recreational,
because this drink isn't doing it for me.

107
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,807
They're hormones.
I'm trying to jump-start my ovary.

108
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,787
-My mother's taking those for menopause.
-Does she have a tilted uterus, too?

109
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,182
Isn't anybody going to notice my purse?

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,151
Cute! Is it new?

111
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,062
No, but it is quite small and panty-free.

112
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,362
You Ieft your underwear at Big's.

113
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,633
No, but I did Ieave a hair brush,
a hair dryer, razors...

114
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,265
...tampons and eye-makeup remover.

115
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,837
Good for you!

116
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,640
And something else.

117
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,105
What?

118
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,350
For the first time at Big's,
I did a number two.

119
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,056
I think it's a good sign...

120
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,153
...that I feel comfortable enough with Big
to do a number two.

121
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,596
It is not a good sign!
It's the end of romance.

122
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,929
This is a big deal!

123
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,232
I went through a relationship
never doing that at the guy's place...

124
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,102
...including a weekend in Bermuda...

125
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,733
...where I spent the whole time
running to the Iobby.

126
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,140
It's tough in New York.

127
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,203
Small apartments, one bathroom.
You can hear everything.

128
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,111
That's why I only date rich men.

129
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:07,141
Money means that there's enough space
to distance yourself from the number two.

130
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,156
I have never done a number two
at a boyfriend's place.

131
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,523
Honey, you're so uptight,
you need to do a number seven.

132
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,429
Excuse me,
it's from that guy at the end of the bar.

133
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,526
Really?

134
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,801
My God, it's Dominic.

135
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,506
Dominic Delmonico
was a publishing magnate...

136
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,807
...and the first and only man
Samantha really loved.

137
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,105
He wined and dined her,
set the bar for hot sex...

138
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,641
...then dumped her
for an Icelandic supermodel named Anka.

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,746
Once, on the cover of Fortune,
he'd fallen to tabloid level...

140
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,257
...due to a messy public divorce.

141
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,857
I'm just gonna say hello.

142
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,528
After what he did to you?

143
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,996
-What did he do?
-He broke her heart.

144
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,259
Imagining Samantha with a broken heart...

145
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,770
...was more confusing to Charlotte
than a French kiss from a gay man.

146
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,031
Ancient history.
I'm the one with the power now.

147
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,476
I've evolved past him.

148
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,889
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hiya, handsome.

149
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,992
-What's this?
-Just a few things you Ieft at my place.

150
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,400
Thanks.

151
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,313
It's like I had one too many items...

152
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,646
...and I was being kicked out of
the relationship express lane.

153
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,084
What is it about Big's apartment?

154
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,248
Nothing ever sticks.
It's like Teflon for women.

155
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,824
I meant to Ieave that stuff
at your apartment.

156
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,799
Why?

157
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,767
For one thing,
I don't wake up Iooking Iike this.

158
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,801
I actually need stuff to Iook Iike this
and it would be nice...

159
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:18,048
...not to have to carry it around all day
with me Iike a nomad.

160
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,281
It's just a few things.
And you can Ieave stuff here.

161
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,150
-I don't want to Ieave stuff here.
-Not a Iot of stuff.

162
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,955
Just Iike, you know,
if you want to shave in the morning.

163
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,125
I shave at the gym.

164
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,725
I don't know, socks.

165
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,401
You want me to Ieave socks here?

166
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,628
Never mind what I want.
What do you want?

167
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,535
I don't know. Let's save an hour.
Why don't you just tell me what I want?

168
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,902
No, really, in your mind...

169
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:50,143
...what is the ideal Iiving situation
for two people in a relationship?

170
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,918
Exactly what we have.

171
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,620
-And what is that?
-I have my place, you have yours.

172
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,694
We're together when we want to be,
we're apart when we want to be.

173
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,590
-Like Woody and Mia.
-Before Soon-Yi.

174
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,662
Ever since Woody Allen described
waving to Mia Farrow across the Park...

175
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:18,039
...single men in Manhattan had yearned
for that kind of separate togetherness.

176
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,103
I felt like the last dinosaur.
Was I the one who needed to adapt?

177
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,243
Was my view of a relationship extinct?

178
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,583
I couldn 't stop thinking about it.

179
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,418
This is a city where gay men are so out,
they're in...

180
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,018
...where women are so chronically single,
ovaries may be the next vestigial organ.

181
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,120
We can have anything delivered anytime.

182
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,462
We can have our dogs walked,
our clothes cleaned, our food cooked.

183
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,798
Who needs a husband
when you have a doorman?

184
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,633
Are New Yorkers
evolving past relationships?

185
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,436
Relationships have declined
since women Ieft the cave...

186
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,772
...Iooked around and said, "This isn't hard."

187
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,312
So you don't need a man,
but do you still want one?

188
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,813
I want more than one.

189
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,749
I can't decide whether you represent
our future or our demise.

190
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,343
I am the future!

191
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,456
Seeing Dominic reminded me
of how needy I was and how far I've come.

192
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,459
-We're going out Friday night.
-Sweetie!

193
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,495
It took you a year to get over him.
He treated you Iike shit.

194
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,932
-Why do you go out with him again?
-Because he treated me Iike shit.

195
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,469
-I'm Ieaning toward demise.
-It's called revenge.

196
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,335
I'm gonna make him want me
and right before we do it...

197
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,534
...I'm gonna drop him Iike he dropped me.

198
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,443
-As Iong as you've got a plan.
-Not only a plan, I have a dress.

199
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,708
Samantha's revenge fantasy,
like all her fantasies, was even better live.

200
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,619
You're more beautiful than ever.

201
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,384
So successful and I'm getting gray hair...

202
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,654
...and Anka is taking me
for everything I've got.

203
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,253
I read that she got the sailboat.

204
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,390
We had good times in that boat.

205
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,832
-You and Anka?
-You and I.

206
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,970
Have I mentioned how unbelievable
you Iook in that dress?

207
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,138
Since Stephan hadn't come out...

208
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,378
...Charlotte accepted his invitation
to stay in.

209
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,625
That's delicious.

210
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:20,495
Grilled Portobello pizzas topped with fresh
basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

211
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,164
It's Martha's recipe.

212
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,896
-I Iove Martha Stewart.
-She's the dog's tuxedo!

213
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:32,470
Look, you have the silk placemats
I've been eyeing at Bergdorf's.

214
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,845
-You have good taste.
-This is my fantasy kitchen.

215
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,215
This is my fantasy.

216
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,960
Is that dress Cynthia Rowley?

217
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,859
Charlotte wanted to be open-minded...

218
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,100
...but Stephan seemed
to be making it as hard as possible.

219
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,201
Meanwhile, Samantha was making Dominic
as hard as possible.

220
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,278
So do you want me?

221
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,344
Do I want you?

222
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,855
This was the moment
Samantha had waited years and years for.

223
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,126
What was another couple hours?

224
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,071
I tried to call you. Were you at Big's?

225
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,876
No, I was out shopping.

226
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,644
My relationship is at a standstill,
so instead, I'm evolving my Iook.

227
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,187
How did it go with Dominic?

228
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,845
I slept with him.

229
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,413
That wasn't part of the plan.

230
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,050
It's the new plan. I wanted to remind him
what he was missing.

231
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,926
I can't believe I thought
he was such a great Iover.

232
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,329
I'm better than him now.

233
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,796
Bye.

234
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,398
In order to survive two decades
of dating in New York...

235
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,169
...Samantha had become a powerful hybrid:

236
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,972
The ego of a man trapped in
the body of a woman.

237
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,909
Charlotte feared the opposite
was true of Stephan.

238
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:21,578
She still needed help classifying her find,
so she brought in a team of experts.

239
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,846
Carrie, Stanford, this is Stephan.

240
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,557
-Hi.
-Ciao!

241
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:31,529
-You changed your hair.
-It's just straightened. Have we met?

242
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,392
No, I've seen your column.

243
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,866
In that photo, your hair is free flowing
and Botticelli-esque.

244
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,436
It's fabulous either way.

245
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,674
Cannolis and cream puffs and tarts, oh my!

246
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,874
I put a Iittle bit of everything.

247
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,648
This one's an experiment.
It's a date tart with pumpkin custard.

248
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,685
This is all for us?

249
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,378
-Sweets for my sweet.
-And her freeloading friends.

250
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,020
My nutritionist will kill me,
but somebody hand me a fork.

251
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,685
-Can you join us?
-I'd Iove to.

252
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,025
I have got to glaze my wedding cake.

253
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,192
Get back to me on the tart.

254
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:19,037
I find him very attractive.
Which, of course, means he's straight.

255
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,575
He's obviously choosing to be straight...

256
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,343
...because he seems to be
head over heels about her.

257
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,684
What if he's gay
and he doesn't know it yet?

258
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,914
Honey, we are aware.

259
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,992
When I was a boy, my father gave me
a book about the female body...

260
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,993
...to teach me about sex.

261
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,588
I took one Iook at it and said, "No."

262
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,359
-How is he in bed?
-I don't know. I haven't slept with him yet.

263
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,667
-Really?
-But he wants to.

264
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:51,839
It's so not fair. AII the good ones
are straight, even the gay ones.

265
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,872
Give me a cannoli.

266
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,892
-Are you Iooking at my forehead?
-No!

267
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,862
That night,
Miranda went out with Joseph Adler...

268
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,422
...a labor-relations lawyer
who'd been after her since the firm retreat.

269
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,196
The Iamb is delicious.

270
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,737
You can Iook if you want.
I've got nothing to hide.

271
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,840
It's actually starting to fill in.

272
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,676
She'd refused him twice before,
but since she was down to her last ovary...

273
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:33,207
...Miranda decided she was in no position
to eliminate men on the basis of hair plugs.

274
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,818
-I'm telling you, I was practically bald.
-I remember.

275
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,251
Now I have hair. This is a miracle.

276
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,992
-Some more bistee?
-Sure.

277
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,264
You probably think I'm crazy.

278
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,758
Actually, I was thinking
you seem very happy.

279
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,702
The funny thing is, I never thought
that I'd be the kind of guy to get plugs.

280
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,469
But I've Iearned
that you should never say never.

281
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,101
I know what you mean.

282
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,878
There are things that I've considered Iately
that I never thought I would consider.

283
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,042
Like what?

284
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,516
-Do you really want to know?
-Sure.

285
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:15,057
I recently found out
that I have a Iazy ovary.

286
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:19,827
Which is no big deal. It just means that I
only produce an egg every other month.

287
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,664
I'm not even sure that I want kids,
but all of a sudden it hit me...

288
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,728
...that if the other ovary shuts down,
I'm out of business.

289
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:33,167
I've started taking hormones and now
I'm actually considering freezing my eggs.

290
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,073
Freezing your eggs?

291
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,945
Like a fertility savings account.
I think it would take the pressure off.

292
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,884
It removes the whole
biological clock issue.

293
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,619
-Yeah, but it raises a Iot of other issues.
-Such as?

294
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,794
Such as, what is all this
reproductive technology doing for us?

295
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,928
Do we want desperate women
having babies at 50?

296
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,764
Maybe some people
aren't supposed to procreate.

297
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,239
Maybe this is the world's way
of weeding out the weak.

298
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,811
If you ask me,
this is a ridiculous abuse of science.

299
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,282
You have now designer sperm
and these simulated wombs.

300
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,184
Here's a good idea.

301
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,943
Why don't we just
eliminate men altogether?

302
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,581
I don't need to be Iectured about science...

303
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,285
...by a man who's doing crop rotation
on his forehead.

304
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,588
Miranda went off the hormones.

305
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,564
Not because of what Joseph said,
but because she was only 33...

306
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,797
...she still had her left ovary
and she wasn 't ready to settle out of court.

307
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,172
Maybe someday there would be eggs
in her freezer. But not yet.

308
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,135
Meanwhile...

309
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:47,550
...Charlotte decided to stop trying to figure
out her creature of mystery and just enjoy.

310
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,611
-Cher?
-I Iove her!

311
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,889
She's such a survivor.

312
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,555
Wait.

313
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,465
I have to ask you something.

314
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,305
Have you ever been with a man?

315
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,404
No. Have you ever been with a woman?

316
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,806
I'm sorry, it's just....

317
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:25,012
Betty Buckley and Martha Stewart
and Cynthia Rowley!

318
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,487
Are you gay?

319
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,931
I'm a 35-year-old pastry chef
who Iives in Chelsea.

320
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,728
If I were gay, I would be gay.

321
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,605
You're the one
who doesn't want to make Iove.

322
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,947
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

323
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,823
Charlotte was relieved and delighted
to discover...

324
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,797
...Stephan was definitely straight,
or at least a gay straight man.

325
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,762
Frankly, after two orgasms,
who the hell cares?

326
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,872
The next morning, it dawned on Samantha
that her desire for revenge...

327
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,972
...was not as strong
as her desire for Dominic.

328
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,017
You're awake.

329
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,547
Yes.

330
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,754
You're so incredibly beautiful.

331
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,929
-I'm gonna miss you.
-What do you mean?

332
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,671
Anka and I are giving it another shot.

333
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,239
It's mostly financial.

334
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,975
You can't do this to me.

335
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,206
-I know. I'm sorry.
-No!

336
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,253
I'm supposed to do this to you!
I had a plan! This is all wrong!

337
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,752
I should go.

338
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,181
-Get out!
-I said I was going.

339
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,257
Stop beating me to the punch!

340
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,124
As she watched history repeat itself...

341
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,225
...Samantha realized
she couldn 't do what Dominic did...

342
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,499
...because she hadn 't evolved past
having feelings.

343
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,333
In a way, that was nice to know.

344
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,184
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sleepy.

345
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,783
Something smells amazing!

346
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,517
It's warm cranberry buttermilk scones
and Iemon curd.

347
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,318
If I continue dating you,
I'm gonna gain 10 pounds.

348
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,828
You'II still be gorgeous.

349
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,598
-You want some tea?
-Yes, please.

350
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,634
-What is that noise?
-What noise?

351
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,938
It's kind of Iike a squeaking.

352
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,009
My God! It's a mouse!

353
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,119
-Are you sure?
-It's in that glue trap.

354
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,778
-Where?
-There.

355
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,288
-My God!
-His Iegs are stuck!

356
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,424
-Do something! Don't kick it to me!
-Get it out!

357
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,663
Get it away!

358
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,201
My God!

359
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,204
At that moment...

360
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,407
...Charlotte realized her masculine side
wasn 't evolved enough...

361
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,578
...for a man whose feminine side
was as highly evolved as Stephan 's.

362
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:49,792
I spent the night at Big's for the first time
since my stuff was kicked out of the nest.

363
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,406
-Where you going?
-Home.

364
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,440
It's where my hair dryer is.

365
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,350
I may have to dry my hair.

366
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,352
I'm wearing it straight,
in case you didn't notice.

367
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,092
I noticed.

368
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,461
But I think it Iooks
pretty amazing right now.

369
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,668
Bring that gorgeous ass back into bed.

370
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,472
I just have to make sure
I didn't Ieave anything else.

371
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:57,691
Suddenly, I realized I didn't have to worry
about leaving something behind...

372
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,261
...because I was there.

373
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,500
Okay.

374
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,205
I'II stay a Iittle Ionger.

375
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,206
But I'm Ieaving this underwear here.

376
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,778
Is it clean?

377
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,915
Okay...

378
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:33,658
...it was a small step for mankind,
but it was a really big step for Big.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
