1
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,207
Life is all about making choices.

2
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,807
Some choices, like who you marry,
are big...

3
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,919
...while others are even bigger.

4
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,682
What do you think?

5
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,186
The $5 ones that Iast three days,
or the $10 ones that Iast five?

6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,050
Either one.

7
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,285
Three days.

8
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,328
$5.

9
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,231
Another choice is how to deal
with an ex-boyfriend.

10
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,668
Some women handle it
coolly, calmly, while others....

11
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,000
Fuck!

12
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,799
Steve.

13
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,371
Go!

14
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,677
$5! Come back here!

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,455
He Iooked so hurt.

16
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,288
Like a kid in one of those
big-eyed velvet paintings.

17
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,526
Poor Steve.

18
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,290
I'm sorry, I panicked.

19
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,456
What was I to do, chat about the weather?

20
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:43,059
-The man's been inside me.
-Could I have more Sweet 'N Low?

21
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,797
I've never been able
to be friends with an ex.

22
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,467
I meet those couples who stay friends
and I think, "How do they do that?"

23
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:54,309
I've never been friends with men. Women
are for friendships, men are for fucking.

24
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,348
You must Iearn to form an opinion.

25
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,647
Friendship is the bonus of a relationship.
No relationship, no friendship.

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,019
If your couple doesn't work,
you withhold friendship as a punishment?

27
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,853
You make it sound so bad.

28
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,122
BIack widow spiders bite
their mate's heads off when it's over.

29
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,663
Withholding friendship
is Ietting them off easy.

30
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,256
Imagine, instead of
the awful break-up scene...

31
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,393
...you say, "Come here"...

32
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,061
...and chomp their head off.

33
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,630
I would Iove to be
one of those people who's all:

34
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,834
"We Ioved, thank you.
You enriched my Iife. Now, go, prosper."

35
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,278
I'm much more: "We didn't work out,
you need to not exist."

36
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,613
What?

37
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,351
It's just so childish.

38
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,982
Not you, the whole situation.

39
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,185
We keep dresses we'II never wear
but throw away our ex-boyfriends.

40
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,193
I'm not saying that I'm any better.

41
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,462
I haven't been able
to be friends with Big, but....

42
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,669
If you Ioved someone and you break up...

43
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,070
...where does the Iove go?

44
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,935
To their next girlfriend.

45
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,976
No. That is a different Iove.

46
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:04,608
The Iove that Big and I had cannot
be same thing he has with Natasha.

47
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,950
Natasha? When'd you stop calling her
the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul?

48
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,684
About three weeks ago
when I saw them at Cafe M.

49
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,557
He was holding her hand and smiling and...

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,258
...I finally got it.

51
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,765
They're happy, slash, we're over.

52
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,763
It was okay.

53
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,405
-Natasha, what a bullshit name.
-Totally.

54
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,444
-Stupid.
-Complete bullshit.

55
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,307
Later that night,
I got to thinking about the ex factor.

56
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,883
In mathematics, we learned
that "x" stands for the unknown.

57
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,144
"a" plus "b" equals "x. "

58
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:47,582
But what's really unknown is: what
plus what equals friendship with an ex?

59
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,159
Is this an unsolvable equation?

60
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,662
Or is it possible to transform
a once-passionate love...

61
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,725
...into something that fits
nice and easily onto the friendship shelf?

62
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,766
I couldn 't help but wonder...

63
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,471
...can you be friends with an ex?

64
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,879
That Sunday afternoon, Miranda was
enjoying a biscotti and the paper when....

65
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,044
There it was...

66
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,848
...her ex's head.

67
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,550
I hear you breathing.

68
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,663
Yeah. Hi!

69
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,397
That was a shitty thing you did,
running away from me on the street.

70
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,129
I didn't run.

71
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,628
You ran.

72
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,562
I wasn't expecting to see you--

73
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,039
It really hurt my feelings.

74
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,571
I don't do very well
with ex-boyfriends and....

75
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,442
This is me.

76
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,412
Steve.

77
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,052
I held your head while you were sleeping.

78
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,068
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,572
I'm so sorry.

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,266
It's okay.

81
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,777
I hadn't seen you in so Iong
and I missed you...

82
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,104
...and then I did that shitty thing.

83
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,248
-It wasn't that shitty.
-It was.

84
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,580
It was a shitty thing. I'm a shitty person.

85
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,381
-You are not a shitty person.
-I am! I am shitty!

86
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,478
You'd never do anything that shitty.

87
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,014
How about showing up at your apartment
and calling you shitty?

88
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,325
Yeah, that was pretty shitty.

89
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,758
You've got a "bat in the cave."

90
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,772
I miss you.

91
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,871
Whenever something funny happens,
I always want to tell you about it.

92
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,711
So tell me.

93
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:53,682
Just 'cause we broke up doesn't mean
we can't have a friendly meal, does it?

94
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,253
I guess not.

95
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,752
What are you doing Friday?

96
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,723
I have a date.

97
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,457
Looking forward to it, are you?

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,127
As Miranda made plans
to have dinner with her last love...

99
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:16,404
...Charlotte came face to face
with the memory of her first...

100
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,201
...her horse, Taddy.

101
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,113
Charlotte's relationship with Taddy ended...

102
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,241
...when he threw her
during a teen equestrian competition...

103
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,187
...causing her to break her collarbone
and lose the blue ribbon.

104
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:35,093
Her father promptly sold Taddy
and she hadn't been on a horse since.

105
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,597
Charlotte wondered if it was time
to get back in the saddle.

106
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,668
Meanwhile, across town...

107
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,866
...Samantha was about to see
a stallion of her own.

108
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,730
I gotta say, you Iook amazing.

109
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,560
Excuse me, but do I know you?

110
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,394
Not yet.

111
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,600
I was thinking maybe you'd
have dinner with me sometime.

112
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,738
What makes you think that?

113
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,840
The way you were just checking me out.

114
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,407
You get 10 points for directness.

115
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,543
Do I also get your phone number?

116
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,211
I'm not sure yet.

117
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,021
I'II tell you what....

118
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,223
Here's my business card.

119
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,027
You call me.

120
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,989
BIatantly picking a woman up
on the street.

121
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,095
How'd you get to be so cocky?

122
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,233
I was born that way, I guess.

123
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,365
At Ieast consider meeting me
for a friendly Iittle drink.

124
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,707
I'II think about it, Mr. Cocky.

125
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,878
PIease do.

126
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,858
Later that week, when I spotted
a Laura Ashley dress, circa 1988...

127
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,829
...still hanging in my closet...

128
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,164
...I decided it was time
to give my ex a friendly phone call.

129
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,305
I hadn't planned on the Idiot Stick Figure
With No Soul answering.

130
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,776
Then, I remembered Big had caller ID.

131
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,747
Shit!

132
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,088
Hello yourself.

133
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,101
-Did you just call?
-No--

134
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,829
Yes, but I didn't get to talk because...

135
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,741
...I accidentally hit the thing...

136
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,511
...so, you know, it hung up.

137
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,442
So, yes.

138
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,050
And I...

139
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:16,418
...I heard Natasha, so, apologize to her.

140
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,690
How is Natasha?

141
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,153
Great.

142
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,989
She's great.

143
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:28,899
How are you?

144
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,731
I'm A-OK.

145
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,371
You sound a Iittle nuts.

146
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,109
Can't you Iet one go by?

147
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,101
This is weird.

148
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,236
The first call.

149
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,581
Right.

150
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,607
Maybe I'd...

151
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,777
...do better if I went with
my Iittle prepared speech.

152
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,486
You have a speech?

153
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,488
I was wondering what you thought of...

154
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,854
...instead of pretending
each other doesn't exist...

155
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,862
...we try to be friends or something?

156
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,570
I'd Iike that.

157
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,705
I've been meaning to call, but I didn 't
know if you wanted to hear from me--

158
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,575
-Want to have a lunch or something?
-Let's.

159
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,976
Thank you.

160
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,786
I have a 1:00 reservation. Bradshaw.

161
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,484
I used to make our lunch reservations
in Big's name.

162
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,824
But today, I put it in mine,
because that's what friends do.

163
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,490
The other party is already here.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,024
Thank you.

165
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,640
Are you hungry? Because I am.

166
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,009
I got up at 6:00, worked out,
hardly had any breakfast.

167
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,648
They have a great Cobb salad here.

168
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,118
Shall we eat?

169
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,782
-Let's eat.
-We'II eat.

170
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,689
And that's when I realized,
Big was nervous.

171
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,622
It was odd. The new "friend" part of me
felt incredibly compassionate...

172
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,096
...while the old "girlfriend" part of me
felt incredibly smug.

173
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,824
-You okay?
-Fine.

174
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,637
You Iook good.

175
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,545
Thank you, so do you.

176
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,878
Good afternoon.

177
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,384
The Cobb salad is very good here.

178
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,947
Can I get you something to drink?

179
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,416
Iced tea.

180
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,482
A mineral water.

181
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,790
-Scotch.
-Cosmopolitan.

182
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,968
An hour later, I had solved
the unsolvable friendship equation.

183
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,339
It seems the answer is this:

184
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,442
Cosmopolitans plus scotch
equals friendship with an ex.

185
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,711
And what about your music?

186
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,117
If I had to Iisten to freakin'
BIood, Sweat & Tears one more time....

187
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,379
-BIood, Sweat & Tears is great stuff.
-10 minutes after we're awake?

188
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,854
Tell me about the girl.

189
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,905
-Really?
-Friends talk about their relationships.

190
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,772
Go ahead, friend, tell me about the girl.

191
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,349
-She's very sweet--
-Okay, enough!

192
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,846
Don't tell me about the girl. No can do.

193
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,785
Maybe we should make a pact:

194
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,987
We don't talk about our relationships
until they get really serious.

195
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,428
It is serious.

196
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,371
We're engaged.

197
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,847
I wanted you to hear it from me.

198
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,110
I just got a splitting headache.

199
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,150
I didn't know how to tell you....

200
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,322
-When you called for Iunch--
-Engaged?

201
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,958
How can you be engaged? You have
a problem with commitment, remember?

202
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,493
In fact, you told me you never wanted
to get married again, ever.

203
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,063
Things change.

204
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,164
You just didn't want to marry me.

205
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,266
-Natasha and I--
-Don't say her name!

206
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,709
Don't you dare say her name to me!

207
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,608
You string me along for two years...

208
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,913
...then you marry some 25-year-old girl
after only five months?

209
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,255
-I did not string you along.
-Fine, you didn't.

210
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,487
You know what? I have to go.
I have a headache.

211
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,058
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

212
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,489
Don't help me! Don't you help me!

213
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,467
Carrie, hold on, wait.

214
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,727
What is it?

215
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,940
-Don't end it Iike this--
-You did it Iike this. I was being friendly.

216
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,068
This seems Iike a much better way
to end things.

217
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,978
Go. Be engaged, get married to...

218
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,412
...Nijinsky or whatever her name is.
Have a nice Iife.

219
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,551
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

220
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,120
These steps are very dangerous.

221
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:29,593
The next day, I had promised to hold
Charlotte's hand while she tried riding.

222
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,193
It turned out,
she needed to hold mine as well.

223
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,938
How are you doing?

224
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,040
Aside from the fact that my ex
is engaged to a teenager...

225
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:41,944
...and I've got horseshit
on my goddamn $300 shoes...

226
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,809
...I'm doing okay.

227
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,416
I think you're amazing.

228
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,678
I would be in a hospital or something.

229
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,078
What the fuck is his problem?

230
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,219
He's got a stubborn streak.

231
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,583
Some horses never really Iike to be ridden.

232
00:14:55,694 --> 00:15:00,131
Taddy was Iike that when I first got him,
but once I broke him in, he Ioved it.

233
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,657
You know what?

234
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,928
I broke in Big.

235
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,334
I broke him in and the Idiot Stick Figure
With No Soul gets to ride him.

236
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,399
I'm really sorry.

237
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,974
I know you are. Thanks.

238
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,112
Damn!

239
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,011
You see, this is what happens.

240
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:24,078
You try to be friendly with an ex
and you wind up knee-deep in shit!

241
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,581
Perfect.

242
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,763
This is Pal. He's a good boy.

243
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,669
He's brown.

244
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,106
Taddy was brown,
but he had white spots on his flank.

245
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,407
Just stay till I'm on the horse,
then you can go, okay?

246
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,711
I'm here, it's all Iovely. Go have fun.

247
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,309
Hey, Pal.

248
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,286
Foot in and up you go.

249
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,550
As Charlotte put her boot in the stirrup...

250
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,527
...all her bad memories of Taddy,
broken bones and ribbons flooded over her.

251
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,522
No!

252
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,791
Can't.

253
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,997
-No, I can't. Let's go.
-You just paid.

254
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,596
-I said, I can't!
-He's all saddled up.

255
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,404
After a few
"get to know each other" phone calls...

256
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,948
...Samantha took up Mr. Cocky
on his offer of a friendly drink.

257
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,976
Turns out, it was a very friendly drink.

258
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,981
I want you to know,
I never pick up guys on the street...

259
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,218
...unless they're very cute.

260
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,460
Get over here, you cutie.

261
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,321
Before we go any further...

262
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,567
...I gotta warn you about something.

263
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,199
Warn me about what?

264
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,164
I'm very well-endowed.

265
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,906
Jackpot.

266
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,775
No. I'm serious.

267
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,174
It's huge.

268
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,918
Most women can't handle it.

269
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,689
I'm not most women.

270
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,087
Unzip and get over here.

271
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,358
Samantha suddenly understood
what made Mr. Cocky so cocky.

272
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm telling you,
it was Iike a wall of flesh coming at me.

273
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,581
Nothing is scarier
than a really big one coming at you.

274
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,051
I didn't even want my mouth near it,
I was afraid I'd get Iockjaw.

275
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,418
It was quite a shock.
His hands are relatively tiny.

276
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,652
-Don't tell me you believe that.
-Not anymore.

277
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,585
I'm going to have to psych myself up
before I try it again.

278
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,756
You're going to try it again? Why?

279
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,400
-Because it's there.
-It's a penis, not Mount Everest.

280
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,597
If it was Mount Everest...

281
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,869
...Iast night I could only make it
to Base Camp One.

282
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,975
You dated Mr. Big, I'm dating Mr. Too Big.

283
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,045
You're unbelievable.

284
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,879
You broke up with James because
he was too small, this guy is too big.

285
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,949
Who are you, Goldicocks?

286
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:09,986
Yep.

287
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,018
I'm Iooking for one that's just right.

288
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,919
That night, after a friendly dinner...

289
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,293
...Steve and Miranda began to explore
their newfound friendship.

290
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,094
If you were a real friend,
you'd Iet me keep it.

291
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,103
Sorry, it's part of a break-up.
You gotta return my fire department shirt.

292
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,174
-It fits me perfectly.
-Tell it to the judge.

293
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,071
-PIease?
-Nope.

294
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,110
Thanks for coming out for dinner.

295
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,412
Thanks for Ietting me pay, finally.

296
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,851
That's what friends do, isn't it?

297
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,580
Goodnight.

298
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,589
That's what friends do, isn't it?

299
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,027
I got another question for you.

300
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,203
Do friends kiss...

301
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,000
...here?

302
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,638
No.

303
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,281
Do friends kiss here?

304
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,519
No.

305
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,188
Do friends kiss....

306
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,058
Yeah.

307
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,295
We had good reasons
for breaking up, right?

308
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,421
Yeah.

309
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,897
Money, schedules, goals.

310
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,672
Good reasons.

311
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,137
What now?

312
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,008
Are we still just friends?

313
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,249
Yeah, we're still just friends.

314
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,483
Friends who have sex.

315
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,098
And in a bed across town....

316
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,532
Ready?

317
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,178
Wait.

318
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,040
Wait.

319
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:54,482
After two yoga classes and a hit
of the best Hawaiian gold she could find...

320
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,021
...Samantha was ready to take
another run at Mount Everest.

321
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,582
Okay, here we go.

322
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,760
Nice and easy.

323
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,232
That's it.

324
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,006
Easy--

325
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,946
Easy.

326
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,815
Good.

327
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,953
Good.

328
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,515
Okay, here we go.

329
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,723
Here we go?

330
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,024
Yeah.

331
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,324
We're not there yet?

332
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,930
-No.
-Okay, stop.

333
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,761
Whoa, boy.

334
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,569
Can we just be friends?

335
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:00,380
And just like that,
Samantha made her very first male friend.

336
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:07,115
The next day in Central Park,
Charlotte was making a new friend as well.

337
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,593
Good, Pal.

338
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,358
She had decided she and Pal
were moving too fast.

339
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:18,568
Before going any further, they needed
to get to know each other better.

340
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,537
You're a good boy, Pal.

341
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,505
Does that feel good?

342
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,734
You Iike that? My Taddy Iiked that, too.

343
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,408
I Ioved my Taddy so much.

344
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,349
Oh, good boy.

345
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,285
And with that gentle nudge
from her new pal...

346
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,219
...all Charlotte's bad feelings
about Taddy lifted...

347
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:43,886
...and she remembered just how much
she had loved his cute white spots.

348
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,859
Easy.

349
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,959
Okay. Go, boy, go!

350
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,387
Hey, it's Carrie, I'm shoe shopping.

351
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,559
It's me, are you there?

352
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,028
Pick up if you're there.

353
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,558
You're not there.

354
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,338
I'm calling to say
I feel bad about Iast week.

355
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,039
I didn't mean for it to happen Iike that...

356
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,249
...I thought you needed to know.

357
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,549
I hated to think someone else
might tell you.

358
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,616
Christ.

359
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,786
I feel like a real shit. I'm sorry.

360
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,728
I'm really sorry...

361
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,870
...I would never hurt you deliberately--

362
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,239
I know you wouldn't.

363
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,501
-You're there?
-I'm here.

364
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,112
Like I was saying, I'm sorry.

365
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,710
I'm sorry, too.

366
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,582
I shouldn't have reacted Iike that.

367
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,290
It was such a shock.

368
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,225
I guess it was a shock
I needed to hear to move on.

369
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,032
Yeah.

370
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,868
I wish you all the best. I do.

371
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,506
I hope you and Natasha will be very happy.

372
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,344
Do you mean that?

373
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,678
No.

374
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,549
But I will.

375
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,388
Really. I hope...

376
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,961
...some day very soon...

377
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:01,556
...we can all meet for a drink
and be great friends.

378
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,200
Like they do in the movies.

379
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,141
Bye.

380
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,077
Bye.

381
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,460
And I actually managed to hold
onto those friendly feelings, until....

382
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,885
I can't believe my ex-boyfriend
is at the PIaza...

383
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,922
...having an engagement brunch.

384
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,082
And he had the nerve to invite you.

385
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,854
It's my own fault.

386
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,589
I had to make the big
"Iet's be friends" speech.

387
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,164
Who am I kidding?
Big and I were never friends, we were...

388
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,962
...something else.

389
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,964
Something that did not end
with an engagement party at the PIaza.

390
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,266
-Do we want another round?
-What do you think?

391
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,037
Four more, please.

392
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,240
I think I can actually feel them
over there eating shrimp.

393
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,314
It's just--why her?

394
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,917
I mean really....

395
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,155
Why her?

396
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,087
One word: Hubbell.

397
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,989
Hubbell.

398
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,119
Oh, my god. Hubbell.

399
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,390
It is so Hubbell.

400
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,625
Who's Hubbell?

401
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,632
Hubbell!

402
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,464
Robert "Hubbell" Redford
in The Way We Were.

403
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,198
I Iove that movie.

404
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,934
I Iove, Iove, Iove, that movie.

405
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,601
-Never saw it.
-Oh, my god!

406
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,609
What are you, an alien?
How could you have not seen it?

407
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:56,873
Chick film.

408
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,046
Robert Redford
is madly in Iove with Barbara Streisand.

409
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,776
-Katie.
-K-k-k-katie.

410
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,515
K-k-k-katie, right!

411
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,784
But he can't be with her
because she's too complicated...

412
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,254
...and she has wild, curly hair.

413
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,421
Hello? C-c-c-curly.

414
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,930
He Ieaves her and marries this...

415
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,468
...simple girl with straight hair.

416
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,332
Ladies, I am having an epiphany.

417
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,332
The world is made of two types of women:

418
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,668
The "simple" girls and the "Katie" girls.

419
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,273
I'm a "Katie" girl and where are our drinks?

420
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:32,305
I always cry at the Iast scene
in that movie...

421
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,445
-...when she sees him with his new wife--
-The simple girl.

422
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,216
-And she reaches up--
-And smoothes his hair away.

423
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,780
She says to him:

424
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,950
"Your girl is Iovely, Hubbell."

425
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,927
Then the music comes in.

426
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,021
"Memories"

427
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,588
Oh my, God, it's so good.

428
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,192
"Light the corners of my mind

429
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,601
"Misty water-colored memories

430
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,334
"Of the way we were"

431
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,967
Let me do my favorite part.

432
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,740
-"Can it be"
-Yes!

433
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:06,307
"Can it be that it was all so simple then

434
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:10,377
"Or has time re-written every Iine?

435
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,488
"If we had the chance to do it all again

436
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,985
"Tell me

437
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,752
"Would we?

438
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,795
"Could we?

439
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,129
"Memories"

440
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,130
I miss James.

441
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,231
Excuse me?

442
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:34,001
After I left my friends, I found myself
pulled to the site of the engagement party.

443
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,707
I had no intention of going in,
but it was on my way home.

444
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,692
One second.

445
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,790
I had a choice.

446
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,164
I could run or I could stand
and ask him the question...

447
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,999
...that if I didn 't ask,
would haunt me the rest of my life.

448
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,408
I thought by the time I got here,
I'd know what to say.

449
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,674
And?

450
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,572
You're Iate.

451
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,675
The party's over.

452
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,508
I'II say it is.

453
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,081
Funny.

454
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,081
I was just on my way home and....

455
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,325
I have a question for you.

456
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,992
Why wasn't it me?

457
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,193
-Carrie--
-No, seriously.

458
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,900
I really need to hear you say it.

459
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,373
Come on, be a friend.

460
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,840
I don't know.

461
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,405
It just got so hard...

462
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,483
...and she's....

463
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,614
Yeah.

464
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,366
"Your girl is Iovely, Hubbell."

465
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,299
I don't get it.

466
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,870
And you never did.

467
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,018
Easy, girl.

468
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,659
Then I had a thought,
maybe I didn't break Big.

469
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,828
Maybe the problem was
he couldn't break me.

470
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,464
Maybe some women
aren't meant to be tamed.

471
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,567
Maybe they need to run free
until they find someone...

472
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,146
...just as wild to run with.
