1
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,866
Here are some things
I love about New York:

2
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,366
That week in spring when it's warm,
but not hot...

3
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,840
...and the trees
are just beginning to bloom.

4
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,968
Men in suits.

5
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,303
Three papers and 12 gossip columns.

6
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,306
It's easy for me to say,
"I love you, New York. "

7
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,649
It's not so easy to say,
"I love you, Mr. Big. "

8
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,980
The first time I realized
I actually loved Big...

9
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,419
...was over toast and coffee one morning.

10
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,885
What?

11
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,456
Thanks, honey.

12
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,331
What?

13
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,735
Nothing.

14
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,936
The first time I felt like saying it was
the night he took me to the ballet.

15
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,809
And he hates the ballet.

16
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,872
I don't want to disappoint you.

17
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,516
A couple of those dancers were on wires.

18
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,947
They were not.

19
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,922
On a couple of those big Ieaps
I saw the wires.

20
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,882
You know what?

21
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,623
What?

22
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,489
I Iove...your hair Iike that.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,565
Cut it out.

24
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,930
And then there was the time
I never expected to say it.

25
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,274
Last Friday night
at approximately 7:20 p.m...

26
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,306
...Big was picking me up
to take me out to dinner.

27
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,312
I just have to change my shoes.

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,217
Hurry, we don't want to be Iate.

29
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,656
If we grab a cab on Madison,
we can be there in five minutes.

30
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,425
Here.

31
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,832
What's this for?

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,405
I just saw it and thought of you.

33
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,681
It was just wrong.

34
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,589
It was wrong.

35
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,987
I didn't know what to say except:

36
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,227
I Iove you.

37
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,525
You told Big, "I Iove you",
because he gave you that?

38
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,261
What did you think it was,
a Iarge diamond duck ring?

39
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,998
I think my mother has one
in the shape of a squirrel.

40
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,235
Note that I did not say, "I Iove the purse."

41
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,468
What did he say?

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,742
He just...

43
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,344
...sort of reacted stunned for a moment
and then he said:

44
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,619
You're welcome.
I'II just wait for you outside.

45
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,953
Maybe he thought you said, "I Iove it."

46
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,228
It was a very deliberate and distinct "you."

47
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,722
He just pretended you didn't say it?

48
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,198
Yeah, but we both know I did.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,061
I've Iaid down the gauntlet.

50
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,037
He has to say "I Iove you" back
or I have to break up with him.

51
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,539
How Iong are you giving him?

52
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,175
I didn't put an expiration date on it.

53
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,769
It's got the shelf Iife of a dairy product,
it'II curdle in a week.

54
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,371
It's so interesting.

55
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,576
Tell a man, "I hate you",
you'II have the best sex of your Iife.

56
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:16,416
But tell him, "I Iove you",
you'II probably never see him again.

57
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,056
That's very comforting right now.

58
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,922
Wait a minute. Time out.

59
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,722
Did you ever think
that at this very moment...

60
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,290
...the man might be trying to find
his way to tell Carrie that he Ioves her?

61
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,332
Listening to Miranda
wax optimistic about love...

62
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,430
...was more disorienting
than a heat wave in February.

63
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,611
It seemed that Miranda,
love's greatest skeptic...

64
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,781
...had recently experienced
a romantic epiphany.

65
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,450
Grab us a seat outside
and I'II meet you out there.

66
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,485
-Will you Iet me pay this time?
-Your money's no good here.

67
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,522
Grab us a bench.

68
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,622
AII right.

69
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,392
-How much?
-$5.90.

70
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,256
She was dating a bartender
who worshiped her.

71
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,697
Miranda was so crazy
about him in return...

72
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,869
...she let him take her out to dinner.

73
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,370
But only to places she knew
he could afford.

74
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,639
Best slices in the city, don't you think?

75
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,704
Saturday, my firm is having
its annual dinner thing.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:22,477
I was wondering--if you think the bar
could spare you, you could be my date.

77
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,816
I warn you, it'II be totally boring.

78
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,324
It's not gonna be boring
if I'm there with you.

79
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,165
You probably should wear a suit.

80
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,135
It's gonna be a big fancy affair.

81
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,070
-You do have a suit, right?
-Sure, I do.

82
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,443
It's really nice. It's gold.

83
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,074
It's gold?

84
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,709
Yeah, corduroy.

85
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,146
What's wrong with corduroy?

86
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:02,550
I don't have enough time to tell you
what's wrong with corduroy.

87
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,434
For the first time,
Steve took Miranda back to his place.

88
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,073
This is your apartment.

89
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,166
You Iike?

90
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,676
It's sweet.

91
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,171
I modeled it after DeNiro's place
in Taxi Driver.

92
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,943
I'm kidding.

93
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,686
It's cheap and it's near the bar.

94
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,858
You never have to come here again.

95
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,570
That evening Miranda experienced
her first pangs of yuppie guilt.

96
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,805
A Iot of wonderful artists worked
as bartenders for years.

97
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,347
It doesn't mean he won't
make money some day.

98
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,853
He's not an artist, slash, bartender.

99
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,719
He's just happy being a bartender, period.

100
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,850
No aspirations beyond shaking cocktails
and refilling peanut bowls.

101
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,553
How's he in bed?

102
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,055
There are no words.

103
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,325
Sounds Iike a dream relationship to me.

104
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,064
He can make you cum,
then make you a Cosmopolitan.

105
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:24,165
How can you get serious with a guy
whose entire future is based on tips?

106
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,639
Wait a minute.

107
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,111
Rich men date
not-so-rich women all the time.

108
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,213
Look at me and Big.

109
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,980
It's not about money,
it's about compatibility.

110
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,613
It's normal for the guy
to have more money.

111
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,717
I know Iots of women who make
more money than their husbands.

112
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,523
You're all missing my point.

113
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,221
None of this matters to me.

114
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,095
I don't want it to matter to him.

115
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,295
When single men have money,
it's to their advantage.

116
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,203
If a single woman has money,
it's a problem to be dealt with.

117
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,865
It's ridiculous. I want to enjoy
my success, not apologize for it.

118
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,172
Bravo, honey.

119
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,244
You're talking about more
than a difference in income.

120
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,409
You're talking about a difference
in background and education.

121
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,148
This guy is working class.

122
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,122
Working class?

123
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,626
It's the Millennium.
We don't say "working class" anymore.

124
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,993
You're trying to pretend
we Iive in a classless society...

125
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,056
...and we don't.

126
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,430
Marie-Antoinette, we get the picture.

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,429
Thank you.

128
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,941
She's right.

129
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,068
I'm dating a guy right now
and he's got an actual servant.

130
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,341
It seems that Samantha was
dating Harvey Terkel...

131
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,021
...a real estate investor who had
just made a killing in the market...

132
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,116
...turning Chelsea sweatshops into
luxury co-ops for the upwardly trendy.

133
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,161
Sum is a fantastic cook.

134
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,489
You won't eat better Thai food in Bangkok.

135
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,688
More, Mr. Harvey?

136
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,632
Yes, please.

137
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,568
You Iike spicy Iike Mr. Harvey, miss?

138
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,400
I Iove spicy.

139
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,767
Enjoy.

140
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,202
Isn't she the best?

141
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,074
I could not Iive without her.

142
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,880
I wondered, was New York really
any different from New Delhi?

143
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,055
Had our class system been
replaced by a caste system?

144
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,654
And if so, can we date outside our caste?

145
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,258
That night, Big took me out
for a romantic dinner.

146
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,734
I could smell it coming the way
you can smell a thunderstorm coming.

147
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,430
A mere two days
after I had said, "I love you"...

148
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,299
...Big had found his own way
to say "I love you" to me.

149
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,967
You're gonna Iove this.

150
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,837
It's from a small winery
in the heart of Tuscany.

151
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,415
Delicioso.

152
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,815
I rented a villa there
one summer with the ex.

153
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,689
It was incredible.

154
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,595
I've always wanted to go back
with someone I actually Iiked.

155
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,763
There's something I've been
meaning to tell you ever since...

156
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,863
...the night I gave you the purse:

157
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,710
You can take it back, if you don't Iike it.

158
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,876
That became the first night
I wanted to tell Big...

159
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,077
... "I hate you".

160
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,986
The next afternoon,
Charlotte made the acquaintance...

161
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,221
...of a member of the very highest caste.

162
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,060
A caste that from coast to coast,
rich and poor...

163
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,491
...everyone deferred to
and honored without question...

164
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,664
...the movie star.

165
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,510
I'm Charlotte York.
I'm the director of the gallery.

166
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,102
Wiley Ford.

167
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,808
I know.

168
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,545
How much for this piece?

169
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,717
The fire extinguisher?

170
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,185
That's a real fire extinguisher.

171
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,755
For the gallery, in case there's a fire.

172
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,625
I guess I'm a total idiot.

173
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,227
No, it happens all the time.

174
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,497
You can have it. Take it.

175
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,735
You can say you got it at the gallery.

176
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,878
People will probably think it's a Jeff Koons.

177
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,842
You are adorable.

178
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,949
What do you think about closing up
for the rest of the afternoon?

179
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,356
Charlene, you are so hot.

180
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,824
Can't wait to get you to bed.

181
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,057
Charlotte. My name is Charlotte.

182
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,266
I prefer Charlene.

183
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:55,072
This champagne is running through me.
Yo, bud, pull over, I need to take a Ieak.

184
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,982
Sit tight, beautiful.

185
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,994
You'II never believe where I am.

186
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,804
I'm in the back of a Iimo about
to go have sex with Wiley Ford.

187
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,965
Where is he now?

188
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,942
He's taking a Ieak out in the alley,
isn't that cute?

189
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,977
It's adorable. Charlotte, Iisten to me,
get out of there immediately.

190
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,547
AII my rules just went
right out the window.

191
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,347
It's Iike, he wants me and I have to obey.

192
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,254
He's zipping up, gotta go.

193
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,031
While Charlotte began to enjoy
the perks of celebrity...

194
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,730
...Samantha discovered Harvey Terkel
came with some nice perks of his own.

195
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,809
Stay in bed as Iong as you want.

196
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,539
Sum will make you breakfast.

197
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,478
That's really not necessary.

198
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,516
PIease, she Ioves it.

199
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,913
Do you Iike fresh orange or grapefruit?

200
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,921
-Orange.
-Orange.

201
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,422
-Eggs?
-Coddled.

202
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,691
Coming right up.

203
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,688
I'II call you.

204
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,292
While Samantha didn't believe
in having servants...

205
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,066
...she had no problem
dating a man who did.

206
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,898
She knew it might take some adjusting,
but she could get used to it.

207
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,740
Bye, Sum.

208
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,543
Take good care of Samantha.

209
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,247
Bye, Mr. Harvey.

210
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,988
Okay, Iazy bones, out of bed.

211
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,161
-Excuse me?
-Up, must wash sheets.

212
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,499
Should I have my breakfast
in the dining room--

213
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,732
Breakfast? I got no time
to make breakfast.

214
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,273
Got a Iot of work to do around here.

215
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,447
It was then Samantha realized
that Sum was not so servile after all.

216
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,284
That afternoon during her lunch break,
Miranda took Steve shopping.

217
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,821
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

218
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,421
What do you think?

219
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,890
I think it's frightening how good I Iook.

220
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,690
It's a beautiful suit.
I think we should take it.

221
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,627
Could you do a cuff with a nice break?

222
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,931
-Will these be the shoes?
-I think we should take the shoes.

223
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,329
Don't you think so?

224
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,937
I guess we're taking the shoes.

225
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,602
Just Iike that.

226
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,009
Jesus, $1,800.

227
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,145
I guess I better not spill anything.

228
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,115
Don't worry. It's my treat.

229
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:52,946
What?

230
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,459
I invited you, I want to pay for the suit.

231
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,757
No way, you're not buying me a suit.

232
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,029
I wanted to do this for you.

233
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,700
Then I start to think of you Iike my mother
and that can get a Iittle weird for me.

234
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,375
Sorry, sir, it was declined.

235
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,708
-Would you Iike to try another one?
-Why don't you try mine?

236
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,343
How about this?

237
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:24,346
Let's try $800 on the card, I'II write
a check for $1,000 and the rest in cash.

238
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,288
Forget it. It's too expensive.

239
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,550
Would you just Iet me buy the fucking suit?

240
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,435
That Saturday,
Big took me to a cocktail party...

241
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,699
...at the home of Sarina Bush...

242
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,434
Great purse, fabulous.

243
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,941
Careful!

244
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,608
White rugs.

245
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,870
...an Upper East Side hostess
famous for her husband's money...

246
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,416
...and a close friendship with Tina Brown.

247
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,985
I knew her 10 years ago
when she was famous for...

248
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,318
...her father's money and a close friendship
with her drug dealer.

249
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,224
God, I hate Park Avenue.

250
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,892
It's Iike being in a foreign country.

251
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,328
Just think of me as your passport, baby.

252
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,226
As we walked through the room...

253
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,565
...of women clutching their bejeweled
swan, kitten and asparagus purses...

254
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,730
...I realized to my horror that
not only did Big not love me...

255
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,168
...he had absolutely no idea who I was.

256
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,039
-Can I get you a drink?
-Tanqueray and tonic.

257
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,411
Carrie, a drink?

258
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,980
Red wine, please.

259
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,417
I'm sorry, Ms. Bush doesn't
serve any brown food or drink.

260
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,154
Can I get you something clear?

261
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,720
Vodka on the rocks.

262
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,497
No brown food?

263
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,629
I think we've encountered
a mutant strain of Upper East Side anal.

264
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,232
She's a Iittle strange.
I've known her for years, she's okay.

265
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,971
I'm sure she's fabulous
until you spill something.

266
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,809
It's Iike she's trying
to cultivate an eccentricity...

267
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,442
...so people won't notice
she's completely devoid of personality.

268
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,887
-Don't be a bitch.
-I'm not, I'm being myself.

269
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,547
You're being a bit of a bitch.

270
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,783
Sweetheart!

271
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,151
How are you? It's been forever.

272
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,891
Thank you for having us.

273
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,728
Sarina, you know Carrie.

274
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,965
Darling, you can't smoke in here.

275
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,602
Terrace.

276
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,533
That's where I'II be.

277
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,879
Just like that,
I was cast out of the fancy party.

278
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:37,078
Charlotte found herself the newest
member of Wiley Ford's entourage.

279
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,216
When did marijuana
become Iegal in restaurants?

280
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,118
It didn't.

281
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,266
-Here.
-No, thank you.

282
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,994
I don't smoke pot.

283
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,305
You do now.

284
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,785
Sum was very rude to me
the other morning.

285
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,993
She practically threw me out of bed.

286
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,030
You must've misunderstood.

287
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,589
Her English isn't really that good.

288
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,134
More asparagus, Miss?

289
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,905
It was then Samantha realized...

290
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,707
...she wasn 't so dim, that Sum.

291
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,407
That night, I realized that relationships
had a caste system of their own.

292
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,713
There's the person who says, "I love you. "

293
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,151
And there's the person
who never responds.

294
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,326
What are you doing here?

295
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,362
Purveying the beverages.

296
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,288
-Just snuck out here to smoke.
-Good.

297
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,663
Are you friends with these people?

298
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,996
God, no.

299
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,995
A Iittle uptight.

300
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,666
-What's with the no brown food deal?
-Whatever.

301
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,470
Jeremiah was
a famous downtown performance artist...

302
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,446
...who was best known uptown as:
"Kid, give me another scotch and soda. "

303
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,575
We had engaged in
a mild flirtation for years.

304
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,982
Who're you here with?

305
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,349
Some guy.

306
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,117
I got a new tattoo, want to see it?

307
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,855
-Is that real?
-Yeah, it's real.

308
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,225
How far down does that go?

309
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,102
Pretty far.

310
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,596
Check it out.

311
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,440
Shit.

312
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,781
Excuse me.

313
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,380
Shit.

314
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,900
Were you really giving
the caterer a blow job?

315
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,946
First of all, he's not a caterer.

316
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,207
He's a well-known performance artist.

317
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,145
That didn't answer my question.

318
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,210
Because it was offensive.

319
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,090
Whatever you were doing, please stop.

320
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,450
You're embarrassing me.

321
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,255
I'm embarrassing you?

322
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,091
If you'd joined me on the terrace
Iike a gentleman...

323
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,826
...we wouldn't be having this conversation.

324
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,027
Let's just go.

325
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,636
You go, I'm having a good time.

326
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,379
And across town,
Miranda was late for the firm dinner.

327
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,154
Why are you dressed Iike that?

328
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,322
I returned the suit.

329
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,926
Frankly, I couldn't afford it.

330
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,259
Then why didn't you Iet me pay for it?

331
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,593
Miranda, you need to be with
a guy who's more on your Ievel.

332
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,034
Being in that store with you...

333
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,474
...I didn't feel good about myself.

334
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,413
I think you're an incredible Iady.

335
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,915
You want to break up with me over a suit?

336
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,910
Fuck the suit.

337
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,581
It's not just the suit.

338
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,450
There's always gonna be
things out of my reach.

339
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,797
I'm being punished for being successful.

340
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,129
That's not how I mean it.

341
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,098
Got it.

342
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,134
Thanks for the info and for standing me up.

343
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,576
It's been nice knowing you.

344
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,772
An hour later,
adrift in a sea of Italian wool crepe...

345
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,379
...Miranda wondered what was really
so wrong with corduroy, anyway.

346
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,991
In the space of one evening,
Charlotte had gone from girlfriend...

347
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,394
...to groupie.

348
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,629
Who had the rum and coke?

349
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,439
Listen, Charlene.

350
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,748
I want you to do something for me.

351
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,479
I want you to go to the Iadies' room...

352
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,245
...stick your finger in your pussy...

353
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,790
...come back and Iet me smell it.

354
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,160
I don't think so.

355
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,741
Charlotte realized,
another moment at the top...

356
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,643
...and she would have become
an Untouchable.

357
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,512
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog

358
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,183
"Was a good friend of mine

359
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,184
"I never understood a single word he said

360
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,155
"But I helped him drink his wine"

361
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,219
After Jeremiah got fired,
we celebrated downtown...

362
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,457
...with a couple of pitchers of Margaritas.

363
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,864
"Joy to the world

364
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,102
"AII the boys and girls

365
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,063
"Joy to the--

366
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,848
"Joy to the fishes in the deep blue--"

367
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,407
I don't Iive here.

368
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,753
"Joy to you and me"

369
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,187
That was the last thing
I remembered that night.

370
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,383
"If I were the king of the world"

371
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,295
-You just relax.
-I will.

372
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,459
I'm gonna go grab a shower.

373
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,774
Excuse me.

374
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,671
Nasty.

375
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,711
Nasty girl.

376
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,950
You dirty cock-sucking whore.

377
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,383
Must wash sheets right away.

378
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,187
Stop it! Let go. You're crazy.

379
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,651
What's going on out here?

380
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,398
I'm so sorry.

381
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:32,666
I just tried to wash the sheets,
but that Iady hit me.

382
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,498
How dare you treat Sum that way.

383
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,338
-Let me explain.
-No!

384
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,077
There's no explanation.

385
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,138
Just get out of here.

386
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:48,278
Samantha realized there was only room
for one woman in Harvey's life.

387
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,052
Jesus.

388
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,992
Listen...

389
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,731
...I know what
you're really pissed off about.

390
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,297
It's just something
I gotta do in my own time.

391
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:10,866
Okay?

392
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,276
I fucking Iove you.

393
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,341
All right? You know I do.

394
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,683
Good morning.

395
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,681
It's just a tough thing for me to say...

396
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:27,223
...because it always seems
to get me in trouble when I say it.

397
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,185
Okay?

398
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,025
Okay.

399
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,959
Are we okay?

400
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,600
We're great.

401
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,204
I Iove you, too.

402
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,238
I'II call you Iater, okay?

403
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,111
Did we?

404
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,919
Definitely not.

405
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,456
I didn't think so.

406
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,631
I felt like I was the lowest of the low.

407
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,828
I never told Mr. Big.

408
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,599
I figured everything
before "I love you"just doesn't count.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
