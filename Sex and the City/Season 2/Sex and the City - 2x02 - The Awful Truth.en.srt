1
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,940
Two years ago, my friend Susan Sharon...

2
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,453
...the East Coast rep for a line
of Italian cashmere sportswear...

3
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,019
...married a mean man.

4
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,054
What did I tell you
about Iistening to my CDs?

5
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:04,188
You put Natalie Imbruglia back in U2!

6
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,094
Now, I only see her once or twice a year...

7
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,397
...generally when
her husband is out of town.

8
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,996
Now, I can't remember if I've taken
my Halcion before dinner or not.

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,406
So I take another one, I have a cocktail,
I'm feeling no pain.

10
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,276
The next thing I know, this freaked out
stewardess is slapping me awake.

11
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,046
I open my eyes, I Iook around the plane,
it's completely empty.

12
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,079
-We'd Ianded in Milan 30 minutes ago.
-My God.

13
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,425
Come up to my apartment
because I have something for you.

14
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,162
The place Iooks fantastic!

15
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,269
Richard's asleep.

16
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,031
In here?

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,241
Susan Sharon and her husband
had one of those very adult apartments...

18
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,607
...that made me feel like I was 16
visiting the home of a friend...

19
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,680
...whose parents thought
I was a bad influence.

20
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,114
Happy birthday, Carrie.

21
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,415
You didn't have to.

22
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,252
I know it's a Iittle early.

23
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,221
It's beautiful.

24
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,425
It's 100 percent Italian cashmere
and Iight as a feather.

25
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,092
God, I Iove it.

26
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,961
It's a "cashmere-ical."

27
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,269
-Guess what Barneys gets for this.
-Don't tell me.

28
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,833
-$900.
-$900 for a scarf? No.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,681
-Do you mind if I return it? I need cash.
-Why not?

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,241
Why do you think they call it "cash-mere"?

31
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,448
-What the hell is going on?
-Sorry, honey.

32
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,494
-But Carrie had this idea about returning--
-What...

33
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,859
...was our agreement
about visitors after 9:00 p.m.?

34
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,493
-I know, it's her birthday.
-I'm on London time!

35
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,404
I've got to be up in three hours
when the markets open.

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,507
I'd really appreciate it if you'd take
the fucking noise somewhere else.

37
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,974
-I'II call you.
-Just ignore him. You don't have to Ieave.

38
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,743
It's okay.

39
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,622
-Goodnight, Grumpy.
-Get the fuck out of my house!

40
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,748
Taunting the psychotic spouse,
I realized, was not a wise move.

41
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,418
Just shut the fuck up!

42
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,487
I wondered...

43
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,502
...could their marriage be that bad,
or was their fighting a form of foreplay?

44
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,968
In which case, I was merely
the catalyst to get things going.

45
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,277
I am so sorry.

46
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,779
I'm so embarrassed.

47
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,840
Don't be.

48
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,911
He's just tired and cranky.

49
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,650
That was classic Richard:

50
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:49,194
Tyrannical, emotionally abusive.
I don't know what to do anymore.

51
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,454
Maybe there were
special circumstances tonight.

52
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,657
He works hard. He's sleep deprived.

53
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,759
BIah, blah, blah. I don't give a shit!

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,068
What would you do? Would you Ieave?

55
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,336
If things didn't change....

56
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,414
They haven't, and they won't.

57
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,575
Do you think I should Ieave him?

58
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,613
If you're not happy,
you know, Iife's too short.

59
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,380
I gotta go.

60
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,795
As I hung up, I realized I had been placed
in a classic no-win situation.

61
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,230
Telling a friend to Ieave her husband
is something you just don't do.

62
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,527
If they do break up, it's your fault.

63
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,829
If they don't,
she knows you think they should...

64
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,205
...and therefore, can't speak to you again.
You're screwed.

65
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,108
It's a shame.
There goes your cashmere connection.

66
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,240
She had me at a weak moment. I was
tired, I'd been chased out of her apartment.

67
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,942
I have a birthday Iooming.

68
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,253
-I said too much.
-No, in an intimate relationship...

69
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,053
-...you should be able to say anything.
-I disagree.

70
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,062
Practically all the relationships I know
are based on a foundation of Iies...

71
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,789
...and mutual delusion.

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,130
James and me, for instance.
I pretend he doesn't have a small dick.

73
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,169
He pretends not to notice
we haven't had sex in weeks.

74
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,640
You should join the U.N.

75
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,507
I'm in an intimate relationship
at the moment...

76
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:17,982
...and I can tell you, the Ievel of verbal
discourse has become a Iittle too intimate.

77
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,780
-Are we speaking of Spring Roll Guy?
-Who's that?

78
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,877
Aaron Melman.

79
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:26,618
He's a dermatologist I met at the
Vietnamese Iunch truck outside my office.

80
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,886
What's the problem?

81
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,087
The problem, if you can call it that...

82
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,290
...is Spring Roll Guy
liked to talk dirty in bed.

83
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,130
Baby, I just Iove the way your pussy feels.

84
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,595
So wet...

85
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,865
...and warm...

86
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,166
...and tight.

87
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,276
Kissing your beautiful tits
feels unbelievably sexy.

88
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,446
So hot and nasty.

89
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,079
How's it feel to you?

90
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,450
What you said.

91
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,382
That can be a turn on.

92
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,046
Sure, but now he wants me to reciprocate.

93
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,352
I can't. I never could.

94
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,552
Why not?

95
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,494
Because sex is not a time to chat.

96
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:09,857
It's one of the few instances in my
overly articulated, exceedingly verbal Iife...

97
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,528
...where it is perfectly appropriate,
if not preferable, to shut up.

98
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,868
Now I have to worry about
being stumped for conversation?

99
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:17,932
No, thank you.

100
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,807
Just talk about his big cock.

101
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,009
Correction, his big, beautiful cock.

102
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,744
-We're using the "C" word now?
-Sorry.

103
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,310
-I can't use adjectives.
-A simple, "You're so hard," is effective.

104
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,214
-Sometimes men need encouragement.
-Such as?

105
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,281
You know....

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,760
"Yes, stud, that's right.

107
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,257
"Don't stop, just Iike that.
C'mon, fucker, don't stop."

108
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,367
You're kidding, right?

109
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,368
No, they Iike it.

110
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,875
So, are you really telling us...

111
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,536
...that during sex you're completely mute?

112
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,740
No, I can do a good orgasm alert.

113
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,282
"I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum."

114
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,579
But that's because I'm gonna cum.

115
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,422
Anything else feels Iike make believe.

116
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,755
If you really Iike this guy,
you're gonna have to start talking.

117
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,528
Was Miranda right?

118
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,362
Have we put such a premium on being
open and honest with one another...

119
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,301
...that we've misplaced
the boundaries of propriety?

120
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,498
Are there still certain things
in a relationship one should never say?

121
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,774
My best friend got engaged
to the biggest Ioser.

122
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,745
What am I supposed to say?
"You're marrying an imbecile?"

123
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,514
My wife, she's had her breasts done twice.

124
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,411
They Iook fantastic, they feel Iike shit.

125
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,980
I keep that thought to myself.

126
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:41,325
I'm single, 38, and still hoping to get
married. I don't want to know the truth.

127
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:46,655
I told Richard I couldn't spend another day
married to a man who is an utter asshole.

128
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,393
There it was, standing across from me.

129
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,371
Biscotti-eating, cashmere-swaddled proof
that I had said too much.

130
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,066
-Then what happened?
-Once I said that, the floodgates opened.

131
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,109
He said that at our wedding,
when he Iooked at me...

132
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,411
...he felt a huge wave of disappointment
because I Iooked so generic.

133
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,610
I said, "On second thought...

134
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,846
"...I don't think the Rogaine is working."

135
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,321
He said that if I Ieave,
all he'II feel for me is pity...

136
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,690
...because he'II be remarried within a year
and I'II be single for the rest of my Iife.

137
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,856
I didn't want to tell Susan Sharon
that his last statement was probably true.

138
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,865
I just feel Iike I owe you so much.

139
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,197
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have had the guts to do this.

140
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,700
It's Iike I was under house arrest for years
and now I'm free.

141
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,235
What are you gonna do?

142
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,574
Do you mind if I stay at your place?

143
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,147
Of course not.

144
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,942
That evening,
as Susan Sharon squatted on my couch...

145
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,349
...Charlotte came home
to the new male in her life.

146
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,352
Fed up with lonely mornings,
cuddle-free nights...

147
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,259
...and the lack of unconditional love
she longed for...

148
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,163
...Charlotte took matters
into her own hands.

149
00:08:54,734 --> 00:09:00,070
She combed the city for the perfect
specimen of breeding, style and trendiness.

150
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,801
Henry, I'm home.

151
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,568
Hi, my good boy.

152
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,384
Until she found the perfect man,
Charlotte would have the perfect dog.

153
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,887
That night, Samantha,
who was never good at keeping a secret...

154
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,359
...found the one thing she couldn 't say
was the only thing she could think about.

155
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,328
Sweetheart, is anything wrong?
If there is, I want you to tell me.

156
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,957
No, honey, I'm tired.

157
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,936
I feel Iike you've become so distant,
Iike you're upset with me about something.

158
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,201
I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me.

159
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,569
I'm not upset about anything.

160
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,935
You're wonderful.

161
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,914
Will you come see
a couple's counselor with me?

162
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,750
Samantha dreaded the shrink the way
most people feared the dentist.

163
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,746
If it's really important to you--

164
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,916
Great.

165
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,854
Goodnight.

166
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,352
She longed for the simple days...

167
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,365
...of emotional unavailability
and hot one-night stands.

168
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,606
Meanwhile, across town,
Miranda was appearing as Eliza Doolittle...

169
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,403
...in My Filthy Lady.

170
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,781
I just Iove kissing this
sensitive spot right here.

171
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,376
Do you Iike that?

172
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,618
Tell me what you Iike.

173
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,713
That.

174
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,958
You Iike my hand there,
caressing your breast?

175
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,287
Sure.

176
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,458
Gently pinching your nipple.

177
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,724
Fine.

178
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,001
Kissing my chest.

179
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,869
That's hot. That really turns me on.

180
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,266
How's it feel?

181
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,501
Hot?

182
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,602
Hot.

183
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,140
And?

184
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,249
-Hairy?
-God, you're getting me hard.

185
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,481
Tell me how it feels.

186
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,045
Big.

187
00:10:58,924 --> 00:10:59,856
And?

188
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,349
Hard?

189
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,094
-Rock hard.
-Keep talking.

190
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,425
A big rock.

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,729
A hard rock.

192
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,297
A big, hard rock.

193
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,306
-A sausage.
-Baby, you are so nasty.

194
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:24,312
Surprisingly, once Miranda opened
her mouth, it was difficult to shut up.

195
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,444
A big, throbbing, rock-hard sausage.

196
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,084
That night, I took Susan Sharon
to meet the new male in Charlotte's life.

197
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,825
True to form, he was already falling
far short of her high expectations.

198
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,392
He did it a minute ago.

199
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,832
He was inconsistent...

200
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,096
Get the ball.

201
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,335
...selfishly stubborn,
and hopelessly codependent.

202
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,940
Isn't he smart?

203
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,137
We can't stay,
I want to be at your place if Richard calls.

204
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,644
Aren't you Ieaving him?

205
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,275
If he calls,
I want to say I won't talk to him.

206
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,115
That's passive aggressive. You should
only talk if you have something to say.

207
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,392
-Do you believe I married a prick?
-You didn't know he was a prick.

208
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,059
I just can't believe that prick hasn't called.

209
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,690
AIthough, he does have this sweet side.
You just don't know him very well.

210
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,794
Did I do the right thing, Henry?
Should I give him another chance--

211
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,169
He's a dog, not an oracle.

212
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,873
The next morning, I woke up
to an unsettling birthday surprise.

213
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,141
Coming.

214
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,213
Sign here.

215
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,654
Thank you.

216
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,662
My God.

217
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,634
"Best wishes on your birthday."

218
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,067
It's from Big.

219
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,634
-What kind of flowers?
-Roses, red.

220
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,436
Big.

221
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,676
Expensive.

222
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,950
-What do you think it means?
-It means rip up the card.

223
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,680
And watch out for the thorns.

224
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,552
No, this is the grand gesture.

225
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,181
The grand gesture?

226
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,623
If you break up,
and he disappears from your Iife...

227
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,129
...it wasn't meant to be.

228
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,760
But if they make a powerful declaration
of their Iove, then you have to reconsider.

229
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:28,339
You think a dozen roses and a card saying,
"Best wishes" qualifies as a grand gesture?

230
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,407
You know men. They can never say,
"I was wrong." They just send flowers.

231
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,003
Sometimes a rose is just a rose.

232
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,480
Jewelry, that's another story.

233
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,608
Henry, no.

234
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,947
Henry, no, not the purse.

235
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,621
I really don't need this on my birthday.

236
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,214
What does this mean,
the ball's in my court or something?

237
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,623
I don't want to play games.

238
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,155
This is not the grand gesture.
This is the vague gesture...

239
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,324
...which is worse than no gesture.

240
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,301
Under the guise of thoughtfulness,
he's being very selfish.

241
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,133
I agree, he's muddied the waters.

242
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,006
You're all just cuckoo. He sends flowers
on her birthday and you condemn him.

243
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,408
Henry, no. No, damn it.

244
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,510
For chrissake, give the dog a break.

245
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,142
He's eaten four pairs of shoes.
I don't want him starting on purses.

246
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,516
Damn it, now. We're gonna go home.

247
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:18,416
You wanted to get out and socialize,
but you'II have to Iearn to behave.

248
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,087
Speaking of cuckoo....

249
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,499
Charlotte was at the point where
she was starting to see the real Henry.

250
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,635
But she did raise a valid question.

251
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,200
Was, "I was wrong, "
the one thing Mr. Big couldn 't say?

252
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,045
I realized that just because
we were no longer together...

253
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,105
...didn 't mean I couldn 't be polite.

254
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,485
It's me.

255
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,444
Carrie.

256
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,921
How are you?

257
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,585
Great. I wanted to call
and thank you for the flowers.

258
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,321
That was thoughtful of you.

259
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,232
My secretary had it on her calendar,
so I, you know....

260
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,202
Your secretary sent them?

261
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:10,038
I sent the flowers,
my secretary alerted me to the day.

262
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,545
That was very thoughtful of her
and you for sending them.

263
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,339
You're welcome.
What are you doing on the big day?

264
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,248
Stanford's arranged this party
down at Layla, that Moroccan restaurant.

265
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,413
You should come.

266
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,549
The instant the words popped out
of my mouth, I regretted them.

267
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,625
I made plans already.

268
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,164
Or not. I mean, just forget it.

269
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,366
I could stop by Iater.

270
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,168
Fine. Whatever.

271
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,305
I may bring someone.

272
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,472
Come and bring that person
and maybe I'II see you Iater.

273
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,207
Thank you again for the thoughtful flowers.

274
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,475
I couldn't believe it.

275
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:58,284
I had just invited my ex and his date
to my birthday party.

276
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,955
As if getting older
wasn't traumatic enough.

277
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,262
That afternoon in the office
of Velma Rudin...

278
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,424
...celebrated psychologist
and author of In-to-me-see...

279
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,865
...A Couple's Guide to Intimacy...

280
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:14,770
...Samantha did her best not to say
the thing she knew she shouldn 't say.

281
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,400
I've noticed that our sex Iife
has diminished.

282
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,103
That's normal, isn't it?
I mean, after a while--

283
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,079
How Iong has it been?

284
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,206
A month.

285
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,509
Don't take it all so seriously.

286
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,883
Have fun with your sexuality.

287
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,150
Have you tried playing erotic games?

288
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,419
Samantha almost confessed that James...

289
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,088
...had been playing
"hide the salami" since they met.

290
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,996
I'm just not feeling very sexual these days.

291
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,195
I saw you masturbating the other day
when I came out of the shower.

292
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:52,175
Many women are simply unable
to achieve orgasm through intercourse.

293
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,040
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

294
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,079
You have a problem with intimacy.

295
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,513
No, that's not it.

296
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,583
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

297
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,579
Nothing you say can hurt me,
as Iong as it's what you're feeling.

298
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,180
That seems to be
all the time we have for today.

299
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,024
Nice work, you two.

300
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,486
Shall we say next week, same time?

301
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,756
Good for me.

302
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,163
The idea of seeing Velma "In-to-me-see"
Rudin on a weekly basis...

303
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,569
...was much more
than Samantha could bear.

304
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,697
Your penis is too small.

305
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,206
Excuse me?

306
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,336
It doesn't--and it just--it can't.

307
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,404
I can't.

308
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,110
It's just too damn small.

309
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,921
Did you ever stop to think
that maybe your vagina is too big?

310
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,662
What can I say? I need a big dick.

311
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,065
I hear that.

312
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,004
As Samantha paid the price
of mentioning the unmentionable...

313
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,565
...Miranda discovered that free speech
comes with a cost of its own.

314
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,408
I just Iove putting my hand
around your cock.

315
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,041
I just Iove hearing you say "cock."

316
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,845
Your big hard cock.

317
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,417
Cock, cock, cock.

318
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,154
Why couldn't I ever say that before?

319
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,716
It's just a word.

320
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,758
Why does it turn us both on when I say it?

321
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,964
What else do you Iike?

322
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,864
I Iike it when you're rough.

323
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,037
When you throw my Iegs over your head,
I Iose control.

324
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,306
What do I Iike?

325
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,673
You Iike it when I'm biting your nipple.

326
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,872
What else?

327
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,349
You Iike it when I'm kissing your balls.

328
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,011
Keep going.

329
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,356
You really Iike it when
I slip my finger in your ass.

330
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,720
Excuse me?

331
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,457
You just Iove a finger in your ass.

332
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,999
How could I know,
"You Iove a finger in your ass"...

333
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,064
...is the one thing you can't say?

334
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,042
Trust me, that's not the only thing.

335
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,977
-But it's true, he enjoys it.
-So do a Iot of men.

336
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,173
They enjoy it, but don't want it
brought to their attention.

337
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,741
Personally, I don't Iike anything in my ass.

338
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,819
I know that may come as a surprise.

339
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,949
I just feel so betrayed.

340
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:25,395
He wanted me to talk dirty, I got into it,
then he pulled the rug out from under me.

341
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,763
Men are so frustratingly inconsistent.
That's why I Iove my Henry.

342
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,098
He's a big Iove bug. You tell him
anything and he Iicks your face.

343
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,503
Charlotte, you may be onto something.

344
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,970
Another double vodka rocks
for the birthday girl.

345
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,601
The truth was, vodka was my only ally.

346
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,170
At any moment, Big was gonna walk in
with his gorgeous date...

347
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:48,117
...smile at me like some distant stranger
and say something crushing--

348
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,720
Happy birthday, baby.

349
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,191
GIad you could make it.

350
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,783
I can't stay Iong.

351
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,453
I Ieft my camel outside.

352
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,095
You remember Jack?

353
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,862
Jack is your date?

354
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,770
I wasn't aware
we were formally dating, but--

355
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,467
It is so good to see you again.

356
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,939
How have you been?

357
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,743
Marvelous, I split up with a bitch who
broke my heart. She didn't get my money.

358
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,646
Happy birthday to me.

359
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,453
An hour later, my Arabian Nights fantasy...

360
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,555
...birthday felt like Midnight Express.

361
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,899
-How are you?
-Great.

362
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,062
How are you?

363
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,002
Good. Fine.

364
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,104
Good.

365
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,575
Excuse me,
what is your ex doing at your birthday?

366
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,974
I told him to drop by for a drink.

367
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,407
I didn't think he'd stay for a Iap dance.

368
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,107
My God, have you tried the baba ganooj?

369
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,713
It is to die for.

370
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,481
I don't eat baba ganooj.

371
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,020
You don't know what you're missing.

372
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,616
I can't believe the bastard dared to come.

373
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,989
I can't believe what
she does with her navel.

374
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,190
PIease, I'm about to Iose my couscous.

375
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,593
While I watched my ex
get a Mesopotamian lap dance...

376
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,967
...Susan Sharon made a play
for Mr. Marvelous.

377
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,506
I can't deal with being single all over again.

378
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,042
Every relationship has its ups and downs.

379
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,203
My husband and I work very hard.

380
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,770
We probably don't spend
enough damn time together.

381
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:27,078
Compounded by the fact that neither of us
gets enough sleep. Then again, who does?

382
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,651
I really never imagined myself
as a divorcee, you know?

383
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,716
It's more important to till your own soil
than to go in search of greener pastures.

384
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,588
Do you ever shut the fuck up?

385
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:47,066
In that moment, Susan Sharon realized
she desperately missed her husband.

386
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,412
That night, Charlotte came home
to a very unpleasant surprise.

387
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,280
Bad!

388
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,152
Charlotte realized,
like so many males before him...

389
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,161
...Henry had shit all over her perfect world.

390
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,197
He and Charlotte soon parted ways.

391
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:17,599
The one thing she could never say was,
"I got rid of the puppy."

392
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,601
We all know what happened to him.

393
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,266
He'd become the glue that put Susan
Sharon and her husband back together.

394
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,402
Shut up.

395
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,037
Shut the fuck up.

396
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,604
Although neither of them could
admit that a dog saved their marriage.

397
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:35,551
Later that evening, as my birthday passed
into the early hours of just another day...

398
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,315
...I found myself alone
on the street with Mr. Big.

399
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,957
Another year older.

400
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,452
And none the wiser.

401
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,790
That's the way it goes.

402
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,192
-Can I give you a ride home?
-No, I'm just gonna grab a cab.

403
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,793
-Do you need cab fare?
-No, I'm okay.

404
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:57,001
Good, because I think I Ieft all my $20
in that belly dancer's crotch.

405
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,878
Goodnight.

406
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,150
Goodnight.

407
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:37,315
As I watched him go, I realized the one
thing I couldn't say to Mr. Big was...

408
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,176
... "I'm still not over you. "



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
