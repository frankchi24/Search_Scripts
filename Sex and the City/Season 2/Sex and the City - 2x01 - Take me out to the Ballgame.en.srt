1
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,513
When you live on a tiny island
like Manhattan...

2
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,650
...the odds of bumping into the one
who broke your heart are incredibly high.

3
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:02,421
The odds of bumping into him
when you look like shit are even higher.

4
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,438
After a break-up,
certain streets, locations...

5
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,808
...even times of day are off-limits.

6
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,749
The city becomes a deserted battlefield
loaded with emotional land mines.

7
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:33,750
You have to be very careful where
you step or you could be blown to pieces.

8
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,166
Get your coat, Anne Frank,
we're going out.

9
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,964
-I'm really not in the mood.
-Coat on. Body out.

10
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,969
-Where are we going?
-It's a surprise.

11
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,701
Only if it's nowhere I can run into him.

12
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:52,574
When do you think you're gonna be
getting out of this hostage situation?

13
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,907
Am I wrong?

14
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,345
Don't Iisten to her, it's only been a month.

15
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,076
It takes half the total time you went out
with someone to get over them.

16
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,451
I always Iike a math solution
to any Iove problem.

17
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,355
It's the break-up rule.
You and Big only went out for a year.

18
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,859
She's got five more months
to get over him.

19
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,157
Cut your Iosses and get back in the game.

20
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,755
When Eric and I broke up,
I got over him right away.

21
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,060
I don't really remember it being Iike that.

22
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,459
Eric who?

23
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,833
Eric, asshole I dated a couple of years ago.

24
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,065
That Eric.

25
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,166
Miranda called Eric the love of her life
until he left her for another woman.

26
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,041
Now, she almost never mentioned him.

27
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,205
You can't push yourself into feeling good.

28
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,945
The only way to get over somebody is
to feel really bad, cry to your girlfriends...

29
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:37,112
...and to replay what you hated about him
over and over in your head all day.

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,919
That sounds about right.

31
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,323
You're too dressed up
for where we're going.

32
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:46,331
I'II risk being overdressed vs. the chance
of meeting Big Iooking the way I feel.

33
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,424
The first meeting is the worst,
you never know how to act.

34
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,333
Then there's the vomiting.

35
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,768
If Big had any class,
he would've moved away. I was here first.

36
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,812
You're giving him too much power.
You broke up with him.

37
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,313
Right, and that makes me what, happy?

38
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,738
Taxi!

39
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,513
Amazingly, Samantha was still
with James. A monogamous relationship...

40
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,145
...for a woman whose bedroom
was busier than Balducci's on a Saturday.

41
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,517
You Iovebirds....

42
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,963
How are the most beautiful women
in Manhattan?

43
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,066
If we see them, I'II ask.

44
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:23,994
Have a fun day.

45
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,038
Don't Iet anything bad
happen to my princess.

46
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,335
I Iove you.

47
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,544
God, everything is going so great.

48
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,618
Me, James, and his tiny penis:
We're one big happy family.

49
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,582
After two months,
despite all his sweetness and charm...

50
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:47,150
...Samantha still hadn't quite accepted
James's shortcomings.

51
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,826
When Miranda said,
"Get back in the game," she meant it.

52
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,096
Forty minutes and a $55 cab ride later,
we found ourselves at Yankee Stadium.

53
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,768
Who wants another?

54
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,997
Miranda was a fan of the Yankees.

55
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:05,510
I was a fan of being able to smoke
and drink at 2:00 p.m. withoutjudgment.

56
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,306
Beer!

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,272
Do they have hot cocoa?

58
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,712
Coming up to bat, the new Yankee.

59
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,819
Just up from the Minors, single. So cute.

60
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,623
I can barely see him.
Why are we sitting all the way up here?

61
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,423
It's the only place I can smoke without
Giuliani putting me away for 10 years.

62
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,986
These seats suck.

63
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,363
This hot dog sucks. My entire Iife sucks.

64
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,128
Your Iife doesn't suck.
You have a man who Ioves you.

65
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,228
Love!

66
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,001
I don't think you Iadies understand
the seriousness of my situation.

67
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,979
How would you Iike to make Iove
to this every night?

68
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,681
Is it kosher?

69
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,509
Don't make me Iaugh. It's tragic.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,052
Can we try and get into the game
for a second?

71
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,158
C'mon! Show us what you got.

72
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,250
Last year this guy was Mr. September.

73
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,795
He hit ten home runs in nine days.

74
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,961
Ball! Good eye!

75
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,294
Way to watch them.

76
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,166
He batted.373. He drove in 47 runs.

77
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,136
His on-base percentage was.410.

78
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,969
As Miranda went on
about the new Yankee's stats...

79
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,204
...I couldn 't help wondering about my own.

80
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,111
Ten years playing in New York.
Countless dates.

81
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,208
Five real relationships. One serious.
All ending in break-ups.

82
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:24,187
If I were a ballplayer I'd be batting....
Whatever really bad is.

83
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,289
My God! Here it comes!

84
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,929
You got it!

85
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,697
Do you know what the odds
of catching a fly ball are?

86
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,038
I didn't. I couldn't help wondering
if they were any higher...

87
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,442
...than finding a relationship
that would last.

88
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,877
Three innings, four beers and one
shameless flash of my press pass later....

89
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,076
We waited outside the locker room
to get my ball signed by the new Yankee.

90
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,481
Good game.

91
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,083
Did you see that bulge?

92
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,288
He was wearing a cup.

93
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,756
His cup runneth over.

94
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,298
It's official, you're drunk.

95
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,963
I'm not drunk, I'm sedated from my pain.

96
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,907
She's allowed to be drunk,
she's going through a break-up.

97
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,710
Excuse me. Huge Yankee fan.

98
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,808
We don't mean to bother you
but my friend caught your ball.

99
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,178
This is her.

100
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,613
I'm her friend.

101
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,258
We were wondering if you'd sign it?

102
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,656
-That foul ball to the upper deck?
-Yes. I mean....

103
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,261
Yes. If it's not too....

104
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,491
I'm a huge Yankees fan. I'm a Iawyer.

105
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,466
If I don't sign it, you'II sue me?

106
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,265
No. I don't know why I said that.

107
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,932
No problem, give me the ball.

108
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,442
Give him the ball.

109
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,939
-Could you hold these?
-Sure.

110
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,444
-You a Yankees fan, too?
-No, I came for the beer.

111
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,985
I think baseball's a Iittle dull.

112
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,457
-What do you do?
-She writes a column.

113
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,117
A sex column.

114
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,157
-Nothin' dull about that.
-You'd be surprised.

115
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,755
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

116
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,667
He's so cute.

117
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,763
I'm gonna ask him
to the Dolce & Gabbana party.

118
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,203
What?

119
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,475
No, really, you can't.

120
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,008
Yankee!

121
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,182
I don't know if it was the beer
or the fact that I was holding his ball.

122
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,590
Something gave me the strength
to ask the new Yankee out.

123
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,829
No. This is not fair.

124
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,263
This is not the way
this is supposed to happen.

125
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,832
Why? You told me
to get back in the game.

126
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,098
With some balding C.P.A.
or other boring rebound guy.

127
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,505
Nobody rebounds with the new Yankee.

128
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,079
Maybe I'm the new Carrie.
Let's blow this hot dog stand.

129
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,818
Samantha, Iet's go.

130
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,048
She knew it was risky,
but a day of watching big men...

131
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,991
...swing their big wooden bats
proved to be too much for Samantha.

132
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,762
She told herself
there's no harm in just looking.

133
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,808
Can I help you?

134
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,950
As my ballpark cheap beer buzz wore off...

135
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,422
...I began to worry
about the ramifications of my day.

136
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,260
Was Charlotte right?

137
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,297
Were we supposed to get over an ex
in a slow, painful way?

138
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,733
Or should we ignore all the bad feelings
and throw ourselves back in the game?

139
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,735
In a world where leaving each other
seems to be getting more frequent....

140
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,837
What are the break-up rules?

141
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,441
Whatever you do, man, don't cry.

142
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:12,173
'Cause if you do get back together again,
then, you're the guy that cried.

143
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,819
Don't call or see him
'til three months have passed...

144
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,052
...and you've Iost the weight
you put on while breaking up.

145
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,356
Give her whatever she wants,
but don't sign a motherfucking thing.

146
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,854
Change your name,
change your phone number.

147
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,093
Change your job. They're all bums.

148
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,998
You got a problem?

149
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,474
Friday night, the Dolce & Gabbana party.

150
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,870
The new Yankee was 10 minutes late.

151
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,036
I was running 20 behind.

152
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,184
I was reaching
for my favorite necklace when....

153
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:55,154
I thought I'd destroyed all the evidence,
but there it was.

154
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,422
We'd taken it with a disposable camera...

155
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,795
...before it ever dawned on me
that we could be disposable as well.

156
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,934
It was then and there I created
my own very first break-up rule:

157
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,339
Destroy all pictures where he looks sexy
and you look happy.

158
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,938
The party was a complete home run.

159
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,243
All the fashion heavy-hitters were there.

160
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,149
Charlotte was dating Paul Ericson...

161
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,658
...the V.P. of a major recording label's
classical and jazz division.

162
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,418
Having a good time?

163
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,995
You won't believe it.
This guy's never heard Miles Davis.

164
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,360
I don't really Iike that jazz stuff.

165
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,561
I'm gonna give you our
Best of Miles Davis CD.

166
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,334
His stuff will change your mind.

167
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,638
His concentration and emotion
in the phrasing....

168
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,501
It's fucking magical.

169
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,173
He was handsome, smart, eclectic.

170
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,215
The perfect match for Charlotte.

171
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,108
Except for one minor snag.

172
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:57,952
The authenticity of Miles' timbre
is gonna blow you away.

173
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:02,593
The fusion revolution changed
the entire concept of contemporary music.

174
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,332
There we were, two single gals
out on the town with our ballplayers.

175
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,143
What's wrong?

176
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,976
I thought I saw....

177
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,376
-Where?
-No, it wasn't him.

178
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,752
Do you think he'II be here?

179
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,352
I don't know, I hadn't thought about it.

180
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,284
Break-up rule number two:

181
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,393
Lie. It's a lot easier than admitting
that's why you invited the new Yankee...

182
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,295
...and why you maxed out your credit card
to buy the dress.

183
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,028
When Mr. Big never made an appearance,
I decided to make the best of it.

184
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,865
I actually got to know
a little about this new Yankee.

185
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,167
His name was Joe.

186
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,142
So, Joe, the new Yankee....

187
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,843
How'd you Iike your first fashion party?

188
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,910
It was kind of cool.

189
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,242
What?

190
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,247
Nothing. It's just....

191
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,917
"Kind of cool."

192
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,918
You're very succinct.

193
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,583
Are you making fun of me?

194
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,128
A Iittle bit.

195
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,023
You're kind of cute.

196
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,993
You're kind of cute, too.

197
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,903
And there, in the shadow of my island...

198
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,807
...just four weeks out
of my last relationship...

199
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,143
...I let the new Yankee get to first base.

200
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:36,478
Our Saturday morning ritual: coffee, eggs,
and a very private dish session.

201
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,680
Today our dish wasn't so private.

202
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,349
You're on page six.

203
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,952
"Hot Yankee Joe Stark on the town
with New York columnist...

204
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,964
"...and 'sex-pert', Carrie Bradshaw."

205
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,761
It's a proud day for me.

206
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,531
That dress just paid for itself.
Big is gonna see this and die.

207
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,129
I don't want him to die.

208
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,106
Cut the shit, it's me.
You're using that Yankee.

209
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,113
Everybody has got to Iook
at my new Palm Pilot.

210
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,978
-It's amazing.
-This is so great.

211
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,450
The first time Big sees you,
you Iook great and you're with the Yankee.

212
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,780
Why are we still talking about him?
He hurt her.

213
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,585
He's out of the picture.

214
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,626
Let's talk about something else, okay?

215
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,769
I have a problem with my boyfriend.

216
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,841
I'm gonna go get the check.

217
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,638
I don't know really quite how to say this,
but he's always...

218
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,538
...touching his--

219
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,546
Balls. I know, Carrie told me.

220
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,082
It freaked me out.
I didn't know what the hell was going on.

221
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,712
I still don't. What is?

222
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,550
I don't know but it's constant.
He can't seem to Ieave them alone.

223
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,560
He and every other guy on the planet.

224
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,858
They always try to pull our attention there.

225
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,023
"Look what I got."

226
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,225
I don't get it. He's from a good family.

227
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,895
He went to Brown. Why is he doing that?

228
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,697
-Does he have Iow-hangers?
-Is that a patented phrase?

229
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,365
Sometimes they hang so Iow,
they get in the way.

230
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,743
I heard Nick Nolte had a ball Iift.

231
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,109
I don't know how Iong they are.

232
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:13,074
You've been dating for three weeks
and you haven't seen his balls yet?

233
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,718
Get with the program.

234
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,947
But why do men do this?

235
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,321
How would they feel if we stood around
in public touching ourselves?

236
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,553
They'd Iove it.

237
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,161
What are we talking about?

238
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,060
Charlotte's boyfriend's balls.

239
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,521
Seriously?

240
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,100
-They're too Iong.
-She's just guessing.

241
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,730
Okay. That's it.

242
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,302
I'm out of here.

243
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,673
AII we talk about anymore...

244
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,210
...is Big or balls or small dicks.

245
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,549
Why do four smart women
have nothing to talk about but boyfriends?

246
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,583
It's Iike seventh grade with bank accounts.
What about us?

247
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,187
What we think, we feel, we know...Christ!

248
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,320
Does it always have to be about them?

249
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:02,122
Give me a call when you're ready to talk
about something besides men for a change.

250
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:07,738
In the case of Miranda Hobbes vs. silly
women everywhere, the verdict was in.

251
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,973
Guilty as charged.

252
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,305
After breakfast,
Charlotte and I went shopping.

253
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,344
Break-up rule number three:

254
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,577
Until emotionally stabilized,
enter no stores.

255
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,351
Later, Samantha and James were
about to enter the seventh inning stretch.

256
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:30,392
When I arch my back, I want you to Iift
that ass and really give it to me.

257
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,564
Rather than quit mid-season,
Samantha decided to attack her problem...

258
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,600
...with the gusto of a seasoned coach
training a rookie.

259
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,963
Go, go, Iift. Lift that ass.

260
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,499
Give it to me!

261
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,311
A good coach encourages and motivates.

262
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,612
You are so hot.

263
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,780
Fuck me. You hot stud.

264
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,890
A good coach disciplines and criticizes.

265
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,656
No. What are you doing back there?

266
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,922
Let's go.

267
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,556
And like every good coach...

268
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,726
...she passed on the benefits
of her years of experience.

269
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,336
Baby, I'm close.

270
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,439
Get up here and slide inside of me.

271
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:19,066
Hurry, slide, slide, slide!

272
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,609
Then, at the bottom of the ninth try,
with two balls and two strikes.

273
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,151
The coach had no choice,
but to bring in a pinch hitter.

274
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,157
What's that?

275
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,421
It's my vibrator.

276
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,823
I thought it would be fun.

277
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,498
I think just us might be more fun.

278
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,061
That's not a problem, is it?

279
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,709
But there was no joy in Mudville.

280
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,311
Mighty Samantha had struck out.

281
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,450
But a little further uptown,
the ball game was just getting started.

282
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,714
I have a present for you.

283
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,714
I thought you just gave me one.

284
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,858
I was at Barneys today.

285
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,368
Here.

286
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,037
Charlotte had decided a possible solution
to her problem...

287
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,167
...might be as simple as briefs vs. boxers.

288
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,303
The salesman said
that these were the very best.

289
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,849
They're Iike the Wonderbra for men.

290
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,509
They give good support,
something about the pouch.

291
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,421
We haven't even made Iove
and you're out shopping for me?

292
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,513
SIow down.

293
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,090
It's not Iike that--

294
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,315
It's what?

295
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:48,098
But Charlotte couldn't bring herself
to tell him the problem was foul balls.

296
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,927
This is too fast. Way too fast.

297
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,264
First comes the underwear,
then you move in.

298
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,432
And then the next thing I know,
you hate my music.

299
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,575
And that was that.

300
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,373
He broke it off after only three weeks.

301
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,848
Charlotte, true to form,
was over him in exactly a week and a half.

302
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,288
Whenever Miranda was feeling stressed,
she went for a long walk.

303
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,983
She'd lose herself in the places and faces...

304
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,654
...and whatever was bothering her
would somehow lift.

305
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,356
But today, she would have no such luck.

306
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,561
I really thought he Iiked me.
Why didn't he call me?

307
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,898
Just when Miranda decided
she was the only woman in New York...

308
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,772
...with any real perspective on men....

309
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,506
There he was. Eric Asshole.

310
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,644
The former love of her life.

311
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,083
Walking hand and hand
with the woman he left her for.

312
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,298
Somewhere between playing
the Royals and the Red Sox...

313
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,839
...the new Yankee found a minute
to teach me some dugout pastimes.

314
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,238
One, two, three, toss.

315
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,134
Shit.

316
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,737
If you don't get this,
we don't move on to spitting.

317
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,975
Hold my beer.

318
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,421
-Back, back, back.
-Sorry.

319
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,123
Break-up rule number four:

320
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,053
Never stop thinking
about him even for a moment...

321
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,092
...because that's the moment he'll appear.

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,060
As he made his way through the crowd,
I felt calm.

323
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,830
I had accomplished
the perfect first meeting.

324
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,464
I looked good, I felt good,
and I was with the new Yankee.

325
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,632
Surprise.

326
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,774
Look at you....

327
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,708
I've been....

328
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,382
-How've you--
-Good, good, good.

329
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,816
-Sorry. This is Joe Stark.
-I know who he is.

330
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,047
I'm a big fan. Good Iuck this season.

331
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,522
Thanks.

332
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,287
I saw your picture in the paper.

333
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,429
You never Iooked better.

334
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,288
You want another round?

335
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,930
Some buddies are at a bar on BIeeker.

336
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,869
-How about it?
-Sure.

337
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,113
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm really sorry, it's not you. This is....

339
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,189
This is really embarrassing.

340
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,121
-I'm sorry. I'm really embarrassed.
-You're okay.

341
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,231
I don't think I'm okay. I just....

342
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,090
I just cried in your mouth.

343
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,202
I just--I can't....

344
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,439
I'm not ready.

345
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,337
That guy in the bar....

346
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,077
That suit guy.

347
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,484
I better go. Sorry.

348
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,542
-You want a ride home?
-No, please.

349
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,453
Don't pay any more attention to me.
Just go, please.

350
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,759
Go to that bar thing.
I'm just gonna get a cab, all right?

351
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,927
PIease. Will you just go?

352
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,862
AII right, then I'II go.

353
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,778
But I didn't go home. I couldn't.

354
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,183
I went to a pay phone.

355
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,619
It's me.

356
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,115
Hi, Iisten.

357
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,383
I know things are really weird
between us right now.

358
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,523
But I really need to talk.

359
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,056
Can you....

360
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,826
Will you meet me at our place
in 15 minutes?

361
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,398
Okay.

362
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,200
I saw Big.

363
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,509
And I completely fell apart.

364
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,575
I know you want me to be over him--

365
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,839
I'm a jerk.

366
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,181
That's my stuff. It's not you.

367
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,415
I saw Eric on the street today.

368
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,713
And I hid.

369
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,850
After two years.

370
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,893
I forgot how hard it is.

371
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,229
Just take all the time you need, okay?

372
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,106
These are cold.

373
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:37,871
So?

374
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,278
And finally,
the most important break-up rule:

375
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,154
No matter who broke your heart
or how long it takes to heal...

376
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,488
...you'll never get through it
without your friends.
