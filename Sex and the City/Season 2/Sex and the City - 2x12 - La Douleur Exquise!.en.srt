1
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,218
New York City restaurants are
always looking for the next new angle...

2
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,721
...to grab that elusive
and somewhat jaded Manhattan palate.

3
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,814
Last year, it was "Fusion-Cajun. "

4
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,286
Last month,
it was "Mussels from Brussels. "

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,419
And tonight, it's "S & M. "

6
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,996
Samantha's PR firm was hired to do
the opening party for La Douleur Exquise.

7
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,466
Translation: The Exquisite Pain.

8
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,637
Of course, we were all invited.

9
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,674
This is what happens
when the Mayor shuts down the sex shops.

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,539
Pops up in your cuisine.

11
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,843
Stanford!

12
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,775
I know where I'm taking Mother for dinner
the next time she's in town.

13
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,778
-Honey!
-Excuse me.

14
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,082
Let her through!

15
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,523
-What are you wearing?
-The invitation said "kinky."

16
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,220
I kinked my hair.

17
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,087
The Iadies are inside. Go have fun.

18
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,327
Next!

19
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,193
Excuse me,
but when did wild sex come back in style?

20
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,103
I think it was the weekend
you spent at the Barneys warehouse sale.

21
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:54,977
Three Cosmopolitans, a Diet Coke,
and a vodka Martini with a twist.

22
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,172
I said olive.

23
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,979
Bad waiter, bad waiter.

24
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,517
-What do you tip for that?
-Anyone else want a whack?

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,886
How does he wait on tables
dressed Iike that? It's humiliating.

26
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,055
The summer I worked at Howard Johnsons,
I wore an orange hat.

27
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,431
Don't be so judgmental.
This is just a sexual expression.

28
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,095
AII these people have jobs
and pay their bills.

29
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,731
They're just having fun with fetishes.

30
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,270
I wonder what your fetish is?

31
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,108
Charlotte has a thing
for Crabtree and Evelyn potpourri.

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,149
-I don't have a fetish!
-We all have a fetish.

33
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,574
The difference between us and them is:

34
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,177
They're putting it out there
where everyone can see.

35
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,689
I think it's healthy and fabulous.

36
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,552
It was Iovely to see you all.

37
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,351
And remember Iadies:

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,430
Whipping on the first date
is considered forward.

39
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,490
Sit your ass down, Mistress Carrie.
There are drinks present.

40
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,402
No can do. Big's flying to Paris tomorrow
for business and I wanna say goodbye.

41
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,635
Why not give him a goodbye
he'II never forget?

42
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,067
Sacrebleu!

43
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,039
Go get him, girl.

44
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,921
Laugh, it's a joke.

45
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,218
Wait, wait. Not so fast.

46
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,161
Let me see.

47
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,465
Baby.

48
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,804
Baby?

49
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:45,813
I wasn't sure if it was the cap,
the crop, or me, but it worked.

50
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:51,727
Meanwhile, at a fetish across town,
Stanford Blanche had a secret sex life.

51
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:56,427
A very active secret sex life
on the Internet as "Rick9Plus. "

52
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,398
It all started innocently enough
as a goof on a lonely Friday night.

53
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:04,705
But pretty soon he was logging in
hours and hours on his favorite website.

54
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,940
It was a comfort to know
that others shared his underwear fetish.

55
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,108
Sometimes as many as 2,000 hits a day.

56
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,544
No sooner had Rick9Plus
entered the chat room...

57
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:19,148
...that he got a message from his favorite
on-screen pal, "Bigtool4U. "

58
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,962
Some fetishes can only flourish
behind closed doors...

59
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,327
...in the very late night hours on a laptop.

60
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:32,271
While others are out in the broad
daylight where everyone can see them.

61
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,908
Charlotte, like every other normal woman
in Manhattan, had a thing for shoes.

62
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,415
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

63
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,744
-Beautiful shoes.
-Just got those in.

64
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,784
-Would you Iike to try them on?
-No.

65
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,722
I'm just Iooking.
I have way too many shoes as it is.

66
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,321
Size seven?

67
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,692
Size seven.

68
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,233
You are bad.

69
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,666
I'm just trying them on.

70
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:16,545
I can't even afford them. I'm saving
for a summershare in the Hamptons.

71
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,148
Beautiful.

72
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,812
Look at that craftsmanship.

73
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,921
I Iove them.

74
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,381
-How much?
-$400.

75
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,689
No. I can't.

76
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,295
PIease take it off before I start to cry.

77
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,523
$200.

78
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,094
-Why?
-Shoes were meant to be Ioved.

79
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,071
You're gonna need a beautiful sandal
Iike that in the Hamptons.

80
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,965
Thank you so much.

81
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,342
-Buster.
-Thank you, Buster.

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,706
While one woman was uptown
eyeing her artful new sandal...

83
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,979
...another was downtown eyeing
Art of Scandal:

84
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,850
The Life and Times
of Isabella Stewart Gardner.

85
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,652
Miranda was obsessed with reading
historical biographies. In fact...

86
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,162
...she spent all last weekend in bed
with Philip of Spain.

87
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,091
'Morning.

88
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,999
That's very good. Crazy Horse and Custer:

89
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,533
The Parallel Lives
of Two American Warriors.

90
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,596
Stephen Ambrose. Great writer.

91
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,869
I know. I just finished his...

92
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,505
...Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson:
Undaunted Courage.

93
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,509
Amazing.

94
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:28,180
I'II pick that up right after I finish
F.D.R.: The New York Years.

95
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,578
Jack.

96
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,381
Miranda.

97
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,089
And right after Miranda picked up
EIizabeth I by Jasper Riley...

98
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,564
...Jack picked up Miranda.

99
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,568
Big and I stayed in bed all morning...

100
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,366
...which gave us just enough time
for coffee and some last minute details.

101
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,031
I'm gonna miss you.

102
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:53,037
I'II be back in a week and you can sit there
and watch as I unpack.

103
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,245
There. I helped.

104
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,886
Before I forget, Charlotte wants to do
a share in the Hamptons.

105
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,828
Are we thinking about it
or should I go in on that?

106
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:16,335
-Don't think I can.
-Why, not a big fan of the $40 crab salad?

107
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,001
There's a possibility
I'm not gonna be here this summer.

108
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,667
I may have to move to Paris for work.

109
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,606
Just for a while.

110
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,306
For how Iong a while?

111
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,344
I don't know.
Seven months, maybe a year.

112
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,916
Nothing's definite.

113
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,077
Wait!

114
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,253
Wait, wait, wait.

115
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,489
How Iong have you known?

116
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,822
It's been in the works for a while.
I'II know more details after this trip.

117
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,763
When did you plan on telling me?

118
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,468
When I knew more. Nothing's definite.
Don't get carried away.

119
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,668
There's the car.

120
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,206
I have to go, or I'II miss the plane.

121
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,042
We'II figure this all out when I get back.

122
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,916
I wanted to kill him!

123
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,181
He's standing there giving me
the "what's-the-big-problem" eyes.

124
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,448
I don't understand, Iike it's my problem.

125
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,753
Calm down.
There are ways to make this work.

126
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,089
It's seven months.
You can go visit in Paris.

127
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,391
-He can come back here.
-It's not about that.

128
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:21,661
It's about the fact that I wasn't even
a factor in his decision-making process.

129
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,032
-Totally.
-Men do this all the time.

130
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,127
Women walking around thinking "we."

131
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,003
And their version of "we"
is "me and my dick."

132
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:29,973
Totally.

133
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,738
Just tell me what's going on!
Is that too much to ask?

134
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,646
"Carrie, I'm thinking about going to France
for the rest of my Iife!"

135
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,416
-Am I right?
-Totally.

136
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,612
One minute he's all over me,
and the next he's pushing me away.

137
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,521
And I just cannot believe
this is happening, again!

138
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,719
Yes, calm down.
There'II be no breaking of things.

139
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,887
Why do I keep doing this to myself?

140
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,130
I must be a masochist or something.

141
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,901
That's when I first realized it.

142
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,103
I was in an S & M relationship
with Mr. Big.

143
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,470
Excuse me.

144
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,870
In love relationships, there is a fine line
between pleasure and pain.

145
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,144
In fact, it's a common belief
that a relationship without pain...

146
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,549
...is a relationship not worth having.

147
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,951
To some, pain implies growth.

148
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,851
But how do we know
when the growing pains stop...

149
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,984
...and the "pain-pains" take over?

150
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,391
Are we masochists or optimists,
if we continue to walk that fine line?

151
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,531
When it comes to relationships...

152
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,065
...how do you know
when enough is enough?

153
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,674
When you read The Complete War Memoirs
of Charles de Gaulle...

154
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,005
...get back to me.

155
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,140
On Tuesday night,
Miranda and Jack had dinner.

156
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,144
In the biography of her life...

157
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,617
...this would go down
as the best first date in history.

158
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,687
This is kind of what I wanted to show you.

159
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,391
Mark Twain Iived here.

160
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,161
Right around the time he wrote Huck Finn.

161
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,926
Really?

162
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,628
Come on.

163
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,732
-It's private property.
-I know.

164
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,141
I'm gonna show you his Iittle house.

165
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,679
Right there, number 27.

166
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,212
It's cute.

167
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,228
Just when Miranda thought
she could read Jack perfectly...

168
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,665
...he opened an entire new chapter.

169
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,862
No.

170
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,106
Someone might come by,
we could get caught.

171
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,470
I know.

172
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,842
A chapter entitled:

173
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,478
"I like to have sex in places
I can get caught."

174
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,110
With my one man out of town in Paris...

175
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,677
...I found time to have drinks
with my other man.

176
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,223
I need your advice.

177
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,684
But in order to get it,
I have to confess something.

178
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,854
-I'm asking you not to judge me.
-Who am I to judge anyone?

179
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,057
I had bangs in the 80s.

180
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,193
I have cybersex on the Internet.

181
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,398
And this would be the nonjudgment part?

182
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,531
My name is Rick9PIus.

183
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,900
No, you didn't!

184
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,836
Rick9PIus: How sad is that?

185
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:26,145
I think it shows a great deal of restraint.
You could have been "Rick11."

186
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:31,112
So, I've been chatting with this guy
and we have a really great time.

187
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,790
But now he wants to meet
and I don't know if I should.

188
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,826
Let's figure this out.

189
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,626
What do you know about him?

190
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,933
His name is Bigtool4U.

191
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,260
My God.

192
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,100
Come on, Carrie. This is serious.

193
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,139
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,370
I'm sorry, Rick.

195
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,242
Where does he want to meet you?

196
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,049
At an after-hours gay club
in the Meatpacking District.

197
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,556
Makes sense. Tell me why you want to go.

198
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,184
He seems hot. It's exciting.

199
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,494
I haven't had good sex
since before Cats was on Broadway.

200
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,793
I say go.

201
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,161
Have a naughty Iittle adventure.
Be safe, have fun.

202
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,601
What if he disses me?

203
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,801
He said he's really great Iooking
and has a really ripped body.

204
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,437
Well, are you Rick9PIus?

205
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,004
I'm so getting your point.

206
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,809
After Rick9Plus went home...

207
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,912
...I decided I was just drunk enough
to call Big.

208
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,417
It's me. What are you doing?

209
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,354
I'm in bed.

210
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,555
I think it's called sleeping.

211
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,629
So, you're funny in France?

212
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,069
It's 5:30 in the morning.

213
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,040
What is it?

214
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,905
I would Iike to know...

215
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,709
...how you could even think
of going to Paris...

216
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,978
...and not even think
about discussing it with me.

217
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,912
I think about you all the time.

218
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,182
What's he doing? What's he thinking?
But you, no.

219
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,520
When were you planning to tell me?

220
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,152
Are you still there?

221
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:20,927
Yes.

222
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,060
Okay, because I think about you
all the time.

223
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,195
No. Correction, correction.

224
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,929
I think about us all the time.

225
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,440
Can we get into this another time?
I was sleeping.

226
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:37,039
It's never a good time for you. You're
always sleeping, or you're going....

227
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,240
You're always going, "Taxi!"

228
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,809
Then you're on a plane to France
for maybe a year.

229
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,581
You're a freaking old man.

230
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,817
You should be thinking
about somebody else.

231
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,951
This is not fake us. This is real.

232
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,855
Even if you don't know it, it is.
I am a woman.

233
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,826
A wo-man!

234
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,070
Have another cocktail, Woman.

235
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,331
This isn't about cocktails.
This is about basic human decency.

236
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,538
This is about taking responsibility.
It's about being a grown-up.

237
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,205
It's about being a man.

238
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,742
I am a man.

239
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,516
I'm a tired man.

240
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,516
It's 5:30 in the morning here.

241
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:21,288
You better get used to it because if you
move, this is how our relationship will be.

242
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,420
You'II be sleeping when I'm eating
and I'II be sleeping....

243
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,292
Shit.

244
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,561
Shit.

245
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,266
Are you still there?

246
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,271
I'm going to bed.

247
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,907
I have an important meeting at 9:00.

248
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,376
Fine, hang up. Don't call me
when I'm sleeping because...

249
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,710
...I have a job here too, you know.

250
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,314
Shit.

251
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,682
Even through my Cosmopolitan haze,
I knew I had gone too far.

252
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,320
Take off your panties.

253
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,187
What?

254
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,054
I want to give you head.

255
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,828
In the cab?

256
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,895
You're not serious?
The driver is right there.

257
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:21,942
Yes.

258
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,779
Yes!

259
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,987
Take Ninth Avenue.

260
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,695
A few days later on the way home,
Charlotte couldn't help but notice...

261
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,757
...a gorgeous pair of Italian slingbacks
in the window.

262
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,802
I just came in to Iook.

263
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,928
You have a very high arch.

264
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,404
-Are you a dancer?
-No.

265
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,910
Such well-formed feet.

266
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,439
I was in Miss Debbie's Twirlers
when I was a Iittle girl.

267
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,046
They are so beautiful.

268
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,848
For anyone else, $500.

269
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,454
For you, free.

270
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:09,494
What? No, Buster.
Why would you do something Iike that?

271
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:14,138
Because these beautiful feet are tired
and they need a Iittle rub.

272
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:23,643
When a shoe fetish meets a foot fetish,
all reason goes out the shop window.

273
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,156
I am way overreacting
to this whole France situation.

274
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,129
I think Charlotte's right,
there are ways to work this out.

275
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,291
What made you change your mind?

276
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,994
I completely Iost my shit to Big
on the phone.

277
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,971
And I realized how close this whole thing
is to really blowing up.

278
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,736
Yes, it's painful sometimes,
but it's worth it, you know?

279
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,069
The guy has to go there for work.

280
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,741
And what is so awful about spending
a week here and there...

281
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,944
-...with your boyfriend in Paris?
-Nothing, it's so romantic.

282
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,423
Great, your Iove Iife takes you to Paris
and I'm fucking in the back of a cab.

283
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,719
-That's Iovely.
-And not just there.

284
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,925
We've done it in the bathroom
at Bond Street.

285
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,486
I just ate there!

286
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,591
The elevator at the Marriott Marquis
and a public restroom in Central Park.

287
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,499
How very "George Michael" of you.

288
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,506
We've actually never done it Iying down,
or inside, for that matter.

289
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,771
This is supposed to be a relationship,
not Outward Bound.

290
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,245
You've got to get him in a bedroom
and find out what's really there.

291
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,715
I'm a Iittle afraid to try.
He Iikes the threat of getting caught.

292
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,844
What if being with just me isn't enough?

293
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:39,083
Excuse me, Miss Charlotte,
what is happening south of your ankles?

294
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:43,185
-They're new. Do you Iike them?
-I Iove them! $500?

295
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,287
No, not that much.

296
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,195
-The guy just kind of gave me a deal.
-How much?

297
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,395
Free.

298
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,901
-Why?
-And where is he?

299
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,371
He just wanted me to have them.

300
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,706
He just really Ioves it
when people Iove shoes.

301
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,509
Sweetie, this is New York City,
nobody Ioves anything that much.

302
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,077
Well, I Iet him hold my feet. Just a Iittle.

303
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,988
The second she said it out loud,
she knew what she had to do.

304
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,956
Hello, again.

305
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,430
I can't keep these shoes you gave me.

306
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,325
-Why?
-You know why.

307
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,739
You've already worn them,
I can't take them back. Keep them.

308
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,143
No, thank you!

309
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,647
-Then I'II throw them in the garbage.
-No, they're too beautiful.

310
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,216
I'd buy them, but I can't afford it.

311
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,384
What about a trade?

312
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,751
Six new styles just came in.

313
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,194
I've never seen them on a foot.

314
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,991
Charlotte looked down
at the exquisite shoes.

315
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,397
The smell of leather was intoxicating.

316
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,935
AII I have to do is try the shoes on?

317
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,304
Charlotte felt like Cinderella.

318
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,525
Cinderella in a dirty, kinky, freaked out,
storybook, parallel universe.

319
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,962
Thank you.

320
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,836
Big arrived on the 9 :00 p.m. flight.

321
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,074
I was at his door by 10 :00
to welcome him home in style.

322
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:46,311
Bonjour, voila le French hat,
Voila, le French fry.

323
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,016
And it doesn't stop there.

324
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:54,582
I have le Big Mac, and Ie Filet de Fish.

325
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,661
What is all this?

326
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,564
It's an apology for being le bitch.

327
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,177
I've been thinking about this.
We can make this work.

328
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,407
We'II do le phone sex.

329
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,209
If things get really bad,
then I'II move to Paris for a while...

330
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,014
...and write Le Sex in le City.

331
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,622
-That would be great.
-Which one?

332
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,054
I don't care.

333
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,788
But you'd be moving to Paris
for yourself, right?

334
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,390
I mean, don't move for me.

335
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,296
Why would I move to Paris
if it wasn't for you?

336
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,835
I'm just saying...

337
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,168
...I don't want you to uproot
your Iife and expect anything.

338
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,273
-I am such an idiot!
-What the fuck?

339
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,941
I'm running around town in a beret,
buying your greasy food...

340
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,818
...and you don't even care
if I'm in your Iife!

341
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,911
-Would you calm down?
-No!

342
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,217
I'm so tired of calming down!

343
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,655
Look, I have to be in a relationship...

344
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,795
...where if I have to go to Paris,
I have to go to Paris.

345
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,698
Fine, go to Paris.
Then what happens to us next year...

346
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,828
...when you decide
you just have to go to Brazil?

347
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,965
This isn't about us! This is about work!

348
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,868
This isn't about work.
This is about us getting closer...

349
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,141
...and you getting so freaked out...

350
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,081
...that you have to put an ocean
between us.

351
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,651
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

352
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,885
Why is it so hard...

353
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:41,492
...for you to factor me into your Iife
in any real way?

354
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,206
I guess old habits die hard.

355
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,336
Maybe I can't do this anymore.

356
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,600
I understand.

357
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,443
I bet you do.

358
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,782
You said you Ioved me.

359
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,716
I do.

360
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,324
Then why does it hurt so fucking much?

361
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,489
On the way home I was furious.

362
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,858
Not with Big, with myself.

363
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,067
I was the real sadist.

364
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:21,138
He might be the one with the whip,
but I was the one who tied myself up.

365
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,438
Tied myself to a man
who was terrified of being tied down.

366
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,280
And downtown,
in the Meatpacking District...

367
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,048
...another terrified man
was preparing to face his fears.

368
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,881
Take them off.

369
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,759
Excuse me?

370
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,893
Stanford panicked.
He hadn 't been seen in his underwear...

371
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,904
...by a roomful of men
since seventh grade gym class.

372
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,236
What's it gonna be, pal? In or out?

373
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,847
So, Rick9Plus undressed.

374
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,146
It would have been rude
to stand up Bigtool4U.

375
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:16,457
To her surprise, Miranda had no trouble
getting Jack to agree to make love...

376
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,428
...in his bedroom that night.

377
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,968
Let's do it in bed.

378
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,936
Suddenly, her fear of his fetish ended.

379
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,270
Miranda realized that Jack's excitement
wasn't about getting caught.

380
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,368
It was about her
and she really began to let loose.

381
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,675
Something she'd been unable
to do outside.

382
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,150
Jack? Is everything all right?

383
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,121
Who was that?

384
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,181
It's my mother. My parents are visiting.

385
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,684
Son?

386
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,160
They sound Iike they're coming in here.
Are they coming in here?

387
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,822
At first, Stanford thought he'd be shunned
for lack of the popular six-pack abs.

388
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,752
But then....

389
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,636
Never seen that kind before.

390
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,840
They're French!

391
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,010
I bought them in Paris.

392
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,444
Turn around.

393
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,509
Stanford Blanche had never felt
more special.

394
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,052
Nice.

395
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,230
Bigtool4U?

396
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,996
Excuse me?

397
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,232
Another beer for you?

398
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,801
I'II buy.

399
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:22,452
Stanford learned that sometimes
a brief encounter can be quite fulfilling.

400
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,019
I went to bed at 1:00.

401
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,491
I was still wide-awake at 2:30.

402
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,701
There were no words left.
We'd said them all.

403
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,024
After we made love, I knew it was over.

404
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,333
Did I ever really love Big
or was I addicted to the pain?

405
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,604
The exquisite pain
of wanting someone so unattainable.

406
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,103
What are you doing over there?

407
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,683
Go to Paris.

408
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,516
I'm not gonna come.

409
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,816
Let's not pretend
we're something we're not.

410
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,860
It's okay.

411
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,792
Come to bed.

412
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,600
I wanted to go to him,
but I felt like I was tied to the chair.

413
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,940
Some part of me was holding me back,
knowing I had gone too far.

414
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,731
Reached my limit.

415
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,946
And just like that,
I had untied myself from Mr. Big.

416
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,118
I was free.

417
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,286
But there was nothing exquisite about it.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
