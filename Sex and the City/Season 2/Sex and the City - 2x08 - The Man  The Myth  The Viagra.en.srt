1
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,814
Once upon a second time around...

2
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,953
...in a mythical land
between Carmine and Mulberry streets...

3
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,220
...two mere mortals were having
a wonderful time.

4
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,664
This is the gangster
I was telling you about.

5
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,894
Gangster? No. No gangster.

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,696
Come, this way.

7
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,508
Grazie.

8
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,248
This is Paolo.

9
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,780
This is my girlfriend, Carrie.

10
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,553
Bread?

11
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,482
You've never called me
your girlfriend before.

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,484
Sure, I have. Just not to your face.

13
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,035
Bravo!

14
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,873
And now you wise guy,
come on, it's your turn.

15
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,510
-Come on, come on.
-Me? Okay.

16
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:03,647
-Not funny, Mr. Sambuca.
-Relax, I'm a regular.

17
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,088
A regular?

18
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,527
I'd Iike to dedicate this song
to the Iovely Iady sitting right over there.

19
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,498
"When I was 17

20
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,375
"It was a very good year

21
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,777
"It was a very good year

22
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:33,308
"For small town girls
and soft summer nights

23
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,517
"We'd hide from the Iights

24
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,258
"In the village green

25
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,560
"When I was 17"

26
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,023
It was perfect.

27
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,995
I felt like I was in heaven.

28
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,468
Meanwhile across town,
Miranda was in hell...

29
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,645
Douche products....

30
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,806
...or its modern day equivalent:
the comedy club.

31
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,110
-Are we having fun yet?
-When does the comedy start?

32
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,586
I've never been this close to suicide.

33
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,484
Not pussy....

34
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,553
-I'II get the check.
-If you ditch me in this place...

35
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,117
...I will hunt you down and kill you.

36
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:22,300
Alan Miller was a divorced architect she
met in aisle three at the Food Emporium.

37
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,830
They immediately bonded
over a shared hatred of designer croutons.

38
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,437
If all I was interested in was freshness...

39
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,738
...then I would be fucking my salad crisper!

40
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,279
Yo, Red.

41
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,880
You wanna answer your fuckin' phone?

42
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,389
It's not my phone.

43
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,330
Go ahead. Answer it.

44
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,725
Answer it!

45
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,176
AIan Miller's phone.

46
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,740
No, this is his date. Who's this?

47
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,906
Who is it?

48
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,116
I'm sorry, his date can't speak right now.

49
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,281
Whom may I say is calling?

50
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,959
His wife!

51
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,954
Numb-nuts, your wife's on the phone.

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,091
You told me you were divorced.

53
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,863
I'm not really divorced.
I'm really separated.

54
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,701
No, we're really separated.

55
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,439
See, this is me, separating.

56
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,002
Red, not so fast.

57
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,943
I'II fuck you.

58
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,649
Honey....

59
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,983
If they're not married, they're gay,
or burned from a divorce...

60
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,421
...or aliens from the planet
"Don't date me."

61
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,755
It's amazing how many
of them walk among us.

62
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,420
Only recognizable by their
slightly Iarger heads.

63
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,191
I asked him, point blank:

64
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,993
"How Iong have you been divorced?"

65
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,296
"Three years." Just Iike that.

66
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,969
Guys are such Iiars.

67
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,528
97 percent of them can't fuck you
worth a damn!

68
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,007
He tells me how much he Iikes me,
and boom, I believe him.

69
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,909
-Am I that needy?
-Maybe he really did Iike you.

70
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,277
If you "Pollyanna-out" on me today...

71
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,714
...I'II have to hit you with this rice pudding.

72
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,251
This married man...

73
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,550
...fell madly in Iove with my friend,
Amanda's friend, Ashley...

74
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,113
...and he said he would
get a divorce and he did.

75
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:29,628
They got married, moved to Connecticut
and he is this amazing husband and father.

76
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,527
-Never happened.
-Excuse me?

77
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,326
Urban relationship myth.

78
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,663
Unbelievable fairy tales
concocted by women...

79
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,067
...to make their Iove Iives
seem Iess hopeless.

80
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,970
Except it makes you feel
even more hopeless...

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,976
...because this fabulous, magical
relationship is never happening to you.

82
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,272
It did happen.

83
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,780
Like the one about the guy
who couldn't commit...

84
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,510
...and the woman broke up with him
and moved to Kansas.

85
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,052
-One night, she comes walking home--
-In the rain!

86
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,781
AIways, in the rain.

87
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,647
He stands there in front of her door
with an engagement ring.

88
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,555
He says, "Marry me,"
and they Iive happily ever after.

89
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,927
But, it can happen.
People do Iive happily ever after.

90
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,262
It happened to my friend, Amanda's friend.

91
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,802
It's always a friend who knows a friend....

92
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,432
Honey.

93
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,874
Have you ever known anyone who's
relationship changed magically overnight?

94
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,499
Yes.

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,877
Look at Carrie and Big.

96
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,611
Their relationship is totally
different than before.

97
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,043
How?

98
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,220
How is it different?

99
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,951
It just is.

100
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,287
I can't explain it.

101
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,691
I can, but you're so scary right now,
I won't.

102
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,692
No, really, tell me.

103
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,668
It's just a feeling.

104
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,601
Something shifted....

105
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,598
Maybe we both know that...

106
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,475
...if we came together again
it must be for a reason.

107
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,539
Why is that so hard to believe?

108
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,345
How much time have you got?

109
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,787
That afternoon, I got to thinking
about myths and relationships.

110
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,686
Heroes, boyfriends, Cyclopses,
divorced guys.

111
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,950
Are they really that different?

112
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,722
The primitive Greeks
clung desperately to myths...

113
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,632
...to explain the random hopelessness
of their miserable lives.

114
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,067
Do modern day singles
need modern day myths...

115
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:22,665
...just to help us get through our random
and sometimes miserable relationships?

116
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,471
What about Big and me?

117
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,044
After what seemed like an eternity of not
quite fitting together, we suddenly fit.

118
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,810
Had the relationship God smiled?

119
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,909
Or was that something
I desperately needed to believe?

120
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,887
Are we willing to believe anything to date?

121
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,990
While Samantha had little belief
in the idea of happily ever after...

122
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,389
...she had a strong belief in the idea...

123
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,297
...of a smart cocktail at the end
of the work day.

124
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,531
Samantha, a Cosmopolitan
and Donald Trump.

125
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,904
You don't get more New York than that.

126
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,507
I gotta go.

127
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,341
Think about it.
I'II be at my office at Trump Tower.

128
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,385
Excuse me.

129
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,116
I was so distracted by your beauty...

130
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:16,122
...I think I just agreed
to finance Mr. Trump's new project.

131
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,322
You owe me 150 million dollars.

132
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,022
Will you take a check?

133
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,760
May I buy you a drink?

134
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,563
I have one, thanks.

135
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,104
Can I buy you an island?

136
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,603
-I don't know, can you?
-The name's Ed.

137
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,172
Samantha.

138
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,008
So, Samantha, do you come here often?

139
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,353
Honey, that Iine's older than you are.

140
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,086
You are a pistol.

141
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,053
You have no idea.

142
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,026
A bottle of their best champagne later...

143
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,063
...Samantha had learned
that Ed was single, available...

144
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,130
...and a millionaire many, many times over.

145
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,067
What's your age ceiling with men?

146
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,403
Fifty?

147
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,232
Factor in millions and millions of dollars.

148
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,274
Fifty?

149
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,909
Well, I just met the cutest older man.

150
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,146
How old, fifty?

151
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,042
Sixty?

152
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,717
-Is he on Medicare?
-I'm guessing 72.

153
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,488
A young 72.

154
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,023
Your silence reeks of ageism.

155
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,561
-Are you serious?
-He took me to dinner at Jean Georges.

156
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,929
We got right in, no reservation needed.

157
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,969
I wasn't aware that Jean Georges
had an early bird special.

158
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,062
He's vibrant and powerful and generous.

159
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,267
He's just Iooking for someone
to have a Iittle fun with.

160
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,173
Would that include bedroom fun?

161
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,144
We haven't discussed it yet.

162
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:44,945
Are you telling me that you are seriously
capable of having sex with a senior?

163
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,111
You know the saying:
"AII cats Iook the same in the dark."

164
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,155
It was pure urban legend.

165
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,656
Alligators in the sewer,
pets in the microwave...

166
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,784
...and now an old man and Samantha.

167
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,321
Is this a piece of veal
or is this a piece of veal?

168
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,262
That is a piece of veal.

169
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,663
In every myth, there comes a point
when the mere mortals are given a test.

170
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,503
The way they respond usually determines
whether they find paradise...

171
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,777
...or are tied to a big rock for all eternity.

172
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,008
I have a huge request.

173
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,412
I want you to know my friends better.

174
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,279
I know your friends fine.

175
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,321
Charlotte is the brunette.

176
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,686
Miranda is the redhead.

177
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,793
And Samantha is trouble.

178
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,626
I want them to know you better.

179
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,625
They've never really spent time with you...

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,298
...and you're so funny and cute.

181
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,433
What is it you need?

182
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,206
I want us all to have dinner
Saturday night at Denial.

183
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,073
Denial was a very popular
Manhattan hot spot.

184
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,375
Apparently, everyone in Manhattan
wanted to be "in Denial."

185
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,916
Okay.

186
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,377
Why are you suddenly so--

187
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,248
-Cute?
-Yes.

188
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,582
Why are you so cute?

189
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,163
Hello?

190
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,300
Where are you?
I've been waiting here forever.

191
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,728
Didn't you get the message
I Ieft on your machine an hour ago?

192
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,070
No. Is everything all right?
I thought you were dead or something.

193
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,435
I'm fine. I'm at Big's.

194
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,875
You're at Big's?
You and I are having dinner tonight.

195
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,242
Well, he got this veal.

196
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,149
You blew me off for a piece
of politically incorrect meat?

197
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,051
Well, he wanted to make me dinner.

198
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,592
You just dropped your Iife
and ran right on over to his?

199
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,393
I can't get into that right now.

200
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,193
You know what?

201
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:44,134
You're relationship is the same as always.
It's all about him.

202
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,304
Could you put Miranda on, please?

203
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,997
Enjoy your veal.

204
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,305
Problem?

205
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,935
No.

206
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,778
I'II have another glass of wine.

207
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,620
PIease.

208
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,819
PIease what?

209
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,027
I'II have another glass of wine, please.

210
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,494
Are you allowed to talk to me Iike that?

211
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,790
I think I am.

212
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,765
Enjoy.

213
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,867
Thank you.

214
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,166
Steve, thank you, Steve.

215
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,604
That's really very cute
but I'm not in the mood.

216
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,711
I'm not really in the mood, Steve.

217
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,878
I'm not a total bitch,
I just had a fight with somebody.

218
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,782
I heard. Boyfriend?

219
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,252
None of your business.

220
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,152
Girlfriend? Butcher.

221
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,385
-Butcher?
-The veal.

222
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,949
I took a shot.

223
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,920
What are you reading?

224
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,760
The Joy of Bartending, Hemingway.

225
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,061
So, what, you're funny?

226
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,272
SIow down, that's a nice Cotes du Rhone.

227
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,975
Enjoy.

228
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,206
It's on me.

229
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,184
Why would that be?

230
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,882
A bribe, so, you'II hang out and talk.

231
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,887
If you Ieave,
I'II have to Iisten to those NYU kids...

232
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,587
...with the Amstel Lights
discuss Fiona Apple.

233
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,996
I'm begging you.

234
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,809
They did a little more than talk.

235
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,210
After work they went back to her place
where Steve, the bartender...

236
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,148
...served Miranda two orgasms,
straight up.

237
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,049
So...

238
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,918
...that was really special.

239
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,293
Sure.

240
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,592
Is that your shirt over there?

241
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,594
Can I get your phone number?

242
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,828
Why?

243
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,534
To call you up and ask you for a date.

244
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,499
Look....

245
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,872
Steve. Look, Steve.

246
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,343
You don't have to do this.

247
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,108
You don't have to make believe
you're gonna call.

248
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,211
Let's just call this what this was:
a one-night stand.

249
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,523
You're a real pisser.

250
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,432
Stop by the bar, see me sometime.

251
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,299
Sure, okay. Whatever. Thanks.

252
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,899
Bye.

253
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,006
Great sex.

254
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,845
Three dinners and two extravagant
lunches later...

255
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,485
...Ed invited Samantha
over to his townhouse.

256
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,020
Up until now,
she would never have believed...

257
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,751
...she would consider a relationship
with an older man.

258
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,952
Bu there was something about Ed.

259
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,531
How did that get there?

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,558
I wonder if....

261
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,573
Ed, no.

262
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,257
After an impressive six-course dinner...

263
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,456
...Ed put the moves on Samantha.

264
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,292
Ed's moves were from
a different dating time.

265
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,768
Moves she had heard of
or seen in old movies...

266
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,068
...but moves she never thought
she'd experience firsthand.

267
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,742
I used to groove with these cats in Cuba.

268
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,440
What's the matter?

269
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,708
Can't afford the Iight bill?

270
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,886
You're fun. A toast to fun.

271
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,192
What the hell!

272
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,322
I'm gonna Iay my cards on the table.

273
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,431
-I've only got a handful of good years Ieft.
-No--

274
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,361
10 to 12, tops.

275
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,368
I'm Iooking for someone
to have some fun with.

276
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,502
I'm aware that a gorgeous woman Iike
you can get any young man you want.

277
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,043
I'm willing to make it worth your wild.

278
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,514
And speaking of wild...

279
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,642
...don't worry.

280
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,480
I got a big, old pocketful of Viagra.

281
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,390
Why, Ed.

282
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,527
That's not Viagra.

283
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,297
Samantha was suddenly living
her own urban relationship myth.

284
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:47,198
The woman who stopped for a cocktail
after work and lived happily ever after.

285
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,967
For 10 to 12 years, tops.

286
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,068
I think in the dark is sexier.

287
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,879
Could you get that Iight behind you?

288
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:04,348
In the dark, she learned that all cats
not only look the same but felt the same.

289
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,017
Ed's lips were not the lips of an older man.

290
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,396
Ed's touch was not the touch
of an older man.

291
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,226
Excuse me, baby. Little boy's room.

292
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,494
Unfortunately Ed's ass
was the ass of an older man.

293
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,839
She told him it was a bad reaction
to the shellfish from dinner.

294
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,582
Saturday afternoon,
Miranda was at home...

295
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,455
...enjoying a cup of coffee
and her New York Times...

296
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,654
...when fate came knocking.

297
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:52,968
Yes?

298
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,264
It's Steve.

299
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,698
Steve who?

300
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,001
Steve Brady, the bartender.

301
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,772
What do you want?

302
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,109
You want your neighbors to hear?

303
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,076
Hi.

304
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,755
-Thanks for Ietting me in.
-Did you forget something?

305
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,893
No, I didn't have your number
and I wanted to tell you something.

306
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,755
I Iike you.

307
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,034
Translation: "I think you're an easy Iay
and I'd Iike to have sex again."

308
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,798
It's not Iike that.

309
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,998
Have dinner with me.

310
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,799
Why?

311
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,941
I don't know, because we're hungry.

312
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,741
I can't have dinner with you.
I don't even know you.

313
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,181
-You slept with me.
-It's a different thing.

314
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,819
-How 'bout tonight?
-I have plans.

315
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,189
-You don't have plans.
-I do.

316
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,487
What plans?
Quick, before you make one up.

317
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,187
I'm meeting my friends downtown
at Denial for dinner.

318
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,588
My buddy works there.
I'II meet you for a drink. What time?

319
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,996
7:00.

320
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,627
Okay.

321
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,101
What time are you really meeting them?

322
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:07,937
9:00.

323
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,685
At 8:15, I arrived at Big's.

324
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,419
One quick drink and we'd be out the door.

325
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,929
I told myself all day it was just
another dinner with friends.

326
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,691
But, as I stood waiting,
in my new, very favorite dress...

327
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,961
...I realized it meant a lot more.

328
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,130
Hi, baby, c'mon in.

329
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,437
You're not properly attired
to meet my friends, mister. Hop to it.

330
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,538
About that....

331
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,707
Do you mind if I don't go?

332
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,381
I've been out all day, it's gonna rain.

333
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,915
But my friends are expecting you.

334
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,459
I know, but they're your friends and...

335
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,887
...they'II be fine with just you.

336
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,696
Is it okay?

337
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,227
Sure.

338
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,734
I was afraid if I looked up into his eyes...

339
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,669
...I'd turn to stone.

340
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:17,548
How could I have let myself believe things
would be different the second time around?

341
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:22,644
I'd never heard of a myth in which
a self-centered, 42-year-old baby...

342
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,714
...magically transformed into a grown
man that you could bring out in public.

343
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,856
They won't seat us 'til
all of our party is here.

344
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,958
How Iong do you think Big will be?

345
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,969
I'm not sure, he's coming from work.

346
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,063
I didn't have the strength to tell them
about my fallen hero.

347
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,767
Not without a cocktail.

348
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,039
I figured as long as I was "in Denial,"
I might as well stay there.

349
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,807
Look at you.

350
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,441
If you want good service, send a bartender.

351
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,418
If you want a good fuck, go home with one.

352
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,788
Hello! It was funny!

353
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,655
Can I talk to you over there, for a second?

354
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,087
The gods are punishing me
for having casual sex.

355
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,732
Thank you.

356
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,373
One quick question and I'm out of here.

357
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,603
Why do you hate guys so much?

358
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,043
Excuse me?

359
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,911
We just met,
so I know that it ain't all about me.

360
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,376
Wait.

361
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,345
What do you want?

362
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,178
I just wanna get to know you better.

363
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,347
Do me a favor.

364
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:37,557
Can you, for a second, believe that
maybe I'm not some "full-of-shit" guy?

365
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,021
That maybe I do Iike you?

366
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,928
That maybe the other night was special?

367
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,993
-Do you think maybe you can believe that?
-No.

368
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,131
Maybe I've just slept
with too many bartenders.

369
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,441
Are you okay?

370
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,844
I don't wanna talk about it.

371
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,984
Nice meeting you all, excuse me.

372
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,427
-Maybe we should get a table for four.
-I knew it.

373
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,592
Big's not coming. Men are shit.

374
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,734
What are you talking about?
He's coming, isn't he?

375
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,637
I didn't know if I had the heart
to tell Charlotte that "happily ever after..."

376
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,937
...really was just a myth.

377
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,344
See, there he is!

378
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,025
It's really coming down out there.

379
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,657
-You remember my friends?
-Of course, I do.

380
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,064
Hello, Iadies.

381
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,931
Seeing Big show up for me...

382
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,267
...shook Miranda's lack of belief system
to the very core.

383
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,806
Excuse me.

384
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,135
More drinks?

385
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,043
Just like that, Miranda left Denial.

386
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,508
Steve!

387
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,757
Maybe I can believe it.

388
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,498
From that night on,
promiscuous women everywhere...

389
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,057
...would tell the tale
of the one-night stand...

390
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,366
...that turned into a relationship.

391
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,095
As for Big and me....

392
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,906
So, tell me.

393
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,133
Did you ever get it on with that old coot?

394
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,512
That was the night we stopped being
a myth and started becoming real.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
