1
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,506
In a town where everyone's dying
to couple up...

2
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:54,053
...sometimes there's nothing better
than being out of a relationship.

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,211
You have time to do your laundry...

4
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,224
...freedom to play your favorite
bad music really loudly.

5
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,817
But the best part of being
out of a relationship:

6
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,261
Plenty of time to catch up
with your friends.

7
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,824
I feel sorry for Big.
I really do, because if you think about it...

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,633
...I was the best thing that ever happened
to him. Actually, I pity him.

9
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,436
Because I get to walk away and be me
and he has to walk away and stay him.

10
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,477
Who wants to be him
when you can be me?

11
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,137
I'm smart. I'm funny.

12
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:25,207
I was this thing. I was it.
I was this magic moment.

13
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,582
I was the abracadabra.

14
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,383
I was totally the "poof" in the relationship.

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,484
I've got more poof than he could ever have.

16
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,187
Sometimes, I poof just hailing a cab.

17
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,924
So, I guess it's better to know now
so I can go poof someone else.

18
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,488
Someone who deserves me...

19
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,264
...and not some screwed up, insecure guy
who can't deal with a woman...

20
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,929
...who's got her act together.

21
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,974
Now, I'm gonna end up deliriously happy
and Big is gonna die old and alone...

22
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,840
...and I pity him. Really, I pity him.

23
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,144
What?

24
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,052
Who's gonna tell her?

25
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,511
What?

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,356
You're obsessed with talking about Big
and frankly, we can't take it anymore.

27
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,895
-It's out of our Ieague.
-Is this an intervention?

28
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,591
Yes, stop her before she obsesses again.

29
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,999
Isn't part of the breaking up process that
you get free rein to whine to your friends?

30
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,263
Of course you do.

31
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,136
But maybe you should think
about whining to a shrink.

32
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,867
Why should I pay someone
when we can talk for free...

33
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,808
...and then get a drink or whatever?

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,609
I don't need professional help.
I've got you guys.

35
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,273
For another ten minutes.

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,511
Then we're cutting you off, cold turkey.

37
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,955
Hey, I don't need therapy.
I need new friends.

38
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,356
Look, we're as fucked up as you are.
It's Iike the blind Ieading the blind.

39
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,361
Sometimes it helps
to talk to somebody who's objective.

40
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:47,263
Okay, I understand why you see a shrink
because you're always in your head...

41
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,492
...but I'm fine.

42
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,561
I am functioning. Besides, I don't really--

43
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,540
To be honest,
I just don't buy the whole shrink thing.

44
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,633
Neither do I. My parents believe...

45
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,713
...that any head problem can be solved
with physical exercise.

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,544
That's why all of us
are really good tennis players.

47
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,647
It's a slippery slope.

48
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,243
First you go once a week,
then three times a week...

49
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,879
...and next thing you know...

50
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,322
...you start sentences, "My shrink says...."

51
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,519
My shrink says that's a very common fear.

52
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,921
Therapy is just so self-indulgent.

53
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,232
Ancient man didn't need shrinks to survive.

54
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,361
Ancient man only Iived till 30.

55
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,101
Were my friends right?

56
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,640
Had I crossed the line
from pleasantly neurotic...

57
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,300
...into annoyingly troubled?

58
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,901
I decided to seek
my own professional help.

59
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,239
How can you not have a shrink?

60
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,873
This is Manhattan.
Even the shrinks have shrinks.

61
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,782
The fact was, Stanford was right.

62
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,878
The therapist was as ubiquitous
in Manhattan as pirated cable.

63
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,048
I have three.

64
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,249
You do not.

65
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,314
I do:

66
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,223
One when I want to be cuddled...

67
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,989
...one when I want tough Iove...

68
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,226
...and one for when I just want to Iook at
a really beautiful man.

69
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,291
-That's sick.
-Which is why I see the other two.

70
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,736
-Do you want a name?
-No, Miranda's shrink referred me to one.

71
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,273
Dr. EIIen Greenfield.

72
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,903
Dr. G! My god! She is hot, hot, hot.

73
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,412
Gwyneth Paltrow sees her.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,970
Why does she go to a shrink?

75
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,710
She suffers from high self-esteem.

76
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,348
While I was contemplating the couch,
Miranda was enjoying hers.

77
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:39,342
Two nights later,
she had another nocturnal rendezvous.

78
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,120
Soon, Miranda found herself
with a nightly playmate.

79
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,557
A week later, I kept my date with Dr. G,
celebrity shrink.

80
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,893
So Carrie, tell me why you're here.

81
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,665
Well, my friends can't handle me anymore.

82
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,234
You're Iike very expensive foster care.

83
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,938
What's bothering them?

84
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,903
They tell me that I talk
about my ex-boyfriend too much.

85
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,481
But that's normal, right, after a break up?

86
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,611
I don't Iike the term "normal."

87
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:24,089
No, of course you don't,
because you wouldn't have any patients.

88
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,785
So, tell me about him:

89
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,753
The ex.

90
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:36,661
You know, I have to be honest.

91
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,670
I'm not sure I really believe in therapy.

92
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:48,037
I'm more of a
"solve your own problems" kind of gal.

93
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,945
Okay.

94
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,585
I don't know.

95
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,019
He was smart.

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,626
He was sexy, just totally screwed up.

97
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:13,136
He was playing all these games,
and I didn't know the rules.

98
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,537
You were playing games.

99
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,202
No, he was. I was just along for the ride.

100
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,604
What about you?

101
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,712
Was this the first time you dated a man
who couldn't give you what you wanted?

102
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,079
Well, that's a Iittle easy, don't you think?

103
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,993
Okay.

104
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,790
Yeah.

105
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,457
Maybe I've dated men
who were wrong for me, but who hasn't?

106
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,695
The thing they have in common is you.

107
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,038
-What's your point?
-Maybe you are picking the wrong men.

108
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,939
Well, of course you pick the wrong guys.
Jesus, I could have told you that.

109
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,143
Frankly, I think I picked
the wrong therapist.

110
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:04,582
She just did not get me at all.
She thought I was a game player.

111
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,251
You have to be.
It's the only way to deal with men.

112
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,386
That's healthy.
Relationships are not about games.

113
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,432
They're about mature
and honest communication.

114
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,297
This from a woman who plays peek-a-boo
with her neighbor.

115
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,734
Games are empowering.

116
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,069
If you know what you're doing,
you can control the situation.

117
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,904
The only place you can control a man
is in bed.

118
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,003
If we perpetually gave men blow jobs,
we could run the world.

119
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,311
At Ieast our hands would be
free to greet dignitaries and stuff.

120
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,543
Sorry.

121
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,348
I mean, even if you're in a relationship...

122
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,514
...you still have to play games.

123
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,820
Big and I played games.
Look where it got us.

124
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,919
But maybe the game is not really over.
Maybe it's just halftime.

125
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:48,065
That kind of delusional thinking
is why you should be in therapy, too.

126
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,533
I do not pick the wrong guys.
They pick me.

127
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,730
So what, you're Iike a fly strip
for dysfunctional men?

128
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,804
Yeah, but one of those really
pretty floral scented ones.

129
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,006
It's slim pickings out there.

130
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,811
You can't swing a Fendi purse
without knocking over five Iosers.

131
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,514
Where did all the great guys go?

132
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,393
There it was:
happy hour in the valley of lost men.

133
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,859
Hello.

134
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,022
I've never seen this many of them
rounded up in one space.

135
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,794
-What's going on?
-It's sports night.

136
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,267
It certainly is.

137
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,134
Come on, girls. Let the games begin.

138
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,141
Sports night: Every female's fantasy...

139
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,235
...a room full of captive heterosexual men...

140
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,611
...all looking to be distracted
during commercial breaks.

141
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,277
I'm getting a contact high
from all the testosterone.

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,584
-We didn't order these.
-They're on the house.

143
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,181
It's sports night. Ladies drink for free.

144
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,954
Forget Disneyland.
This is the happiest place on Earth.

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,224
Yes, indeed.

146
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,061
If you Iadies will excuse me.

147
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,098
I'm getting on the bench.

148
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,845
-Who's winning?
-Knicks.

149
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,878
-Is that good?
-You're not a Knicks fan, I take it.

150
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,513
Not yet.

151
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,454
-I'm Don.
-Samantha.

152
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,358
Don Seglar was a very successful importer
of Mexican handbags.

153
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,387
He was fanatical about two things:
keeping the price of foreign labor down...

154
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,557
...and the Knicks.

155
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,000
-Maybe I can teach you a few things.
-And vice versa!

156
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,270
It's 10 seconds Ieft.
Pass, you motherfucker!

157
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,402
We need to penetrate, drive to the basket.

158
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,470
Get it to Johnson. He's on fire tonight.
Go L.J., go!

159
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,010
Go! Score!

160
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,814
Which is exactly
what Samantha did two hours later.

161
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,867
When I got home that night, I couldn't get
Charlotte's words out of my head.

162
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,502
We spent our childhoods playing games.

163
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,870
Were they all just primers
for the games we played as adults?

164
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,105
Were relationships just a big chess match:
strategy moves, countermoves...

165
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,740
...all designed to keep your opponent
off balance until you win?

166
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,875
Was there such a thing as
an honest relationship?

167
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,544
Or was it true?

168
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,213
Do you have to play games to
make a relationship work?

169
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:29,087
I went out with this girl on Saturday night.
We had a great time.

170
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,426
I didn't call her again until Thursday,
so I didn't seem eager.

171
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,632
I went out with this guy on Saturday night.
I thought we had a great time.

172
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,136
The asshole doesn't call me until Thursday.

173
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,833
I screened his call
and didn't return it until Monday.

174
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,803
I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum.
Propose by Christmas or it's over.

175
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,244
My girlfriends said that was a game.
I think it was just smart.

176
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:53,216
Besides, if he doesn't come through,
I can always secretly get pregnant.

177
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,013
The next day, I reluctantly showed up
for my second appointment with Dr. G.

178
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,924
I was still a skeptic and I'd already read
every New Yorker in the waiting room.

179
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,088
When you think about it,
what was I getting out of this anyway?

180
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,433
And then, at five minutes
to my last scheduled hour...

181
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,936
...I got my answer.

182
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,970
My third appointment with Dr. G:

183
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:24,142
I had come a little early
to catch up on my reading.

184
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,750
Hi. I'm Seth.

185
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,529
Hi. Carrie.

186
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,499
I thought we could go on playing
this coy game, or I could introduce myself.

187
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,898
Well, I'm glad you did.

188
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,106
Especially since I had worn
my new dress for the occasion.

189
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,201
That New Yorker is from Iast year.

190
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,207
Well, this New Yorker is
a Iittle behind on her reading.

191
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,410
So, how Iong you been a Dr. G convert?

192
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,647
Not very Iong, just three sessions.

193
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,490
I just had my one-year anniversary.

194
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,886
What'd she give you, a cake or something?

195
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,253
A really big bill.

196
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,789
Listen, this is gonna sound a Iittle weird.

197
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,862
Would you have dinner with me sometime?

198
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,771
Sure.

199
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,535
I'd Iike that.

200
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,205
-Call me, all right?
-Okay.

201
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,913
Maybe it was unethical making a date...

202
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,318
...with Seth Robinson, photographer,
in my shrink's waiting room...

203
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,750
...but there was something about him.

204
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,816
Come on in.

205
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,762
Well, you're dressed up.

206
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,463
He's a photographer.

207
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,837
-And you met him at your shrink's?
-It wasn't a setup or anything.

208
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,997
Jeez, what if he's crazy?

209
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,872
It's the crazy ones that have the good pills.

210
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,878
That's it! Go, Marcus! Go!

211
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,211
Excuse me,
but why is that on and who is Marcus?

212
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,842
Marcus Camby, Knicks forward.

213
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,615
Now that Ewing is injured,
he needs to pull it out.

214
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,849
When did we start caring about basketball?

215
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,423
Don is obsessed.
I don't get Iaid unless the Knicks win.

216
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,587
Can I just say?

217
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,359
They and I have been
on a very Iong Iosing streak.

218
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,024
-That's awful.
-No kidding.

219
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,695
The Knicks are the only ones
getting screwed.

220
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,761
Come on, you fuckers!

221
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,464
Why are you staying with him?

222
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:33,535
Because the sex, what I can remember,
was unbelievable.

223
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,778
Yes!

224
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,783
They won!

225
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,353
-I've got to go.
-Go.

226
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,616
Have sex. Go!

227
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,224
The next night,
Miranda got a pleasant surprise.

228
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:02,299
Her date thought it was time they moved
past peek-a-boo to playing doctor.

229
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:20,090
Miranda wanted to play fair,
so she gave him a little tit for tat.

230
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,358
All over town, people were getting lucky.

231
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,523
Seth and I were having
a great first date at the coffee shop.

232
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,830
And what about the plant?

233
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,529
I know.
She always has it in a different place.

234
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,267
Maybe it's some sort of
Dr. G psychological test.

235
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,674
-That's it. It's Where's Waldo.
-Yeah.

236
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,709
And it needs to be watered.

237
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,077
-It's plastic.
-Are you sure?

238
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,708
I touched it.

239
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,648
You touched Dr. G's plant?

240
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,088
I've been going to her over a year.
I got bored.

241
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,890
Then you came along.

242
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,993
-Well, that's sweet.
-No, it's true.

243
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:05,068
There was something about him. I felt
like I could talk to him about anything.

244
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,867
And in the spirit of psychological health
and not playing games...

245
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,635
...I decided to be honest.

246
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,801
I Iike you.

247
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,504
I Iike you, too.

248
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,619
Later that week,
Miranda went shopping for dinner.

249
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,603
Shopping quickly devolved
into a game of hide and seek.

250
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,261
I thought I'd be an adult here
and come over and introduce myself.

251
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,655
Hi.

252
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,090
I'm Miranda.

253
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,423
You know.

254
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,433
Across the airshaft.

255
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:21,041
Yeah, right. You're the girl who Iives
above the guy I've been cruising.

256
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,577
Miranda realized she was still playing
with an imaginary friend...

257
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,985
...just like she did when she was five.

258
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,355
The next day, she called her shrink
for an emergency session.

259
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,161
Meanwhile, Sam had decided
she would celebrate...

260
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,528
...the end of the basketball season
and the return of her sex life...

261
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,000
...by watching
the final Knicks game at Don 's.

262
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,235
Baby!

263
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,835
In a minute, baby.

264
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,471
The Mets are playing Chicago.

265
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,482
Now that basketball is over,
I can give them my full attention.

266
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,678
They've been playing Iousy ball this year.

267
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,584
The idea of lasting
through another sexless season...

268
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,923
...was more than Samantha could take.

269
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,757
So, she forfeited the game.

270
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,893
Meanwhile, I was getting plenty of action.

271
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,198
Seth and I had just come back
from another amazing date.

272
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,333
You want to come in?

273
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,477
I think I already am.

274
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,406
This is great.

275
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:38,613
You have all the classics here:
CIue, Parcheesi, and Twister.

276
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,585
I was the seventh grade Twister champion.

277
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,822
-Is that a challenge?
-Yeah.

278
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,025
AII right, buddy. It's go time.

279
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,383
-How are you holding up?
-Feeling good, my friend.

280
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,960
Left foot yellow.

281
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,027
I guess that one's mine.

282
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,593
You're in a very compromising position.

283
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,605
I believe I'm in about
20 compromising positions.

284
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,936
I am not gonna Iose my concentration.

285
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,059
In no time it was "yellow pants off. "

286
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,827
So what do you think Dr. G
would have to say about this?

287
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,895
Very bad.

288
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,128
Bad patients.

289
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,233
I have to tell you.

290
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm not really into therapy,
I think it's kind of bullshit.

291
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,847
-I'm telling Dr. G on you.
-No, no!

292
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,377
-Cross your heart.
-Hope to die.

293
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,922
So why are you in therapy, seriously?

294
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,424
I'm really fucked up about women.

295
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,689
After I sleep with them,
I completely Iose interest.

296
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,424
What about you? What's your problem?

297
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,370
I believe in therapy,
this moment is called "the breakthrough."

298
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,902
I pick the wrong men.

299
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,419
Although she'd made some good points,
I stopped seeing Dr. G immediately.

300
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,687
I couldn't risk the humiliation
of running into Seth in the waiting room.

301
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,389
My friends totally understand.



9999
