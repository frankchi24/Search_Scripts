1
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:50,380
This is a story about a lovely couple,
Rob and Elaine...

2
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,750
...who rented a house one especially
hot and sticky summer in the Hamptons.

3
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,756
Elaine invited her best single friends,
Cindy and Janet...

4
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,089
...while Rob invited his single friends,
Ira and Matthew...

5
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,130
...to share the good times
and exorbitant rent.

6
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,995
Until one day,
this lovely couple had a terrible fight...

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,695
...when Elaine went for a run
and twisted her ankle...

8
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:13,865
...and came back early
to find Rob canoodling with Janet.

9
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,973
And Cindy got tired of Matthew's
idiotic jokes and incessant market chatter.

10
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,707
Ira tried to be there for Elaine
and confessed his true feelings for her...

11
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,943
...which she tried to laugh off as a joke.

12
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,146
By August, it got to the point
where everything was so awkward...

13
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,121
...that nobody wanted to come back.

14
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,784
And that's when Janet
called her friend Charlotte.

15
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,586
It's a really cute three-bedroom cottage.

16
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,495
They're giving us a fantastic deal
for the month of August.

17
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,729
Because it's haunted with
cheating boyfriends and sexual rejection.

18
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,292
We can always burn sage.

19
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,862
Sharing a house with your girlfriends
is fine in your 20s...

20
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,742
...but in your 30s, isn't it a bit pathetic,
Iike being the oldest kid at summer camp?

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,176
She has a point.

22
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,681
My 25-year-old assistant, Nina Grabowski...

23
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,650
...has a summer share in Bridgehampton
with 18 other girls.

24
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,451
They sleep in shifts.

25
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,318
-What if they meet someone?
-They fuck in shifts, too.

26
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,683
Hold it.

27
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,990
I can't believe you guys would pass up
a chance to get out of this heat.

28
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,657
Besides, the city's completely dead
during August.

29
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:17,134
-Because everyone's in the Hamptons.
-Or stuck in traffic trying to get there.

30
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,401
This could be the Iast summer we can all
get together and do something Iike this.

31
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:26,242
I mean, next year, who knows?
One of us could be married or have kids.

32
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:31,045
And we'II always regret that Iast summer
we didn't spend together in the Hamptons.

33
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,318
Charlotte's sweet hopefulness
touched something in all of us.

34
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,224
-Okay, I'm in.
-Me, too.

35
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,485
Fine, but I get the Iate shift.

36
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,358
Samantha always felt like
she was in her 20s...

37
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,868
...until seeing an actual twenty-something
brought her down to earth.

38
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,599
No, I'm getting you on the VIP Iist.
You have to try it for one night.

39
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,903
My best friend Jerry owns it.
He also owns the one in South Beach.

40
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,136
Yes, the same one.

41
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,237
Proof and confirm the guest Iist
for the Hetrick-Martin benefit.

42
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,077
And get me Richard Johnson, ASAP.

43
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,977
He is not a fag, because I happen to have
three friends he's personally fucked.

44
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,384
You are nasty. You are.

45
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:15,291
I'm sending you a car, to and fro, and if you
hate it, I'm gonna Iet you blow me. I am.

46
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,527
I am serious. Off, now.

47
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,867
AIec, I've gotta go.
I'II keep you posted, okay?

48
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,231
Bye, honey.

49
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,867
I have personal relationships of my own,
you know.

50
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,172
-Not with my clients, you don't.
-I have my career to worry about.

51
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,348
Your career is being my assistant.

52
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:40,414
You're so deluded. You wouldn't even
know what's hot if it wasn't for me.

53
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,721
Unfortunately you don't seem to
grasp the vast difference between us.

54
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,256
Yes, I do.

55
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,891
You stood in Iine at Studio 54...

56
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,055
...I stood in Iine at Studio 54, the movie.

57
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:59,538
I gave that bitch her first job out of
college. She didn't know a fucking thing!

58
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,133
Girls in their 20s, they're spoiled
and ungrateful. They think they're it.

59
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,040
Don't they realize, we're still it?

60
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,705
No, because the world validates
their delusion.

61
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,647
And she took a copy of my Rolodex.
Do you think I can sue?

62
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,545
-Do you remember us in our 20s?
-Dimly.

63
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,881
Have some compassion.

64
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:19,653
The only thing worse than being single
in your 30s is being single in your 20s.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,024
Where've you been? I was worried
you'd miss the jitney.

66
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,790
The Hamptons Jitney is like
the bus to summer camp...

67
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,857
...only instead of singing everyone
ignores each other and talks on their cell.

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,335
Everyone, this is Greg.

69
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,032
This is Samantha, Carrie and Miranda.

70
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,096
Hi!

71
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,177
Greg's been going to the Hamptons
every summer for 20 years.

72
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,075
-Since I was six.
-You do the math.

73
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,135
I have.

74
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,812
Thank you.

75
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,050
Easy, sister, no need to push.

76
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,517
Four bumper-to-bumper hours later,
we arrived at our new digs.

77
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:02,325
They said this place was shabby chic,
I'm thinking it's much more shitty chic.

78
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,165
These towels are mildewed.

79
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,830
Actually, this whole house smells
Iike mildew.

80
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,241
It's not mildew, it's beachy.

81
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,801
Would you all stop being so cynical?
We're Iucky to be here.

82
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,713
Cynicism. Now there's one advantage
we have over girls in their 20s.

83
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,047
I was cynical in high school.

84
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,951
Who's that?

85
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:25,148
It's Greg, that cute guy I met on the jitney.
I told him to drop by.

86
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,920
And if he asks, he thinks I'm 27.

87
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,652
Evidently, while we had taken
the Midtown Tunnel...

88
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,960
...Charlotte had taken the time tunnel.

89
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,556
-Hi!
-Hey.

90
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,727
Come on in. You guys remember Greg.

91
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,094
Hi, Greg.

92
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,601
Hey!

93
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,505
Me and my housemates are having
a big bonfire tonight at the beach...

94
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,711
...and I just wanted to tell you
that you're all invited.

95
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,144
Excellent!

96
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,228
Here you go, Iadies.

97
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,158
There's so much foam
you could ski on the head!

98
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,296
Sorry, it's been awhile
since I pumped a keg.

99
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,672
I Iove young men, but come on. The guys
here don't even have chest hair yet!

100
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,569
That's good news for their backs.

101
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,676
Sorry!

102
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,044
Okay, this is really fun.
How Iong do we have to stay?

103
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,813
God!

104
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,149
I'm gonna go tell Charlotte we're Ieaving.

105
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,629
Another thing about twenty-something
girls is they're very considerate.

106
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,360
You can always count on one of them
to hold your hair when you vomit.

107
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,068
Excuse me!

108
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,433
My God, Carrie Bradshaw!

109
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,605
-Yeah?
-Laurel Harris.

110
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,939
May I just tell you that I worship you?

111
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,571
I read your column every week,
it's Iike my religion.

112
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,941
Thank you.

113
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,644
I work in a publishing house,
but I'm really a writer.

114
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,686
-Great.
-We'II see.

115
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,522
Maybe I could send you something
to read sometime?

116
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,457
-Sure.
-That would mean so much to me.

117
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,223
To have someone Iike you as my mentor.

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,193
Well, mentor.

119
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,933
Could I call you sometime in the city?

120
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,867
If I could spend some time with you,
that would be so cool.

121
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,329
Of course. I'II be Iooking at
a very busy summer.

122
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,808
I can help.
I'II run errands, I'II do your wash.

123
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:30,138
No menial Iabor necessary.
I'II just give you my phone number.

124
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,180
My God, this is so cool.

125
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,485
Thank you.

126
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,450
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

127
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,761
The next day, Miranda woke up early
to enjoy the cool morning breeze...

128
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,664
...and a much-needed moment of solitude.

129
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,564
AII right, somebody puked on the deck.

130
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,699
Sorry...

131
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,135
...Stacey and Holly did
too many Jell-O shots.

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,341
What are you, 25 now?

133
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,974
Good morning.

134
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,984
No, 27!

135
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,147
Whatever.

136
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:16,284
That week, back in the city,
I wondered what was the allure of the 20s?

137
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,058
On one hand, there's great skin tone,
the thrill of fresh experience...

138
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,068
...and the sense of a consequence-free life
full of endless possibilities.

139
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,505
While on the other, there are horrible
apartments, sexually inexperienced men...

140
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,702
...and embarrassing errors
in fashion judgment.

141
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,514
Should we fear these freshly minted, single
women as a threat to our very survival...

142
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,213
...or pity them as clueless half-wits
about to get their dreams dashed...

143
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,449
...and illusions shattered?

144
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,524
Twenty-something girls...

145
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,493
...friend or foe?

146
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,060
And that evening,
in my first act as a mentor...

147
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,367
...I took my young acolyte to a book party.

148
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,166
My God.

149
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,974
I can't believe I'm out with
Carrie Bradshaw. This is too cool.

150
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,308
Stop, I can feel my head swelling.

151
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,247
If it gets any bigger,
I'II have to say goodbye to my hats.

152
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,442
I have a question.

153
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,714
Do you think that 25 is too young
to write a personal memoir?

154
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,814
As Iong as it doesn't deal with incest,
Prozac, or partying, no.

155
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,992
It does deal with sex,
or rather not having sex.

156
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:26,020
It's about how girls my age
are saving themselves for marriage.

157
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,963
-Saving what for marriage?
-Our virginity.

158
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,938
Are you telling me that you've
never had sex with a man?

159
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,608
That is correct.

160
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,406
Okay, what do you consider sex?

161
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,311
Are you implying I'm
some kind of Lewinsky?

162
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,216
I'm not! I'm talking no blowjobs,
no hand jobs.

163
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,084
AII right, I get it, no jobs of any kind.

164
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,086
You know what?
I think I need to get a drink.

165
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,191
-I'II get it. Cosmopolitan, right?
-Yeah.

166
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,959
I remember from your column.

167
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,865
A 25-year-old virgin was getting me
a Cosmopolitan.

168
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,203
The generation gap
had never seemed so wide.

169
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,606
Hi.

170
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,745
-Have you actually read the book?
-No, have you?

171
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,713
Not yet.

172
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,443
Know anything about the author?

173
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:23,011
His family has a history of diabetes
and he has a steel splint in his Ieft femur.

174
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,684
-I'm his doctor, Bradley Meego.
-Carrie Bradshaw.

175
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,793
My doctor won't even make house calls,
Iet alone attend a book party.

176
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,855
I've never been to one.
I thought it might be interesting.

177
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,764
It's exceeded all my expectations.

178
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,168
Generally, it's cheese and crackers.
You never see an actual shrimp.

179
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,364
No, I meant you.

180
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,001
I'd ask you for a drink after
but I'm driving to the Hamptons.

181
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,144
I'm going out to the Hamptons tomorrow.

182
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,009
Great, can I call you there?

183
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,945
AII right, you know what?

184
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,488
I'II be with my friends Saturday
at Townline Beach.

185
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,285
A big yellow umbrella.
You can come by and say hello.

186
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,519
Is this a ploy to see me in my bathing suit?

187
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,985
-Here's your Cosmo.
-Thank you.

188
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,431
Dr. Bradley Meego, this is Laurel.

189
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,161
-Hi.
-Hey.

190
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,030
What if it rains?
Do we pick another date?

191
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,263
Doctor, you are persistent.

192
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,641
AII right. In case of emergency, only.

193
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,182
Now I'm gonna have to buy the book.

194
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,118
Nice meeting you. You, too.

195
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,316
Drive safe.

196
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,651
My God, he is such a fox.

197
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,820
Did you meet him when I was at the bar?

198
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,499
Lady, you've got it going on!

199
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,098
That Saturday turned out
to be hot and sunny.

200
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,430
While we sat under our umbrella...

201
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,136
...twenty-something girls sizzled on the
sand like rotisserie chickens.

202
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,145
Excuse me,
when did tanning come back in style?

203
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,511
Hand me the 45!

204
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,651
Forty-five, I didn't know
it went up that high.

205
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,748
You could sit in a microwave and not burn.

206
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,484
It's Charlotte's,
but I don't think she'II be using it.

207
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,618
It's not good for her 27-year-old image.

208
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,588
She actually put on oil.

209
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,893
Just Iet her have her fun now.

210
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,833
Come Labor Day, she's gonna Iook Iike
a 27-year-old handbag.

211
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,895
I'd risk a few precancerous
freckles for a summer romance.

212
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,774
And right then, my summer romance
made his appearance, right on schedule.

213
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,278
Yellow umbrellas seem to be
very popular this year.

214
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,814
This is Dr. Bradley Meego.

215
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,943
Hello.

216
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,617
What kind of a doctor are you, Doctor?

217
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,317
Internal medicine.
General, all-purpose kind of thing.

218
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,224
Fabulous, so you can prescribe medication?

219
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,829
-What'd you have in mind?
-Feel free to ignore her.

220
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,765
I'm sure that's impossible.
I'm gonna go take a quick dip.

221
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,065
-You promise not to ditch me, now.
-I promise.

222
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,172
-Is that the guy from the book party?
-Yeah.

223
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,240
I've got to start reading.

224
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,777
He's cute. I'm just not
really sure I'm interested.

225
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,182
Good-Iooking, polite,
house in the Hamptons.

226
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,582
-It's good on paper.
-You know the rule.

227
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,485
Good on paper, bad in bed.

228
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,858
A "good on paper guy"
is a guy with great credentials...

229
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,626
...who you always end up leaving
for some hot guy...

230
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,191
...who rides a motorcycle and doesn 't have
a checking account.

231
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,531
My God!

232
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,198
The water feels so awesome.
You guys should really go in.

233
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,639
You better put on some sunscreen,
Georgette Hamilton.

234
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,212
That's okay, I never burn.

235
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,910
Well, I do.
In fact, I've had enough for today.

236
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,714
I'm gonna go grocery shopping.
You guys want anything?

237
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,982
We should get some rum.
We can make Long Island Iced Teas.

238
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,715
Yes, I Iove Long Island Iced Teas.

239
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,152
Excellent!

240
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,434
I took a Ieap of faith
and made reservations...

241
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,838
...at one of those impossible-to-get-into
restaurants for tonight.

242
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,876
I'd Iove to...

243
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,412
...I just can't abandon my friends.

244
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,850
Actually, that wasn't an invitation.
It was just restaurant chitchat.

245
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm kidding.

246
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,287
How about after dinner?

247
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,417
I've got a great Iittle house,
cute porch we could sit on.

248
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,983
I don't know.

249
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,631
Okay, how about I just call your...

250
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,894
...in-case-of-emergency number
this weekend.

251
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,094
The emergency being,
I think I'm gonna miss you.

252
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,468
Yes, you could definitely do that.

253
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,630
Good.

254
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,803
Romantic, polite, and his very own house
south of the highway.

255
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,276
My good-on-paper guy
was jumping right off the page.

256
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,277
Later that afternoon, we came back from
the beach rested, rejuvenated...

257
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,117
...feeling almost 29 again.

258
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,220
Even Miranda was in good spirits.

259
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,660
Guys, I just got back from the market.
Fresh corn and seafood for dinner.

260
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,556
Except, your groupie can't stay.
I only got enough for the four of us.

261
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,692
She's here?

262
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,828
Yeah, she was asking too many inane
questions. I sent her up to your room.

263
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,136
-Thanks.
-Sorry.

264
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:13,211
I've got to shower, the sand is itchy
in my bathing suit, and then I'II help you.

265
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,975
Take your time. That came for you.

266
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,373
My God!

267
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,076
What's wrong?

268
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,485
It's for the Hamptons Hoedown
tomorrow night...

269
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,252
...and the event is being run by
Nina G. Public Relations. Nina G.!

270
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,159
Overnight, Samantha's ex-assistant,
Nina Grabowski...

271
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,459
...had reinvented herself as Nina G.

272
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:37,025
I was up for that job and now she's using
my Rolodex to put together the guest Iist.

273
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,196
While Samantha was getting
fucked royally by her protege...

274
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,769
...mine was giving me the royal treatment.

275
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,605
It's not that I don't wanna
have sex with men...

276
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,613
...I feel Iike these previous
generations of women have...

277
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,139
...devalued sex to the point
where it's not even special anymore.

278
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,618
One summer, when I was 15,
I read everything Jackie Collins ever wrote.

279
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,349
I thought to myself, who cares?

280
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,118
Is it supposed to be shocking...

281
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,354
...wagging one's pussy
at every good-Iooking stud who walks by?

282
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,864
-PIease.
-And what is it you Iike about my column?

283
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,135
I have a tiny tick on my stomach,
and I can't get it off.

284
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,836
-Does it hurt?
-No, but it itches.

285
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,463
My God, that is not a tick.

286
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:16,833
What is it?

287
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,537
There go our shitty sheets.

288
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,310
My God, it's so disgusting.

289
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,242
-Where's she going?
-To the drugstore.

290
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,987
Charlotte really is in her 20s.
She's got crabs.

291
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,716
My God!

292
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,359
That night, I called Dr. Meego.

293
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,761
I figured it was an emergency.

294
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,395
I have this thing about crabs.

295
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,336
I had them in college
and it scarred me for Iife.

296
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,602
I can't go back to that house
until the mattresses are sanitized...

297
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,734
...and the sheets and towels are burned.

298
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,108
I'm flattered you thought of me.

299
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,910
I'd be happy to prescribe your friend
some industrial-strength pubicide.

300
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,076
She can take care of herself.

301
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,687
Cheers.

302
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,020
You might have to spend the night here.

303
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,493
I might have to, but only to sleep.

304
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,935
Women always say that
and as soon as the Iights go out...

305
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,165
...boom, they're going for my pajamas.

306
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,176
AII righty. I promise, no funny stuff.

307
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,177
That night we slept together,
but we didn't sleep together.

308
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,878
It was really nice.

309
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:41,119
I believe it was the first instance of a case
of crabs moving a relationship forward.

310
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,668
Every year, one of the local
Hamptons billionaires got down and dirty...

311
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,070
...and threw a big hoedown
full of cowboys and caviar.

312
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,438
It was the event of the season.

313
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,304
We joined Samantha
to lend our moral support.

314
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,914
I can't believe it.

315
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:07,816
There're people here who don't even come
to my parties and they came to Nina's.

316
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,979
Look at her over there.

317
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,617
Beef jerky carpaccio?

318
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,685
I am just so depressed right now.
Excuse me.

319
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,457
Where are you going?

320
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:23,467
To congratulate Nina.
I may need her to hire me someday.

321
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,228
While Samantha set out to negotiate
twenty-something detente...

322
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,037
...Charlotte prepared to launch
a full-out war.

323
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,268
Excuse me.

324
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,920
Do you know that you gave me crabs?

325
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,420
-What?
-You heard me.

326
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,897
-What makes you think it was me?
-That is so tacky.

327
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,094
So is Iying about your age.

328
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,433
I saw your Iicense
when you bought the beer.

329
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,632
I didn't Iie. You made an assumption,
I didn't contradict it.

330
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,699
Whatever.

331
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,370
I may have given you crabs,
but you deceived me.

332
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,377
-That is so much worse.
-Grow up.

333
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,960
You are a waitperson.
That doesn't mean wait, it means go!

334
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,864
My God, you actually came.

335
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:33,466
I just stopped by to wish you good Iuck.
It's a fabulous party.

336
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,163
That is very cool of you.

337
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,573
I told you not to seat Martha
near the hayride. She's allergic.

338
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,971
PIease try to keep the young people
out until after 11:00.

339
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,980
We're all out of country-fried goat cheese,
somebody got stuck with a cactus needle...

340
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,715
...and there are people outside
who aren't on the Iist.

341
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,189
Jesus fucking Christ.
You are totally coked out.

342
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,657
You are totally jealous.

343
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,328
My God, what is that?

344
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,494
What is that sound? My God!

345
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,064
That's not supposed to happen until 12:00.

346
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,196
-I know.
-This is your problem. Get them to stop!

347
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,763
I can't, they're on a fucking barge!

348
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,635
Could you help me?
I need to get everybody outside.

349
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,238
I'm totally fucked right now.

350
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,676
Okay, people, fiesta fireworks, outside!

351
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,278
Let's go!

352
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,192
This is Greg.

353
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,491
I think the two of you
would really hit it off.

354
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,531
Hi.

355
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,000
I began to realize, that the biggest threat
twenty-something girls posed...

356
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,370
...was to themselves.

357
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,272
I've been Iooking all over for you.

358
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,073
-Look, I got one just Iike yours.
-That's great.

359
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,114
You want me to get you a Cosmopolitan?

360
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,345
No. I'm gonna go find my date.
But I'II see you Iater, okay?

361
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,319
That guy from the bookstore?
My God, he was so cute.

362
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,316
Annoying, yes. Dangerous, no.

363
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,619
They were simply our youthful
doppelgangers...

364
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,719
...who needed our compassion
more than anything.

365
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,534
And then everything I so firmly believed
was promptly blown to pieces.

366
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,838
Is it you?

367
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,007
Hey. What are you doing here?

368
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,084
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

369
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,148
I just got back this week from Paris.

370
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,889
This is Natasha.

371
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,363
Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

372
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,031
Really?

373
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,436
Natasha's parents have a house in East
Hampton. We came up for the weekend.

374
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,101
Excuse me. It's nice to meet you.

375
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,184
I'm sorry, I'm just a Iittle stunned here.

376
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,680
And confused.

377
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,689
Who is she?

378
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,927
I meant to call you.

379
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,990
She's this girl that I met in Paris.

380
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,037
She works for Ralph Lauren in Europe.

381
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,769
You're in from Paris for the weekends?

382
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,404
No. The Paris deal fell through.

383
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,414
I planned on calling you.

384
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,284
I certainly didn't want
to run into you Iike this.

385
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,086
You can't plan everything.
Life can be pretty random.

386
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,321
I'm here on a date, too, somewhere.

387
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,193
He's a doctor, Bradley Meego.

388
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:50,663
He's good on paper, probably Iike Natasha.
Good-Iooking, sweet, blah-blah-blah.

389
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,296
How old is she, anyway?

390
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,004
I don't know, 26, 27.

391
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,443
Something Iike that.

392
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,543
I'II see you in the Hamptons
or back in the city.

393
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,883
I promise to call
when I get back into town.

394
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,572
Are you okay?

395
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,005
No, I just ran into Big.

396
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,739
He's back from Paris.

397
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,144
He has a new girlfriend.

398
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,746
She's 26.

399
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,743
-Where is he? I didn't see--
-God.

400
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,028
And then I realized...

401
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,869
...twenty-something girls
are just fabulous...

402
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,468
...until you see one with
the man who broke your heart.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
