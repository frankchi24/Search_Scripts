1
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,047
There are only two times
when it's appropriate...

2
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,447
...to wear the little black dress in daylight.

3
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,043
One involves leaving a party way too late.

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,146
The other involves leaving
the party way too early.

5
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,014
The New York funeral.

6
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,821
Javier was a hot Cuban designer...

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,226
...and the toast of
the New York fashion elite.

8
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,820
He was also a good friend.

9
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,796
I had known him since he was Harvey.

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,697
Javier loved clothes.

11
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,166
Unfortunately, he loved heroin more.

12
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,596
Shit.

13
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,200
Okay.

14
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,172
Wow, Iook at you!

15
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,679
You Iike?

16
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,979
Isn't it a Iittle wrong to wear
a dead man's design to his own funeral?

17
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,280
It's wrong not to.

18
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,947
Besides, at $2,000,
I better get some wear out of it.

19
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,684
$2,000? You're kidding.

20
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,124
Marked up 30 percent since yesterday.

21
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,357
That's the thing about New York.
You're always more popular dead.

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,829
I have to Iook fabulous.

23
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,365
Everyone is gonna be there.

24
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,130
Reminder, honey: this is a funeral,
not Friday night at Bond Street.

25
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,866
That's your grief talking.
Get your purse, Iet's go.

26
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,874
Sorry I'm Iate.

27
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,401
-Is everyone in town invited to this?
-Carrie invited me.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,375
You got invited with a guest?

29
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,882
We were supposed to see a show together.

30
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,146
That dress is really inappropriate.

31
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,618
Apparently, Charlotte and I
were the inappropriate ones.

32
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,056
There it was,
Javier's entire new spring line.

33
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,823
It was his best show ever.

34
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,625
Everyone's wearing a Javier.

35
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,957
Told you.

36
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,791
Lend me your hat, please?

37
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,127
Fine.

38
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,238
But if anyone asks,
it was a gift from the designer.

39
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,906
Christ, my heels keep getting stuck.

40
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,238
So much for death with dignity.

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,320
Hello.

42
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,557
Buenos dias.

43
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,455
Look at the number they did on Josephina.

44
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,688
She is beautiful.

45
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,093
She wasn't a week ago.

46
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:48,463
Josephina was Javier's sister
and heir apparent to the Javier industry.

47
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,196
In a day she had gone from ugly duckling
to Donatella Versace.

48
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,963
Death definitely became her.

49
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,531
You're smoking at a funeral?

50
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,577
Javier would have wanted it that way.

51
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,274
We are asking today...

52
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,076
...that in Javier's memory...

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,941
...all donations be made to Javier House...

54
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,217
...a home we are building to house
those in the fashion industry...

55
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,219
...who suffer from...

56
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,755
...substance abuse.

57
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,984
No, don't.

58
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,724
-No?
-No.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,431
I'm gonna help them raise money.

60
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,060
That's unusually nice of you.

61
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,503
Forget nice,
the mailing Iist will be priceless.

62
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,940
And I'II have every unlisted 212 number
in Manhattan.

63
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,143
You had to give Samantha credit.
She always saw the positive.

64
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,910
One man's death was another
woman 's p.r. opportunity.

65
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:41,248
Josephina, I'm Samantha Jones
from Samantha Jones Public Relations.

66
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,118
I was so touched by your speech,
that I wanted to....

67
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,168
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,135
It's nothing to Iose your hat over.

69
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,910
She Ioved hats.

70
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,246
It's...

71
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,715
...fitting really.

72
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,118
Your mother?

73
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,377
My wife.

74
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,687
I'm so sorry.

75
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,018
It's okay.

76
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,088
Thanks.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,058
Kids?

78
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,759
Nope.

79
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,199
It's just a drink.

80
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,402
He works on the same block as my gallery.

81
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,771
You picked up a man at a cemetery?

82
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,871
He's handsome and he went to Princeton.

83
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,348
-The widower thing is a definite no-no.
-Why?

84
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,748
The dead wife factor.

85
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,378
No matter how bitchy she was alive,
now she's dead...

86
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,888
...and you're the bitch
who can't Iive up to her.

87
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,188
-Don't talk about his wife Iike that.
-See? Happening already.

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,228
It's not his fault she died.

89
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,130
And besides, going through something
Iike that makes him more sensitive.

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,497
He's felt really deeply.
He's in touch with his emotions.

91
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,167
It's kind of romantic.

92
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,666
Think about it. He's been married.

93
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,238
It shows he can commit.

94
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,742
Then date a divorced guy.

95
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,040
They've committed
and everyone's still alive.

96
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,443
It didn't work for Big.

97
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,142
AII marriage did
was convince him he hated committing.

98
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,615
You broke up with him.

99
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,846
So I'm the one
with the commitment problem?

100
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,080
I'm just saying....

101
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,121
While we were watching them
break ground on Javier's last location...

102
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,224
...Miranda was breaking new ground
of her own.

103
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,363
So, it's just you?

104
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,657
Yep.

105
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,994
Just me.

106
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,525
Such a big apartment to buy for just you.

107
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,400
I have a Iot of shoes.

108
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,904
Maybe the boyfriend will move in?

109
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,567
No boyfriend.

110
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,976
Just me.

111
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,141
I have a son who owns his own business.

112
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,546
No, thanks.

113
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,687
I'II take it.

114
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,986
With that, Ms. Miranda Hobbes Esquire,
a.k.a. "just me"...

115
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,088
...bought herself her first apartment
and promptly took herself out for a drink.

116
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,837
While Miranda was out
celebrating her future...

117
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,771
...I was in contemplating my own.

118
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,404
In a city that moves so fast,
you get the Sunday paper on Saturday...

119
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,380
...how did any of us know
how much time we had left?

120
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,381
There was so much I hadn't done.
I'd never been to Greece.

121
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:30,081
I hadn't finished painting my bathroom
My Visa bill still wasn't paid in full.

122
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,152
Hell, sometimes I felt like
I was barely living.

123
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,082
Hello.

124
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,598
It's just me.

125
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,168
So, how are you?

126
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,134
Just got back from a funeral.

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,408
And you thought of me? I'm flattered.

128
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,735
Listen...

129
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,572
...do you want to have dinner some time?

130
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,776
I'd Iike to have dinner any old time.
Who am I having dinner with?

131
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,143
Me.

132
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,683
In that case, I better check my book.

133
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,447
-I'm hanging up now.
-Fine.

134
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,121
Saturday, 8:00, Roberto's.
Be there or be square.

135
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,791
God, you're old.

136
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,262
It was so easy.

137
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,062
Just like that,
I had made a Saturday night date with Big.

138
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,662
In under 30 seconds,
we had resuscitated a relationship...

139
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,230
...that had taken six months to die.

140
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,806
The next day, Samantha set out
to break some records of her own.

141
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,278
You know,
I rarely make personal contributions.

142
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,017
We'd Iove to have you
on the Javier House board.

143
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,951
Maybe in this case
you can make an exception?

144
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,552
I'II tell you what's exceptional.

145
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,718
Getting solicited by a woman
as beautiful as you.

146
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,660
Richard Cranwell,
senior partner at Bear Sterns...

147
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,529
...philanthropist, playboy.
His specialty was hostile takeovers.

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,626
FIattery will get you everywhere,
Mr. Cranwell.

149
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,570
PIease, call me Dick.

150
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,932
Dick.

151
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,170
In Samantha's case,
it was more like a friendly merger.

152
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,769
Perhaps we could discuss Javier House
over dinner sometime.

153
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,472
I believe that could be arranged.

154
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,687
Samantha groped Cranwell for the good
of all strung-out designers everywhere.

155
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,559
Unfortunately, she was
not expecting Sandy Cranwell...

156
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,058
...back early from groping
a sweater set at Bendels.

157
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,396
Get out.

158
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,725
I'II just Ieave the proposal.

159
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:33,338
Apparently, Sandy was not feeling
as charitable as her husband.

160
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,681
Meanwhile,
at her mortgage company across town...

161
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,479
...Miranda was having her own
troubles closing the deal.

162
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,644
So, it's just you.

163
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,553
Yeah, just me.

164
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,723
Check the "single woman" box.

165
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,624
Initial.

166
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,300
And the down payment's
coming from your father?

167
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,959
No.

168
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,335
Just me.

169
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,712
Check the "single woman" box.

170
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,275
In the course of one hour...

171
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,754
...Miranda had checked more single
women 's boxes than her gynecologist.

172
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,422
I'm telling you, if I was a single man,
none of this would be happening.

173
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,828
If you were a single man, I'd date you.

174
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,663
I've got the money, I've got a great job,
and I still get, "it's just you?"

175
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,034
They're threatened. Buying a place alone
means you don't need a man.

176
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,094
I don't.

177
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,664
Everyone needs a man. That's why I rent.

178
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,143
If you own and he still rents,
then the power structure is all off.

179
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,304
It's emasculating.

180
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,848
Men don't want a woman
who's too self-sufficient.

181
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,113
I'm sorry, did someone just
order a Victorian straight up?

182
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,354
I'm sorry, Miss Jones,
your card's not accepted.

183
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,255
That's not possible. Try it again.

184
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,521
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

185
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,087
Your card and you are not accepted here.

186
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,065
Samantha had messed with
the wrong woman.

187
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,701
Sandy Cranwell practically owned
Manhattan and wanted Samantha off it.

188
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,206
Come on, Iet's go.

189
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,866
Sandy Cranwell had done
what any well-heeled socialite would do.

190
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,436
She took out a social hit on Samantha.

191
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,780
In 12 hours,
Sam had gone from "a" list to blacklist.

192
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,687
The next night,
Charlotte met Ned the widower for drinks.

193
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,018
This was fun.

194
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,856
Maybe we could meet
for a real meal next time.

195
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,019
I'd Iike that.

196
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,292
They talked about architecture,
art, the Ivy League.

197
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,493
The ex-wife wasn 't even in the picture...

198
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,796
Is this her?

199
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,461
...until the ex-wife's picture showed up.

200
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,934
Yeah.

201
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,472
She's so pretty.

202
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,239
Let's get out of here, okay?

203
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,512
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,110
That was really thoughtless of me.
I know this must be hard for you.

205
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,021
It's just a Iittle weird
talking about her on a date.

206
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,090
I understand.

207
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,331
It's a beautiful night.

208
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,637
Are you okay?

209
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,074
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,676
It's just--

211
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,946
Seeing Liz's picture
and thinking about her....

212
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,315
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

213
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,745
Here.

214
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,349
Ordinarily,
Charlotte hated when men cried.

215
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,654
But on Ned,
it only made him more romantic.

216
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,962
Wow.

217
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,470
So embarrassing.

218
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,538
I'm just...

219
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,740
...feeling so much right now.

220
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,607
Those were magic words
to Charlotte's ears.

221
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:57,881
It's okay.

222
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,316
You just take as much time as you need.

223
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,684
Okay? It's okay.

224
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,106
Apparently, all the time Ned needed
was 45 minutes.

225
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,339
That night, under the watchful eyes
of a dead woman...

226
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,010
...Ned came back to life...

227
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,646
...twice.

228
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,625
One word:

229
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,858
-Rebound.
-Not when the other person's dead.

230
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,129
She has a point.

231
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,830
He's moving on.
I'm helping him to get over his wife.

232
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,602
This guy has "project" written all over him.

233
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,767
That's not fair.

234
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,003
So how was the sex?

235
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,340
Amazing.

236
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,915
It was Iike Liz was Iooking over us,
giving us her blessing.

237
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,573
A threesome in absentia.

238
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,381
I mean,
my hat blew right into her headstone.

239
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,354
She was clearly sending a message.

240
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,118
Yeah, "don't fuck my husband,
you hat-Ioving bitch."

241
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,586
He invited me to a memorial service
at her grave next week.

242
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,720
That is huge.

243
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,492
Excuse me,
but when did cemeteries get so happening?

244
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,263
It's a sign that he's ready to move on.
And he's ready to do it with me.

245
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,497
You're saying you fucked him back to Iife?

246
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,437
In a way, yes.

247
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,974
Man, you're good.

248
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,600
That night I had my date with Big.

249
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,674
I was feeling everything...

250
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,476
...fear, happiness, dread.

251
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,616
Was I ready to jump back
into a life with Big in it?

252
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,348
Was seeing him again a huge mistake?

253
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,953
And if it was...

254
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,651
...why was I so excited?

255
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,452
I had never felt so confused.

256
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,027
Was Charlotte right?

257
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,156
In a world where everyone's dying
to make a connection...

258
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,701
...can a relationship bring you back to life?

259
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,565
I never really thought about it.

260
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,663
Come on, everybody wonders
what happens after you die.

261
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,005
I'm too busy wondering
who's dinging my car in the garage.

262
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,478
I think we reincarnate.

263
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,114
That's the easy way out.

264
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,946
What are you gonna come back as?

265
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,617
Someone who knows better.

266
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,183
You smell nice.

267
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,192
I'm serious.

268
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,691
-Do you believe in heaven?
-Yeah.

269
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,093
Really?

270
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,297
What's your idea of heaven?

271
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,464
A big bed.

272
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,466
And they're just saying, "Come on in."

273
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,175
You're idea of heaven is a bed?

274
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,337
It depends on who's in it.

275
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,276
I'm not sleeping with you tonight.

276
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,281
I thought we were just having dinner.

277
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,882
We are.

278
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:53,390
A half hour later, and I was back at Big's,
the site of so many past little deaths.

279
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,585
It felt great and weird and...

280
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,853
...wrong.

281
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,726
-We can't do this.
-Yes, we can.

282
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,026
Not Iike this.

283
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,397
You're right, Iet's go inside.

284
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,695
No.

285
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,032
I have to go.

286
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,604
I didn 't know what had happened...

287
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,669
...but suddenly, getting back together
with Big seemed like a very bad idea.

288
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:19,081
I was scared to death. The first time
we got involved, I got out just in time.

289
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,085
Would I be as lucky the second?

290
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,615
Across town, Samantha was facing
her own uncertain future.

291
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,591
-Check it again: Samantha Jones.
-Sorry.

292
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,754
The first time, she thought it was
an unfortunate oversight.

293
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,820
The second time was just unfortunate.

294
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,366
-I'm sorry, we're all full.
-I'II wait for a table.

295
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,027
Don't bother.

296
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,538
By the third time she was turned away,
it had all become clear.

297
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,573
She was deader in this town than Javier.

298
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,135
Teddy, take her out of here.

299
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,847
The next day,
Miranda met her new neighbor.

300
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,111
Hello!

301
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,081
Are you my new neighbor?

302
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,986
Yeah. Hi, I'm Miranda Hobbes.

303
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,554
Nice to meet you.

304
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,055
I haven't actually moved in yet.
I'm just taking some measurements.

305
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,723
I'm so glad to have
a young person moving in.

306
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,799
Brings a Iittle Iife to the place.

307
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,066
Ruthie kept pretty much to herself.

308
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,360
Never married.

309
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,368
She died in there, you know.

310
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,333
She did?

311
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,844
Oh, yes.

312
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,982
It was a week
before anyone realized she passed.

313
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,012
Rumor has it, the cat ate half her face.

314
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,046
So, just you?

315
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,624
That night, Miranda had another
disconcerting experience.

316
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,025
Halfway through her
Three Delicacy Delight...

317
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,502
...a delicacy got stuck.

318
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,962
After Miranda was done
saving her own life...

319
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,502
...she called someone
who could commiserate.

320
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,530
Unfortunately,
I was deep into screening mode.

321
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,905
Big had called twice and I didn't know
what I wanted to say to him.

322
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,274
Oh my God, I just choked!

323
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,346
I just almost died and you are not--

324
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,106
Hey, sweetie, you all right?

325
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,549
I was watching Hard Copy,
and I kept thinking when they found me...

326
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,417
...I would forever be
the dead girl who watched bad TV.

327
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,217
Why didn't you call me?

328
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,418
I couldn't breathe.
I'm gonna die alone, Carrie.

329
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,995
No, you are not.
Do you want me to come over?

330
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,690
No, I'm okay.

331
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,728
I'II call you tomorrow.

332
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,726
The fact was, Miranda was not okay.

333
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,573
She went to bed hungry and locked
the cat in the kitchen for two days.

334
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,074
After a week of being a social pariah...

335
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:03,410
...Samantha realized if she ever wanted to
get her life back, she'd have to beg for it.

336
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,847
She went to the top, the Godfather.

337
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,578
Samantha Jones.

338
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,353
The name sounds familiar.

339
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,323
Shippy Shipman was the queen
of the ladies who lunch.

340
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,657
And was personally responsible
for the demise of at least 70 social lives.

341
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,562
You might know me from
the Javier House Foundation?

342
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,258
No, that's not it.

343
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,323
No?

344
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,395
I believe you were the whore who once
groped my husband at a Whitney benefit.

345
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,469
It was bad.
Not only was Samantha dying...

346
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,204
...but her entire sex life
was flashing before her.

347
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,042
Maybe. I don't really remember.

348
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,173
I do.

349
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,820
You're good friends with Sandy Cranwell?

350
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,616
Yes, we go back to Chapin.

351
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,786
Could you maybe talk to her for me?

352
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,159
I think you made your own bed
and you need to Iie in it.

353
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,591
And you're good at that,
aren't you, Samantha?

354
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,027
What do you want me to say, Shippy?

355
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,767
That I'm a whore?

356
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,570
That I've slept with every man in New York
and some in Brooklyn?

357
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,936
AII right, maybe I have.

358
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,080
Is that what it's gonna take?

359
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,241
Okay, I'm a big whore.

360
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,080
Now, will you help me?

361
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,622
I don't think so.

362
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,686
Fine.

363
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,730
And I only groped your husband's flat
preppy ass at that benefit...

364
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,132
...because I was drunk.

365
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,529
I'II see myself out.

366
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,073
The next day, Miranda decided
to check out her new neighborhood.

367
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,548
But suddenly,
she was the one checking out.

368
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,601
That was the peculiar thing
about New York...

369
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,700
...you never knew if a cab was
going to save you or kill you...

370
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,802
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, please.

371
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,868
...or both.

372
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,008
That was freaky.

373
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,410
I felt Iike I was drowning
and dying at the same time.

374
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,352
They said you had a panic attack.

375
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:29,122
Yeah, and I had to pay $500 of my
single person's salary to find that out.

376
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,996
What's wrong?

377
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,765
Take a good Iook at my face,
because at my funeral...

378
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,497
...there'II only be half of it.

379
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,369
I'II be dead and my cat will be happy.

380
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,466
Charlotte will be picking up men
at the next grave site over.

381
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,875
Breathe, sweetie, breathe.

382
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,573
I'm all alone, Carrie.

383
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,643
The first people on my "call in case of
emergency" Iist are my parents.

384
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,584
And I don't Iike them.
And they Iive in Pennsylvania.

385
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,953
Sweetie, you can put me on there.

386
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,858
I can't! You screen!

387
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,485
I'II pick up.

388
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,295
I promise.

389
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,894
Listen...

390
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,435
...you did the right thing
buying that apartment.

391
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,400
-You Iove it, right?
-Yeah.

392
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,771
And you won't be alone forever.

393
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,342
The truth was, I didn't know
if any of us would end up alone.

394
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,541
But I did know Miranda couldn't
afford another panic attack.

395
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,519
Meanwhile, over in Queens...

396
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,890
...Charlotte was about to get
a surprise of her own.

397
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,759
You brought Iilies.

398
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,559
You said they were her favorite.

399
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,645
PIease tell me those are your sisters.

400
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,246
I don't have any sisters.

401
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,708
Charlotte realized she wasn't
the only woman resuscitating Ned.

402
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,554
Charlotte's relationship
died right where it started.

403
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,989
She was prepared
to live in the shadow of a dead woman.

404
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,691
She wasn 't prepared to live in the shadow
of three live ones.

405
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,445
That Saturday, Samantha hit rock bottom...

406
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,580
...also known as Javier House.

407
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,140
No one would return her phone calls.
She hadn 't raised any money.

408
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,051
All she could do for
Javier House was construct it.

409
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:40,987
But six hours of hard labor later,
Samantha experienced her own rebirth.

410
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,757
It was Leonardo DiCaprio, ex machina.

411
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,965
That day, Leonardo and Samantha
became fast friends.

412
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,828
The nightmare was over.

413
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:55,202
Leonardo DiCaprio had brought
Sam back to social life.

414
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,975
To add insult to panic attack...

415
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,707
...Miranda had just gotten
some unsettling news.

416
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,017
The mortgage officer had
messed up Miranda's application.

417
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,814
They had inadvertently
labeled her as "separated. "

418
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,582
And to clear up the confusion...

419
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:14,216
...Miranda had to write
a rather humiliating letter.

420
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:24,828
Miranda had a choice.
She could panic or she could just type.

421
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,267
Miranda killed her panic attacks
right then and there.

422
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,387
She realized she probably
wouldn't die alone.

423
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,818
But she kept overfeeding
her cat just in case.

424
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,967
Meanwhile, four unreturned calls later,
my number was up.

425
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,003
Good, you're alive.

426
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,970
Wait, where are you going?

427
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,134
Home.

428
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,371
I'm old. It's past my bedtime.

429
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,371
-I'm sorry.
-You should be.

430
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,610
I had box seats to a Yankee double header.

431
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,174
Damn!

432
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,310
Who'd you take?

433
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,819
Someone who returned my calls.

434
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,822
It was deja vu all over again:

435
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,792
Me, Big, a doorway...

436
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,858
...and mixed emotions.

437
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,560
Wait, not here.

438
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,463
Don't do this, Carrie.

439
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,597
Come on.

440
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,931
We're going out.

441
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,637
I took him to the most
non-sexual place I could think of.

442
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,246
"Just you

443
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,609
"Just me"

444
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,183
I'm good!

445
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,793
-Did you see that?
-Wow, I sure did.

446
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:01,023
Two pitchers of cheap beer later,
Big and I were having a great time.

447
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,665
You know what my version of hell is?

448
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,000
Wearing rented two-tone shoes.

449
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,778
"Just us

450
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,608
"Just we"

451
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,272
Hey, batter batter!

452
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,445
No heckling the bowler.

453
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,522
Did you see that?

454
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,826
Yeah.

455
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,591
That was nice.

456
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,828
Look at that.

457
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,102
I won.

458
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,137
Okay, two out of three.

459
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,071
You want to play a second game?

460
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,876
Maybe.

461
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,844
Are you sure you're ready
to get killed all over again?

462
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,350
I didn't know what we were
talking about anymore.

463
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,750
But either way, I knew the answer.

464
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,682
Yep, Iet's do it.

465
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,917
We never made it to the second game.

466
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,965
I didn't know if it was suicide or not.

467
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,501
All I knew was
Big and I had been reincarnated...

468
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,263
...and I'd never felt more alive.
