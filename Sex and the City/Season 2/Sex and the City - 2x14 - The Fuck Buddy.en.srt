1
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,883
Iran into my friend Skipper
on the street the other day.

2
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,443
He was bruised and frantic.
He'd just broken up with another girl.

3
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,490
I thought everything was going fine.

4
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,718
That's when they tiptoe up
and clobber you.

5
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,125
What did she say she thought was wrong?

6
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:07,529
Skipper, you're a very sweet guy.
This isn't about anything you did.

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,763
It's just that we're in very
different places right now.

8
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,963
We want different things from Iife.

9
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,499
I need to spend more time alone.

10
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,839
So, actually, we want the same thing.

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,004
We both want to spend
more time with you.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,408
Three months before that,
it was a dental hygienist named Tiffany.

13
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,043
The timing is wrong, that's all.

14
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,383
You're one of the nicest guys
I've ever known.

15
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,949
I feel Iike I've reached a time in my Iife
when I need to focus on my career.

16
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,285
I don't want to feel guilty about that.

17
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,421
I don't want you to give up your career.

18
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,624
I know.

19
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:40,927
You've been great.

20
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,468
You really deserve someone
who will appreciate you.

21
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,672
I don't feel Iike I have
anything to give at the moment.

22
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,234
And last year, it was Miranda.

23
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,178
I feel Iike I need to spend more time alone.

24
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:59,241
I've just reached a point in my Iife
where I need to focus on my career.

25
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,853
I don't think that I have
anything to give at the moment.

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,490
Skipper, what else can I say?

27
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,022
I have such horrible luck with women.

28
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,755
I should've seen this coming, but I didn't...

29
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,765
...because they wait for you
to get relaxed and get comfortable...

30
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,769
...before they bring the ice pick
down between your eyes.

31
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:18,929
Not all women...

32
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,735
...just the types of women
you seem to be attracted to.

33
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,435
Over and over and over again.

34
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,777
Those Iadies don't know what they're
missing and missing and missing.

35
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,009
Skipper's pattern was clear to both of us.

36
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,110
He was a sweet guy who was
perpetually attracted to women...

37
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,779
...who were looking for jerks.

38
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,119
Later that night, on a date across town...

39
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,455
...Miranda was repeating
a pattern of her own.

40
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,985
She had been dating a lawyer she met
when they fought in court.

41
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:48,227
A frequent guest on MSBNC,
Kevin was not just argumentative...

42
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,268
...he was an anger professional.

43
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,429
I think I gotta revise my opinion...

44
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,633
...that only an idiot would
want to go out to a movie these days.

45
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,576
It was worth the $19,
plus $10 in snacks and water...

46
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,137
...just to hear that bus driver behind us
explain filmmaking to his wife.

47
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,116
He had some wonderful insights.

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,211
On the bright side,
it was an interesting movie, right?

49
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,017
It was a real Citizen Kane.

50
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,421
The actor who played Carlo was charming.

51
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,825
He Iooked Iike he walked into work
before the anesthesia wore off...

52
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,123
...from his Iobotomy.

53
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,757
AII right, I'II just get us a cab, okay?

54
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:20,821
Taxi!

55
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,266
You gotta face uptown
to get a cab around here.

56
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,699
I've caught plenty of cabs this way.

57
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,970
In never-never Iand where people
confuse a Iack of talent with charm.

58
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,278
Come on, Gene Shalit, get in the damn cab.

59
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,172
Come on.

60
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,374
Get in, sore Ioser.

61
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,249
Come on, in.

62
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,688
In, come on.

63
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,791
Miranda hated how he ordered her around
and told her what do...

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,851
...every place except one.

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,498
Put your hands up over your head.

66
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,305
Spread your Iegs.

67
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:15,245
The weird thing is when he tells me
what to do in Iife it drives me crazy.

68
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,984
But when he does it during sex
it really drives me crazy.

69
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,457
It's totally hot!

70
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,417
That Iooks Iike a good spot.

71
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,360
Everybody, check for park poo.

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,954
Isn't that funny?

73
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,192
That what I hate in Iife, I Iove in sex?

74
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,999
So, how about if you Iimit
your contact with him to just sex?

75
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,573
That's a nice, healthy relationship.

76
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,176
I'm not ready yet to throw in the towel.

77
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,474
You're just ready to
wrap it around his neck.

78
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,911
He's going through a very stressful time
waiting to make partner at his firm.

79
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,748
When that finally works out,
I think he'II Iighten up.

80
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,119
Or maybe you should face the fact
that you're attracted to angry men.

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,784
-Deviled eggs?
-Wait a second, hold the eggs!

82
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,953
What about Skipper? He never got angry.

83
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,123
-And you dumped him. Fits a pattern.
-I don't have a pattern.

84
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,291
In math,
randomness is considered a pattern.

85
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,427
And I'm what they call a prime number.

86
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,795
She's got a very obvious pattern.

87
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,433
I do? What? Tell me!

88
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,444
You wait for a perfect guy
to ask you on a perfect date--

89
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:16,037
And when he does,
you project this huge fantasy on him...

90
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,412
...setting up these enormous expectations--

91
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,714
Which promptly blow up
in your pretty face.

92
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,415
You put all your deviled eggs
in one basket.

93
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,956
That's a horrible pattern.

94
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,319
Well, spread it around a Iittle more.

95
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,829
Date a few guys at once
and then you won't feel so disappointed.

96
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,458
-Are you asking Charlotte to juggle?
-It's all about multi-tasking.

97
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,033
None of us can afford to fall into this
"one man at a time" pattern.

98
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,662
Look at how much time
you wasted with Big.

99
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,306
But Big was an aberration.

100
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,106
Next time I meet a handsome, rich,
emotionally unavailable 43-year-old man...

101
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,669
...I'II know what to expect.

102
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,805
Will you?

103
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,372
Or will you make the same mistake
all over again?

104
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,473
I wondered...

105
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,646
...were we all just victims
of conditioned responses?

106
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,158
Doomed to repeat the same
unconscious relationship patterns?

107
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,860
Were we all, in fact, just dating...

108
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,757
...the same person over and over again?

109
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,924
I guess I have dated quite a few artists.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,366
But I don't think they were
all the same person.

111
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,702
Okay, yes. They were all narcissists
with commitment phobias...

112
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,366
...and substance abuse issues.

113
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,572
But, in my opinion, the painters
were very different from the sculptors.

114
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,009
Handsome waspy assholes
who treat me Iike shit.

115
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,381
I only date girls with Sony PIaystations...

116
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,153
...or breasts.

117
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,885
That night, Samantha became acquainted
with the new neighbors next door.

118
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,719
Though she had never met them...

119
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,730
...she already knew them intimately.

120
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,466
The idea that someone else
was having great sex and flaunting it...

121
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,233
...was more than she could bear.

122
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,432
So she decided, if you can 't join 'em...

123
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,637
...beat it.

124
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,008
It all fit Samantha's pattern to a T...

125
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,716
...having a wall between her
and the person she was having sex with.

126
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,254
After a few weeks of not seeing Big...

127
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,726
...I was beginning to fall into
some familiar patterns of my own.

128
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,556
Staying out till 3:00 and sleeping till noon.

129
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,156
Ordering takeout from
the same greasy Chinese...

130
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,330
...and calling old friends who would
always be there for me when I felt...

131
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,169
...restless.

132
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,506
McFadden.

133
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,077
Hey John, it's Carrie.

134
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,439
Carrie, hey, how are you? Long time.

135
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,246
I know. Listen, I thought
if you weren't doing anything...

136
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,810
...you might want to meet
for a drink after work.

137
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,355
Sure, that would be great.

138
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,448
How about sixish?

139
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,049
I could be there at 6:30.

140
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,992
Perfect, I'II see you then.

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,164
That evening, at 6:30 sharp....

142
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,673
-Wow, it's great to see you.
-You, too.

143
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,138
Come on in.
I was just gonna open a bottle of red.

144
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,872
Red, yeah, beautiful.

145
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,883
I just gotta be somewhere by 8:30.

146
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,452
-That's okay, I've got dinner plans at 8:00.
-Okay.

147
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,763
John was as dependable a pal
as a gal could ever hope for.

148
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,466
Fun, comfortable and easy to be with.

149
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,703
The kind of guy who you could shed all
inhibitions and really be yourself around.

150
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,707
No muss, no fuss.

151
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,309
So how's the...

152
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,878
...going?

153
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,147
Great.

154
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,788
It's great.

155
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,893
-How's work with you?
-Never dull.

156
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,528
How's your younger sister doing?

157
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,964
Brother.

158
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,696
The one that moved to Phoenix?

159
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,906
-Tallahassee.
-Right.

160
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,200
So how's he doing down there?

161
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,676
-He's doing great, thanks for asking.
-Sure.

162
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,079
And then I realized it.

163
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:18,913
I didn't have a relationship pattern,
I had a between-relationship pattern.

164
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,922
I always went back to John
after every devastating...

165
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,258
...soul-shattering, gut-wrenching break up.

166
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,923
He was sweet, handsome, uncomplicated.

167
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,557
A real shot in the arm
for my sexual self esteem.

168
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,864
Thanks for the call, gorgeous.

169
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,800
Sure put a cherry on my sundae.

170
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,445
Why had I been keeping him
on the bench all these years?

171
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:44,505
Did I really believe a relationship
had to be difficult in order to work?

172
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,419
Do you want to have dinner Friday night?

173
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,846
Dinner?

174
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,389
I should check my schedule,
but I think I can make it.

175
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,450
Great.

176
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,928
You want to say...

177
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,356
...8:00?

178
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,959
How about 8:15?

179
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,025
And just like that, I broke my pattern.

180
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,130
Carrie, you can't date your fuck buddy.

181
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,438
Say it a Iittle Iouder.
The Iady in the Iast row didn't hear you.

182
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,105
You wanna take the only person in your Iife
that's there purely for sex...

183
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,842
...and make him a human being?

184
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,905
Why?

185
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,750
Excuse me, "fuck buddy"?

186
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,153
What is a "fuck buddy"?

187
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,415
Come on.

188
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,389
A fuck buddy is a guy you dated
once or twice and it didn't go anywhere...

189
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,626
...but the sex is so great,
you sort of keep him on call.

190
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,098
He's Iike "dial-a-dick."

191
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:40,328
You mean you just call this guy up
when you're, you know, horny?

192
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,668
Yes.

193
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,299
And he just comes right over?

194
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,106
Well, he's not a slave, sweetheart.
He does have a Iife.

195
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,043
But you don't have to know about it.

196
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,481
And you're guaranteed delivery
within Manhattan in six hours or Iess.

197
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,409
And you guys all have one?

198
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,182
Mine moved to Chicago
but now we have phone sex.

199
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,723
What's he doing in Chicago?

200
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,121
I have absolutely no idea.

201
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,358
A few moments later,
emboldened by our conversation...

202
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,762
...and high from too many
tantric headstands...

203
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,801
...Charlotte asked a man out
for the first time.

204
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,800
Man, that class was tough.

205
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,271
I never sweated so much in my entire Iife.

206
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,169
Would you Iike to go out
to dinner Friday night?

207
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,733
Sure.

208
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,105
I wondered...

209
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,847
...if Charlotte can break her pattern and
ask out every man in Manhattan...

210
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,253
...why couldn 't I have
a deeper relationship...

211
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,291
...with a man I have shallow sex with?

212
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,222
Wow.

213
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,094
You're all dressy.

214
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,129
I guess.

215
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,760
Thanks.

216
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,468
I wanted to tell him
that he'd never actually seen me in clothes.

217
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,841
Do you want a glass of wine first, or....

218
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,972
No, I'm fine, thanks.

219
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,208
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

220
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,483
-I made reservations.
-Huh?

221
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,988
At a sushi restaurant.

222
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,921
Cool. I see.

223
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,120
No! I mean, God!

224
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,765
I mean sushi...

225
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,195
...Japanese food!

226
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,771
When you said dinner, you meant dinner.

227
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,864
Yeah.

228
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,205
It's just that, whenever we've had dinner,
we've always, you know.

229
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,869
Yeah, I know.

230
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,707
I'm just gonna get my purse.

231
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:35,113
Like most first dates,
we were off to an awkward start.

232
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:49,332
The yellow tail sashimi,
two pieces of salmon sushi...

233
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,699
...and a spicy tuna hand roll.

234
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,197
Do you Iike eel?

235
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,869
No way.

236
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,000
I'II have the chicken teriyaki, well done.

237
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,704
No, the sushi's so amazing here.

238
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,176
I can't deal with the raw stuff.

239
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,774
Why didn't you say?
We could've gone someplace else.

240
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,843
Don't worry about it.
If I'm hungry, I'II grab a burger after.

241
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,147
Okay.

242
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,624
Hey, Iisten, before I forget...

243
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,391
...this is for you.

244
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,356
Thanks. What is it?

245
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,629
Forty minutes free Iong distance,
continental U.S., no strings attached.

246
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,328
It's to promote our new 7-7-3 service:

247
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,965
Seven days, seven hours, $3 a day.

248
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,635
Thank you.

249
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,768
So you--

250
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,870
Think these gimmicks up?
Sort of. Officially, I sell time.

251
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,179
I get incentive minutes which
I can distribute at my own discretion.

252
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,016
So, if I'm Iucky,
I might get a whole hour next time?

253
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,146
I don't think so.

254
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,487
But if you're currently with MCI
and switch...

255
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,220
...then you get two free hours.

256
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,026
I was kidding.

257
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,994
Right, gotcha.

258
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,901
Maybe we should just order some sake?

259
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,127
Yeah, sure.

260
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,163
Hey, sake to me!

261
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,572
We went back to my place for a quickie.

262
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,250
I needed to erase the stagnant
memory of the past two hours.

263
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,446
Was it really possible that
someone so stimulating in bed...

264
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,183
...could be so tedious in life?

265
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,559
Meanwhile, Samantha was actually
beginning to look forward...

266
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,662
...to the company of her new neighbors.

267
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,905
Every night, like clockwork,
right after the end of the 11:00 news...

268
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,248
...Samantha relished her role as
the invisible guest vocalist...

269
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,312
...to an unseen band.

270
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,693
Until one night, she wasn 't so invisible.

271
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,250
That Saturday, Miranda planned for us
all to meet her latest fling for brunch.

272
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,853
Apparently,
he had flung himself elsewhere.

273
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,481
He should be here any minute.

274
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,821
Don't worry about it. If it's just us, fine.

275
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,225
It's not Iike we've got anywhere else to go.

276
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,593
I have a date tonight.

277
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,688
-With whom?
-That yoga guy.

278
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,858
I asked him out.

279
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,159
Wow, I'm impressed.

280
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,766
Once I broke the ice with him,
it was just Iike riding a bike.

281
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,002
I have so many dates this week,
that I just scheduled two tonight.

282
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,306
-You double-booked?
-I had to.

283
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,814
One guy is Ieaving town
and I couldn't cancel the other.

284
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,009
How do you conceive pulling this one off?

285
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,110
Early dinner with bachelor one,
Iate supper with bachelor two.

286
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,917
My God, you're turning into a man.

287
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,686
Charlotte had done more
than break a pattern.

288
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,624
She had actually changed genders.

289
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,287
I just don't know how I'm ever
gonna eat two dinners in a row.

290
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,357
And then, just like that,
she was a woman again.

291
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,424
Sorry, babe.

292
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:14,495
The idiot who drove me here apparently
passed his driving test in Bangladesh.

293
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,470
I'm just happy to get off
that fuckin' rickshaw alive.

294
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,138
Kevin, this is Carrie,
and Samantha, and Charlotte.

295
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,976
-This is Kevin.
-Nice to meet you.

296
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,677
I have to go make a call, I'II be back.
Waitress! A draft beer here.

297
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,714
He's cute.

298
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,086
In a tightly wound sort of way.

299
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,921
He's finding out on Tuesday
whether he made partner.

300
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,259
I'm keeping my fingers crossed
that he'II unwind some after that.

301
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,228
What are you doing?

302
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,032
I just don't want him
going off on the waitress.

303
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,236
That evening,
Charlotte set out to break her pattern.

304
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,675
A casual meal with Eric from yoga...

305
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,909
...discovering a mutual love
for long drives up Maine coasts...

306
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,109
...and reruns of Nanny and the Professor.

307
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,617
She was psychic, wasn't she?

308
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,675
Absolutely.

309
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,984
But it was very subtle, very sophisticated.

310
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,750
I don't think that kids today
would understand it.

311
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,654
When I have kids,
I'm gonna be a total nazi with the remote.

312
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,924
I want them to read.

313
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,795
How many kids do you want to have?

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,558
Two: one of each.

315
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,425
Sounds perfect.

316
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:23,003
As Charlotte began to swim in visions
of family summers in Kennebunkport...

317
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,643
...she realized she was late
for the second shift.

318
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,803
Oh my God.

319
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,603
What's wrong?

320
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,342
My throat is so sore.

321
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,780
I've just been fighting this cold all week.

322
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,552
Let me get the check.

323
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,321
I'm so sorry.

324
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,689
I had a really great time.

325
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,220
Me, too.

326
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,395
While Charlotte was off
to her next engagement...

327
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,667
...Samantha was imagining
an engagement of her own.

328
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,547
Excuse me, Jesus!

329
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,552
Hi, I was just wondering...

330
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,180
...do you know
who Iives in that apartment?

331
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,558
Yes, very nice.

332
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,362
Musician. His wife, a dancer.

333
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,930
Really? And are they nice Iooking?

334
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,430
Yes, very nice.

335
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,695
Very good.

336
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,901
Okay, then. Carry on.

337
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,706
Later that night, Charlotte was returning
from a second dinner of steamed mussels...

338
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,948
...and fries with bachelor number two,
an art loving commodities broker.

339
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,114
-I had a really great time.
-Me, too.

340
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,222
Excuse me.

341
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,319
So, can I call you?

342
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,756
Definitely.

343
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,230
Okay.

344
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,372
Charlotte?

345
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,008
Eric, what are you doing here?

346
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,341
I was just Ieaving you some chicken soup...

347
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,812
...for your throat.

348
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,813
But I see you've healed.

349
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,675
Who is this guy?

350
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,243
I'm the guy she had dinner with before you.

351
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,555
You double-booked us?

352
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,852
Hey, don't feel bad.

353
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,758
You got the Iate shift.
You get to take her upstairs.

354
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,886
I don't think so.

355
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,564
You know what? Enjoy the soup.

356
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,063
Hey, you going uptown?

357
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,166
-Yeah, West Side.
-Wanna share a cab?

358
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,662
Sure.

359
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,669
From that moment on,
Charlotte developed a new pattern.

360
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,406
She made it a rule never to take advice
from her friends again.

361
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,275
Very late that night...

362
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,651
...Samantha decided to roll out
the welcome mat for her new neighbors.

363
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,731
The musician and the dancer
turned out to be a middle-aged...

364
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,288
...Eastern European couple.

365
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,400
He played in a polka band.
She was a dancer...

366
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,935
...once upon a time.

367
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,505
Samantha?

368
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,666
Would you mind keeping it down?

369
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,336
I'm trying to get some sleep.

370
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,711
Samantha broke a pattern after all.

371
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,653
She decided to move her bed
to the opposite wall.

372
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,049
Later that week,
Kevin experienced a dream come true.

373
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,390
He was made a full partner
of the law firm where he worked.

374
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,657
He took Miranda out to celebrate.

375
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,957
A toast.

376
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,893
-To a very happy occasion.
-Yeah.

377
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,939
I'm falling all over myself with glee.

378
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,600
I get to work 60 hours a week
for the same salary.

379
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,835
I'm walking on air.

380
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,071
Can't we enjoy your success
for one second?

381
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,705
You don't get how stressful my Iife is.

382
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,306
You really do Iive in never-never Iand,
don't you?

383
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,141
By the way...

384
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,088
...if there's a difference between this
$100 champagne and the crap for $29...

385
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,921
...it takes a more delicate palate
than mine to detect it.

386
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,088
Well, I Iike the champagne,
and the bread is fabulous.

387
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,927
Oh my God, Iook at those flowers.

388
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,192
Don't piss me off.

389
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,402
Where are you going?

390
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,063
Back to never-never Iand.

391
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,770
And by the way, never-never call me again.

392
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,039
Have a nice day.

393
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,404
What?

394
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,176
Miranda broke her pattern
in a way that she had never expected.

395
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,787
The angry guy had turned her
into a cock-eyed optimist.

396
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,422
There couldn't have been
a more perfect moment...

397
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,324
...to see Skipper
for the first time since she dumped him.

398
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,555
Hey, Skipper!

399
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,295
SIow down a minute.

400
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,458
Don't tell me what to do, okay?

401
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,598
I just wanted to say hello.
How've you been?

402
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,664
How've I been?

403
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,708
You got a Iot of nerve
talking to me Iike nothing happened...

404
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,267
...ever since you tossed me out
Iike bad milk.

405
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,176
I've been friggin' great.

406
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,340
Now that I've got you out of my system.

407
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,384
Can't I just talk to you for a minute?

408
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,944
Could I buy you a beer or something?

409
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,522
Miranda had never seen him
as angry as this before.

410
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,853
Much to her horror, she was attracted.

411
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,687
That's the thing about patterns.

412
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,921
They don 't break because you tell them to.

413
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,089
Have you been working out?

414
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,930
And a few nights later,
John and I went out for a movie.

415
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,261
I refused to believe that
a passionate sexual connection...

416
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,173
...could not be translated into
a meaningful friendship, at the very least.

417
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,107
Did you Iike the movie?

418
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,169
-Was it a comedy?
-No.

419
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,736
I didn't think so.

420
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,080
Isn't this the most amazing block?

421
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,881
AII these brownstones
are over 100 years old.

422
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:41,118
It's Iike being in the New York
of Edith Wharton and Henry James.

423
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,630
Sometimes, I can't believe
how Iucky I am to Iive right here.

424
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,192
What?

425
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,972
Your tits Iook great in that thing.

426
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,532
At that moment,
I knew we only had two things in common.

427
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,045
Listen, I'd invite you in, but--

428
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,705
No, that's okay.

429
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,849
I got to be up really early tomorrow.

430
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,509
Okay.

431
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,880
I'II call you.

432
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,759
Goodnight.

433
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,057
I knew it was the last time
we'd ever see each other.

434
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,729
Just like that...

435
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,398
...I was thrown right back
into my old pattern:

436
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,335
Greasy Chinese, sleeping till noon...

437
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,874
...and feeling restless.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
