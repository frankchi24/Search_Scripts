1
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:52,040
There are over seven million people
in New York, not including house guests.

2
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:55,047
Visitors are a vital par
ofthe city's economy.

3
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:58,503
Most single people in Manhattan
do not buy furniture

4
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,350
until facing the arrival
of an out-of-towner.

5
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:04,852
- Great couch. Where'd it come from?
- l have no idea.

6
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:09,319
Everything in Miranda's new aparment
was hand-picked and arranged

7
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:13,440
by Charlotte's friend Madeline Dunn,
an upcoming interior designer.

8
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,536
- l've been looking for one ofthose.
- That's very stylish for a pull-out.

9
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:21,290
l'll have that end table for you
tomorrow.

10
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:27,305
Thank you.

11
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:32,226
- This is a sofa bed?
- lt's what stared this whole thing.

12
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,688
l needed a sofa bed for Jeremy.

13
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,196
lf he sleeps on it while staying
in my fabulous aparment,

14
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,775
l may have to throw myself
out a window treatment.

15
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:46,118
Jeremy was an old friend of Miranda's
who'd lived in London for several years.

16
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,298
He was coming to New York
to scope out the job situation.

17
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,959
Miranda suggested he be her house guest

18
00:01:52,138 --> 00:01:56,054
because his emails had stared
to border on firatious.

19
00:01:56,227 --> 00:02:00,144
Meanwhile, l had become
a frequent house guest of Big's.

20
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:04,397
Do you have a spare toothbrush
l could use?

21
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:10,452
- A sparetoothbrush?
- l'll bring you a new one.

22
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,870
Excuse me.

23
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,710
There's only one pink brush head
and Big was giving his to me.

24
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:46,634
lt was the most encouraging moment
so far in our relationship.

25
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:52,307
When Jeremy arrived, he was even more
adorable than Miranda remembered.

26
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:56,482
- l love your fat.
- Thanks. How the hell are you?

27
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:58,483
Especially when he said...

28
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:02,278
l'm tired of dating.
l'm ready to get married.

29
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,536
- Miranda, are you here?
- Coming!

30
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:13,255
- That must be my end table.
- My end table's afraid to go out alone.

31
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:20,187
l hope you like the finish.
lt's a hair darker than l was thinking.

32
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,145
- Sorry to interrupt.
- That's beautiful. ls it Biedermeier?

33
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,946
lnspired by Biedermeier. Good eye!

34
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:30,781
l'm addicted to ''Architectural Digest''.
Jeremy Fields.

35
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,294
- l'm sorry. This is...
- Madeline. Madeline Dunn.

36
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,666
Pleasure.

37
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:41,547
Thanks for bringing that by.
We were just about to go out for dinner.

38
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:44,300
Did you want to join us?

39
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:49,608
Last week l was doing an interview
at a restaurant...

40
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,948
Miranda was in the situation
every woman dreams of:

41
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:55,693
she was on a truly great first date.

42
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:59,160
''Just be careful not to eat any buckshot!''

43
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:02,339
Unforunately, it was somebody else's.

44
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,760
l should get Jeremy home.
You must be jet-lagged.

45
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:09,934
Actually, l feel great.
l slept on the plane for once.

46
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:13,521
- Well, l'm pretty beat.
- Did you want to go?

47
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,686
No, not if you're...

48
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:18,271
Go ahead.
l can find my way back.

49
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,157
Right, we don't have to...

50
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,119
Except l forgot to make a copy
ofthe key.

51
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:29,842
Jeremy could use my key.

52
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,803
Of course.

53
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,096
l gave you a key.

54
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:39,810
Well, then. Goodnight.

55
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,531
A week later, Miranda threw Jeremy
a going-away party.

56
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:01,635
l'd like to make a toast
to my good friend Miranda,

57
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:07,019
who not only put me up, she threw
this soiree in celebration of my deparure.

58
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,981
OK, Miranda. l get the hint.

59
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:14,903
l'd especially like to thank her
for introducing me to Madeline,

60
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,706
an incredible woman who must be drunk
because she just agreed to marry me!

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,506
The only thing going away
was Miranda's dream.

62
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,466
Congratulations!

63
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,648
lce. We should get more ice.

64
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,821
They say when you get a place
of your own, someone will propose.

65
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:41,152
l thought it would be to me.

66
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,489
The woman owes you
a morgage payment.

67
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,666
- How is this possible? They just met.
- lt's love at first sight.

68
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,919
This isn't love. lt's two people justifying
a week of non-stop fucking.

69
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:55,970
On my furniture.
l have to redecorate.

70
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:59,978
lt's encouraging. lt means that even
if you're not dating anybody,

71
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,106
you could be engaged
in a couple ofweeks.

72
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,410
Or date someone for a year
and get an electric toothbrush head.

73
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:10,783
Why are women obsessed
about getting married?

74
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,118
Married people just want to be single.

75
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,168
lf you're single,
the world is your smörgasbord.

76
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:20,673
ls this where Jeremy Fields'
engagement party is?

77
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,602
The red awning.
And it's a going-away party.

78
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,726
- l can take you there if you like.
- Were you going?

79
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,654
l was leaving as there were
no handsome men there,

80
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:32,029
but maybe the tide is turning.

81
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,996
My aparment is going
to be lucky for everybody but me.

82
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:44,667
What aparment isn't lucky for Samantha?

83
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:48,797
This is all your fault.
You introduced me to Madeline.

84
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,679
l could have hired a gay decorator
and this wouldn't have happened.

85
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:55,065
Then they might never have met.

86
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:59,236
And Jeremy would have fallen
in love with me.

87
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:03,030
Why not me? What am l doing wrong?
Am l invisible?

88
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,210
- Can l help you?
- l live here!

89
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:14,007
That night, l needed a little reality check.

90
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,227
l was just at this party

91
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:26,024
and two people who met a week ago
announced their engagement.

92
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:29,406
- And?
- lsn't that a bit shocking?

93
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:33,451
This is New York, nothing's shocking.
We've embraced public urination.

94
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,047
But these people think they're soul mates.

95
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:41,088
- Did they actually use the term soul mates?
- Several times.

96
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:44,684
l give them three months.
What are you wearing?

97
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:50,981
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
- l believe in lust at first sight.

98
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,400
- l'm serious.
- So am l.

99
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:56,284
Come on, l need a visual.

100
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,828
l don't know. A top, strapless.
Denim.

101
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:05,464
- Were you asleep when l called?
- Yes.

102
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,309
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

103
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:11,893
But next time, be at the door...naked.

104
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,896
l stared to wonder.

105
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,148
ln a city as cynical as New York,

106
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:21,612
is it still possible to believe
in love at first sight?

107
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:24,541
l'd given up on the idea,
but now l know

108
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,959
that if you don't believe in love at first sight,
you haven't experienced it.

109
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:34,213
Love at first sight is for Carmen Electra.
lt's too faky for New York.

110
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:39,435
Here, women want a blood test and an
ATM receipt before giving you their number.

111
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:41,934
How can you believe in love at first sight

112
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,900
in a city where people jerk off on you
in the subway?

113
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:49,571
A bride four weeks from her wedding
has no time to meet for coffee,

114
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:54,378
so l joined Madeline for an hour
in the presence of absolute cerainty.

115
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:57,375
Flowers, fowers everywhere!

116
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:01,932
l'd like each bridesmaid to carry a different
fower. Tulips, irises, lilies...

117
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:06,730
Charlotte should have the tulips!
You know she's one of my bridesmaids?

118
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,603
We asked Miranda to do the guest books
as she introduced us.

119
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,035
You know, Carrie.
l'm such a fan of your column.

120
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,243
Would you write something
to read at our wedding?

121
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:23,626
- What does she want you to write?
- A poem about love.

122
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:27,968
- l hope you said no.
- How can you say no?

123
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:31,809
lf l knew that l wouldn't be
in charge ofthe guest book.

124
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:35,933
Why did l agree to this?
l write about sex, not love.

125
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:40,029
l might have to get married now.
That guy l picked up at Miranda's...

126
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,956
lf you're engaged,
l am selling the aparment.

127
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,583
Hardly.

128
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,041
That night, we went back to my place.

129
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,792
Tug my hair, tug my hair!

130
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:56,056
lt all seemed so familiar.
She was having a déjafuck.

131
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:59,313
- What's wrong?
- l've slept with you before.

132
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:03,482
- Yeah, like 15 years ago.
- Why didn't you say something?

133
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:06,861
l thought you were playing
the sexy stranger game.

134
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:11,416
- lt was kind of a reunion.
- You forgot someone you slept with?

135
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,543
We're not in single digits any more.

136
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,214
You didn't share a cab with this guy.
You slept with him.

137
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:21,053
- Maybe we did it in a cab.
- l'd like to forget some men l've slept with.

138
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:24,726
- l keep a list.
- How sweet: ''Men to do today''!

139
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:29,063
l'm offiicially out of men to fuck.
l have to get married or move.

140
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:32,573
- Lovely! Can l use that in my poem?
- lt's yours.

141
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:36,445
- Wait till you see my bridesmaid's dress.
- ls it hideous?

142
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:41,372
No, we got to pick our own.
lt's this amazing, backless, black satin.

143
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:45,797
- Pretty sexy for a bridesmaid.
- Madeline just said it had to be black.

144
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:48,215
Honey, calm down.

145
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:51,845
l've been tasteful and appropriate
at seven weddings.

146
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:54,895
lt's always: ''Don't look at me,
look at the bride.''

147
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:57,740
This time people
are going to look at me!

148
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,076
This whirlwind wedding was creating
a great deal of stress

149
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:04,699
for everyone but the bride and groom.

150
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:09,966
The next night, l made the mistake
oftelling Big about the poem.

151
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:13,636
Love, glove, dove.
Dove is good.

152
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:17,928
Love is like a dove.
Or a big fuzzy glove.

153
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:20,776
l might have stolen that
from a greeting card.

154
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:24,480
- Thanks.
- What? This is fun.

155
00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:27,695
lt's not supposed to be fun.
lt's someone's wedding.

156
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,452
- A wedding is serious to some people.
- Then ''shove'' probably won't work.

157
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:39,425
- When is this wedding?
- lt doesn't matter. You're not going.

158
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,721
Yes, l am.

159
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:47,352
l wouldn't miss you reciting
''love, glove, dove'' for anything.

160
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,916
Things with Big were good.
He was going with me to a wedding.

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,846
Can l just say...wow!

162
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:12,679
l need a few minutes.
The card's here for you to sign.

163
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,311
l don't need to sign it.

164
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:19,028
Your name's on the invitation, too.

165
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,194
Really?

166
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,952
lt was my first time to get something
other than ''Carrie Bradshaw and guest''.

167
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,537
How'd they get my name?

168
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:32,929
l guess Madeline must have asked
Charlotte or something.

169
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:36,515
lf you don't want to sign the card,
it's not a big deal.

170
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,831
Would you like to sign the guest book?

171
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,491
Would you like to sign the guest book?

172
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,710
Would you like to sign the guest book?

173
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:57,456
At least we get to see who's arriving alone.

174
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:59,380
Samantha could be counted on

175
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:03,390
to take life's lemons
and make them into Spanish Fly.

176
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:08,807
- Where do they want the gifts?
- Excuse me, l'm not the gift person.

177
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,945
Christ! My rerun's here!

178
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:13,868
Of course.
You met him at the engagement party.

179
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:18,535
l have to star writing things down.
l also have to star drinking heavily.

180
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,584
Where's Big?

181
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:26,426
- lnside, looking bored.
- That's my look.

182
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,016
Should l be bothered that he wouldn't
sign the card?

183
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:33,225
l'm glad l didn't ask him
to sign the guest book.

184
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,809
That would have put him over the edge.

185
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:40,869
Charlotte wasn't kidding about the dress.
lt was hard not to notice her.

186
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,446
- Look at you!
- Oh, my God!

187
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,836
l am so late!

188
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:50,874
- Are you with the bride or the groom?
- Actually, l'm a bridesmaid.

189
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:55,266
Are you Charlotte? l'm Marin Healey.
l'll be walking you down the aisle.

190
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,971
All her life, Charlotte had imagined
doing exactly that

191
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:02,235
with someone exactly like Marin.

192
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:05,609
l'll show you
where you're supposed to be.

193
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:10,657
Are you seeing this?
He never even looked at me!

194
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,038
While Miranda felt invisible,
l felt far too visible.

195
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:17,585
l'm in the programme?
l barely know the bride and groom.

196
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:21,132
- They barely know each other.
- l'm between the vows and the fish.

197
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:24,679
Am l in there?
No, of course not.

198
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:27,977
- l'd better find Big.
- l'm coming with you.

199
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:30,989
Can you leave the guest book
unattended?

200
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:34,113
People know what to do
with the guest book.

201
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:38,916
The ceremony was shor and sweet,
just like the engagement.

202
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:44,296
...our newly-weds: Mr Jeremy Fields
and Mrs Madeline Dunn Fields.

203
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:00,446
lt's amazing.

204
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,083
Six months to find me an end table
and she plans a wedding in four weeks.

205
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:09,632
Five bucks says your end table
lasts longer than her marriage.

206
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:21,224
People have said a lot of nice
things about Jeremy.

207
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:24,321
l am here to make a rebuttal.

208
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:29,079
- l have known Jeremy a long time.
- Which is more than the bride can say.

209
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:35,085
l only hope that some day l can have
what you two have:

210
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:38,544
8,000 little napkins with my name
on them.

211
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:43,095
And, of course, someone to love.

212
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,097
Cheers!

213
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,038
And now, we have a very special treat.

214
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,457
One of my favourite writers,
Carrie Bradshaw,

215
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:02,164
has agreed to share a poem
that she wrote for the occasion.

216
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,549
Shit.

217
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:16,649
As l made my way to the microphone,
l could only think one thing:

218
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,816
dead woman walking.

219
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:35,347
His hello was the end of her endings

220
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:40,316
Her laugh was their first step
down the aisle

221
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:44,104
His hand would be hers to hold forever

222
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:48,492
His forever was as simple as her smile

223
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,958
And suddenly it hit me: two people
were committing to a life together

224
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:59,884
and l couldn't even get a guy
to be on a card with me.

225
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:07,229
He said she was what was missing

226
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,561
She said instantly she knew

227
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:14,363
She was a question to be answered

228
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,793
And his answer was l do

229
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:24,875
l had no choice
but to embrace the moment

230
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:29,718
and pass off my tears as tears ofjoy
for the happy couple.

231
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:39,573
Can l have the salad dressing?

232
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:43,874
- l want three or four kids, too.
- How about dog versus cat?

233
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:50,173
l think that this should be our song.

234
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:52,467
Then we should dance to it.

235
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:57,806
Are they in the Evelyn Wood plan, too?

236
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:02,688
Sorry, l had to take a call.
Did l miss anything?

237
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:06,192
You missed my poem
and most ofthe reception,

238
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:09,739
but a slow dance makes you
forgive and forget.

239
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:12,538
l hate to dance
while people are eating.

240
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:15,963
Well, l'll be at the bar
where people are drinking.

241
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:19,173
Say hello to my date.

242
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:29,777
- l think l know you from somewhere.
- lt's very possible we've fucked.

243
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:35,074
- l think l know you from college.
- Then we probably fucked in college.

244
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:42,371
- Another cosmopolitan, please.
- And a Scotch, straight up.

245
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,422
lt's the famous poet, Carrie Bradshaw.

246
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:48,005
Can we not talk about the poem, please?

247
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:52,515
lt was perfect. Except the crying.
What was that about?

248
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:55,361
Big took a call during my poem.

249
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:59,528
lt's not imporant to him.
Nothing is imporant to him.

250
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:03,404
The guest book person
also puts the gifts in the van.

251
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:08,461
Will you help, or should l wait for someone
else not to see me so l can end it?

252
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:12,217
l'll help you.
What street do you want to stand in?

253
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:21,599
lfthey get married in less than a month,
l'm not going.

254
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:24,650
- Careful. That one's from me.
- What are you giving them?

255
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:27,495
The dancing frogs.

256
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:36,080
Even on the verge of breaking
the speed record for relationships,

257
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,045
Charlotte took her duties as bridesmaid
very seriously.

258
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:43,926
- lsn't it beautiful?
- How do we do this exactly?

259
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:48,235
We throw string around
and write something funny on the mirror.

260
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:52,984
Some people throw condoms on the bed,
but l prefer rose petals.

261
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,329
l would love to wake up in rose petals.

262
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:04,962
lt was all so romantic.
The bed, the rose petals...

263
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,297
...the bed.

264
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,358
Technically, it wasn't a third date,
but they'd had dinner and been dancing.

265
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:21,112
Charlotte worried she'd made a mistake

266
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,409
by sleeping with a man
she thought she could marry.

267
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:29,296
- Then something wonderful happened.
- l want to introduce you to my parents.

268
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,876
Charlotte was back on schedule.

269
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:35,306
Did you see us?
We've been dancing up a storm.

270
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:41,902
- Would you like a free lesson?
- My dad is quite the dancer.

271
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,645
That would be great.

272
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,363
ls she the one?

273
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,122
You're a beautiful dancer.

274
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,187
- May l cut in?
- lf you must.

275
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:12,239
lsn't he something? He's very smar.
He's pretty much my role model.

276
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,616
He used to take me to his offiice...

277
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:17,280
Your father just felt me up.

278
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,618
We were dancing and he put his hand...

279
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,418
My parents have been married
for 50 years.

280
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:27,885
My dad would not cop a feel just because
some girl is wearing a slutty dress.

281
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:34,681
lt was clear to Charlotte that Marin
wasn't going to take her side now or ever.

282
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,528
Did the last four and a half hours
mean nothing to you?

283
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,126
Darn! We missed the chicken dance.

284
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,009
Excuse me, have you seen my date?

285
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:54,176
l'm sorry. l had to help Miranda
put the gifts into the van.

286
00:21:57,438 --> 00:22:01,058
- So, are you ready to go?
- Have they cut the cake yet?

287
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:05,105
l don't know, but l can tell you
how it turns out.

288
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,324
lf you want to go, go.

289
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,995
- What's wrong?
- You wouldn't even sign the card.

290
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,175
The card?

291
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:22,219
l'm afraid we don't want the same things.

292
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:26,390
Things like cake?

293
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:31,441
l want someone who's going to be
with me until the end...

294
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,286
...of a wedding.

295
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:42,707
- l'll stay.
- You will?

296
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:49,017
Single ladies, it's time for the tossing
ofthe bouquet.

297
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:53,399
- lsn't the bouquet tossed at the end?
- Congratulations. You lucked out.

298
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:56,320
l'm going to say goodbye to my friends.

299
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:01,829
Big moment.

300
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:05,949
Big and l are leaving.
He's crossed his pain threshold.

301
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:07,956
