1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,042
My friend Charlotte
was dating Dr. Bram Walker...

2
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,586
...a very hardworking orthopedic surgeon.

3
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,321
Bram?

4
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,152
What?

5
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,993
Were you asleep?

6
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,394
No, I was just resting my eyes.

7
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,131
My God.

8
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,095
I fell asleep for one second.

9
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,497
My God.

10
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,903
I was up at 5:00, I had three carpal tunnels.

11
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,805
It's very exhaustive reconstructive work.

12
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,908
He fell asleep when
he was making Iove to me.

13
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,640
He fell asleep!

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,147
He was tired.
This has nothing to do with you.

15
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,987
Has a man ever fallen asleep
making Iove to you?

16
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,456
No, but I'm sure many of them wanted to.

17
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,125
I can't believe this happened to me!

18
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,662
You want some herb tea?

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,925
I must be really bad in bed.

20
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,057
You are not bad in bed.

21
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,466
I've got Constant Comment and....

22
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,031
Do you want some Tummy Tamer?

23
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,834
Of course it's her.
I have to say, I'm not surprised.

24
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,378
Ever seen her on a Stairmaster?
Nothing happening below the waist.

25
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,707
Nada. No sale.

26
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,337
How can you say that?

27
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,909
Even if she was bad in bed,
which she isn't, is it really that important?

28
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,750
Absolutely. Who we are in bed
is who we are in Iife.

29
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,690
I never met a man who was bad in bed
who was good at Iife.

30
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,250
Just for the record, in bed, you are....

31
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,260
Don't make me state the obvious.

32
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,628
How can you be so sure?

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,828
No one ever took a nap while fucking me...

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,995
...and I get affirmations all the time.

35
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,231
Just Iast week....

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,304
Last week, Samantha had dinner
with a gay couple she'd known for years.

37
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,070
David and David.

38
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,708
Thanks for a Iovely dinner. It was fun.

39
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,251
I have to admit,
we have an ulterior motive.

40
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,744
What?

41
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,922
We're wondering if you're seeing
anyone special right now?

42
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,691
Actually, no.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,160
Do you have a hot guy for me?

44
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:44,989
Two.

45
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,898
-No!
-Yes!

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,837
We want to have sex with a woman.

47
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,068
-Are you serious?
-Totally.

48
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,610
I'm curious about it.

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,909
We've never done it
and we thought it might be fun.

50
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,074
We were Iike:

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,478
"If we were gonna do it with a woman,
who would it be?"

52
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:11,250
-Then we were Iike, Samantha.
-Totally.

53
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:16,258
We decided of all the beautiful women
we know, you are probably the best in bed.

54
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,821
Totally.

55
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,497
Look at that!

56
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,333
I'm thinking about doing it.
They're cute, they're healthy.

57
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,665
They're gay!

58
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,707
For a sex columnist,
you have a Iimited view of sexuality.

59
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,736
Gay as pink suede.

60
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,505
Wake up. It's 2000.

61
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:37,007
The new millennium won't be about sexual
Iabels, it'II be about sexual expression.

62
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,617
It won't matter if you're sleeping
with men or women.

63
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,847
It'II be about sleeping with individuals.

64
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,786
Or in your case, twos or threes.

65
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,190
Soon everyone will be pansexual.
It won't matter if you're gay or straight.

66
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,196
-Just if you're good or bad in bed.
-Exactly.

67
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,160
That night I got to thinking about bed.

68
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,137
Are we secretly being graded every time
we invite someone to join us in it?

69
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,867
A plus, B, D, incomplete.

70
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,338
Is making love really nothing
more than a pop quiz?

71
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,882
If sex is a test, how do we know
if we're passing or failing?

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,514
How do you know if you're good in bed?

73
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,951
Later on, I was walking home thinking
about my sexual report card when....

74
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,551
What the hell--

75
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,595
Christ, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
I threw my cigarette.

76
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,828
I thought I was stung by a bee. Jesus!

77
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,497
I'm sorry. Did it Ieave a mark?

78
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,842
You can't smoke in the restaurant.
I'm a smoker.

79
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,276
I'm a smoker too,
but watch where you throw those things?

80
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,612
No, it didn't Ieave a mark.

81
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,448
As the pain subsided,
my mind was free to notice...

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,852
...how incredibly cute this guy was.

83
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,119
I am sorry. My name's Patrick Casey.

84
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,552
Carrie Bradshaw, burn victim.

85
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,423
How weird was that? That was intense.

86
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,263
You gotta admit,
it's a clever way to meet the Iadies.

87
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,694
You got a Iittle comedy routine
going there?

88
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,238
Little bit.

89
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,674
Listen, I really feel bad.

90
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,009
At Ieast Iet me buy you a coffee,
or some burn salve?

91
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,480
-Not funny yet.
-Sorry.

92
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,649
But it might be after a cappuccino.

93
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,718
There's a place right around the corner.
We can smoke there.

94
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,455
Three Marlboros and two
Marlboro Lights later I had learned...

95
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,356
...Patrick was a composer,
writing music for movies.

96
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,793
What type of movies do you compose for?

97
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,297
Really bad ones.

98
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,629
The I Screamed When I Knew What You
Did Last Summer On Elm Street types.

99
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,136
As Iong as you're challenged
by what you do.

100
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:46,534
Dammit. Patrick Casey, whoever you are.

101
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,008
I'm Iate. I have to go.

102
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,312
Thank you for the coffee.

103
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,213
Maybe one day
you'II give me scar tissue again.

104
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,523
-You're great.
-Thanks.

105
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,017
As I walked away, I started to think:

106
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,561
How many cute, smart, single smokers
are there left in the world? Seven?

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,769
I decided to do something
I almost never do...

108
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,031
...give a man my phone number.

109
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,941
This whole burn Iawsuit I plan to initiate...

110
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,839
...it might get a Iittle crazy,
so here is my phone number.

111
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,280
You will need that for your attorney...

112
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,252
...or if you want to have
coffee again sometime.

113
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:33,225
I left feeling great. It was such a cute
approach. How could he not call?

114
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,627
How could he not call?
It's been three days.

115
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,892
Give him 12 more hours and then
send him off to the island of Iost men.

116
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,058
I don't wanna send him there, I Iike him.

117
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,196
Could you believe that someone actually
had the nerve to call this FIorentine Peach?

118
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,167
I can't believe you spent
this much on sheets.

119
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,767
It's an experiment.
I'm trying to change my bed karma.

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,641
I figure if I can make my bed
a place I really want to be...

121
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,776
...others will feel the same way.

122
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,450
The field of dreams.

123
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,315
Exactly. "If you build it, he will come."

124
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:09,459
The thing that gets me is, I'm not usually
wrong about the phone number size-up.

125
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,429
I don't put it out there
unless I'm sure it's coming back.

126
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm either really Ioving or hating the color.

127
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,368
He thinks I'm ugly.

128
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,929
My God. Get a grip.

129
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,466
A guy doesn't call you for three days
and you're ugly?

130
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,171
-What's your point?
-Pillowcase.

131
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,446
It's amazing.
We can feel totally good about ourselves...

132
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:36,577
...and then it all goes out the window
if the guy doesn't mirror it back to us.

133
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,551
This has a Iittle weird thing here.

134
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,418
Dammit. Does everything I bring into
this bedroom have to have a flaw?

135
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,865
The next day I was in the Village looking
for the perfect $7 dress...

136
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,131
...to go with my $300 shoes, when....

137
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,836
I had a choice.
I could turn around and run away...

138
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,878
...or I could smile, be brave
and walk on over.

139
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,810
Hi.

140
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:09,044
So what? Saturday's the day you stand on
the street and smoke in the Village?

141
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:11,849
Hi, I'm Carrie.

142
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,589
-We're kind of in the middle of something.
-Right, sure.

143
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,189
Bye. I was on my way to Perry Street.

144
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,630
This is Perry Street.

145
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,026
BIeecker, I meant BIeecker.

146
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,036
Okay, bye. Goodbye to you, too.

147
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,546
-Let me explain.
-No, I'm embarrassed.

148
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,914
You're obviously in the middle
of a thing with your Iover...

149
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,782
...or whoever and I'm there....

150
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,653
I'm not gay.

151
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,692
I'm an alcoholic.

152
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,052
We were waiting for a meeting to start.

153
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,562
I wanted to introduce you
but it's supposed to be anonymous.

154
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,529
I really wasn't getting the gay vibe
from you.

155
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,268
It's just, he was so cute and....

156
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,802
-I never called.
-Right.

157
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,372
I was freaked. I've only been
in the program 11 months...

158
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,573
...and my sponsor said I really shouldn't
get involved with someone for a year.

159
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,785
Okay, maybe you'II call me in a month.

160
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,744
It doesn't bother you that I'm an alcoholic?

161
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,983
God, no. I Iove alcoholics.
Hell, I hope to be one someday.

162
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,721
-That was a joke.
-That's not funny, yet.

163
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,388
But it might be after a cappuccino.

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
What the fuck, it's only a couple of weeks.

165
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,261
Would you Iike to go on a date sometime?

166
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,564
I can't think why not.

167
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,532
You call me.

168
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,939
I accepted his kind invitation
because when you think about it...

169
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,311
...aren 't we all in recovery from something?

170
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,783
Drinking? Drugging?
Our last relationship?

171
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,721
On our first date,
Patrick and I went for coffee.

172
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:55,850
I'm really compulsive. If I open up a bag
of Chips Ahoy, I gotta eat the whole thing.

173
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,163
I'm Iike that with Reese's Pieces.
Reese's Pieces and shoes.

174
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,598
Wouldn't the shoes
be a Iittle tough on digestion?

175
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,669
This is me.

176
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,538
Thank you, Mr. Casey. I had a great time.

177
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,980
No, Miss Burn Victim.
I had the great time.

178
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:20,648
Then I gave him my very best
lean-in-and-kiss-me-goodnight move.

179
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:35,024
Our next date, over dinner,
he told me about working his 12 steps.

180
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,067
After dinner, I stood on my third step
trying to work him.

181
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,537
That smell is amazing. What is that?

182
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,300
Me.

183
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,137
I'II call you.

184
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,308
I couldn't figure it out.

185
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:00,291
I knew he wanted me, because during my
lean-in-and-kiss-me-goodnight move...

186
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,885
...I'd accidentally, on purpose felt
his pop-up-and-say-hello.

187
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,988
What was going on?

188
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:11,194
By the third date, I wanted him even more
than a fistful of Reese's Pieces.

189
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,006
Well then, goodnight.

190
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,407
That was that. I'd hit my humiliation limit.

191
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:25,109
Then I thought, how many cute,
smart, sexy, single, smoking alcoholics...

192
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,812
...are there left in the world? Five?

193
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,191
Do you want to come up?

194
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,668
But you see, the thing is,
I've never had sex sober.

195
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:53,434
I've always been drunk or high.
I don't know if I'II be any good.

196
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,505
What the hell?
Let's take it one step at a time.

197
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,864
Sex is amazing.

198
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,870
It feels so fucking amazing.

199
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,639
Do other people know about this?

200
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,002
AII right! I did it! Sex without beer!

201
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,381
Easy, cowboy.

202
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,013
You!

203
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,881
What about you! You are the best.

204
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,285
You weren't half bad yourself.

205
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,487
You are the best.

206
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,429
-You're the best.
-I aim to please.

207
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,634
After we have a cigarette...

208
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,872
...can we do it again?

209
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,510
I'II have a Spanish omelet, hash browns,
more coffee and orange juice.

210
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,347
Can I have some rice pudding
for Iater? Thanks.

211
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,316
Storing up for winter?

212
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,220
No, I'm starving. Patrick and I....

213
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,550
AII Iast night and I'm just....

214
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,059
No, don't stop, it's okay.

215
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,860
Just because I'm bad in bed
doesn't mean everybody is.

216
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,297
One more time.

217
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,632
You are not bad in bed.

218
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,002
Really? Has a man ever fallen asleep
making Iove to you?

219
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:32,203
No, but I once fell asleep when a guy was
doing me. It was the Iudes.

220
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,267
It's okay.

221
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:38,046
I'm mature enough to realize that while
I may be good at some things Iike...

222
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,113
...accessories, that I might need help
in others Iike....

223
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,015
-Fucking?
-Making Iove.

224
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,356
So, I'm taking a class.

225
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,985
A fucking class?

226
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,697
No, a tantric sex workshop.

227
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,264
Just don't drink any suspicious Kool-Aid
or put on new Nikes.

228
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,166
It's not Iike that. It's taught by a
well-respected woman psychologist.

229
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,098
It's called "How To PIease A Man."

230
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,843
I know how to please a man.
Just give away most of your power.

231
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,883
I have a trainer for the gym.
I can have a trainer for--

232
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,644
-Fucking?
-PIease stop saying that.

233
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,055
Are you actually going to do this?

234
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,124
Seating was Iimited,
so I signed you guys up.

235
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,764
PIease? I can't go alone.

236
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,033
If Bram ever falls asleep on me again,
I will die.

237
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,160
Pretty please, with sugar on it?

238
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,999
Christ, I'm in.

239
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,402
What the hell, I don't exactly
have them hanging from the rafters.

240
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,774
"How To PIease A Man."

241
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,674
I could teach the damn class.

242
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,044
AII right.

243
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,187
That night,
while David and David got undressed...

244
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,352
...and waited for her in the bedroom.

245
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,828
Samantha began to wonder
if maybe she was about to go too far.

246
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,397
Was she actually capable
of being this sexually free?

247
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,126
Or was she getting in over her head?

248
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,133
She decided before there were regrets,
they should all talk about it a little more.

249
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,301
Listen, David and David, maybe....

250
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,612
You Iook amazing.

251
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,445
Just Iike Jean Harlow in Red Dust.

252
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,045
Samantha loved the Samantha mirrored
through the eyes of the Davids.

253
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,820
What the hell?

254
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,065
-They're so soft.
-I know.

255
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,943
-I can't do this.
-Neither can I.

256
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,955
But I....

257
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,620
-We're just getting start--
-No, can't.

258
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,159
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

259
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,629
It's very pretty, but no.

260
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,468
It's not you, it's us.

261
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:47,435
I have an idea. Let's all put on our clothes
and go out for gelati!

262
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,599
-Cheesecake.
-Whatever.

263
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,009
Suddenly, Samantha wasn't feeling
so good about herself in bed.

264
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:07,322
I gotta go or I'm going to be Iate
for the tantric workshop thing.

265
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,087
Baby, you don't need a workshop.

266
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,289
You are amazing.

267
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,432
Come on, one more time.

268
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,536
We did it Iast night and all this morning.

269
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,468
I could have sex with you
morning, noon and night.

270
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,268
That's when I realized it.
Mr. Compulsive wasn 't in bed with me...

271
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,810
More, c'mon.

272
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,574
...he was in bed with a big bag
of Chips Ahoy.

273
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,672
More.

274
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,743
The intent of tantric...

275
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,255
...we say "sacred sexuality..."

276
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,084
...is to experience
and merge with the Divine.

277
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,854
I think Patrick's addicted to me.

278
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,523
It's Iike he's replaced drinking with me.

279
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,190
Program guys are tough.

280
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,928
I dated a guy who was
in Over-Eaters Anonymous.

281
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,734
Every time we had a fight,
he'd binge-eat hot fudge sundaes.

282
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,601
In other words, Iadies,
to drive your man crazy.

283
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,678
He wants to have sex all the time.
It's getting a Iittle out of hand.

284
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,683
At Ieast he wants to fuck you.

285
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,878
-They were gay.
-So?

286
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,854
One minute they were interested and then,
suddenly they weren't.

287
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,982
What did I do to turn them off?

288
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,053
Not having a dick would be the thing
that you did to turn them off.

289
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,595
You guys, I'm serious. This is rude.

290
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,500
Use it to bring any man to his knees.

291
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,436
With Iove, of course.

292
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,940
Where was this bitch Iast night
when I needed her?

293
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,310
Be quiet and you might Iearn something.
This Iady is supposed to be a genius.

294
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,617
If she's so good, why is she having
this workshop in her apartment?

295
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,050
I don't know.

296
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,547
Tantric sex is not about talk,
it's about action.

297
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,460
Delayed action.

298
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:53,188
So, without further delay...

299
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,894
...Iet me introduce my husband.

300
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,300
Dr. Ronny Shapiro.

301
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:08,009
I will demonstrate the very effective...

302
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,338
...Lingham Massage.

303
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,520
I think I know why we're in an apartment.

304
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,915
The receiver Iies on his back...

305
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,855
...before the giver, naked.

306
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:27,990
Genitals clearly exposed for the massage.

307
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,657
You're not writing.

308
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,602
Take your time doing this.

309
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,571
An hour and a half later, crippled by our
inability to look away from a car crash...

310
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,704
...we watched as the Dr. Shapiro
illustrated tantric sex.

311
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,078
Massage the head of the Lingham...

312
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,119
...as if you are using an orange juicer.

313
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,714
There go my good feelings about breakfast.

314
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,392
Stop it! You're embarrassing me.

315
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,127
We're the embarrassing part?

316
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,231
PIace your right hand...

317
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,527
...on the receiver's Root chakra.

318
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,235
Root!

319
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:12,002
The Root chakra is Iocated between
the anus and the genitals.

320
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,903
I think that I just got my 50 bucks worth.

321
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:21,609
Gently rock your hand
to awaken this chakra.

322
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,684
CIinically referred to as perineum.

323
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,257
Perineum: Latin for
"not without an engagement ring."

324
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,061
Will the women who are Iaughing
compose themselves?

325
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,623
Thank you.

326
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:39,336
Orgasm is not the goal
of Lingham Massage...

327
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:44,273
...but can be a pleasant
and very welcome side effect.

328
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,270
Watch what I'm doing here.

329
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,377
If you can master this...

330
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,644
...your man will always be faithful.

331
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,153
Because once they go tantric...

332
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,785
...they don't go back.

333
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,257
You go, girl.

334
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,696
See that? Can you all see this?

335
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,371
My God!

336
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,699
He's gonna....

337
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:25,378
And just like that,
Miranda got hit by Old Faithful.

338
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,814
What's funny?

339
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,993
After we talked Miranda in from
the ledge, I met Patrick for a movie.

340
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,465
I was telling my sponsor today
how I felt about you...

341
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,901
...and suddenly I realized
maybe I should just tell you.

342
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,474
I Iove you.

343
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,170
There it was, the little phrase
every girl is dying to hear...

344
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,876
...a week and a half into a relationship.

345
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,614
Thanks and that's so....

346
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,655
What? Too soon?
Is that what you're thinking?

347
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,159
We have been going out for, Iike, a minute.

348
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,494
Fuck that shit. I don't want to play games.

349
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,033
I'm just trying to own my feelings.

350
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,370
I Iove you. I said it.

351
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,836
Mr. Casey, you do not Iove me...

352
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,042
...you Iove you, not drinking, with me.

353
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,046
No, I Iove you.

354
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,321
I'm so flattered...

355
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,787
...but I think maybe we should
slow down a Iittle here.

356
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,417
What does that mean?

357
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,494
It means that things
are going very fast and....

358
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,534
You have these new feelings
because you're not drinking--

359
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,533
No, don't give me that program bullshit.

360
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,198
This has nothing to do with drinking.

361
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,465
I Iove you.

362
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,935
Maybe we should spend a Iittle time apart.

363
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,081
I'II call you tomorrow.

364
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,609
-I'm not coming up?
-Just a couple of nights.

365
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,922
Are you breaking up with me? 'Cause if--

366
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,618
I'm not breaking up with you.
I'm just going inside.

367
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,959
Call me tomorrow.

368
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,724
We'II do something next week, okay?

369
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,998
What am I going to do now?

370
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,398
You should go to a meeting.

371
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,066
And then go home, and call me tomorrow.

372
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,309
Goodnight.

373
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,105
I'II see you next week.

374
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,411
Go.

375
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,455
Get yourself some cookies.

376
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,767
Meanwhile, across town at Charlotte's....

377
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,064
My God, what are you doing?

378
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,072
My God.

379
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,039
You are good. Sweet Christ!

380
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,811
You are good!

381
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,248
Charlotte considered it the best 50 bucks
she'd ever spent.

382
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:21,548
It cost Miranda a little more, but across
town in her bed, things were good as well.

383
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,330
Carrie!

384
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,784
What are you doing?

385
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,755
Fuck you, you bitch!

386
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,251
Shit!

387
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,090
I Ioved you and you didn't Iove me.

388
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,665
You fucking made me date you...

389
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:04,524
...before the month and now I'm drunk.

390
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,465
And I don't care!

391
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,132
I Iove you!

392
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,544
I Iove you!

393
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,576
Make Iove to me!

394
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,148
What are you doing?
Don't take your clothes off.

395
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,817
My first impulse was to go down
and rescue him...

396
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,348
...but as I learned on our second date,
that would be codependent.

397
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,187
Still, I felt I had to do something.

398
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,495
Here, put this on, you'II get a cold.

399
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,059
I hope I fucking die!

400
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,705
Quiet, asshole, I'II call the cops!

401
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,763
Shut the fuck up, dickweed!

402
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,806
Carrie!

403
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,578
You were the best fuck I ever had!

404
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,442
Three weeks later,
I got a letter from Patrick...

405
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,679
...saying he was back in the program
and wanted to make amends.

406
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,620
I never saw him again
but I always wondered two things:

407
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,521
Was he able to stay sober?

408
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,992
Am I really that good in bed?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
