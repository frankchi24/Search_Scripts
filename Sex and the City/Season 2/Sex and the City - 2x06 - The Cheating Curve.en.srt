1
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,913
They say that New Yorkers
will attend the opening of an envelope...

2
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,282
...as long as the champagne
doesn't run dry.

3
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,447
But tonight's opening at
Charlotte's gallery for Yael...

4
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,855
...a lesbian painter from Brooklyn Heights...

5
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:02,725
...actually transcended the bad wine,
stale cheese routine.

6
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,694
It was lesbian chic meets art-world cool.

7
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,531
A surprisingly fabulous combustion
that no one saw coming.

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,834
Charlotte was there
with her latest fling, Gareth Davis.

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,637
A toxic bachelor and the owner of Thorn,
a downtown restaurant...

10
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,975
...frequented by second-tier models
and the men who buy them salad.

11
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,243
Miranda brought Ethan Watson...

12
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,319
...a documentary filmmaker
she had met the week before...

13
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,548
...at a sparsely attended
Harvard Alumni mixer.

14
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,016
And my date for the evening
was Samantha.

15
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,757
Not entirely inappropriate
given the circumstances.

16
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,593
Here.

17
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,632
Nobody told me it was B.Y.O. Man.

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,100
What did you expect?
It's a Iesbian art show.

19
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:47,765
But don't straight guys follow them
around to see what they're going to do?

20
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,641
Wait a second. You see that guy?

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,334
-Who?
-I know him.

22
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,309
-Who is he?
-He's a trainer at my gym.

23
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,849
And you should see his squat thrusts.
I'm just gonna say hello.

24
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,746
You know what, honey?
I think I'm gonna go home.

25
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,814
-Relax, I'II be right back.
-I don't feel very well.

26
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,360
-What's wrong?
-I have a headache. It just hit me.

27
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,864
-You want a Percodan?
-I'm fine. I just need some sleep.

28
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,228
Go on, make new friends.

29
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,500
-I'II call you.
-Okay.

30
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,937
With Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte
all suitably occupied...

31
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,875
...I figured there was no better time
to make my escape.

32
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,679
The truth was, I had another engagement.

33
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,144
But I didn't dare tell any of my friends
where I was going...

34
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,485
...or who I was planning to meet.

35
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,927
-You Iook sensational.
-You don't Iook so bad yourself.

36
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,799
This old thing? I've had it for years.

37
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,238
I knew it was wrong.

38
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:58,038
Seeing an emotionally unavailable man
I had sworn off months earlier.

39
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,704
But the guilt worked like an aphrodisiac.

40
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,546
I had never felt sexier or more alive
in my entire life.

41
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,623
By midnight, Charlotte discovered
Manhattan 's latest group...

42
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,285
...to flaunt their disposable income:

43
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,454
The power lesbian.

44
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,057
They seem to have everything.

45
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,657
Great shoes, killer eyewear
and the secrets to invisible makeup.

46
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,900
-I want that one. I'm gonna take it.
-Didn't I say I was buying it?

47
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,204
-I thought you were taking the Iarge one.
-I want both.

48
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,267
For God's sakes.

49
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,545
Charlotte had never sold out
a show before in her life.

50
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,082
She was pleasantly surprised.

51
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,348
Unfortunately, there was
a not so pleasant surprise in store for her.

52
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,852
We're out of champagne.

53
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,517
I'm sure I have an extra case or two
in the back storeroom.

54
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:00,830
Excuse me.

55
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,834
Relax, we're just kissing.

56
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,539
I'II see you in there.

57
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,382
I can't believe he had the nerve to kiss her
and still pretend he wasn't cheating.

58
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,584
Maybe he doesn't consider
kissing cheating.

59
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,093
Come on. It was only your second date.

60
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:26,029
So? Doesn't that guarantee me fidelity
until the end of the evening?

61
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,829
Remember Ron,
the married guy with kids on Park Avenue?

62
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,597
He didn't consider fucking
below 23rd Street cheating.

63
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,865
That's insane.

64
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,839
Men cheat for the same reason
that dogs Iick their balls:

65
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,638
Because they can.
It's part of their biology.

66
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,373
Instead of wasting all this energy
condemning it...

67
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,406
...maybe it's time we all got in Iine
with the reality of the situation.

68
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,577
That sounds very empowering,
but you're forgetting one detail.

69
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,644
I hope so.

70
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,017
-Women cheat.
-But it's different.

71
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,115
How?

72
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,787
We don't go around randomly attacking
any man we're attracted to.

73
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,159
-Speak for yourself.
-We're not driven by testosterone.

74
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,497
Then what does drive us according to you?

75
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,466
-Emotions.
-You mean hormones.

76
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,769
No. I mean that Iittle voice inside of me
that says, "Mate for Iife."

77
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,641
You can't Iisten to every fucking Iittle voice
that runs through your head.

78
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,577
It'II drive you nuts.

79
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:19,448
The problem is that you two have very
different definitions of cheating.

80
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,877
I don't tolerate it.

81
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,411
And I'm more forgiving
and realistic about human nature.

82
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,158
That's because you cheat.

83
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,059
I just don't think that you can define
cheating in absolute terms.

84
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,892
You think it's okay to cheat?

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,489
I think maybe there's a cheating curve.

86
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,703
Someone's definition
of what constitutes cheating...

87
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,671
...is in direct proportion to how much
they themselves want to cheat.

88
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,298
That's moral relativism.

89
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,703
I prefer to think of it as quantum cheating.

90
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:49,942
The fact is, the act of cheating
is defined by the act of getting caught.

91
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,644
One doesn't exist without the other.

92
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,085
I wondered, was Samantha right?

93
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,148
Is cheating like the proverbial tree
in the forest?

94
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,057
That it doesn't exist
if there's no one around to catch you?

95
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,860
In a gravity-free world of anything goes,
what constitutes cheating?

96
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,223
Everybody cheats.

97
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,460
That's the great thing
about having a trainer.

98
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,568
Seven, keep your neck back.

99
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,730
Eight.

100
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,034
Pisses me off seeing people
train improperly.

101
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,044
I guess I better behave then.

102
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,942
I'm all about form and discipline.

103
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,409
Do it right or don't bother doing it at all.

104
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:25,916
Yes.

105
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,987
Samantha realized that
while purity of form exacted a price...

106
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,388
...it also had its own rewards.

107
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,789
So how do you feel?

108
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:37,859
You got me all wet. I mean sweaty.

109
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,394
Same time on Wednesday?

110
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,761
It's a date.

111
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:45,062
Later that day, Charlotte realized
she was tired of listening...

112
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,366
...to another man 's weak justifications.

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,705
You don 't understand.
She's a friend of my sister's from college.

114
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,675
She just moved to the city
and her uncle died Iast month.

115
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,873
I was just trying to be supportive.

116
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,108
Besides...

117
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,214
...you're the one I want to sleep with.

118
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,345
When she felt her life
take a fortuitous turn.

119
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,081
Gareth, I've got to go.

120
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,682
Wait. What--

121
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,059
Hi! Nice to see you.

122
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,156
I just came in to pay for my painting.

123
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,203
It's her painting for six months
and then she's selling it back to me.

124
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,329
Excuse me.

125
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm the one with the big Ioft
and all the empty white walls.

126
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,068
Look at it. I am so excited.

127
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,848
Excuse me.
By the way, I Iove the Prada Ioafers.

128
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,142
Thanks.

129
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,854
Power lesbians and their shoes are like
Wall Street brokers and their cigars.

130
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,220
AIice told me so many nice things
about you.

131
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,759
How Iong have you been
doing the art thing?

132
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,160
Ten years. No, 12 years. I'm Iosing track.

133
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,025
AImost five years at this gallery.
What do you do?

134
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,091
I'm a V.P. at Warner Music.
Eileen works on Wall Street.

135
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,966
How Iong have you been together?

136
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,767
Used to be together.
Five years. We're just friends now.

137
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,672
That is so cool.

138
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,378
Want to join Melissa and Drew
in about an hour for a drink?

139
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,574
Sure. Would you Iike to join us for a drink?

140
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,912
I wish I could, but--

141
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,415
But what?

142
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,891
The truth is Charlotte couldn't think
of one really good reason not to go.

143
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,187
I'd Iove to.

144
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,956
One drink at G-Spot,
the hottest new girl bar in town...

145
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,160
...followed by dinner
and scintillating conversation at Luke's...

146
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,002
...a hot new French-fusion restaurant
with an even hotter chef...

147
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,564
...followed by late-night dancing
at Love Tunnel...

148
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,008
...Ieft Charlotte exhilarated and happy
as she'd been in ages.

149
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,478
There was something
relaxing and liberating...

150
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,381
...in traveling in an alternate universe
that contained no thought of men.

151
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,010
By the end of the night,
Charlotte had truly made...

152
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,420
...some wonderful new friends.

153
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,227
That night, Miranda was exhausted
from her own night on the town.

154
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,101
She had spent the last four hours
in the dark with Ethan...

155
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,472
...watching the classic
holocaust documentary Shoah.

156
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,775
Shoah is so much better than
that faky, stagy Schindler's List.

157
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:13,241
Narrative film can't begin to touch
the horror of experience.

158
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:18,214
Only documentaries can really
begin to capture the truth.

159
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:23,024
In fact, the entire concept
of narrative film...

160
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,896
...is just bogus.

161
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,397
You know--

162
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,306
Want to come back to my place?

163
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,410
Miranda was pleased to discover
that Ethan was as passionate in bed...

164
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,345
...as he was on the subject
of non-narrative film.

165
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,849
But just as they were
getting down to business...

166
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,647
...Miranda realized they were not alone.

167
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,486
What's that for?

168
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,256
Just something to get us in the mood.

169
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,691
I think it's kind of sexy, don't you?

170
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,325
Yeah, I guess it could be.

171
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,337
Miranda realized
that Ethan's passion for film...

172
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,874
...had taken on a new and interesting twist.

173
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,707
A few nights later, after a late show
of Gimme Shelter at the Waverly...

174
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,911
...Miranda discovered that Ethan's
new friends were hard to shake.

175
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,749
-Does that really need to be on?
-No.

176
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,591
It just really turns me on.

177
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,732
-Aren't I enough?
-You're great.

178
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,498
I can turn off the sound if it bugs you.

179
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,832
Could you move your head
a bit to the right?

180
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,677
Yeah. That's great.

181
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,952
That night, in Mr. Big's kitchen,
I performed an unnatural act of my own.

182
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,749
I cooked.

183
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,755
Voila. Fondue.

184
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,590
You didn't cook.
You just heated up cheese.

185
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,696
And tore up Iittle pieces of bread.

186
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,856
-I'm touched by your effort.
-Okay.

187
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,234
It's the only recipe I could ever master.

188
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,503
AII righty.

189
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,035
Now...

190
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,835
...tell me you Iove it.

191
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,838
Tasty.

192
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,915
Now you tell me.

193
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,554
It's horrible.

194
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,728
Can we go to a restaurant now?

195
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,668
I take it back. You're an excellent cook.

196
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,006
I haven't told my friends
we're seeing each other.

197
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,637
Neither have I.

198
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,846
-That doesn't count. You have no friends.
-I have interested parties.

199
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,852
-Why haven't you told them?
-I sensed you didn't want me to.

200
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,350
Bullshit.

201
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,183
What do you want me to tell people?

202
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,283
-Nothing.
-Good idea. Let's keep it quiet.

203
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,656
-Why do you want to keep it quiet?
-I just want to be agreeable.

204
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,972
The truth is, I wasn't sure why
I wanted to keep the fact...

205
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,507
...that I was seeing Big again
so under wraps.

206
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,340
All I knew is that it felt somehow illicit.

207
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,972
I didn 't even want
to be caught waking up there.

208
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,010
That morning at 7:00 a.m...

209
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,281
...as I walked the Walk of Shame
back to my apartment....

210
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,883
My god!

211
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,022
-What are you doing up here?
-Teeth cleaning.

212
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,757
-At 7:00 a.m.?
-I Iike to get it over with. How's Ethan?

213
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,534
-Aside from his porn addiction?
-Still?

214
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,163
It was kind of sexy at first,
but it's getting borderline humiliating.

215
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,400
"Move your head here.
Move your head there."

216
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,170
Isn't the real thing more exciting
than a tape?

217
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,912
Maybe it's a force of habit.

218
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,311
I get the feeling he's more interested
in the video than me.

219
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,285
Like he's cheating on me with them
while we're having sex. I don't know.

220
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,048
Am I expecting too much?

221
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,852
No, you deserve his undivided attention.

222
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,220
Thank you. I have to go.
I have a breakfast meeting.

223
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,230
-You're dressed up for the dentist!
-Laundry day.

224
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,066
-Got it.
-Bye, sweetie.

225
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,661
I felt horrible.
I had never lied to Miranda before.

226
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,638
But I was embarrassed to admit
that I was seeing Big again.

227
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,268
The truth was, I was cheating
on her and all my friends with Mr. Big.

228
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,712
That afternoon, Samantha got
very personal with her new trainer, Thor.

229
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,184
I feel Iike such a cliche.
I bet you sleep with all your clients.

230
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,984
I really don't, but it's always been
kind of a fantasy for me.

231
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,618
-Maybe I could train you.
-Why don't we take a shower first?

232
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,222
You got great Iegs.

233
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,323
If I knew we were going to be doing this,
I'd have shaved them.

234
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,163
That's all right. I'II shave them for you.

235
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,248
Are you a dirty girl?

236
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,052
I guess that depends
on your definition of dirty.

237
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,787
And then to Samantha's
surprise and delight...

238
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,491
...Thor kept right on shaving.

239
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,841
What is this thing guys have these days
about wanting to shave your pubic hair?

240
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,308
It's obvious. They want a Iittle girl.

241
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,474
Actually, in Thor's case,
it was more Iike being branded.

242
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,374
What are you talking about?

243
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,643
He shaved me in a shape: a Iightning bolt.

244
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,948
Where do you find these guys?
Carrie, are you Iistening to this?

245
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,426
That very personal trainer of Samantha's...

246
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,692
...shaved her crotch
in the shape of a Iightening bolt.

247
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,825
Really. It's very creative.
Sort of Iike X marks the spot.

248
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,530
You know, it's a very neglected area.

249
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,130
But people are really starting
to pay attention.

250
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,936
You can't just Iet it grow wild.

251
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,411
There's an entire business...

252
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,070
...devoted to the upkeep
and management of pubic hair.

253
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,775
It says as much about you as shoes.

254
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,783
Congratulations, it sounds Iike you found
yourself a very talented stylist.

255
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,185
What are you doing in there?

256
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,924
You know what? Can somebody get that?
I'll be out in a sec.

257
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,518
Sorry I'm Iate.

258
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,928
You didn't have to get
all dressed up for us.

259
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,660
Why not? You did your hair.

260
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,599
It's not for you guys.
I'm meeting Lydia and her friends tonight.

261
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,041
-Who's Lydia?
-Haven't you heard? Charlotte's a Iesbian.

262
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,642
I am not a Iesbian.
I just have some new Iesbian friends.

263
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,339
She's been out with them
three times this past week.

264
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,606
So?

265
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,881
They're cool and they buy art
and their Iives aren't complicated by men.

266
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,784
I was a major Iesbian in the fourth grade.

267
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,656
Wendy Kirsten. We kissed. It was nice.

268
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,753
They know you're straight, right?

269
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,230
I'm sure they do, but we don't even talk
about sex. It's a non-issue.

270
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,200
You have to tell them,
otherwise you're just Ieading them on.

271
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,673
You're nothing but a big clit tease.

272
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,337
Are you saying that a straight woman
and a gay woman can't be friends?

273
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:25,475
Of course, but you can't expect to move to
Wonder Woman's island and not go native.

274
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,579
Where's Carrie?

275
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,646
If she doesn't get out of the bathroom,
we'II miss the movie.

276
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,885
Is everything okay in there?

277
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,724
Actually, no.

278
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,664
I need help.

279
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,599
This is embarrassing.
I got a new diaphragm and it's stuck.

280
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,532
How Iong has it been in there?

281
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,972
Since Iast night.

282
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,507
While you were getting
your teeth cleaned--

283
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,943
I'm either gonna have to make an
emergency visit to my gynecologist...

284
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,017
...or someone's gonna have to help me.

285
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,110
I'd help you, but I'm not very dexterous.

286
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,881
You're the Iesbian, go in there.

287
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,084
No.

288
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,350
Go.

289
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,462
And I just had my nails done.

290
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,899
You are so buying me dinner.

291
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,108
Wait. Aren't we skipping a beat here?

292
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,268
Who are you sleeping with?

293
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,509
It's something that started again
a few weeks ago.

294
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,539
I don't know if it's real
so I didn't want to say anything.

295
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,080
It's Big.

296
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,445
You're sleeping with Big?
He was such an asshole to you.

297
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,822
Not really. Maybe sometimes.

298
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,524
Why do you think
it'II be different this time?

299
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,564
I don't know. I'm not sure they are,
but it kind of feels okay.

300
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,824
If it feels okay,
why are you sneaking around?

301
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,198
We've got this physical, chemical...

302
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,741
...kind of connection that's hard to shake.

303
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,140
So Iay off, okay?

304
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,906
-Now it's gonna be a casual sex thing?
-Maybe.

305
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,573
-That's gonna work.
-Even I am not that naive.

306
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,512
I'm really not in the mood
to see a movie anymore.

307
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,317
Come on!

308
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,185
I couldn't sleep at all that night.

309
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,952
The problem was, my friends were right.

310
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,796
Falling into this casual thing with Big,
without a sense of what happened...

311
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,735
...or where it was going,
suddenly felt like a huge mistake.

312
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,504
The next morning, Charlotte attended
brunch at the home of Patty Aston...

313
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,377
...the ex-wife of a Hollywood
television producer.

314
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,077
If power lesbians represented
Manhattan 's chicest new social hive...

315
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,912
...Charlotte was about to meet
their queen bee.

316
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,478
Patty is an amazing Iady.

317
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,185
She's on the board of 100 charities
and now she's taking flying Iessons.

318
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,626
She's got a house in Telluride.
We're all going there for Easter.

319
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,324
-You should come.
-I'd Iove to.

320
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,101
She also has some very interesting art.

321
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,737
Diana the Huntress.

322
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,169
I got her on sale.

323
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,102
This is Charlotte.

324
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,245
A pleasure. I've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

325
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,437
Likewise.

326
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,952
I was telling Charlotte
about your amazing house in Telluride.

327
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,350
Sounds wonderful.

328
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,944
I'm gonna get us some drinks.

329
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,852
-Champagne?
-Sure.

330
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,151
Do you ski?

331
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,022
Yes, but not well.
I guess I'm what you'd call a snow bunny.

332
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,326
I just kind of hop down the bunny trail.

333
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,900
It's not a prerequisite, believe me.

334
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,630
It's wonderful to Ieave the city
and be in the mountains.

335
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,465
Absolutely.

336
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,072
You should plan to join us the next time.
I know Lydia would Iove it if you could.

337
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,736
That's very generous of you.

338
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,145
But before we get on a plane together,
there's something we all want to know.

339
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,749
Are you gay?

340
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,453
No, I'm not.

341
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,548
But I do so enjoy
the company of all these women.

342
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,658
Everyone's so smart and funny.

343
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,656
After spending too much time
and attention on men...

344
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,825
...it feels Iike such a safe,
warm environment.

345
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,927
And while sexually,
I feel that I am straight...

346
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,200
...there's a very powerful part of me
that connects to the female spirit.

347
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,068
Sweetheart, that's all very nice...

348
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,980
...but if you're not going to eat pussy,
you're not a dyke.

349
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,582
Later that afternoon, following
a particularly grueling workout with Thor...

350
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,956
...Samantha decided to take
a relaxing steam.

351
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,236
That asshole!

352
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,573
That day at the gym...

353
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,204
...Samantha discovered
that lightning does indeed strike twice.

354
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,710
That evening,
Miranda was treated to a double bill.

355
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,454
Nanook of the North at Alice Tully Hall...

356
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:01,352
...and Steady as She BIows
at Ethan Watson's Porn Palace.

357
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,257
Hold it right there.

358
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,392
AII right, that's enough!

359
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,903
This is not a synchronized event.

360
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,307
Look, I Iike you.

361
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,967
But this is ridiculous.
It's either the women in the video or me.

362
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,570
Your choice, but you can't have both.

363
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,973
It's not that simple.

364
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,782
I've only known you for a few weeks.

365
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,849
But I've been involved
with these women for years.

366
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,682
I am so out of here.

367
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,464
That night, for the first time ever,
Big took me out dancing.

368
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,697
It was like he knew
I needed to talk to him...

369
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,105
...and decided to make it
as difficult as possible.

370
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,235
Our attraction, or addiction,
or whatever, was strong.

371
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,940
But I knew I had to be stronger.

372
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,780
Does this mean we're
seeing each other again? Officially?

373
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,910
If you say so.

374
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,350
That is an infuriating response.

375
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,585
I don't know what "officially" means.

376
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,958
"Officially" means officially.

377
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,563
You know, for real.

378
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,604
Every moment of my Iife is for real, baby.

379
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,607
Just answer me this:
Why did we break up?

380
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,609
You tell me.

381
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,277
You're the one who Ieft me high and dry
with two tickets to St. Barts.

382
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,947
You didn't say what I wanted to hear.

383
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,257
Is that it?

384
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,753
No, not just that.

385
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,897
I wanted to tell him
I was afraid he could never love me...

386
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,661
...the way I wanted to be loved.

387
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,226
I was afraid that he didn't
really have the capacity...

388
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,204
...to love anyone but himself.

389
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:57,503
I was afraid that, given the chance,
he'd break my heart again.

390
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,635
But I cheated and just said....

391
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,611
I guess I was afraid.

392
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,477
I can tell you one thing.

393
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,785
I sure did miss you officially.

394
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,296
Did you cry?

395
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,292
No.

396
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,230
But I did Iisten to a hell of a Iot of Sinatra.

397
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,238
And there it was. I guess we were
back together officially.

398
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,876
Whatever that means.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
