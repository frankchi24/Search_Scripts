Epi 11. one

11
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,264
Okay. Come on let's hurry.

12
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,038
- I'm not dressed to hustle.
- Oh.

13
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:04,518
When Charlotte and I heard that there was
a woman in Chelsea not talking or eating,

14
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:06,555
we were there in a New York minute.

15
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,590
And she's doing this for how long?

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,621
16 days. 24 hours a day.

17
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:25,969
This is Day 6.

18
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,500
It gets worse?

19
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,636
By changing my personal energy field,

20
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:34,364
I'm attempting to change
the energy field in this room

21
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:38,700
and perhaps that energy shift
will shift the energy of the world.

22
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,447
Good for her. So Best-e's for lunch?

23
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,690
When I was working in the galleries,

24
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,690
performance art was more theatre
then instillation.

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,751
She's moved it to the next level.

26
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,967
Well girlfriend needs to move a combthrough her hair.

27
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,998
She has company.

28
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,190
There's a man over there staring at me.

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,489
Where?

30
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:35,462
Over there.

31
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,283
Oh.

32
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,628
He's not there.

33
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:48,119
Can you tell Circe that Charlotte from
Hisgallerian Spring Street sends her very best?

34
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,962
Okay that's him again.

35
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,196
Oh my god.

36
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:59,296
That's Alexander Petrovski, the artist.

37
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,555
He is the¡¦

38
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:08,152
Thank you very much.
Would you like..?

39
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:09,311
No. it's okay.

40
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,749
Oh excuse me. Mr. Petrovski.

41
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:12,589
Yes?

42
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,534
I don't mean to bother you but..

43
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,900
I just have to say thank you.

44
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:20,199
When I first moved to New York
and working in the galleries,

45
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,151
your Abstract #1 was my first important sale.

46
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,371
This is such a thrill.

47
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:30,875
I mean you defined the 70s in terms of progressive..

48
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,085
And what did you think about this work today?

49
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,687
Very moving. Significant.

50
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,235
And what do you think?

51
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,858
Good.

52
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:43,401
But you thought it was funny.

53
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,683
I heard you laugh.

54
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,306
I'm not very arty.

55
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:49,695
You don't think it's significant?

56
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,435
Oh please.

57
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:54,645
There are depressed women all overNew York doing the exact same thing as her

58
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:55,897
and not calling it art.

59
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:58,194
I mean, if you put a phone up on that platform,

60
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,370
it's just a typical Friday night waiting for some guy to call.

61
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,827
She's kidding.

62
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:05,957
And frankly, I don't buy the whole 24 hours
not eating thing.

63
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:08,495
I bet if anyone bothered to come down
here three in the morning,

64
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,915
she wouldn't even be up there.

65
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,925
She'd be around the corner having a Big Mac.

66
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,664
Why do you think she has the life ladders?

67
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:17,178
To keep her from running out for a snack.

68
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,728
And who are you?

69
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,485
What do you mean?

70
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:21,679
Your name?

71
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,196
I'm Carrie Bradshaw.

72
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:26,224
You're comic.

73
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:30,745
And I'm Charlotte York. I mean Goldenblatt.

74
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:32,313
I forgot my married name.

75
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,632
I just got married so..
can I just say, again,

76
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:40,800
how very, very important your work is?

77
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:46,836
Oh my God.

78
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,061
We just met Alexander Petrovski.

79
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:53,890
You're comic?

80
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:59,801
That night over at new couple central.

81
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:04,445
Hot pizza and in less than 30 minutes,
I think I missed my calling.

82
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:07,927
You just pass by me without a kiss?

83
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,907
- I wanted to wait until I can use my hands.
- Oh.

84
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:17,370
See?

85
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,958
What's with that little pizza box?

86
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:28,020
One is a pizza, the other is a surprise
for you after the pizza.

87
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:29,888
Oh.

88
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:30,749
After.

89
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,849
- I love surprises.
- Yeah?

90
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,224
What are we drinking? Wine?

91
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,905
Oh.

92
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:39,941
What?

93
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,219
One of my guys busted his knee.

94
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:44,515
- I have to go to the hospital.
- Oh.

95
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:47,715
What are 6'8" pro basketball players
doing on a skateboard?

96
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,641
I don't know.

97
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,353
Hey. Don't wait up.

98
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:54,736
I'll see you tomorrow.

99
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:57,710
All right.

100
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:59,648
Good night beautiful.

101
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:09,082
There they were. The sweetest words
you can ever say.

102
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,509
In the sweetest way you can ever say them.

103
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,646
Turns out Miranda didn't like surprises
as much as she thought.

104
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:30,182
Last night Robert said I love you.

105
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,659
Wow. That's wonderful.

106
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:34,611
On a cookie.

107
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,769
I need more information.

108
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,320
He brought it over, I guess as a surprise.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,231
But before we got to it he had to leave

110
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:45,121
and then I panicked and ate the entire thing.

111
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,626
Because?

112
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,994
If it wasn't there,
I wouldn't have to deal with it.

113
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,958
Oh.

114
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,143
Now was it the fact that he said it
on a cookie or that he said it period?

115
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:58,605
Had to be the cookie.

116
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:01,672
Robert is great. Right?

117
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:06,130
Well.. I didn't wanna be the one
to have to tell you this about him

118
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,931
but... he's perfect. I'm sorry.

119
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:12,265
If your best friend can't tell you who will?

120
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,474
He is perfect. Really.

121
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:19,447
You should see how cute he is
helping plan Brady's birthday party.

122
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:23,080
Oh. Brady is one year old.

123
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:26,242
And yet I haven't aged a day.

124
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:30,448
Saturday afternoon, my house.

125
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:32,533
Just us, some of Steve's family.

126
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,422
I'm not coming if there's a clown.

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,976
No clown.

128
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:38,673
Good. Nothing scarier than a clown.

129
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,544
- We're gonna be four. Thanks.
-Okay

130
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:46,683
What are you getting?

131
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:49,260
Yes. I need glasses and I am not ashamed.

132
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:53,043
I have a sexy young man who loves
to fuck me and I'm fabulous.

133
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:55,648
Have you considered putting that on a t-shirt?

134
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:58,442
Are those the kind you get at
the drugstore next to the Bengay?

135
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:00,702
How dare you! These are Chanel.

136
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,367
There you go. Thank you.

137
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:08,739
Hey. Have you ever heard of that
artist Alexander Patrovski?

138
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,735
Who?

139
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,630
Alexander Patrovski? Oh my god.

140
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:15,872
He was the number one hot guy at Studio 54.

141
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,273
Dated every top super model in the 70s.

142
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:22,421
oh my nipple's getting hard
just thinking about him. Why?

143
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:23,956
I met him yesterday.

144
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:26,391
No. how did he look. Is he still gorgeous?

145
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:27,803
We need more time.

146
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,697
Where did you meet?
What's he like?

147
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:36,054
We met at a gallery and he was odd.

148
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:38,697
How old is he now? Let me see.

149
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:40,990
When I was 22. He was about 30.

150
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,162
Studio 54 was '79.so that would make him, what? 53.

151
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,818
And that would make you..

152
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm forty fucking five.

153
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,454
I have nothing to hide.

154
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:57,469
Hello.

155
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:02,995
What?

156
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,916
I'm pregnant.

157
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,902
Congratulations!

158
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:09,317
Oh my god.

159
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,821
It's very, very early. But I am.

160
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,776
I just heard from the doctor.

161
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:16,637
We don't know if it's the acupuncture
or all of the herbs that I've been taking

162
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:20,487
or maybe Harry and I are just a better fitter
whatever but I am. I'm pregnant.

163
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,365
How far along are you?

164
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:24,116
About three weeks.

165
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:26,737
Oh please excuse me.

166
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:32,192
What was that?

167
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:33,716
Well I'm growing it out.

168
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:35,578
My hair. Down there.

169
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:37,828
Smith enjoys a full bush.

170
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,385
Isn't this great?

171
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:43,046
Everything is exactly like it always is..

172
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,021
but I'm pregnant.

173
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:49,860
One lazy Wednesday afternoon later.

174
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,794
Hello.

175
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,696
Uh, hello. Good afternoon. I'm..

176
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:54,852
Wrong number sorry.

177
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,274
Hello.

178
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,875
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,528
Yes I'm sorry too. Wrong number.

180
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,475
Yes?

181
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:29,471
I'm afraid it's me again. I have really..

182
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:30,978
a bit of trouble here.

183
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:33,833
Sir. I can not understand you.

184
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,143
This is Alexander Patrovski calling for Carrie Bradshaw.

185
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:42,597
Oh. I'll get her. Hold on.

186
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,854
Carrie.

187
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,114
Hello?

188
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:54,063
That was you before. Yes?

189
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:55,652
Sounded just like you.

190
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:58,071
Oh no. That was my sister.

191
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,343
She's visiting.

192
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,240
Oh that's nice.

193
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,917
I hope you don't mind me calling you.

194
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:05,522
I got this number from the friend of yours

195
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:08,626
who knows the girl who works at the gallery at Circe.

196
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,060
I hope it's okay.

197
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,504
Okay.

198
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,844
Are you still laughing out that artist?

199
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,474
Excuse me?

200
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:19,223
Saying that she eats all night. Big Mac's.

201
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:22,438
Well. I'm sticking to my guns.

202
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:23,801
I thought you would.

203
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:27,732
So, let's go see her at three a. m. to be sure,

204
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:30,744
how's Saturday for you?

205
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,405
You're not serious.

206
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,741
I am serious. She is serious.

207
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,757
You're the one who's not serious.

208
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:39,485
You're expecting me to get out of bed

209
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:43,666
and go meet you at some art gallery at 3 am?

210
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,004
Not 3. Let's say one.

211
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:49,872
We'll have dinner first. At the Russian?

212
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:51,715
1 a. m. at a mysterious place?

213
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:55,130
I'm not going to get sold into White slavery, am I?

214
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,329
I don't know what this means.

215
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:00,575
It was a joke.

216
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:04,645
Okay. Comic. Good-bye.

217
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:23,961
Hello again.

218
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,991
Carrie. It's Harry.

219
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:28,709
Harry. Hi. What's wrong?

220
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,584
What happened?

221
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,496
It just.. you know... went away.

222
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:37,886
Doctor says it happens all the time.

223
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:39,632
How is she?

224
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,922
Not good.

225
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:45,053
She's just been sort of sitting
and staring since this morning.

226
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:47,015
She didn't want me to call anybody but I thought..

227
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,112
No, you did the right thing.

228
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:52,191
She's in the living room.
I told her you were coming.

229
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:57,744
How are you?

230
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,278
You know¡¦

231
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,602
Hi. This is awful. I'm so sorry.

232
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:22,770
The doctor said the good news is we got pregnant.

233
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,935
He said lots of woman miscarry andgo on to have perfectly healthy kids.

234
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:31,235
It's true. Shall I get you some mint tea?

235
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:32,517
How about that?

236
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:35,374
I can't go to Brady's party on Saturday.

237
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:38,127
Okay. She'll understand.

238
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:47,077
Napkins. Cups. Party favors.

239
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,871
Done. Done. Done.

240
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,546
Now on Saturday,
all Steve has to do is bring the cake.

241
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:52,674
What kind?

242
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,235
Chocolates with white icing.

243
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:58,571
Baby's first sugar. Look out.

244
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:02,119
You like chocolate, don't you?

245
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:06,307
Well you haven't mentioned anything about the cookie.

246
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,836
You know what? Yes. I was.

247
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,762
If you give me a minute.

248
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,985
That's five days ago.

249
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:19,905
I'm embarrassed. I ate the whole thing.

250
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:23,046
It was delicious.

251
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,298
Good.

252
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,457
What about what is said?

253
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:34,126
Sweet. So sweet.

254
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,109
I love you Jules.

255
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,978
I love you Mimi.

256
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,913
Loved you since I first saw you.

257
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,276
Feel so right to finally say it.

258
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,284
Don't have to hold the words back anymore.

259
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:54,036
I love you Jules. I love you.

260
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:02,893
Hello.

261
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:07,158
I am so fucked up. I am so fucked up.

262
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,443
Okay we need to divide and conquer.
What's going on?

263
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,748
I can't say I love you. I just can't.

264
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,362
It's not in my DNA.

265
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:17,430
And everywhere I look,
it is just flying out of people's mouths.

266
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,959
Who's mouths is it flying out of?

267
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,178
Everyone. Jules and Mimi.

268
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:22,470
They're fictional.

269
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,687
But they say it. Robert said it.

270
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,532
He said it on a cookie

271
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,949
I am so fucked up.

272
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:34,023
Robert asked about the cookie and
it was the perfect time to say it and I couldn't.

273
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:36,959
He was just hanging there waiting
and I couldn't.

274
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:39,827
I am never gonna be happy.

275
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,205
Just not gonna happen for me.

276
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:43,786
Do you love him?

277
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:47,370
How can I love him if I can't even say the words?

278
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:48,694
Well.

279
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:52,991
I always thought that when the right guy
came along all of my bullshit will calm down

280
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:56,213
and go away and the words would just fall out of my mouth

281
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:58,922
because I would know he was the one.

282
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,140
And here he is.

283
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,385
The perfect guy. And I..

284
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,816
Is he the one? I don't know.

285
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,010
I don't know.

286
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,815
Because I am so fucked up.

287
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,496
And I am gonna ruin my life.

288
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:16,805
Stop. It's too late to ruin your life.

289
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:20,362
The only thing you're gonna ruin tonight
is your night and mine.

290
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:23,523
I was kidding.

291
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,356
I'm laughing on the inside.

292
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:29,386
Okay listen. Get a good night sleep see
how you feel tomorrow.

293
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:33,444
Turn off Jules and Mimi and go to bed.

294
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:35,432
You've seen enough love for one night.

295
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:38,408
You're right.

296
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:42,427
You know what used to make me
feel better? Cookies...

297
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:44,774
- Good night.
- Good night.

298
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,856
I blame Valentine's Day.

299
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:54,023
Hundreds upon hundreds of cards
all decreeing you're the one.

300
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:58,951
Just imagine the hundreds and hundreds of
wrenching late night phone calls

301
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,347
all over this one idea.

302
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:02,770
And it's not just with love.

303
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,610
It seems we're always looking for
that one thing to make our lives complete.

304
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:10,243
That job, that chance, that family.

305
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:11,875
I couldn't help but wonder,

306
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,367
when will waiting for the one be done?

307
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:30,255
Samantha was never a woman
who looked for the one

308
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,528
but today, she found one.

309
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,398
A gray one.

310
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,790
She figured a box in the hand was better
than one in the bush.

311
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:08,096
Turns out, left on too long,
nice and simple was not so nice.

312
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:12,199
Here we go. Happy birthday.

313
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,758
Hey birthday boy.

314
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,774
- Daddy.
- How are you?

315
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:16,974
Yes.

316
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:18,851
Who got the clown?

317
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:21,585
I did. Hey Ma.

318
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:25,476
I got my grandson a clown.

319
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,318
The kids love it.

320
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,603
Brady's the only kid.

321
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:31,385
Well I paid him.

322
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:34,297
He can open the door or something.

323
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:38,805
Put that cake somewhere cool
where it won't get knocked over.

324
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:41,258
Laundry room.

325
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,296
And tell the clown to open the door.

326
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:49,742
I hope you're not insulted I brought my own beer.

327
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,754
No. Not at all.

328
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:54,169
Hi Ma.

329
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:58,035
Debbie. There's my Debbie.

330
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,017
Oh Miranda the baby looks so cute.

331
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:03,868
Thanks.

332
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,460
God bless him.

333
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,397
Hey, you want a beer?

334
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,034
Sure.

335
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,195
Did you see my clown?

336
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,369
Hey.

337
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,218
Thanks for coming.

338
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:22,365
Of course.

339
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:23,491
How is she?

340
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:26,371
The same. Just stares at the TV.

341
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:28,811
She says she wasn't strong enough to come.

342
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:30,339
I don't know what to do.

343
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:33,687
She'll be okay. She just has to feel it.

344
00:19:35,044 --> 00:19:37,347
- Come on, there's food.
- Good.

345
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,518
This is the story of Elizabeth Taylor.

346
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,433
The E! True Hollywood Story.

347
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,651
We'll give you an exclusive revealing look

348
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:53,161
at one of Hollywood's greatest treasures.

349
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:57,700
A talented and courageous woman
who was above all, a survivor.

350
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:11,589
Here you are.

351
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:13,045
I was told there'd be no clowns.

352
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,549
Nothing scarier than a clown.

353
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,134
I need to talk to you in private.

354
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,985
All right well you'll have to wait
till I get something to eat. I'm starving.

355
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,557
- Here.
- Oh.

356
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,224
Come.

357
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,563
Okay.

358
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:37,747
What is so important that it couldn't wait.

359
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,555
I found a gray hair.

360
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:40,796
In a food?

361
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:43,535
In my hair. Down there.

362
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,665
What am I going to do? It's a disaster.

363
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,041
It's not a disaster.

364
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,240
It's all part of getting older.
You said that yourself.

365
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,837
My eyes getting old is one thing but this,

366
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,623
this cannot get old. What will Smith think?

367
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,464
Smith is well aware of the fact that you're older.

368
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:03,255
Older not old and this is old.

369
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:05,937
No man wants to fuck grandma's pussy.

370
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:10,526
Oh god. This is a child's birthday party.

371
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:12,439
I was going to tweeze but if you pluck it,

372
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,062
six more will come to its funeral.

373
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:17,172
Well that's what they say.

374
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:23,086
- Bye.
- Stop. Please.

375
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:24,413
I'm not telling you the whole story.

376
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,793
It gets worse?

377
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,205
I dyed it.

378
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:29,507
And I left it on too long,

379
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,959
- and it's the wrong color.
- Okay.

380
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:35,913
You have ten seconds and then I'm leaving.
Ten nine...

381
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:38,178
It's red. And when Smith sees it,

382
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,217
I'm going to have to explain why it's red.

383
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,366
- Five. Four. Three.
- Carrie, I don't think you get the magnitude of this.

384
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,476
- Two. One.
- I'm Bobo the Bush.

385
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,762
Turns out, there is something scarier than a clown.

386
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:55,475
Elizabeth endured a difficult? operation.

387
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:58,165
Hovering near death for three days.

388
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:00,752
Elizabeth Taylor's story is an epic.

389
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,501
And an inspiration.

390
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:08,661
Now is the time for guts and guile.

391
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,858
This is the story of one of Hollywood's

392
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:40,194
Everything's so nice Miranda.

393
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,823
Thanks.

394
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,785
I'm real glad everything worked out.

395
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:47,206
You and Robert. Me and Steve.

396
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:49,424
Cause I really love him.

397
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:58,479
There's my girl.

398
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:01,804
I got my pipes all warmed up to sing.

399
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:04,239
- And where's that cake?
- I'll get him.

400
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:08,530
Hey. Are you okay?

401
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:19,819
Okay.

402
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:30,175
Hold up. Hold on. Forget those wimpy little ones.

403
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,694
Wait till you see what I got here.

404
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,371
Look at that. Huh?

405
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:40,930
I love you. I love you Steve.

406
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sorry, I should never have said that.

407
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,435
It's just that.. I love you and I fucked everything up

408
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:48,300
and now it's too late.

409
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,769
I'm sorry I'm doing this. I'm sorry.
Please don't look at me.

410
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:57,825
I love you too.

411
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,670
You do?

412
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,357
I mean, come on.

413
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:09,123
What about Debbie?

414
00:24:10,864 --> 00:24:14,249
I know but.. Miranda.

415
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,541
You're the one.

416
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:25,183
- We'll get the cake.
- We're getting the candle.

417
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:26,515
Hello. Where is cake?

418
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:29,474
Will you look at the candle that Steve brought?

419
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:37,665
Look at the candle.

420
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:51,077
Happy birthday to you.

421
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:55,572
Happy birthday dear Brady,

422
00:24:55,572 --> 00:24:59,424
happy birthday to you.

423
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:03,925
Make a wish Brady.

424
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:18,528
Did you make a wish?

425
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,660
Give me a kiss.

426
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:27,064
Three weeks later,
Miranda and Steve got their wish.

427
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:29,160
They were back together.

428
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:34,449
From a one year-old's birthday party

429
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,458
to a one a. m. dinner party.

430
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:40,760
Hi. I'm here to meet Alexander Patrovski.

431
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,316
Upstairs.

432
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,528
Good evening.

433
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,563
Don't you mean good morning?

434
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:12,461
You look lovely.

435
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,741
Oh. I'm just wearing my pajamas.

436
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,585
You know you're late. It's 1:03.

437
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:19,542
Sorry. I don't wear your watch.

438
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,472
How do you ever know your time?

439
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:23,797
I find that someone will always tell me.

440
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:26,928
1:03 did you say?

441
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:29,761
1:04.

442
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,316
Well. It's very red downstairs.

443
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:39,365
They said that it's what's expected of Russia.

444
00:26:41,562 --> 00:26:43,441
So. What's all this?

445
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:48,164
Potatoes. Little veal. Herring.

446
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:52,909
Beet salad. More red and veal in aspic.

447
00:26:54,168 --> 00:27:00,215
What exactly is aspic? Kind of a meet jell-o?

448
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:02,816
Try it. It's yummy.

449
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,758
Do you always eat this late at night?

450
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:07,913
I usually work all night. For me it's not late.

451
00:27:07,913 --> 00:27:09,551
You work all night painting?

452
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:11,386
Yeah. Sculpture whatever.

453
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:14,560
I have a bit of an art question.

454
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:18,464
- As you know Alexander.
- Alex-ander.

455
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:22,098
- Oh.
- Alex-ander.

456
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,560
Alexander.

457
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,543
Say Alec.

458
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,014
Alec.

459
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:30,657
Alexander.

460
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:32,450
Call me Bob.

461
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:43,440
So, I'm a writer.
I write a column for a newspaper.

462
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:47,049
Congratulations.

463
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,828
Drink?

464
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:59,222
What are you drinking?Water.

465
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:02,801
In that case, I'll have a vodka martini please.

466
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,318
Thank you.

467
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:07,610
Well Bob,

468
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,199
this is the latest I've been up in quite a while.

469
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,611
I even had to take a little disco nap.

470
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:13,989
Remember those?

471
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:19,094
My spies tell me you were quite
the regular at Studio54.

472
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,414
That must have been an amazing time.

473
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,844
Why don't you tell me about that?

474
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:31,682
What is there to remember?

475
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:35,211
Martha Graham's face, Andy Warhol's wig.

476
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,515
That's about it. I rarely think about the past.

477
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:43,358
What I care about is...
what will happen today, tonight.

478
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,944
What may happen tomorrow. Yes?

479
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,878
Yes.

480
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:01,651
I have something to show you and
I don't want you to freak out.

481
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,793
Oh man. Where'd it all go?

482
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:12,683
- I shaved.
- Bummer.

483
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:16,690
Look. I know you enjoy a full bush.

484
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:19,148
But there's something I should tell you.

485
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,989
There is one moment in every relationship

486
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:26,530
where you risk letting someone know the real you.

487
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:31,483
I'm a working woman and I don't have time
for you to be down there searching for it.

488
00:29:32,326 --> 00:29:37,188
So. I wanted to make everything nice and simple.

489
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:39,536
This was not that moment.

490
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,742
How long have you lived in New York?

491
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:44,791
Long time. Off and on. Paris, London.

492
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:48,542
The other places. I like New York. It's honest.

493
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,802
Honest?

494
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:52,126
There's no big smile on its face.

495
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:55,257
It's dark, painful. I like it.

496
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:58,230
Okay. You are way too Russian.

497
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,016
You get a girl out of bed to tell her you like pain?

498
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:06,293
It's two in the morning. Lighten up Bob.

499
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:10,269
Don't you know any jokes?

500
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,766
More meat?

501
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:18,841
Fruit and tea. We sweeten out tea
with black cherries. It's good.

502
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:21,711
Try it. You'll like it.

503
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:28,881
- Fruit?
- I'm not really a fruit person.

504
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:32,171
Take a banana. Put it in your purse for breakfast.

505
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,725
I insist.

506
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,238
Is that a banana in your purse

507
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:47,562
- or are you just very happy to see me?
- Oh god.

508
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:51,127
You asked for a joke.

509
00:30:55,012 --> 00:31:01,647
At exactly 3:01, we pulled up in front of the
gallery to see if Art was alive and awake.

510
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,702
Oh my purse. I left it in the cab.

511
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:10,427
Taxi! Hey!

512
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:15,304
Wait! Hold on! Wait a minute!

513
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:19,395
Hey! Ho! Ho! Okay!

514
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:22,062
- What'd you forget?
- Here we go.

515
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:44,140
Do you wanna give her a banana?

516
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:47,416
Shh.

517
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:56,012
Of all my odd dates, this was number one.

518
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:03,007
Taxi!

519
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,865
- Hi.
- Where you go? Where do you wanna go?

520
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,825
Oh. Where's he going?

521
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:30,143
I asked him to wait so..
we can have a proper good night.

522
00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:37,534
Oh. Well. Thanks for dinner.

523
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:41,640
You're welcome. I live right near here.

524
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:44,001
I thought you lived way downtown.

525
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,239
That is near.

526
00:32:48,823 --> 00:32:51,301
Well you can take the boy out of Studio54

527
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,822
but you can't take Studio54 out of the boy.

528
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:59,651
You are funny. Light.

529
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:04,828
So. Not tonight, huh?

530
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:29,268
And he tasted like black cherries.

531
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:41,130
