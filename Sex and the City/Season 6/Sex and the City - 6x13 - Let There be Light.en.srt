Season 6
Epi 13. the unbearable lightness of seeing

11
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:52,323
A single gal spends most of her
life searching for the perfect male.

12
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:08,026
And out of the blue, it arrives.

13
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:14,157
Aleksandr Petrovsky was a
rather famous artist with whom I had

14
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,666
one rather infamous date.

15
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,935
It's been three whole weeks.

16
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,906
I thought you died or something.

17
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:21,561
I did die from dejection.

18
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:25,411
How could you have left me
on the street all alone.

19
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,000
It still hurts.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,666
You'll get over it.

21
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,574
You're a big boy.

22
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:32,049
And where did you get this information?

23
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:37,059
- I was in Holland for work.
- Hmm, Holland??

24
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:38,997
Been there?

25
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:41,630
To the land of the wooden shoes, no.

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,432
No, no, no.

27
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:46,914
I brought you a little present.

28
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:48,163
Let's go.

29
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:55,091
Milk chocolate?

30
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:59,117
Or pehaps you like dark?
I've got right here.

31
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:03,251
You don't have a mouse trap in there, do you?

32
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:05,366
No, why would I?

33
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:07,786
I was being silly.

34
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:11,330
You know, in the cartoons, when they
put their hands and the thing..

35
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:14,704
Ok.

36
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:20,674
Et voila.

37
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,422
Light or dark?

38
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:39,939
Second only to the
search of the perfect male,

39
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,256
is the search for the perfect fragrance.

40
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,809
Am I peppermint musk?

41
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,455
Oh, no.

42
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:49,424
Ladies, I'm taking a lover.

43
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:53,751
Yes, a lover. Aleksandr Petrovsky.

44
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,359
Wait, the only guy?

45
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,872
I beg your pardon.

46
00:02:57,872 --> 00:03:00,625
My lover is not old.

47
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,264
He is worldly and wise and very sexy.

48
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:05,558
He is sexy.

49
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:06,577
Very.

50
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:10,347
Yesterday I almost did it with him on
a park bench in front of children.

51
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,472
What stopped you?

52
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:12,808
Common decency.

53
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:13,534
Oh that.

54
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:16,298
Well, that and the fact that I'm not
lover ready.

55
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:18,171
I need a little bikini waxage.

56
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,897
Well, then snap to it.

57
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:22,310
Don't play hard to get with a man
who's hard to get.

58
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,225
Maybe cucumber basil.

59
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:26,025
Why would you wanna smell
like a salad?

60
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,277
I can't decide what I am.

61
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:29,158
What do mean not old?

62
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,021
Charlotte e-mailed me his photo.

63
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,830
Hello, sixty.

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,276
He is in his lover perfect, early fifties.

65
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,542
That's a good age.

66
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,806
They've been around the block, they know
how to use their cock.

67
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:40,855
Oh, you rhyme now.

68
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,242
And where did you get his picture?

69
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:43,236
I googled him.

70
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,656
I wanted Miranda to see your potential new boyfriend.

71
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:47,694
Not boyfriend, lover.

72
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,585
How long are you going to keep saying
in like that?

73
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:52,637
Uncomfortable with my taking a lover?

74
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:56,051
Maybe he cold be more than a lover.

75
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:59,953
Ah, no, the only place this is going is Loverville.

76
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:01,470
Well, I could see it going somewhere.

77
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,666
Oh, please, half the time, I can't even
understand him.

78
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,793
We have nothing in common.

79
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:08,001
He's in and out of Europe.

80
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:10,170
- That could be good.
- Honey, you're not listeing.

81
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,879
She only wants him to be in and out of her.

82
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,354
Yes, but in a much less obvious sounding way.

83
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,059
How about? petuli?

84
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,798
No, you need something classic, clean.

85
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:24,658
But just a hint of neurosis.

86
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,152
How about you?

87
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,280
Are you finding anything?

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,458
I don't know.

89
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,619
I'm trying to figure out what Steve might like.

90
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,942
Just get some old spice and call it a day.

91
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,958
Steve does not wear old spice.

92
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,455
He wears nothing and he smells great.

93
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:46,355
Oh, Miranda and Steve sitting in a tree
K.I.S.S.I.N.G, first comes..

94
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,881
Well, actually first comes baby.

95
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,411
Oh great.

96
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:53,935
Now I have to spend the rest of the day smelling like..

97
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:57,099
- Apples and hay.
- You bastard.

98
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,201
Ok, let's go.

99
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,455
Aren't you going to get something for your new lover?

100
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:03,378
I suspect he already likes the way I smell.

101
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,484
Hey.

102
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:13,367
How lucky are we?

103
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:14,924
Very.

104
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:17,402
If Miranda and Steve had a fragrance,

105
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,976
it would be called Perfection.

106
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:32,026
If Miranda, Steve, and Robert, her ex and neighbor

107
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,463
had a fragrance, it wold be called Less Than Perfection.

108
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:39,054
In fact, Awful, Uncomfortable, and Terrible.

109
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,647
Hi.

110
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:43,409
Well, if it isn't the happy couple.

111
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,137
How are you today.

112
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,838
Y'all have a nice day.

113
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:06,127
So the doctor said that Harry and I
have to wait at least two months before

114
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:07,649
we even get try to get pregnant again.

115
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,231
And I like to back to work, but then if I do
get pregnant, that's not really fair to the new

116
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:12,905
employer, so I..

117
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,968
I'm sleeping and walking,

118
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,399
sleeping and walking, how am I doing that?

119
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,348
That's rude.
This is important to me.

120
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:21,143
I know it's important to you,
you know it's important to you,

121
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:24,469
the homeless guy on the corner of 57th
and 7th knows it's important to you.

122
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,270
Could we please talk about something else?

123
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:30,247
I'll give a hundred dollars if you say something
bitchy about someone we know.

124
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:31,858
No.

125
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,759
I'm trying to figure out my next direction
and I need to talk about it.

126
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,964
Fine, Talk to my ears bleed.

127
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,683
But do yourself a favor and stop for a minute
and look at the light.

128
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:45,616
You mean the fact that no matter what happens
with the baby, Harry and I will always have each other?

129
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:49,136
No, Char, the frigging light over there in the park.

130
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,212
When did it become fall?

131
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,057
Somewhere between your ovaries and my boredom.

132
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,228
Imagine.

133
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:03,423
Being blind, not being able to see
a beautiful day like today.

134
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,142
Can you think of anything worse?

135
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:08,334
Stone washed jeans with a matching jacket.

136
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,976
Maybe I should stop thnking so much about
myself and volunteer for the blind or something.

137
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,135
That would be a nice thing to do.

138
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,513
Very Jacky-O

139
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,174
Ok, let me begin.

140
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,149
Can I ask you a question?

141
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,055
Yes, it will hurt a little.

142
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,470
No, that's not the question.

143
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,756
Are you Russian?

144
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,073
Yes.

145
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,053
See.
Hurt a little.

146
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:38,432
Yes, I was wondering
how do you say hello in Russian?

147
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:41,305
- Zdravstvuite.
- Zdravstvuite.

148
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:47,692
And uh, how do you say thank you?

149
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:52,141
- Spasibo.
- Spasibo.

150
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:54,080
You're welcome.

151
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,002
The only thing more uncomfortable than a bikini wax,

152
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,034
is an elevator ride with an ex.

153
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:03,299
Luckily, Miranda had figured out a way to avoid that.

154
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:06,101
Unfortunately, Robert had also.

155
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,160
Robert, hi.

156
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:12,222
Ok, I guess I deserve that.

157
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,875
Robert.

158
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,315
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:16,845
I've never meant to hurt you.

160
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,899
Steve and I just fell back in love.

161
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,068
Oh.

162
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:23,452
And so what was I to you?
A little half time show?

163
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,710
What?

164
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,555
Not at all.

165
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:28,067
I never thought that Steve and I would

166
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:31,221
get back together, or I never would have
started up with you.

167
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,340
I hope you understand that.

168
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,502
Well, I'll try.

169
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:38,358
And I hope you understand when you get my bill.

170
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,688
- Your bill?
- Yeah, my bill.

171
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,113
For services rendered.

172
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:43,921
You know, my stud fee.

173
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:45,225
Robert, come on.

174
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,907
No, no, no, no.
Hey, It's cool.

175
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:48,806
I got your singing.

176
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,605
You're a busy working mother,
too tired to go out and eat,

177
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,574
Hoonen Kitchen, too tired to go out and fuck,
call Robert.

178
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:56,690
- That's not true.
- Sure it is.

179
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,625
- Fastfood, Fast fuck.
- You were not a fast fuck.

180
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,230
No, you're right, I wasn't.

181
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,474
I was slow.
Nice and slow.

182
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:06,054
Just the way you liked it.

183
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:10,953
Ooh, Robert, ooh, yes.

184
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,578
Robert, oh god.

185
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,922
Robert, ooh.

186
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,293
No man has ever been in this deep.

187
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,219
Hey, what are doing back?

188
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,036
I gave Robert custody of the elevator.

189
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:28,984
What?

190
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,865
We're moving my stuff in here next week
and you gave him the elevator?

191
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:33,598
You're lucky I didn't give him Brady.

192
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:35,749
I bumped into him on the stairs.

193
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:36,655
How bad was it?

194
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,066
Hug me.

195
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,574
Oh, it's that bad, huh?

196
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,750
So we can't ever use the elevator?

197
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,818
Not between 8 a. m. and 10 p. m.

198
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:50,429
- We have a baby in a stroller.
- I know.

199
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,574
Why, why, why did I have to shit where I eat?

200
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,690
Look, he's just upset, it'll blow over.

201
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,487
I don't think so, Steve.

202
00:09:57,487 --> 00:10:00,879
The man is crazy in love with me and
now he's acting out, talking about how

203
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,062
I said no man's ever been in me that deep.

204
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:06,130
What?

205
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:08,341
Nothing.

206
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,454
Steve.

207
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,283
Nothing. Fine.

208
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,121
Wednesday night, after dinner,

209
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:19,345
I took the express elevator to Loverville.

210
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,541
Spasibo.

211
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,582
Oh, you speak Russian very well.

212
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:24,920
Spasibo.

213
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,643
Is that the only word you know?

214
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:28,222
Zdravstvuite.

215
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,803
Yes, but is that the only word you know?

216
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:38,186
There is my studio, and here's my house.

217
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,967
You have the entire floor?

218
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,932
Not at first, but over the years.

219
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,174
- Spasibo.
- Zdravstvuite.

220
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:11,366
This used to be some kind of sewing
factory, sweat shop in 1920s.

221
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,535
That's a lovely story.

222
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,651
Very nice, if you like that whole window sky thing.

223
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,745
Yes, it's lovely light in the morning.

224
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:38,330
Study and kitchen

225
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,039
Would you like some fruit or martini
or something?

226
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,423
Why don't you show me upstairs?

227
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,968
My Russian may have been shaky,

228
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:16,659
but I discovered I spoke lover very well.

229
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:40,306
Turns out, I'd found a sweet bed
and breafast in Loverville.

230
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,818
Good morning.

231
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,907
Um, where?

232
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,599
Morning.
Come, come, sit.

233
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:06,055
In the light of day,
everything looked completely different.

234
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,823
Would you like some coffee?

235
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,222
What kind?

236
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,951
Um, Regular.

237
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:16,433
Regular coffee is for regular people.

238
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:19,023
You are not regular.

239
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:23,570
I hope I'm not in the way.

240
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,520
What, what?

241
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:30,656
No, no. It's Violet, Admar, Lee.

242
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:34,167
Hey, everybody, this is Carrie.

243
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:36,771
It's my staff.

244
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:38,873
I saw(?) them out sitting in the street with the sign

245
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:40,932
I'll do art for food.

246
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,881
Speaking of food,

247
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,388
pancakes for the lady.

248
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:49,278
You're hungry.

249
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,580
But you, Aren't you gonna eat?

250
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,475
No, I'm done.

251
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,938
I'm off to Amsterdam remember?

252
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:58,179
Oh, yeah. Right.

253
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:02,761
Maybe before I leave, I'll have one more little bite.

254
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:07,174
La voiture ne va pas attendre pour toujours.

255
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:08,937
Oui, oui, je pars toute de suite.

256
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:11,526
Passeport, portefeuille, bien.

257
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:17,577
Maintenant, sois poli avec M. Groge.

258
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:20,401
There I was having pancakes at eyehop(?),

259
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,647
the international house of Petrovsky's.

260
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:27,491
And they just went on about their business
totally unfazed.

261
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,767
Oh, honey, they've seen it all.

262
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,213
And you gotta give it to him,

263
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,135
making pancakes for pussy.

264
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:34,906
That's a classic touch.

265
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,815
What?

266
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:39,109
You don't think you're the first babe
he buttered up for.

267
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:41,392
No, no, no, you're right.

268
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:41,955
You're right.

269
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,493
thewhole thing was so choreographed.

270
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,840
No, he knew exactly what he was doing.

271
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,098
Sounds good to me.

272
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:50,360
I miss a man with the moves.

273
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,475
So Smith no moves.

274
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,970
No, he has them, most of them I've given him,
but he has them.

275
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,879
Truth time.

276
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,036
I'm a little jealous.

277
00:14:58,036 --> 00:14:58,689
Of what?

278
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,893
My grand slam breakfast?

279
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:02,754
You've got yourself a man,
a real powerplayer.

280
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:05,575
Someone who takes charge, drags you to the bed,

281
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,885
has his way with you, doesn't have to ask what you want,

282
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:09,255
and fucks you and fucks you.

283
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,505
We're not talking about me anymore, are we?

284
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:15,847
No, I mean, Smith, he's hot but he's a baby.

285
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,279
He's almost thirty.

286
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,160
Still, I swear sometimes I don't know whether to
blow him or burp him.

287
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,691
I need a grown-up.

288
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:25,547
So, uh, how were they?

289
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:26,603
The pancakes?

290
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:28,780
Delicious, exactly what I wanted,
I couldn't get enough.

291
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,145
No, I was referring to the moves.

292
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:34,130
Oh, delicious, exactly what I wanted,
I couldn't get enough.

293
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,201
Good for you.

294
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:40,049
So, how many pancakes do you think
that kitchen has seen?

295
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,469
Does it matter?

296
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:43,899
In the cold, harsh reality of daylight,

297
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,666
I knew it didn't matter.

298
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,402
But in the colder, harsher reality of a woman

299
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:53,081
who just slept with someone he likes, it did.

300
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,267
Google dot com showed many many listings

301
00:15:56,267 --> 00:16:00,974
on the art of Aleksandr Petrovsky, and one

302
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:03,644
on his many many women.

303
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:16,575
According to certain scientists, whenever a woman

304
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,437
has sex, her body produces a chemical which

305
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,320
causes her to emotionally attach.

306
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,417
This chemical may also account for the series of

307
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,375
terrifying questions that involuntarily pop into

308
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,191
our minds after just one casual tryst.

309
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:36,748
Questions like does he like me, will he call again,

310
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:40,626
and the classic, where is this all going?

311
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,590
When it comes to the men, even when we try to

312
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,128
keep it light, how do we wind up in the dark?

313
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:57,084
Hey, I've got this invite to a party
Teen Posse's throwing.

314
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:58,940
Top thirty under thirty.

315
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,017
- I'm one of them.
- Hah.

316
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,211
You wanna go?

317
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:06,040
Teen Posse and me, no.
And no.

318
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,008
Well, my agent and my manager
really want me to go.

319
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,911
At least look at the invite and tell me
how lame it is.

320
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:16,185
The party may have been all wrong
but it was being hosted by Richard Wright.

321
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,053
What?

322
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,071
Lame ass?

323
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,881
No, not so lame ass.

324
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:25,097
Richard Wright is a big name in
the hotel business.

325
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:28,518
He brings a certain something.

326
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:31,996
And it was exactly the certain something
that Samantha was missing.

327
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:33,952
You should go.

328
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,269
In fact, I'll go with you.

329
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,451
What the hell.

330
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:38,591
Cool.

331
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:48,010
And I'm not relly allowed to try and pregnant
again for another two months.

332
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,991
So you said.

333
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:52,168
And I thought I have all this time
on my hands to volunteer.

334
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:57,225
Ok, working as a guide for visually impaired person
is a serious undertaking.

335
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:01,730
We suggest allour potential volunteers go to
a public place like a park or a department store

336
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,368
with a friend and let him or her lead
your around blindfolded.

337
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,448
Blindfolded?

338
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:09,847
Yeah, try not to take the blindfold off
no matter how uncomfortable you feel

339
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:15,485
and you'll begin to get a sense of what it's
like not to be able to rely on your sight.

340
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,355
Ok, bye.

341
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:21,521
I mean where can this possibly go?

342
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:22,900
I thought you didn't want it to go anywhere.

343
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,637
Well, that was before I slept with him,
now, not so sure.

344
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,571
Interesting.

345
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:30,493
No, ridiculous, and according to my new best
friend google dot com,..

346
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,595
You googles him.

347
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:37,906
The man has dated every woman in New York
from 1977 until, well, until last Wednesday.

348
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:41,828
And who knows how many pancakes he's making
for other ridiculous women around the world.

349
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:45,575
Oh god, listen to me, and I've only slept with
him once.

350
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,629
Ok, let's get blind.

351
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,573
So once I put this over my eyes, I can't take it off.

352
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:52,226
I need you to guide me.

353
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:53,702
I'm there.

354
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:55,271
This is embarrassing.

355
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,707
No, thinking you can take a lover is embarrassing.

356
00:18:57,707 --> 00:18:59,798
This is halping people.

357
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,112
How's my hair?

358
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:10,446
Oh, that's European code, it's him.

359
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:11,582
Should I answer it?

360
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:12,921
Ok.

361
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:14,558
Hello

362
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:15,785
Carrie, it's Aleks.

363
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:18,985
Hi. How's Amsterdam.

364
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:20,892
What?

365
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,636
I can, I can't hear you.

366
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:23,951
Oh you know what, I need better reception.

367
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:24,621
I'm gonna go right over there.

368
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,921
Don't go away.

369
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,509
Ok.

370
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:28,677
Hi.

371
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:31,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:36,658
Tomorrow night?

373
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,143
Yes.

374
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:40,672
What?

375
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:43,729
- The reception is very bad.
- Bad reception, yes.

376
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,649
- Tomorrow, are you free?
- Yes, I'm free.

377
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,586
- Sorry I can't hear you.
- I'm free.

378
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:53,281
- Ok, tomorrow at 9.
- Yes, I will be there.

379
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:56,611
- Carrie, Carrie?
- Hello?

380
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,926
Sweetie?

381
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:09,722
Would like the sample in the air?

382
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:14,546
- Do you need some assisstance?
- No, thank you.

383
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,042
I'm trying to help the blind.

384
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:19,023
I just got separated from my friend,
but I'm sure she'll find me.

385
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:23,174
- Lumiere?
- Oh, no, bad, bad.

386
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,468
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sorry.

387
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,532
And there in the dark, Charlotte realized

388
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:37,059
she had no idea where she was going in

389
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:39,289
Barney's or in real life.

390
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,211
but sometimes, even if you're not sure of your

391
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:46,140
direction, you can find your way
to something wonderful.

392
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,202
Don't they have these over there in the..

393
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:55,207
I swear I looked and looked and then I thought
best if she finds me.

394
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,027
I'm eating them tomorrow, cute, huh?

395
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,104
Oh yeah.

396
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,149
Ok, ok.

397
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:07,020
Let's just go in front of the line, like I suggested.

398
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,604
I don't like pushing in front of people.

399
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:10,472
Oh, grow up.

400
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,051
Smith Jerrod, we're on the list.

401
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:18,153
Oh my god, owesome.

402
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,691
Love your hair.

403
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,444
Let me just check you off.

404
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:23,918
And you are?

405
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,699
Samantha Jones.

406
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,466
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

407
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,773
Um, dude.

408
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,520
He's with me.

409
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,522
- Oh, I'm sorry, Richard Wright.
- Smith Jerrod.

410
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:46,555
Let's get some drinks, shall we?

411
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:54,816
So, how long have you been babysitting?

412
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,150
Said the man who's hosting a Teen Posse party.

413
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,028
Don't rub it in.

414
00:21:58,028 --> 00:21:59,497
The hotels have to stay hip.

415
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:01,347
So I have to bend over backwards.

416
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:03,501
? of these trendy little pissass.

417
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,870
Well, you look good.

418
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,100
That's 'cause I'm looking at you, gorgeous.

419
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,394
Two more scotch rocks.

420
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:14,417
What's up?

421
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,669
Can I get you a scotch?

422
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,349
No thank, man, I'm an AA.

423
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:19,797
You kids today.

424
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,747
So how do you two know each other?

425
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:24,443
We used to go out.

426
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,516
And then I fucked it up royally
and lost the best thing I ever had.

427
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:30,099
Oh my god, Smith, you have to come.

428
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,565
Paulie is snorting pretzel out of his nose.

429
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:34,848
- You have to come.
- It's fucking hilarious.

430
00:22:34,848 --> 00:22:38,068
- Come on.
- Paulie. do it again.

431
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:41,072
Paulie is snorting pretzels out his nose.

432
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,802
Fuck you.

433
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:50,058
Okay, this is the last load.

434
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:52,459
For a guy with no stuff, you've got stuff.

435
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:54,673
Let's get the TV first.

436
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,821
What the fuck?

437
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,943
That wasn't like that when we moved it in here.

438
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:02,798
Oh my god.

439
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,822
- Robert.
- What?

440
00:23:04,822 --> 00:23:06,235
Nah, you think?

441
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:09,854
Um hello, he's mad, your name is on the boxes,

442
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:11,157
he lives in the building.

443
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:14,796
Nah, it doesn't seem like him, I musta
bumped it or something.

444
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:18,199
Steve, he's crazy in love with me.

445
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,651
You didn't see how angry he was on the stairs.

446
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,278
Ok, this is bullshit.

447
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,173
I'm not gonna live like this.

448
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,619
What are you gonna do?

449
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,152
I'm gonna take care of things.

450
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:28,589
Be kind.

451
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,533
He's still in love with me.

452
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,662
Steve?

453
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:45,858
Look, I need to talk to you
about this whole Miranda thing.

454
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,296
What about her?

455
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,138
I'll be right back, baby.

456
00:23:56,827 --> 00:24:00,678
Turns out Petrovsky wasn't the only one
with the international house.

457
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,798
We're sorry.

458
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:06,429
She's sorry.

459
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,014
I'm sorry.

460
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,866
We're sorry.

461
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,023
I appreciate that.

462
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,107
What happened?

463
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:26,933
Let's just put it this way.

464
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,100
He won't be bothering us again.

465
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,412
Was he very upset?

466
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,915
When it came to Robert,

467
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:44,055
Steve thought it was kinder
to leave Miranda in the dark.

468
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:14,934
Samantha.

469
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:20,270
Hey, where are you going, babe?

470
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,750
Richard wanted to show me one of his
remodelled suites.

471
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,045
Cool, can I come?

472
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:28,583
No.

473
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,997
No, Smith, you can't come.

474
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:34,829
Look, this was fun, but where is it going?

475
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:36,420
Gorgeous?

476
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:44,254
You go play with your friends
and I'll go play woth mine.

477
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:52,024
Samantha.

478
00:25:57,553 --> 00:26:00,928
Two years ago, I was on top of the fucking world.

479
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:05,466
I almost took bullshit beer basher
bunch of kids with six pack abs.(?)

480
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,923
This is a world class hotel.

481
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:11,366
Fuck it. I've down this road before.

482
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:16,288
Richard may have,
but Samantha haven't.

483
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:37,105
I just wanted to make sure you got
home safe.

484
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:42,438
I don't know what's wrong with me.

485
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:46,150
I hate myself for doing this to you.

486
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,665
Oh god.

487
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:53,789
It's ok, it's okay.

488
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:00,468
Come on.

489
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,487
Let's get you out of here.

490
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:06,184
Even in the dark, Smith could still see Samantha.

491
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:10,747
And for the very first time, she saw him.

492
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,413
I have some work to do in my studio,

493
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,893
but you're welcome to stay, ok?

494
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:29,600
It was at that moment I realized
I wasn't really comfortable in Loverville.

495
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:34,749
I'm not that kind of google.

496
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:24,298
Why?

497
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:25,746
I just wanted to say thank you.

498
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,860
I'm gonna go.

499
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,401
Ok, then I'll call you tomorrow, all right?

500
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:33,065
Um.

501
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:40,538
This has been really lovely
but I don't think I'm cut out for it.

502
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,205
I don't understand.

503
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:52,528
The pancakes and the other ladies,

504
00:28:52,528 --> 00:28:54,476
it's just not for me.

505
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:58,712
There are pancakes but no other ladies.

506
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:07,847
Well, I have a book with a few emergency
telephone numbers, yes.

507
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,731
But now I just see you.

508
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:18,749
This is not about great bang, this..

509
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:25,042
I just like you.

510
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:29,578
Why me?

511
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:35,943
Why me?

512
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,896
You make a good breakfast.

513
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,295
So what's all this?

514
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:51,347
It's too soon to tell.

515
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:54,809
