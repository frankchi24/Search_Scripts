00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,280
In every relationship, there comes a time
when you take that next important step.

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,160
- Do I look all right?
- Don't worry, they'll love you.

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,480
- I just want to make the right impression.
- They'll love you because I love you.

5
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,960
Here we are.

6
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,080
For some couples,
that step is meeting the parents.

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,880
For me, it's meeting the Prada.

8
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,600
Holy shit.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,760
You know, on my planet,
the clothing stores have clothes.

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,000
Ladies.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,720
So how often do you shop here?

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,040
- Carrie.
- Hi.

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm gonna guess more than once.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,960
If all my customers were this beautiful, yes?

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
- This is my boyfriend, Jack Berger.
- How are you?

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,200
Okay, two. Bonus round. I'm down with that.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
- He's funny, yes?
- Yes.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,480
And this is his first time at Prada.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,600
- We have some amazing new things for men.
- I'm here for my amazing new girlfriend.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,120
Can I get you something to drink?
Cappuccino, bottled water, champagne?

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,840
- Champagne?
- Yes.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,800
Some couples spend
Saturday afternoon shopping.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
Look, everybody, it's Carrie.

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,960
Other couples spend it sexing.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
- Aren't you gonna shower?
- Nope.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
I want to smell you on me all night.

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
Dirty boy.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,600
So how's Friday at 9:00?

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,320
I can't do Friday.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,720
But we always do Friday, it's T.G.I. Fuckday.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,880
- My play starts previews this week.
- Play?

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,960
I was thinking you could come check it out.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,400
It's a kick-ass play.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,880
"Kick-ass play. "
Three words I hope never to hear again.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,120
- Come on.
- It's in Brooklyn. I don't do borough.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Don't give me that look.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm the one who should be hurt.
You always spend Fridays in me.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,240
Okay, here's the deal.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,880
You come see me in Brooklyn...

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
and afterwards, I'll make sure you come...

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
and come and come in the bedroom.

42
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,760
- What do you think?
- Two things.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
One, you look damn fine.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,240
Two, I'm a little hammered.

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,000
Here, for you. Try.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Now, that is fabulous.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,400
You know, I never say fabulous,
but if I did, I would.

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,120
That's what a real shirt looks like.

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,120
- But you will wear forever.
- Yeah, I'd have to.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,480
Does it also somehow open
into a small studio apartment?

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
Carrie, tell him.

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,080
My girlfriend used to talk me into things,
and I'm a better man for it.

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,400
This is our first shopping trip together.
I want to take it slow.

54
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
So how is Claudia?

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,640
We broke up.

56
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,480
Yes, is tragic.

57
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,400
Only thing more tragic is Jack Berger
not having Prada.

58
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,720
What can I say, except thanks for the hooch.

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,280
Carrie, do you know any fantastic
gorgeous single women like yourself...

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,920
I could go out with?

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,920
Cheer up, sweetie.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
I may have found you
the impossible dreamboat.

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,760
Straight, single, and works for Prada.

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,000
- Is he Jewish?
- What?

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Did you think I would throw away
all my new religious beliefs...

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,920
just because Harry
and I are no longer together?

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- Yeah.
- I am not a fair-weather Jew.

68
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,840
Besides, I can't even think
about dating again.

69
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm way too sad about losing Harry.

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,160
Now, Charlotte, honey.
You will start dating eventually...

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,920
and by then
this Prada item may be off the rack.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
If she's not ready to move on,
she's not ready to move on.

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
People can't move on before they're ready.

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
I'm just saying.

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,840
I can't even imagine dating again.
I mean, what would I say about myself?

76
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,840
"I was married and then I got divorced...

77
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,560
"then I fell in love with my divorce lawyer
and we were gonna get married...

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,360
"but then I blew it and we split up, too. "

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
It's depressing.

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,760
Now you went and told the truth.

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
What are we gonna do about it?

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,560
I say we get all dressed up
and go out for drinks Friday night.

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,200
I'll wear my new Prada.

84
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,560
- I'm in.
- Excellent.

85
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
Shit, motherfucker fuck shit.

86
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,640
There's a
"Shit, motherfucker fuck shit" situation?

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,760
- I have to go to the theatre.
- They finally made that mandatory?

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,000
A new play in Brooklyn. Jerry's in it.

89
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,880
- So it's children's theatre?
- I think that's sweet.

90
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,040
It's not sweet, it's pathetic
how far a gal will go for a good fuck.

91
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,040
And speaking of the theatre, that night...

92
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,200
Miranda continued performing
her one-woman show...

93
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
I'm Not In Love With Steve.

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
How was life on the playground?

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
The little bratty girl had a birthday.

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,040
Bratty had a birthday?

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
Yep, here.

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,280
I scammed you a cupcake. It's chocolate.
I had to fight for it.

99
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
For me? Thanks.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm getting a gut from all the cupcake action
on that playground.

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
You don't have a gut.

102
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Okay, so I gotta run.
I wanna get home to see the Knicks game.

103
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,480
Why don't you watch it here?

104
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,040
I pay for ESPN and all,
and I've got all this extra food and all.

105
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
Unless you have plans with someone,
in which case...

106
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Debbie's got shit to do.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,880
I wouldn't be crowding you?

108
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,760
For the guy who scammed me
the chocolate cupcake.

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Cool.

110
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,960
The Knicks overtime
turned into Steve's overnighter.

111
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,040
All right, now I have to call somebody.
You have a Prada abuse problem.

112
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,480
I do, do I? Here.

113
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,720
For you.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
It's the "I never say fabulous"
fabulous shirt.

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,600
Carrie, thanks, but you can't afford this.

116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,920
You can't afford
that stuff you bought yourself.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,680
Last week I couldn't, but voilà.

118
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,800
It's a check from our publishers.
They sold my book in Paris.

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
It's an advance from France.

120
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
That's quite an advance.

121
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,640
I know, I can't believe it.
Half off at home, big deal in France.

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,320
I'm the literary Jerry Lewis.

123
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,360
So, you see, you have to have
the "I never say fabulous" fabulous shirt...

124
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,000
because you are the most fabulous...

125
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,640
of all the fabulous men
who never say "fabulous. "

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,720
Okay, thank you.

127
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm starving. What looks good?

128
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,920
The next day I met Miranda
and little lord Brady...

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,480
for an early evening walk.

130
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,920
If I get tired in about a block,
can you push me around in that?

131
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,080
Sure.

132
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
Steve slept over the other night.

133
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,880
On the couch.

134
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,400
We were watching the Knicks game
and it got late.

135
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,520
Someone's gonna get hurt.

136
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,520
Carrie, I can't help it.
It was the most fun I've had in a long time.

137
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,560
- I like being around him.
- Then tell him that, I beg of you.

138
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,560
- He has a girlfriend, did you forget?
- No, did you?

139
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,880
- No.
- He probably already knows how you feel.

140
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,520
No way, I'm acting my ass off.

141
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,520
There is no Academy Award for that,
just so you know.

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,240
My God, Courtney. Hi.

143
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,000
- Carrie Bradshaw, the toast of Europe.
- Hardly.

144
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,480
Miranda, this is Courtney, my publisher.

145
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,120
Ex-publisher. I just got the boot.
Hence the gin.

146
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,880
I'm gonna go home
and make myself a welfare martini.

147
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,520
Wait. Why?

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,520
"Disappointing sales in my sector. "

149
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,840
- I'm sorry.
- "Fuck them. "

150
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,360
If it weren't for the European interest
in your book...

151
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,160
I'd have gotten the boot a week ago
when they started dropping all my authors.

152
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,480
How's Berger handling it?
He's so frigging talented. I can't stand it.

153
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
They should've never dropped
his second book option.

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,440
Shortsighted A-holes.
You tell him to get the phone book out...

155
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,280
and give me a call
if he needs a drinking buddy.

156
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Cute kid. See you.

157
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,920
Berger never said anything to me.

158
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,640
My God.

159
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,680
And I'm running around buying him shirts
and shoving my big check in his face.

160
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,920
- You didn't know.
- God, I feel awful.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,680
Why did I have to parade in
and brag about that check?

162
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,920
Because you're proud of it.
And you earned it.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,320
- It's okay to be proud of it.
- This is not good.

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
So what now? Should I tell him I know?

165
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,120
Maybe you should wait till he brings it up.

166
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Move over, Brady, I'm getting tired.

167
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
And in Central Park...

168
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,120
Not him. Gay.

169
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,120
Gay and doesn't know it.

170
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,880
Here. Pale with no arms,
straight, and Jewish.

171
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Please, Harry and I just broke up.

172
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,440
Char, you loved Harry, I loved Harry.

173
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,960
We all loved Harry.
But it's been two weeks. Next.

174
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,800
No next. It doesn't work like that.

175
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,040
It do, and it better, because you are knock,
knock, knocking on sad-gal door.

176
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,160
And nobody loves a sad gal.

177
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,720
You don't understand what this feels like.

178
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,560
You've never...

179
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,560
- Never mind.
- What? I've never what?

180
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,760
Lost the love of my life? Wrong.

181
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Paolo. Brazilian. Broke my heart.

182
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,640
- I've never gotten over him.
- Anthony.

183
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,280
Had an ass
like two scoops of butter pecan ice cream.

184
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,440
Him. I could see you with him.

185
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,480
- I'm not interested.
- You better get interested...

186
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,960
or you're gonna end up all alone
and with no mans.

187
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
Maybe I am.

188
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,240
Would that be the worst thing
that could happen?

189
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Nice day to get laid.

190
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
The corn.

191
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,480
Harvested.

192
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,520
The hay.

193
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,920
Harvested.

194
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
My youth?

195
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,600
Samantha wondered
if perhaps she'd judged the arts too quickly.

196
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
So was it worth the trip?

197
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm not usually a fan of the theater,
but get your cock out.

198
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,960
- Did you like the play?
- I felt like I was hit with a tranquilizer dart.

199
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,160
- Did you at least like my monologue?
- What monologue?

200
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,480
After you dropped trou,
all I could think was...

201
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,400
I got to get me some of that.

202
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
This.

203
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,920
I hope the critics like it more than you.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,280
I quit my restaurant job today.

205
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,600
They wouldn't let me off to do the play.

206
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,120
- So fuck them. Maybe it'll be a big hit.
- How?

207
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,440
The promotion of this thing
is all out of whack.

208
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,840
You have this pathetic, sad little flyer...

209
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,440
and nowhere on it does it say
the most important thing about the play.

210
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,000
- What's that?
- Full frontal, you, naked.

211
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,560
Now, that's a reason to go to the theater.

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
- Who's doing the P.R.?
- No one.

213
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,400
They don't have money
for that kind of thing.

214
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,640
We're getting paid, like, $30.

215
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,680
Is this really what you want to do
with your life?

216
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,880
Stand in an empty theater
talking some harvest-to-harvest bullshit?

217
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,280
Yeah. I love it. I'm an actor.

218
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
Then I'm gonna help you.

219
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,760
You're gonna help me be an actor?

220
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,000
No, I'm gonna help you be a star.

221
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,720
Look, if I have to go see you act,
there better be a red carpet involved.

222
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,560
I don't need help.
All I gotta do is work on my craft.

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,800
All you have to do is work on your abs.

224
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,960
But we have to do something
about your name.

225
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,840
Jerry Jerrod. Awful.

226
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,840
- Stop talking.
- Whatever you say.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,160
Matt? Toby?

228
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
Ryan.

229
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,600
Is something wrong?

230
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,000
No, I'm just preoccupied.

231
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,360
Berger, it's okay. I know.

232
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,160
About the book option.

233
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,320
I bumped into Courtney a few days ago.

234
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,440
- Why didn't you say anything sooner?
- Because I didn't know if...

235
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,800
- Does anyone else know?
- Like who?

236
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,440
Any of your friends?

237
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
Miranda was with me, but she...

238
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,120
- I don't want her to know.
- She's fine, it's no big deal.

239
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,600
It is to me.

240
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,760
No, I meant to her.

241
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,880
Right.

242
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,080
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,560
What do you have to be sorry about?

244
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,480
The shirt and the check. I feel awful.
I would never...

245
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,960
This has nothing to do with that.

246
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,040
I think that check is great.

247
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,120
Don't feel bad about that. You earned that.

248
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,680
Good for you.

249
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,840
I'm proud of you.

250
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,800
Berger, do you want me
to talk to my new editor?

251
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,000
Jesus Christ. No, thank you.

252
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,160
It's just a dropped option.

253
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,800
I'll be fine.

254
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,800
Yes, you will be.

255
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,080
Because you're great.

256
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,560
He grunted. End of discussion.

257
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,560
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- Look, when men are failing...

258
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,720
- Berger is not failing.
- Fine, when men are flailing...

259
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,320
Okay, yes, there's a bit of a flail.

260
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,160
...they need strong women
to charge in there and help.

261
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,040
Like I did with Smith Jerrod.

262
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,800
- Who?
- Jerry. I changed his name.

263
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm helping him with his career...

264
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,800
and Smith is the perfect name
for the next big thing.

265
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,560
"Smith Jerrod, the next it boy, is so it...

266
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,520
"that the glitterati are migrating to Brooklyn
to see him act. "

267
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,120
Are the glitterati migrating to Brooklyn?

268
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,720
Yes, you are.
I got tickets for us all opening night.

269
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,360
Invite everyone fabulous you know,
and dress up.

270
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,640
I've got a whole red-carpet thing happening.

271
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,360
Why are you doing all this?

272
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
He's 28 and making $30 a week.

273
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,200
The poor guy was dying.
I could help, so I did.

274
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,640
And he isn't threatened
by you offering to help?

275
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,360
No, he's a whole different generation.

276
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,200
Younger guys aren't threatened
by strong women having power.

277
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,880
Is it a whole generation or just him?

278
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,160
As women's roles evolve and change,
we assume that men's do as well.

279
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,480
There are hundreds upon hundreds
of articles...

280
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,360
written about the new man.

281
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,560
But does this new man really exist?

282
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
Perhaps he's just the old man...

283
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
renamed and repackaged
by some clever P.R. Woman.

284
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Are the men of today less threatened
by a woman's power...

285
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,440
or are they just acting?

286
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,320
Hang on.

287
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,280
You're early.

288
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,960
- Am I?
- Yeah.

289
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
- You look nice.
- Do I?

290
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,160
Looks like it's someone else's turn
to make cupcakes.

291
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,320
That is so cute.

292
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,160
I never did it before,
but it can't be that hard, right?

293
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,000
- Do I look like the baking type?
- Right.

294
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,080
"Mix batter in a large bowl. "

295
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,840
Okay, here's a bowl.

296
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,840
Look at me, I'm baking.

297
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,880
Miranda, you don't have to do that.

298
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,120
Someone needs to help you,
and Brady really has no motor skills.

299
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,080
One condition: I get to lick the bowl.

300
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,600
Deal. I have the milk and eggs right here.

301
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,080
You really are gonna score points
on the playground this week.

302
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,200
It's not for the playground.
They're birthday cupcakes for Debbie.

303
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,560
Fun.

304
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,640
We're having a party,
and she said she didn't want a cake...

305
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
but she didn't say anything about cupcakes.

306
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,640
So how many cupcakes are we making?

307
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,400
H-A-P-P-Y-B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y-D-E-B-B-I-E.

308
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,560
- 20.
- 20. Great.

309
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,520
20 little Debbie cakes later...

310
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,360
- That's bad, right?
- Here, let me do it.

311
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Shit. It's 6:30.

312
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,000
I gotta go to work.

313
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Okay, let's just... I'll finish those later.

314
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,880
Just go. I'll do it.
You can't do letters anyway.

315
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,480
- Really, you sure?
- Go.

316
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,800
Thanks. Miranda, you're the best.

317
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,480
- Jello.
- I'm not going, I'm not up for it.

318
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,440
If I'm going to the theater,
you're going to the theater.

319
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,960
- I can't.
- Are you all right? What's wrong?

320
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm at Steve's, and he had to go to work...

321
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
and I got stuck helping him
make 20 cupcakes...

322
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,440
for his girlfriend's birthday.

323
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,560
- Why would he ask you do that?
- He didn't.

324
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,320
I thought they were for the playground,
and then it was too late to back out.

325
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,240
It's my own fault.
What did I think would happen?

326
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,080
He would see how great I make cupcakes
and be back in love with me?

327
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,280
Damn it! I fucked up Debbie's "B."

328
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,640
- Put down the icing.
- I have to finish.

329
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,160
Debbie cannot have your tears. No way.

330
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,680
If I don't finish,
Steve will know something's up.

331
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Miranda, you can't make those cupcakes
and live with yourself.

332
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Move away from the icing.

333
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,080
- What'll I tell Steve?
- Blame the baby.

334
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
That's what they're there for.

335
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
- I put it down.
- Good girl.

336
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,560
God, that's Berger in a cab.
I'm not dressed yet. Listen to me.

337
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,600
You get out of there,
you go home, and I'll call you later, okay?

338
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,920
- Okay. I love you. Bye-bye.
- Me too. Bye.

339
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,720
Surprise.

340
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,080
That's not a cab.

341
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,640
No, this'll be much more fun.

342
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,440
I haven't had her out on the open road
for a long time.

343
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm not really dressed very biker chick.

344
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,920
- Prada and all.
- It'll be fine, come on.

345
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,880
Not to be a total girl about it...

346
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,840
but I really can't have the helmet hair...

347
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
when there's a red carpet situation.

348
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,760
We haven't been out on this thing
the whole time we've been dating.

349
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,560
I really want to take the bike tonight.

350
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,320
Think about how much fun it's gonna be
going over the Brooklyn Bridge.

351
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
Come on, Carrie. For me?

352
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,720
All right, just don't go fast.

353
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
Good hat, huh?

354
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,400
There is a little-known relationship law.

355
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,200
When your man is down and out,
you have to get up and on.

356
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,480
I told you not to go fast.

357
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,520
It wasn't that fast.

358
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,560
It just feels fast because you're on the bike.

359
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
Bullshit.

360
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,160
Couldn't you feel my hands
digging into you?

361
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,720
- Yeah, I thought you were excited.
- I was terrified.

362
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,360
All right, calm down, you're safe.

363
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,960
I am not gonna die on a bridge...

364
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,000
so that you can feel like some big man
on a bike.

365
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,920
- What the fuck does that mean?
- You know exactly what it means.

366
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,880
And I am sorry,
but I'm not sorry I made that money.

367
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,920
I worked really hard for it,
and I never thought you would be...

368
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,640
the type of guy
that would have a problem with that.

369
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,520
Neither did I. But I guess I do, don't I?

370
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm sorry about the bike.

371
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Are you gonna look at me?

372
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,320
I didn't think I was going that fast.
I'm sorry, I'll never do it again.

373
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
Well, I'll never get on that bike again.

374
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,560
Look, I don't want to be this guy.

375
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,400
I don't want to be the guy threatened
by your success.

376
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,440
I swear to God, I will do anything,
I'll do whatever it takes.

377
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,600
I don't want to be this guy.

378
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,800
I think you are magnificent.

379
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,080
I do.

380
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,040
That was for the helmet.

381
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,800
Come on, let's get this over with.

382
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,800
Carrie, over here. Right here, Carrie.

383
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,680
They know you?

384
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
I used to be a party girl.

385
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,440
Can we get one alone?

386
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,280
- Yeah, sure.
- No, we're together.

387
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,840
- What's his name?
- Jack Berger. He's a writer, too.

388
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,080
Lovely, thanks a lot. Cheers.

389
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,360
They just do that
so that they can get it right for the papers.

390
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,200
This just isn't my night.

391
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,240
Look, I'm really not up to going in.

392
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,320
I'll just wreck it for everybody.
Would it be okay if I took off?

393
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,000
You can get home with the girls, right?

394
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,440
You okay?

395
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,040
"Hello, gorgeous. "

396
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,600
That is the worst Barbra Streisand
I have ever heard.

397
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,960
When in Brooklyn, do as the Brooklyns do.

398
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,760
Speaking of the worst,
I have, like, the worst seat I've ever had.

399
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,160
Not anymore you don't.
You're sitting with me.

400
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,800
And speaking of "one alone"...

401
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,080
Charlotte sat in the theater
surrounded by couples...

402
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,480
and in one, clear, crystallized moment...

403
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,760
she felt what her life would be like
with no mans.

404
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,880
Miranda's not coming.

405
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,560
So my friend Tony from Prada
is sitting next to you.

406
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,400
Hello.

407
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,040
After all, what single girl in New York
would turn down a gift from Prada?

408
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,800
All of Manhattan is here.

409
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,760
Who's watching the Island?

410
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,120
My youth?

411
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,040
The rain came down.

412
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,720
Hard, then soft.

413
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,080
It hit the grass.

414
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,800
Green, then wet.

415
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,560
Wet, so wet.

416
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,200
It reminded me of you.

417
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
You always smelled like the rain.

418
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,240
A stud is born.

419
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,000
That night Smith Jerrod's Full Moon
became a sensation.

420
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,520
- Full frontal, and he can act.
- Who knew?

421
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,000
- Where's Berger?
- He left.

422
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,160
He's coming down with a cold.

423
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,560
- I'll see you later.
- Okay. Good night.

424
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,680
- You want to come out with me?
- Sure.

425
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
Maybe we were all acting, all the time.

426
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,200
And tonight I was playing the part
of the woman in the great relationship...

427
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,280
whose boyfriend
was coming down with a cold.
