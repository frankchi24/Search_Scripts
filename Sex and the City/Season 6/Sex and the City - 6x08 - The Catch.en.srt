Epi 8. the catch

11
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,335
My career had reached new heights-literally

12
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:56,030
An editor at New York Magazine thought thatI would be the perfect person to write

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,476
about the ultimate challenge for swingers.

14
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,856
The flying trapeze.

15
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:02,002
Wouldn't you rather be at Jeffrey?

16
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:03,592
They're having a sale on stripes.

17
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:06,555
That's not supportive.

18
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,499
Step on up. Good. That's good.

19
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,802
Come around to my side.

20
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:18,448
I'm gonna take off your climbing limbs
and strap on your safety harness.

21
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:21,706
Yes. Please strap on anything that
would keep me from plummeting to my death.

22
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,087
Toes over the edge. Feet should-width apart.
Just a little bit more.

23
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:27,499
That's good. head up.

24
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,351
Now put your right hand out in front.

25
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,307
I've got you. Good.

26
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,113
Are you ready to grab the bar?

27
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:36,844
I'm ready to go to the bar.
Does everyone say that?

28
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:40,223
Pretty much. Okay.
Hold the bar in one hand.

29
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:43,452
You're queen of the world!

30
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:46,559
All right. That's good.

31
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,967
Keep your head up. Don't look down.

32
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:50,202
Are you ready?

33
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:51,857
And hup!

34
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,205
Swing it sister!

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,350
Two hours later, I was hooked.

36
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,320
Stanny, are you watching?
I'm about to try a catch.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,292
Maybe you should quit while you're a¡¦live.

38
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,756
You can totally do this.

39
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:16,099
Just listen to me and trust me. Hup!

40
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,529
All right. Legs up.

41
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:23,177
Take your hands off and reach for me.

42
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:26,507
This time you got it. Let go.

43
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:31,863
- Let go.
- No. No. No. No.

44
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,826
That day. I didn't get caught.

45
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:38,652
But Samantha's zipper did.

46
00:02:57,894 --> 00:03:00,546
This is one of the frustrating things about living alone.

47
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:03,678
There's not always somebody around to rip your clothes off.

48
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,556
Hey Smith. Wanna come over and do me?

49
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,441
What she meant was; undo me.

50
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,681
But two birds with one stone.

51
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,474
And in Central Park,

52
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:30,981
a photographer attempted to catch
two lovebirds sitting on a stone.

53
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,625
Honey, a little less teeth.
Just relax your lips.

54
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,939
No, now you're squinting!

55
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,436
A lesser man might have told Charlotte to take a flying leap.

56
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,471
But Harry loved her too much.

57
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,642
I thought the point was to look natural.

58
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,120
That's what I'm trying to get you to do.

59
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,908
Well, one might ask how natural is
it to be sitting in Central Park in a suit?

60
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,640
Honey. I read the wedding section religiously

61
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,473
and I know what they're looking for
and not all pictures are selected.

62
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,298
And I really, really want there to be
a York- Goldenblatt announcement

63
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:07,417
of our wedding in the Sunday Times
so please just a little less teeth.

64
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,964
Charlotte York. I cannot wait to marry you.

65
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:13,339
That's perfect! That's it!

66
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:15,385
I was having a moment.

67
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,355
Lipstick!

68
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:23,258
Wait no, no! Sorry.
No kissing pictures. It's tacky.

69
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:24,990
And speaking of tacky.

70
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,391
It's cute, huh?

71
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,226
Debby bought it for him over at the 6th avenue flea market.

72
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,850
Did you wash it first?

73
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,051
She also got something for you.

74
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,484
It's aromatherapy.

75
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:43,173
Oh. Huh.

76
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:45,814
You know I was thinking.

77
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:49,421
Maybe we should figure out a time
for the two of you to meet.

78
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,435
What? Why?

79
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:55,117
Well. She's around Brady and I know
how you're not so comfortable with that.

80
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:56,640
I'm completely comfortable.

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,837
I don't need to meet her. I trust you.

82
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,642
She bought me a fucking candle.

83
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:07,942
And it was an aromatherapy candle for serenity and calm.

84
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:11,501
I was much more serene and calm before the fucking candle.

85
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:15,828
Women with candles have replaced women with cats is the new sad thing.

86
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:19,030
And get this. He thinks I should meet her.

87
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,659
I sense that he wants us to become friends.

88
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,779
No. No. No. Forget it.

89
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,896
You do not need to become friends with the new girlfriend.

90
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:31,347
It's unnatural, uncomfortable, insincere and rife with ulterior motive.

91
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:32,574
Has this happen to you?

92
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:34,725
No. I'm just being supportive.

93
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,566
But there is a baby involved.

94
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:42,251
Exactly. She's using Brady to get to me and I am not falling for it.

95
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:46,852
Speaking of falling, I tried the trapeze yesterday for that piece that I'm writing.

96
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:49,987
I could never. I have the most terrible fear of heights.

97
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:51,655
Well I do not. You've seen my shoes.

98
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:54,516
So did you fly through the air with the greatest of ease?

99
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,901
At first, but then I couldn't do a catch.

100
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,351
All I had to do was let go and reach for the guy,

101
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:01,026
who was very cute, and I still couldn't do it.

102
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:05,987
You are insane for getting into a harness without even the hope of an orgasm.

103
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:08,040
- Hello ladies.
- Hi honey.

104
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:11,428
Hi Howie.

105
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:15,438
Everyone this is Harry's best friend Howie Halberstram from Portland.

106
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:18,348
I'm not crashing. I'm just here to drop off the photo proofs.

107
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,187
And the seating chart.

108
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:21,541
We're gonna have a quick bite to eat

109
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,459
then I'm going to take the place cards to the calligrapher.

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,946
And after that when there's time,

111
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:29,013
we're gonna go around the corner and try to find our balls.

112
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,858
Yes. Harry knows to show a guy a good time.

113
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,590
Howie, this is Samantha and Miranda. And Carrie.

114
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:38,597
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

115
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,750
- Good.
- Good.

116
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,523
Good guy. You two, I see it happening.

117
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:51,923
So, Carrie. I was thinking you might
show Howie around a little later.

118
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,529
Unless Harry needs me to ice a cake or something.

119
00:06:55,991 --> 00:07:00,593
Well. I'm kinda busy.

120
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:03,738
I have to do a flying trapeze thing.

121
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:09,073
That is so weird cause I have to have a lion
taming thing tomorrow so that's out for me.

122
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,046
But you know, if you change your mind,

123
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:12,838
I will give you my business card.

124
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,236
Okay.

125
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:15,972
There you go.

126
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:16,917
Thank you.

127
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,575
- All my line's on there.
- Okay.

128
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:21,070
- Call me any time you¡¦
- Okay. Okay.

129
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:24,803
What's wrong with you?

130
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:27,017
He was funny and cute.

131
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:30,717
And in town for a week. What's the point?

132
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,513
That is the point.
It's the best possible scenario.

133
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,554
Because you know he's leaving.

134
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:40,767
But it's like whatever happens,
there's an expiration date.

135
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,020
It's expiration dating.

136
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,616
It isn't dating. It's sex. It's fun, it's a fling.

137
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:49,300
Oh please. I'm too old for a fling.

138
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,171
I can barely do a swing.

139
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,538
And if you will excuse me,

140
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,623
I have to go home so I can write
about the fact that I couldn't do a catch.

141
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:57,472
He is a catch.

142
00:07:57,472 --> 00:08:00,040
You should do him.

143
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:06,264
When you're young,
your whole life is about the pursuit of fun.

144
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:08,900
Then, you grow up and learn to be cautious.

145
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:13,073
You could break a bone or a heart.

146
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:15,996
You look before you leap and sometimes
you don't leap at all because

147
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,860
there's not always someone there to catch you.

148
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:21,998
And in life, there's no safety net.

149
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,080
When did it stop being fun
and start being scary?

150
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,090
I decided it was time to leave
fear behind and have some fun.

151
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:39,916
Okay, legs up.

152
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:43,703
That's good. let go and reach for me.

153
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,840
I can't.

154
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,981
All right, this time. Let go.

155
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:53,159
I can't. I can't.

156
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:54,560
Don't tell me you can't.

157
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,838
I want nothing but lilies on the Hoffa.
The theme is Yentl chic.

158
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,230
Don't forget the candles.

159
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,599
You think this is the first wedding I ever planned?

160
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,197
Jesus Christ, you're worse than me.

161
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:04,770
We want candles, candles, candles

162
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,643
and I don't want short stubby little broken-off DICK candles.

163
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,936
I want loooong tapers.

164
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:12,196
All right. Call me right back.

165
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:15,468
Ta-da. It's okay?

166
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:18,437
Okay? You're Audrey Hepburn. Owitz.

167
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,736
I'm so excited about this wedding.

168
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:23,193
We're gonna do everything according to tradition.

169
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,057
We're gonna smash the glass,

170
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:28,600
and the signing of the Ketubah. The Hora.

171
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:31,248
Be careful. God forbid you fall off the chair.

172
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:33,121
Oh the horror. The hora.

173
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:35,202
Well maybe we won't do the chair thing.

174
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,986
You have to. That's the big finish.

175
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,433
Just remember when you're up there.

176
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,759
Pretend you're having a good time,

177
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,076
hang on for dear life,
and for fuck's sake keep your legs together.

178
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:44,533
Nobody wants to see the bride's beaver.

179
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:47,897
Don't say that in front of my dress.

180
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,626
Hello. York residence.

181
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:53,521
Yes we have a minute.

182
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,293
It's the New York Times fact checker.

183
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:57,316
Yes. Goldenblatt has two T's.

184
00:09:58,152 --> 00:10:01,138
Sure. Fax it over!

185
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,443
We're in. We're in.

186
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:05,893
This calls for a hora.

187
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:11,629
Hey.

188
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,804
Oh my god. What are you doing here?

189
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:15,851
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

190
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:17,884
Jesus Christ, Char, my ear.

191
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,031
You're not supposed to see me in my dress.

192
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:21,343
It's bad luck. Very bad luck.

193
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:22,756
Close your eyes.

194
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,912
Keep them closed.

195
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:27,657
Oh no. This is so bad.

196
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,100
Are all brides like that?

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,459
That's nothing.

198
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,622
I once had a girl in Long Island
give herself a stroke.

199
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:37,418
She pulled it together for the big day though.

200
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:46,109
Hopefully I'll get cell reception down in Mexico.

201
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:47,378
Uh-huh.

202
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:49,972
Samantha, a fan of expiration dating,

203
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:53,477
was about to enjoy one of the benefits of dating an actor.

204
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:55,438
Location. Location. Location.

205
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,036
It's gonna be cool working with Gus Van Sant.

206
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:57,785
Uh-huh.

207
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,871
Here. Let me.

208
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:07,168
Can't believe we don't get to spend my last night together.

209
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:08,655
Are you dying?

210
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:10,165
No.

211
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:11,907
Then it's not your last night.

212
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,733
There.

213
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,117
I'm gonna miss you Samantha.

214
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,226
Oh, save that performance for Mr. Van Sant.

215
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:24,441
It's just two weeks.

216
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,454
It's a long time.

217
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:27,906
Would you get out of here already? I'm late as it is.

218
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:31,029
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:35,152
And listen. When you're on location,
don't do anything I wouldn't do.

220
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,351
What does that rule out?

221
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:37,884
Few things.

222
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,788
Karaoke. I don't do that.

223
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:52,437
He flies through the air with the greatest of ease.

224
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:57,193
That daring young boy on the flying trapeze.

225
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,592
This is it.

226
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,168
It's a very nice building.

227
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:03,337
Miranda. I can't find my keys.

228
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:06,970
Magda. I'm not home.

229
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,733
Do you understand?

230
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,491
I'm already at Charlotte's.

231
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:14,924
I am not home.

232
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,797
Is Miranda here?

233
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:22,839
She is not home.

234
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,402
That's too bad. I was really looking forward to meeting her.

235
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:30,130
She is not home.

236
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,580
Magda, this is Debbie.

237
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,180
Nice to meet you.

238
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:37,334
All right. We just need to grab
some things out of Brady's crib.

239
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:42,918
Last time I forgot Mr. Elephant and Brady
acted like a big baby. Didn't you B-boy?

240
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:46,280
He is a big baby.

241
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,795
I have not cleaned the room yet.

242
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:54,177
That's okay.

243
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,550
This is a nice room. She has nice taste.

244
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,404
Yeah. I help build the crib.

245
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:04,830
Really?

246
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,394
What's wrong Brady?

247
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:15,644
Did you drop your binky?
Where's your binky?

248
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,623
Oh it's right there.

249
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:22,871
Here you go Bradilicious.

250
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,435
Hey, wanna go to Blockbuster
and rent a tape or something?

251
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,472
Okay but this time, I get to pick.

252
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,109
- Bye.
- Bye Magda.

253
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:44,144
There's a lot of dust down there.

254
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:47,371
You really should vacuum. Under¡¦.

255
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:56,852
That night, we all gathered at
Charlotte's casual rehearsal dinner.

256
00:13:56,852 --> 00:14:00,021
You're like a lint tray.
What's happening back here?

257
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:03,190
That Debbie is crazy.

258
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,949
She came to my apartment with Steve.

259
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,110
Totally ambushed me.

260
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,407
I had to hide under the bed to avoid them.

261
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:09,978
Seriously?

262
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,139
Maybe.

263
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:12,699
Well did you see her?

264
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,857
Just her shoes and her nails.

265
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:15,709
And?

266
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:16,843
Both acrylic.

267
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,003
You know maybe you should just
meet her and get it over with.

268
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,613
I don't wanna meet her.

269
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:25,836
If I meet her and she's real and that
means Steve has an actual girlfriend.

270
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:29,292
Apparently, I wasn't the only
one who had trouble letting go.

271
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,753
Hey. What's happening there?

272
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:34,513
Oh you know. Bride. Bride. Bride. Blah, blah, blah.

273
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,319
Hey I just saw your friend go into the bedroom.

274
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,640
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

275
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,359
Still no.

276
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,252
It's just casual sex.

277
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:47,194
Nothing's casual anymore.
When even it says so in the invitation.

278
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:50,598
Just go in there and see what happens.

279
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,095
Worse comes to worst, you can always hide under the bed.

280
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:58,267
I decided they were right.

281
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:01,134
It was time to get back in the swing of things.

282
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:11,223
Oh. Hey. How are you?

283
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,349
Wow. This is kind of uncomfortable.

284
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,409
Look, would you please stop calling me,

285
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,145
I don't have time to chat.

286
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:21,403
I've got boot and ears on my mind.

287
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:22,950
I'm sorry I never called.

288
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,406
I understand. You're busy.

289
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:24,999
That time of year.

290
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:29,133
You know, final exams for clown college. Or something.

291
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:30,726
And what would that interia? think?

292
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:34,633
You know, seating arrangements,
the little car, walking in the floppy shoes.

293
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,770
Scorting? flower and nose application?

294
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,746
Continue appieing?, the clown kissing.

295
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,835
Maybe I would have a fling.

296
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:43,759
After all, how bad could it be?

297
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:55,348
That night, Howie and I had sex
like we were teenagers again.

298
00:15:55,348 --> 00:16:00,238
Meaning, he had no idea what he
was doing, and I didn't say anything.

299
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:09,605
Meanwhile, Samantha was banging around as well.

300
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:16,305
You have one new message.

301
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:21,870
Hey I'm here. It's pretty cool.
You miss me yet?

302
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:26,638
That's the thing about getting used to a man.

303
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:27,937
There's always a catch.

304
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,676
It's here. It's here!

305
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:37,701
Not just her wedding day, but the New York Times.

306
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:47,117
Oh my god. I have a mustache.

307
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:50,378
It's an ink stain.

308
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:53,623
Hey now look at me.
That is a terrific smile.

309
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:54,919
This is a nightmare.

310
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:58,209
It's probably just our paper.

311
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,511
Anyway, who cares?
We're getting married today!

312
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:02,150
I look like Hitler.

313
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,918
I'm having a Jewish and I look like Hitler.

314
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:05,921
Hello.

315
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:09,329
In your paper do I have a mustache?

316
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:09,979
What?

317
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:13,301
In your wedding section,
does it look like I have a mustache?

318
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:15,543
Oh. Hang on a minute.

319
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:20,779
As I feared, my fling had become a pain in the neck.

320
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,891
You do not look like Hitler.

321
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,067
Fredo Bandito maybe.

322
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,370
Bad luck is starting already.

323
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:36,794
Yeah. There's a little something.

324
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:40,468
But maybe it's just my paper. And your paper.

325
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:41,693
I have to go.

326
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,639
Clearly Charlotte was bent out of shape. And so was I.

327
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:49,430
Come on granny. I'll take you to the early bird special.

328
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,853
Oh god. Don't make me laugh. It hurts.

329
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:56,298
Is this still from your days as a flying relenda?

330
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:59,912
Well that's my official story and it's partially true.

331
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,698
But this is a sex sprain.

332
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:04,632
Good for you.

333
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:07,067
No. It was not good for me.

334
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,671
It was jack rabbit sex.

335
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,876
You know, pound, pound, pound, pound, pound.

336
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,619
Are straight men still allowed to do that?

337
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,043
No. They aren't. It's bad.

338
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:18,734
It's basically masturbating with
a woman instead of your hand.

339
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:19,814
I don't enjoy.

340
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,917
Carrie. You made it.

341
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:26,487
Oh. Hi. Hi.

342
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:27,559
The jack rabbit?

343
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,671
Uh-huh. I better¡¦

344
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,172
Hop to it.

345
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:35,683
Hi. Hi. Hi.

346
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,594
You look hot.

347
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,510
Thanks.

348
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:47,828
- Guess what?
- What?

349
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:50,194
I got a suite at the Mercer for later.

350
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:52,892
King size bed, huge tub.

351
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:55,256
We can have breakfast before I leave.

352
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:58,500
Unless of course we're busy doing something else. Hmm?

353
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:03,946
Yeah. I don't know.

354
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:06,678
I'm pretty tired from last night.

355
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:10,601
I'm only gonna be in town for another
day and I wanna get to know you better.

356
00:19:13,124 --> 00:19:16,582
Well. Okay. We'll see.

357
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,185
We'll see?

358
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,845
I know what we'll see means. We'll see.

359
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:30,048
No. The thing is you're just visiting so..

360
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:31,908
I figured..

361
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,368
I figured it was a one-night kind of thing.

362
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,852
Just fun.

363
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:47,555
Wow.

364
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,235
If I'd known you were just using me,

365
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:53,750
I wouldn't have made love to you like that.

366
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,216
We are here today to celebrate the
union of two very special people.

367
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:08,049
Harry Goldenblatt and Charlotte York.

368
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:13,101
It's important for everyone here
to be a witness to this moment.

369
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:17,133
For the Jewish wedding ceremony has two parts.

370
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,256
The first designates to the community

371
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:28,622
that the Kallah, bride, and the Chatan,
groom, are for one another alone.

372
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:34,771
And the second part gives them to one another.

373
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,332
It's a gift.
(fuck you)

374
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,884
And a huge responsibility.
(fuck you)

375
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,334
As one man slipped a ring on,

376
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:05,425
one woman was still trying to slip a bracelet off.

377
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:18,322
Sorry. It's a back spasm I'm sorry.

378
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:41,433
It seemed to Charlotte that the wedding had gone

379
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,182
from to Jewish Law to Murphy's Law.

380
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,441
Mozel Tov.

381
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:14,890
Hey Charlotte, are you okay?

382
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:19,005
This is a disaster.
It's the worst wedding in the history.

383
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,597
That's not true.

384
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,477
Although I know saw most of it from here down.

385
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:28,176
Harry never should have walked in
on me wearing my wedding dress.

386
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:29,228
Now we're cursed.

387
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:30,944
You're not cursed.

388
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,319
You're married.

389
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,410
You just got married.

390
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,286
I know but I wanted everything to be perfect.

391
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:41,953
Okay you have to stop with the tears.

392
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:45,565
You already had the perfect wedding and the marriage,

393
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,809
not so perfect.

394
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,551
You know I think this is a good sign.

395
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:52,982
I think the worse the wedding,
the better the marriage.

396
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:55,403
I have a stain on my dress.

397
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:59,196
That's good. That's a good sign.

398
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,967
You're just trying to make me feel better.

399
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:05,989
No I'm trying to get you to open
your eyes because you're missing it.

400
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:07,612
- What?
- Everything.

401
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:10,030
You're missing your wedding.

402
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,818
You have a wonderful man who loves you.

403
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,727
Who will be there to catch you when you fall.

404
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,416
Do you know how special that is?

405
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,545
I would love to find a man
who's strong enough to catch me.

406
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:27,658
So, let's get to that reception so
you can fall in a cake or something.

407
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:29,974
Okay.

408
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,325
- Okay?
- Perfect.

409
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:42,426
Oh Christ. Oh Christ.

410
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,281
Are you okay?

411
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:52,640
Oh yeah. I'm just feeling a little sad.

412
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,508
It was just so beautiful.

413
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,733
The ceremony.

414
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:56,737
My bracelet.

415
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:05,044
Ladies and gentlemen.
Can I have you attention please.

416
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,832
Oh god, it's time for the toast.

417
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,623
Top me off. I'm next.

418
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,772
I would like to raise a glass

419
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:14,727
to Harry and Charlotte

420
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:19,833
cause they found each other despite all the bullshit.

421
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:24,912
Hey. Hey. It's tough out there.

422
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:28,400
I mean, people don't care like they used to.

423
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:30,973
People leave you hanging.

424
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,016
People, are a bitch.

425
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:37,849
Is this a toast or a roast?

426
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,354
Here's to love.

427
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:43,903
And love means never,

428
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,991
ever having to say

429
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:52,719
'you used me for sex'.

430
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:57,125
Thanks Howie. That's nice.

431
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,192
Mozel Tov.

432
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,900
It was a Mozel Tov cocktail.

433
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:08,371
Carrie said the worse the wedding,
the better the marriage.

434
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:11,280
Well then I think Howie just got us to our silver.

435
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:19,375
Hi. Hello. Great.

436
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:28,087
I would like to congratulate
my very brave friend Charlotte.

437
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:33,038
Who knows what she wants and who goes for it.

438
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,998
Not everyone can do that.

439
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:40,547
Especially when it comes to love.

440
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,249
Some of us can't even say the words. But.

441
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:57,289
Sorry hon. Good speech though.

442
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:00,956
Maybe Miranda just got us to our Gold.

443
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:45,202
He's certainly acrobatic.

444
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:48,350
Oh yeah. He's a regular jerk de soleil.

445
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,754
Do you think everyone knows I slept with him?

446
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:57,927
Yes. And they all think you're a big horror.

447
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:06,752
I don't like this. I'm afraid of..

448
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,506
What? What's the worst that can happen?

449
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:10,363
We'll live happily ever after?

450
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:25,685
And of course this being a wedding,
there was one more catch to go.

451
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,530
Okay. Who's ready to catch the bouquet?

452
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:33,054
Not me. I've lit myself on fire,

453
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:35,123
I showed emotion in public.

454
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:36,942
I think I'm done.

455
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,472
Oh you were fabulous.

456
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:40,551
I believe you mean flammable.

457
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,350
Okay. Now you're done.

458
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,407
It wasn't the perfect catch.

459
00:27:58,194 --> 00:27:59,309
And neither was mine.

460
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:04,903
But I survived because I have a good safety net.

461
