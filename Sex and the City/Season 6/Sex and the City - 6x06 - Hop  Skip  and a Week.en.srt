2
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,759
In New York city where no good event gets going before 9 pm,

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,074
it's a very bad sign when you get invited to something that starts at 9... am.

4
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:58,780
What are you going to say?

5
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,698
I'm just going to tell them that before 10 am,

6
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:03,998
as far as I'm concerned, everybody's guilty.

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,246
I figure I'll be out in no time.

8
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,746
Well, as long as I'm down here,

9
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:10,474
I'm going to head over to J&R to look at some computer chips.

10
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:13,150
When you get off, call me. We'll meet up do something.

11
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,697
Well, aren't you going to write today?

12
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:16,818
What does that mean?

13
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:18,690
It doesn't mean anything. It was just a question.

14
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:20,995
What did you think I was going to do?

15
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,776
Sit on my ass all day? Slack off?

16
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:24,957
No, I didn't mean it like that.

17
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:29,019
Look, it's early.

18
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:31,260
Right, it's early.

19
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:33,767
And it's also a very bad sign

20
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,876
when a couple is fighting before 9 am.

21
00:01:36,876 --> 00:01:40,317
You know what we need right now? A Hollywood kiss.

22
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:43,102
Here? We have coffee.

23
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,762
Come on. I'll kiss.

24
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:55,191
Better?

25
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:57,396
Better.

26
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:01,480
I'll see you later. I love you / Ok

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,493
I love you too. Wish me luck.

28
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:05,947
Hang 'em all.

29
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,976
Hi. I hope you can help me with this.

30
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:18,234
I feel terrible but I don't think that I can serve jury duty today.

31
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:21,253
You see, I work for myself as a freelance writer,

32
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:23,030
and no one can cover for me.

33
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,729
Welcome to jury duty.

34
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:35,823
Meanwhile another woman was having trouble juggling her duties

35
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,463
Oh, is it 8:30 already?

36
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:39,710
Good morning.

37
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,646
Fuck!

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,838
Don't say "ass".

39
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:50,043
I'm, uh, I'm going to be a little late tonight, work stuff.

40
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:55,025
It's Ok, Brady.

41
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,581
Mommy's just got to go to work.

42
00:02:57,581 --> 00:02:59,020
Boy's fine.

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,482
He just misses Mom.

44
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:08,230
Oh, look at that. Yes. Say bye-bye.

45
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,457
Bye bye, Mommy.

46
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,476
No no, it's not big deal

47
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:13,140
Bye bye, Brady.

48
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:18,442
Along with her coffee, feeling guilty have become a part of Miranda's daily routine.

49
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:22,571
Let me help you, darling. / Thanks Lenore.

50
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:26,253
You have done such a wonderful job with this event.

51
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,612
Macaroom's on the outside, dear.

52
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,910
I just hope people will enjoy it.

53
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,526
I'm sure they will.

54
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:36,133
Charlotte had been guilted into joining the synagogue sisterhood society.

55
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,466
Now I know since Harry puh, puh, puh...

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,840
You've been coming to temple alone

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,297
The break-up was bad news for you

58
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,473
but good news for me.

59
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:48,945
Hence... good news for you!

60
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,018
Lenore, what are you saying over there?

61
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,611
I have someone for you.

62
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:57,363
Now I know, I don't look old enough to have a son your age but

63
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,426
I do!

64
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,458
Charlotte, darling.

65
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:04,256
I have two single sons both perfect for you.

66
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:08,833
Ah-ha, Barbara, I told you I wanted to fix her up with my David.

67
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:12,598
Charlotte may have been there to arrange the cookies

68
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,510
but Barbara, Elaine and Lenore were there to arrange her next marriage.

69
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:22,960
Meanwhile, Samantha had used her pushiness to parlay her new man's hit off-broadway show

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,477
into a hot on-broadway poster.

71
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:26,515
Fuck me!

72
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,513
Well, that's the first thing every woman in town will be saying after she sees it.

73
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:31,702
It's huge!

74
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:33,707
And that's the second.

75
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:37,158
And honey, I'm not even sure the poster does you justice.

76
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,774
Come on! My dick's like 3 stories long.

77
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:43,085
The way God had Madison avenue intended!

78
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,755
Sometimes when you're sitting on a jury,

79
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:51,653
it may seem as if all you're doing is a lot of waiting around.

80
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:55,820
but to the contrary, the catalyst for the resolution of the lawsuit is

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,725
the fact that you're there ready to hear the evidence and

82
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:00,771
render a verdict.

83
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:02,516
You're not just sitting around but

84
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:07,082
rather playing an indispensible role in our justice system.

85
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:11,095
But now let's take a look at the flow of a typical trial.

86
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:13,599
Whether you're serving on a civil or criminal trial,

87
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,096
there's a general procedure that is followed.

88
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:19,442
You may hear opening statements by the opposing attorneys,

89
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,074
each presenting their sides of the dispute.

90
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:24,031
This is not evidence

91
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,109
It's just so weird!

92
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,855
I mean, a mango wasn't even a fruit you can buy into.

93
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:32,567
I do believe it is the oddest thing you can pull out of a briefcase.

94
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,654
Except for pineapples.

95
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:38,556
The moment he pulls out a pineapple,I want you to call me.

96
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:45,285
Charlotte, what are you doing?

97
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:48,576
Why are we hiding?

98
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,934
I'm on the worst date of my life!

99
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,432
Honey, I'm so sorry.

100
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:55,850
This woman from the temple set me up with her son

101
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,101
and he's awful! You have to help me.

102
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:59,374
Ok.

103
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:02,044
Call me on your cell phone and tell me something bad happened.

104
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,022
Then I'll rush out.

105
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:04,373
Ok, then when the guy leaves I'll call you,

106
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:05,997
you'll come back in with us. /Yes!

107
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:12,848
We've been dating a long time. We have contingency plans.

108
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:22,283
I asked for more bread but they haven't brought it yet.

109
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:33,095
Oh, I'm sorry. I wouldn't normally get that but maybe something bad happened.

110
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:38,164
Hey, Charlotte, it's me. Something bad happened.

111
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,902
Something bad happened?!

112
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:43,383
I know it was going to be terrible.

113
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,004
The man brought me carnations.

114
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:45,803
I see.

115
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:50,121
Wait, hold up! The man brought you flowers?!What~ an asshole!

116
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,014
Not flowers, carnations!

117
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:53,412
What's so wrong with carnations?

118
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,786
Uck, the filler flowers.

119
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,739
Would you dump a guy if I brought you carnations?

120
00:06:56,739 --> 00:07:00,467
Me? No, but I happened to like carnations, especially the pink ones.

121
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,660
In fact, I think they're making a comeback.

122
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,744
I would, however, throw away a guy for wearing dark siders or top-siders or any of the above.

123
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:08,538
No, those are cute!

124
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,557
So, basically guys are just fucked.

125
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,079
No, that's not true.

126
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,003
None of that matters with the right guy.

127
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:16,521
Harry was bald and he talked with his mouth full.

128
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,123
but I loved him anyway.

129
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:21,330
Right. Because he didn't bring you filler flowers.

130
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,930
No... becaue I loved him.

131
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,128
Of course you did, sweetie. You don't say that to her.

132
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:29,118
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just trying to be funny.

133
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,842
Well, it wasn't funny.

134
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:33,488
Yeah, it wasn't funny, I'm a slacker.

135
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:36,576
I guess if I wear a top side, I wouldn't be here.

136
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,585
Good evening. You folks are ready to order?

137
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,459
Um... yes!

138
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,495
Let's see, um,...

139
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,451
I'm going to start with goat cheese salad and

140
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:47,813
then I'll have the tuna but, sir,

141
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:51,115
can you make sure there's no parsley on anything?

142
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:54,065
I'm just really allergic. Not even a sprinkling ever on the plate.

143
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,443
Hey, you got her. No parsley.

144
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:58,493
and, can... actually can, uh,...

145
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:01,235
can you ask the chef if the marinade for the tuna has parsley in it?

146
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:03,531
Because if it does I should probably change my order.

147
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,995
I'll go check/ Thank you.

148
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,038
You're not allergic.

149
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:08,388
What?

150
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,165
You're not allergic.

151
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:10,109
I don't like it!

152
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:11,459
Why don't you just say that?

153
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,569
Because when I say that, parsley somehow,

154
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,773
magically appears on the plate and I feel bad

155
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,817
because I have to send it back.

156
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:21,209
You didn't even order something that usually comes with parsley.

157
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,729
It comes with everything.

158
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,826
You know what? Guys, I actually have to

159
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:27,669
I... I totally forgot I... I have to

160
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,573
uh,... go.

161
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:30,345
Bye.

162
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,319
Charlotte decided to leave her second bad date of the night.

163
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:46,096
Uh, you can just drop us at the corner of uh 73rd and Madison. Thanks

164
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:51,891
Whoa, actually, can you go around at 73rd between Park and Madison?Thank you.

165
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:54,650
I'm in heels.

166
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:02,336
I can't believe you put me down in front of your friend.

167
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,321
I didn't put you down.

168
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,239
Oh, okay, great.

169
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,248
Now you're going to tell me what I feel?

170
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:10,643
I'm not telling you what you feel.

171
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:12,506
Ah, here we go again.

172
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,855
What's going on with us?

173
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,940
When did you stop being on my side?

174
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,946
When did you stop being on my side?

175
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:31,652
This isn't working.

176
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:33,016
You're right.

177
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,628
I think we should take a break.

178
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:36,187
Are you serious?

179
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:37,681
I think we need some time apart.

180
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,635
Well, nothings haven't been great but...

181
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,089
How long have you been thinking about this?

182
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:47,183
Right up here's fine.

183
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,202
At third brown, stand on the right.

184
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,758
Ah no, actually wait. There's going to be 2 stops.

185
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:02,481
Wait, you want to take the break starting now?

186
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:05,597
I thought you would at least come up and we need to talk.

187
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:07,723
I... I don't need to talk.

188
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,138
Ok? I need some time to think.

189
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,917
Well, how much time?

190
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:14,292
About a week?

191
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:16,460
I'm going to go out to my Hamptons house.

192
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,220
I just need some distance.

193
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,027
sort through stuffs. Is that okay?

194
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:23,239
What?

195
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,248
I'm supposed to decide what I feel about this with the meter runnung?

196
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,484
Yeah, okay. Go.

197
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:33,927
I'll call you when I get back.

198
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,209
Well, thanks for dinner!

199
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,461
I knew we were having problems but a break?

200
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,670
What am I? Some horrible job he needs to get away from?

201
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,104
A break isn't always a bad thing.

202
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:01,161
Oh, come on it's a hop, skip and a week from a break up.

203
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:05,084
Or it's the thing that saves you from saying the things that you wish you could take back

204
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,260
but you can't!

205
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,042
If Harry and I had taken a break, then maybe I wouldn't be out on blind dates again.

206
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,302
Hey, remember when a break was a good thing?

207
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,530
Spring break, coffee break,...

208
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,133
Now it's break-up.

209
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,645
Break down.

210
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:20,109
They keep getting worse. What's next?

211
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:20,938
Hip break?

212
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,331
You know what I think?

213
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:25,069
I think "Don't do that. "

214
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,032
Do what?

215
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,794
Well, I'm sorry I'm upset.

216
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:31,549
Well, don't be.

217
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:34,582
You'll be even more upset when your faces are all lined.

218
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:38,987
As far as I'm concerned, the test of a good relationship is

219
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:42,929
are you like this... or like this...?

220
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,724
That is the test of a good relationship? / Um-hmm.

221
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:48,372
Or good dermatologists

222
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:51,200
Make fun but a bump in the road is never good.

223
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,228
And you shouldn't bother staying around to find out how not good.

224
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:55,773
Well, it's not all frowns.

225
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:58,753
Berger and I have a lot of good stuff too. It's complicated.

226
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:03,562
Complicated by the fact that the man had to go all the way to Long Islandto think this through.

227
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,930
Maybe you can send him a postcard!

228
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:11,240
That is the most blatant agenda pushing I have ever seen.

229
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,685
And the most effective.

230
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:13,884
Wow!

231
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:15,757
I just wish I knew what he was thinking.

232
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:18,830
Oh, who cares? Look at his pegs.

233
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,627
I meant Berger.

234
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:22,743
It's so frustrating. What am I supposed to do?

235
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,797
Just sit around, waiting to find out whether he chooses me?

236
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:29,055
I'm doing that all day at Jury duty and it sucks!

237
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,256
Here's an idea.

238
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:33,432
Why don't you use this time to think about what you want.

239
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,306
Remember you? What do you want?

240
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:46,641
The next day I got to thinking about trials and trial separations.

241
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,767
In a court room, a jury decides the outcome.

242
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:53,926
In a relationship, the victims have to decide their own fate.

243
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:58,965
How can 2 people mired in the mess ever figure it out?

244
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,747
Do we need distance to get close?

245
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,662
Sorry. Cab gridlock situation.

246
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,882
They should rename the west side highway the no way highway.

247
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:12,581
Ah... let me just pull out my files on the McKenzie case.

248
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:14,706
We're not here to discuss the McKenzie case.

249
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:18,085
I'm sorry then. What is this meeting about?

250
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:19,008
You.

251
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,882
We're concerned.

252
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:28,321
It's been noted recently that you've been lateto important meetings and struggling to handle your case late.

253
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,227
I'm sorry, Maurice. I don't know what you mean.

254
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,401
I was late today, but... / Actually,

255
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:35,771
you've been late rather frequently. There was

256
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:39,757
the deposition last Tuesday and the motion hearing last Friday

257
00:13:39,757 --> 00:13:41,811
and you left early on Monday

258
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:43,786
Way to watch my back, Fern.

259
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:45,132
I understand it's been difficult.

260
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:46,678
With the new baby and all.

261
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,779
Got it.

262
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,693
No problem. Won't happen again.

263
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:56,175
But let me say as far as the McKenzie brief, Miranda Hobbs' kicking ass.

264
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:58,255
Where I'm doing a bad job is at home.

265
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:02,678
So, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

266
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,863
And may I remind you that when my mother died, I was back in the officeon Monday.

267
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,896
Guess what I'm drinking.

268
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,774
An absolute hunk. Your drink!

269
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,249
And you're delici...

270
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,751
Take off that ski cap.

271
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,004
Let people see you.

272
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,040
I don't want people to see me.

273
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,794
Everybody's giving me shit about the poster.

274
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,124
Oh, you're insane. People love it!

275
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:41,754
Not my people.

276
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:44,347
My cellular buddies are pissed that I'm shelling for liquor company.

277
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:45,927
My acting class thinks I'm a sell.

278
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,057
My Ma's running around every grocery store in Seattle

279
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:51,358
hiding magazines so my 96 year old grand mother doesn't see my dick.

280
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,184
Drunks, nobodies, prudes.

281
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,357
And I just don't see where this is going.

282
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,440
For one thing, I was getting auditions.

283
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,131
But nothing's happening.

284
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,698
I'm sorry to bother you but

285
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:03,878
Are you the absolute hunk?

286
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,416
Yes! He is!

287
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:11,107
I just wanted to say that my friends and I are huge, huge fans.

288
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,033
It's working! What did I tell you?

289
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:21,159
How dose those guys toasting me mean my acting career's happening?

290
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,519
First come the gays then the girls

291
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,978
Then... the industry.

292
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:28,656
Cheers / Cheers

293
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,707
And speaking of absolute gay,

294
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:35,543
Charlotte was on a lunch date with Yenta number 2's son.

295
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:39,175
So... I mean I guess I just knew it wasn't going to work out.

296
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:43,832
I mean I like practicing falatis but I don't want to talk about it at all day with my significant other.

297
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:47,964
And... what are you looking for exactly in a

298
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,804
significant other?

299
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,605
Look.... We don't need to do this.

300
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:53,922
I mean you know I'm gay.

301
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:55,322
I know I'm gay.

302
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,659
The only person who doesn't know I'm gay is my mother.

303
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,912
So do you really want to know what my type is?

304
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:03,702
That's it.

305
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:05,424
I know him!

306
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,170
Get out!

307
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:07,748
Get out!

308
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,320
Could you introduce me?

309
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,418
Actually he's straight.

310
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:13,130
Oh...

311
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,922
My brother will be so disappointed. We're obsessed with him.

312
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:21,802
Charlotte, honey.

313
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:22,883
Hi Elaine

314
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:26,442
You went out with Fagel and Miskite and you can't go out with my David?

315
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:28,474
It's just these blind dates are so...

316
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,153
Hey, not so blind!

317
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,855
I showed David your picture from the last newsletter

318
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:34,523
and he thought you were a knockout!

319
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,071
Well, that's nice.

320
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:38,931
I told him you'd be at the next single in Mingle night at the temple

321
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,910
You could meet there.

322
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,308
He's a looker! My David.

323
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:46,116
Now I know most people say that about their childeren but he is.

324
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:50,154
and he's even better looking in person.

325
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:51,432
So you'll meet him.

326
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,676
Never had braces. Can you imagine?

327
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:58,335
Some people are bullied into blind dating

328
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,049
Charlotte was bubbied.

329
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,791
I'm here!

330
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,023
I'm here!

331
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,327
Is he still awake?

332
00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:07,014
No, no, no.

333
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:09,312
The boy got to sleep an hour ago.

334
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,889
Great! It's great!

335
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:21,697
Well, I just guess I can stay here and get back to my work then.

336
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:32,644
That night the only thing Miranda put to bed was the McKenzie brief.

337
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,775
The next day the verdict was in.

338
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:42,070
Century 21, the downtown discount store was the best part of jury duty.

339
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:45,024
Hello.

340
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:48,941
I'm with 2 men in plaid pants and I'm carrying a 9 iron.

341
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,853
Greetings from California.

342
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,986
Ah, you think that's bad? I'm discount shopping.

343
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:54,775
What are you doing golfing?

344
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:57,684
I'm just in it for the scotch afterwards.

345
00:17:57,684 --> 00:17:59,078
How are things?

346
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,315
Ah, pretty good so far. I found the most unbelievable Enamel Anary(?) dress

347
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,026
and a Dolce Camono (?).

348
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,384
I meant in your life.

349
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:08,854
How's tricks?

350
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,528
Tricks are for kids.

351
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,261
Ok, kid.

352
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:14,910
So how's it going with that guy, hot dog?

353
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,263
Berger. Why do you ask?

354
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,229
Because we're friends and

355
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:21,507
friends ask other friends how things are in their lives.

356
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:24,115
besides I don't tee off another for 10 minutes.

357
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:26,576
Ah, we're great! Great!

358
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:28,088
Moved in together yet?

359
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:30,864
Um... actually we're taking it slow.

360
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,295
What's that mean?

361
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,233
Well, we're kind of taking a break.

362
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,315
You're taking a break?

363
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,684
A little break.

364
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,567
I don't know why I told him. I think I crumbled under questioning.

365
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,293
You haven't been together that long. What are you taking a break from?

366
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:45,322
Well, sometimes a person needs a little space.

367
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:48,213
From you? This guy must be crazy.

368
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:51,442
Spoken by the man who moved 3,000 miles away.

369
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:54,793
You know, a break can be a very good thing.

370
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,771
As long as you're alright with it.

371
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,455
I am very okay with it. In fact...

372
00:18:58,455 --> 00:18:59,875
You're breaking up.

373
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,144
No, we're not! Berger and I will figure... / No, your cell phone is...

374
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,210
breaking up. I can hardly hear you.

375
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,227
Hello?

376
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:11,920
With an armful of discount clothing, I realized I could no longer discount my feelings.

377
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:14,512
I decided to rent a car

378
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:18,000
and drive the distance to get closer to Berger.

379
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,482
I paid 187 dollars to drive 40 feet.

380
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:29,740
What did I think I was going to do?

381
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,970
Badger my boyfriend into being with me?

382
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:33,805
Well, that's one option.

383
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,602
I just keep thinking you know if I, if I stick with it,...

384
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:41,406
just try a little harder... / Carrie.

385
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:44,533
You know how much I like Berger but come on.

386
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,589
No one can accuse you of not having tried.

387
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:47,372
You did good.

388
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:49,851
I mean Berger can be...

389
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:52,399
threatened and...

390
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,505
insecure and somtimes he shuts down but

391
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,370
but he's also smart and funny like

392
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,666
he made up this thing,...

393
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,344
this, this Holywood kiss thing

394
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,039
whenever we're being pissy with each other

395
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,039
we did this fake Hollywood kiss bit.

396
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,337
That makes us laugh.

397
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:11,265
You guys need a bit?

398
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,344
I know. It isn't working.

399
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,365
Why is it so hard to admit that?

400
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,094
God, I've got to break up with him.

401
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,269
If he ever comes back.

402
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,383
Oh look here. Here's the mommy.

403
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:27,780
Ok, Got him. How was your bed?

404
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,986
Magda, see you late tomorrow. Thank you for everything.

405
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:35,480
It's okay. /Don't cry. Magda will be back tomorrow.

406
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,788
Hey, I missed you today.

407
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,068
How are you? / Bye bye, Brady.

408
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:44,087
No no crying. Oh you darling. Bye bye.

409
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:47,879
What's wrong with him?

410
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,546
Oh, he'll be fine. He just misses his mommy.

411
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:55,406
Magda. It's okay.

412
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:59,235
The next day Miranda decided to do something about that.

413
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:01,720
We both know that this isn't working.

414
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,153
and as much as I would like it to, it's not just going to magically change.

415
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,831
What are you saying?

416
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:08,325
I can't keep working like this.

417
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,756
I'm going to have to cut way back.

418
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:13,792
To 50 hours a week.

419
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,902
55 tops.

420
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:36,330
That night Miranda was there to put Brady to bed.

421
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,146
but there would still be times when she wouldn't be around.

422
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:44,674
so Miranda found a way to be... around.

423
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:47,917
And at bus stops, all around town

424
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,971
Fuckin' eh.

425
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:52,664
Everybody in New York thinks I'm an asshole.

426
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:53,731
Listen, blondie.

427
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:57,984
If you're going to be in this businessyou're going to have to be a lot more thick skinned than this.

428
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:00,219
What business? Naked hustle business?

429
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,263
Ok, I understand you're upset but you're going to have to take a step backwards

430
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:05,461
and see the big picture!

431
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,350
I need some time to think. I'll see you later.

432
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,056
Stop right there.

433
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,655
So there's a bump on the road.

434
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:15,590
You can't bail the minute things get rough.

435
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,631
Now trust me. This will all work out.

436
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:21,878
What if you're wrong?

437
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:23,794
There it was. A frown.

438
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:28,336
Or as close to a frown as Samantha and her dermatologist doctor Petersonwould allow.

439
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:32,237
Oh my God! Look! There he is! The absolute hunk!

440
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:38,023
What did I tell you? First, the gays, now the girls!

441
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:45,314
A hop, skip and a week later, the industry followed.

442
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:51,507
Gus Fiansent offered Smith a part of a model / hustler / junkie in his latest movie.

443
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:52,854
which he happily accepted.

444
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:56,908
So you grew up in Connecticut? I went to school there.

445
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,052
Really? Where did you go?

446
00:22:58,052 --> 00:22:59,991
Yale. / Oh

447
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:02,382
Something wrong with Yale?

448
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,784
No, no, it's just...

449
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,331
Yale.

450
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:09,429
Charlotte knew how silly she sounded

451
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,924
The problem wasn't that David went to Yale.

452
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,444
The problem was... he wasn't Harry.

453
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:16,712
David

454
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:17,912
You're really nice and

455
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:20,414
in fact... you're perfect.

456
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:25,791
but for where I am right now, you might as well be a gay man with carnations.

457
00:23:26,258 --> 00:23:27,349
I'm sorry?

458
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:29,783
I'm just not ready to date.

459
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,746
Okay.

460
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,050
You want to go back to my apartment in that sense?

461
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,599
No.

462
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,153
Well, I think it was worth asking.

463
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:44,573
Okay. I think I'm going to head out. Bye.

464
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:56,134
This blows! The only cute guy just left.

465
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,749
All that's left is the fatties and the baldies.

466
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,336
Charlotte could only hope that one of the baldies was her baldie.

467
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:28,815
Out of all the synagogues and all the cities, you had to walk into mine.

468
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,428
Harry.

469
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,149
How you've been?

470
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:36,490
Not good.

471
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,451
I miss you.

472
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:45,509
And... being away from you just only made it all the more clear how much I love you.

473
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,175
Charlotte / Wait!

474
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:49,174
Let me finish.

475
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:53,037
I don't care if you ever marry me.

476
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:55,505
I just want to be with you.

477
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:59,624
I would be lucky... to have you.

478
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:04,474
So if you can find some way to forgive me, if you could just call me,

479
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:07,681
or just ask me out again.

480
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,275
Well, that's not good enough.

481
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:22,403
Charlotte York.

482
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:26,278
Will you marry me?

483
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:31,697
Yes!

484
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,838
Yes, I'll marry you.

485
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,722
I am so coming back next week!

486
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:53,024
It wasn't a pineapple but it was just as weird.

487
00:25:53,024 --> 00:25:56,780
and there was only one other person who would really appreciate it.

488
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,962
At that moment,

489
00:25:57,962 --> 00:26:00,134
I knew I wasn't ready to let Berger go.

490
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:02,172
Ok, people. You're released.

491
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:09,493
Who is it?

492
00:26:09,938 --> 00:26:11,805
It's me. I'm back.

493
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,601
Oh, well, come on up.

494
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,414
When it comes to a trial, you have to listen to the evidence.

495
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:22,934
But when it comes to the trials of love, you have to listen to your heart.

496
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:25,327
I didn't know what Berger's verdict would be

497
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,401
but I knew mine.

498
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,284
I hear they're making a come-back.

499
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,475
Hey, Berger. I know things have been bad but I really think... / I know.

500
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,105
I love you, Carrie.

501
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,809
I want to try to make this work.

502
00:26:57,303 --> 00:27:00,539
Hey, you're never going to believe it. Do you know the mango guy?

503
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,629
He pulled out... / A pineapple?

504
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:04,283
A coconut.

505
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:06,638
Ah... so close.

506
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:08,116
I know!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
