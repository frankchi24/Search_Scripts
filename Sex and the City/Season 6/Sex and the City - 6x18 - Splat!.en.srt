Epi 18. splat!

11
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,006
When you live in New York City,

12
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,019
it can take all your energy
to stay in Vogue.

13
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:56,438
So when Enid Figg, my old boss
at Vogue wanted to meet me for lunch,

14
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:58,700
I was eager to hear
what she had for me.

15
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:02,107
Carrie, I need to ask you a favor.

16
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:05,405
Apparntly, this would be
about what I had for her.

17
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:08,774
I wanted to invite you to a party
that I'm throwing, a week from Saturday.

18
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:12,803
It's for an amazing couple
Roma Patelle and Andre Dubiankie.

19
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:14,421
They make documentary films.

20
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,710
Oh. Well, unless I'm doing the catering,
it sounds like a fun favor.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,837
There'll be a lot of couples
from the art world and...

22
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:22,851
I thought maybe you could bring
your Alexander Patrovski.

23
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:26,922
- Done. Is that it?
- No. I was hoping you might..

24
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,593
I can't believe I have to ask this.

25
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:36,608
Does he have a single friend
that you could bring along for me?

26
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:37,941
A date?

27
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:41,557
Well the thing is it's shaping up
to be mostly couples and...

28
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:46,195
I'm not a couple and
there are no exciting prospects

29
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:50,407
so I thought that someone from
his crowd might be right for me.

30
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:56,549
Please never mention this conversation
to anyone?

31
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:59,499
Excuse me.
Do you know what you want?

32
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:04,163
- Yes. I'll have the Dorado.
- The Dorado. This is a much larger fish.

33
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:06,278
This fish we recommend for two people.

34
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:09,635
See? You have to be a couple
just to order lunch in this town.

35
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,261
- I'll have the dorado as well.
- Do you even like Dorado?

36
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,263
Because if this is a pity Dorado,
I can have crab cakes.

37
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:18,658
- We'll have the Dorado.
- Very good.

38
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:30,868
The only thing is I'm not sure if Alexander
is a let's set people up kind of guy.

39
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,284
Carrie, I got you a job.

40
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:35,080
You get me a man.

41
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:40,054
Later that evening,
the couple I was in had a couple of hours

42
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:43,334
to prepare a dinner party
for a couple of couples.

43
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:47,519
Do your friends enjoy red wine?

44
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,274
My friends enjoy all wine.

45
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:56,845
Yes, we'll have the Barolo.

46
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:04,126
Hey. Do you have any single male friends?

47
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,204
Are you tired of me already?

48
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:10,958
It's for this friend of mine.

49
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:13,492
I have a friend.

50
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,988
- He's a food critic.
- Perfect.

51
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,197
Is this really how one finds love?

52
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,922
No. It's just what we do to distract ourselves
until the real thing comes along.

53
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:24,373
Now. I have a question for you.

54
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,710
Oh sorry. All my friends are taken.

55
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,301
Wow. I've never said that before.

56
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,968
You know I'll be in Paris for some time
with my exhibition.

57
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:37,264
I'm going next week and
I'm not sure when I'll come back.

58
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:42,493
Unfortunately, having a man leave
me for Paris was not foreign to me.

59
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:44,821
I'm hoping you'll come.

60
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,963
Sure, I'll come for the opening
and maybe another weekend also?

61
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:53,571
No, you misunderstand.

62
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,614
I'm hoping you'll come and be with me.

63
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,099
In Paris?

64
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,006
Yes.

65
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:06,344
For who knows when we'll come back?

66
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:09,126
Yes. I need you there.

67
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:12,853
But this was foreign to me.

68
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,017
Oh, the caviar.

69
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:19,720
For most women,
the goal of the dinner party is

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,896
to have your friends feel comfortable
around your boyfriend.

71
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,221
I think my maid is using my vibrator.

72
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:29,246
Other times, you wish your friends
were not quite so comfortable.

73
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:31,567
I don't think you're suppose to
say maid anymore.

74
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:35,034
I don't think we're supposed to
say vibrator over dinner.

75
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,538
I'm telling you.
I went into the kitchen to get it.

76
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,370
Wait. Why was it in the kitchen?

77
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,410
I like to mix it up.

78
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,496
But yesterday,
the batteries were dead.

79
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,302
They were new the last time I used it

80
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,533
and I haven't used it
since Smith came back.

81
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:50,332
Oh baby, that's sweet.

82
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,895
Now maybe in the Dominican Republic
people like to share vibrators

83
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,882
but this is America, land of plenty.

84
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:59,552
I think you could have
a potential lawsuit on your hands.

85
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:02,891
- What? Breaking and vibrating?
- As long as it's not entering.

86
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:15,749
- Beautiful piano. You play?
- Yeah I do.

87
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:19,170
You know any Billy Joel?

88
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,190
- I'm not familiar.
- Uptown girl, Always a woman.

89
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,935
Piano man.

90
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,016
Tell us about your sculpture
exhibition in Paris.

91
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:35,510
- They are not technically sculpture.
- Oh. Sorry.

92
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,819
They are large-scale light instillations
integrated with video imaging.

93
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,180
That's fine.

94
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:45,185
I don't like Paris. Too much attitude.

95
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:49,701
- And what's with the toilet paper?
- Paris is the best city in the world.

96
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,313
Easy fellow, you're talking
to New Yorkers here.

97
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:56,648
New York is wonderful
but there is nowhere like Paris.

98
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:00,200
You'll see Carrie.

99
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,915
- Are you going? For the opening?
- Yes she's coming with me. To live.

100
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:12,590
Well, we hadn't actually
discussed the details but...

101
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,408
yes, I have been invited to go to Paris.

102
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:26,198
Later, my friends wanted
a tour of the apartment.

103
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:29,691
A.k. a, time to ask me
what the hell was going on.

104
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,016
- You would go live with him?
- I don't know.

105
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,620
When were you planning to tell us?

106
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,000
He just sprang this on me two hours ago.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,528
- How long would you go?
- Where would you live?

108
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,036
- Is there a guest room?
- Are you really thinking of going?

109
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:42,399
I'm not sure. I haven't digested it yet.

110
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,880
- I'm still digesting dinner.
- This is so exciting.

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,881
I know. My boyfriend has just
asked me to go to Paris with him.

112
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:51,838
This is the most romantic thing
that has ever happened to me.

113
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,326
What do you think
they're doing down there?

114
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:57,635
Not having a Billy Joel sing-a-long,
that's for sure.

115
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,854
Ladies, time's up.

116
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,384
I can't pretend to be
one of the boys any longer.

117
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:14,504
So. I spoke to my girlfriends and
they have a few questions about Paris.

118
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:18,102
But you are the one who's going.

119
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:21,148
Well we don't know about that yet.

120
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,747
I mean...

121
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:27,005
how could this work?
Would I get my own place?

122
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:30,322
- Why do you get your own place?
- I don't know.

123
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:32,488
I've never done this before.

124
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:36,077
You'll live with me. I have a beautiful
apartment at the left bank.

125
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:38,294
But it's been remodeled.

126
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,826
So we would stay at the plaza?

127
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:45,100
Okay but are we talking a year?
Indefinitely?

128
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,858
Don't I need to learn French?
Would I be able to work there?

129
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,551
What about my cell phone?
Would it work there?

130
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:53,764
So many questions.
Which is yours?

131
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:59,572
I can't remember.
I think I drank too much Barolo at dinner.

132
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:05,415
Okay. Here's one of mine.

133
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,448
What about my apartment here?
Would I sublet it?

134
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,008
- I would pay for your apartment.
- That's crazy. I can't let you do that.

135
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:15,537
Why? I have plenty of money.

136
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,651
But I don't have plenty of Carrie Bradshaws.

137
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:30,767
And I've always wanted to learn French
and drink wine before noon so basically

138
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:35,399
it's my fantasy complete with Parisian
parties and museum openings.

139
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,479
But for how long?

140
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,611
As long as it's fun. Indefinitely.

141
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:40,979
So you'd be moving there?

142
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,288
No. Cause I'd still have
my apartment here.

143
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:46,984
- Which he'd be paying for.
- He can certainly afford it.

144
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,197
- Do you think you might get married?
- No. That's..

145
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,328
I don't think that's the point.

146
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:55,870
- Then what is he promising you?
- The world.

147
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,016
But what about your job?
Your column is all about New York.

148
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:00,714
You're all about New York.
How would you¡¦

149
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,459
I don't know.

150
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,709
How can you people still have questions?
I got all of your questions answered.

151
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,067
And they were good answers
by the way.

152
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:13,688
So this is the time when everybody
should be really excited for me.

153
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:17,149
- We are excited. It's fabulous.
- No. Forget it. Forget it.

154
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:21,363
- No, I think it's really romantic.
- Then stop killing it with questions.

155
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:23,480
We just wanna make sure
you think this through.

156
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,614
I am thinking it through.

157
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:28,733
But it's a nice offer
and it would be nice

158
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:32,034
if my friends could be happy for me.

159
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:36,470
Especially when I've always
been happy for them.

160
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,345
Carrie, we are happy for you.

161
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,262
Anyone wanna talk about cancer?

162
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,324
Anybody?

163
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:49,731
They say the unexamined life
it not worth living.

164
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:52,551
But what if the examining
becomes your life?

165
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,112
Is that living or just procrastinating?

166
00:09:56,112 --> 00:10:01,434
And what if all those helpful lunches
and late night phone calls to friends

167
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:06,059
have made us all girl talk
and no girl action?

168
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,711
Is it time to stop questioning?

169
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,579
Certain questions should never
be asked by anyone.

170
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,741
Especially a husband.

171
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:27,197
Think someone's getting a little chunky?

172
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,187
Harry.

173
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,322
I'm talking about the dog.

174
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,167
Elizabeth Taylor had gained 4 pounds

175
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:46,498
which for a dog who used to weigh
8 pounds seemed excessive.

176
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:55,919
Hi. Can you tell me
where the diet dog food is?

177
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,081
Oh I can't believe her.
She's beautiful. May I?

178
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:04,599
Yes she is beautiful.
But she's getting a little fat.

179
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,373
Oh. She's not fat.

180
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:10,166
You're right. That is an ugly word.
She is full figured.

181
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,937
No. She's pregnant.

182
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:19,319
Honey. I got your message.
So the dog's knocked up?

183
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:23,885
Yes. She's pregnant because everyone
around me gets pregnant just not me.

184
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,251
It's not like she planned it.
She's a dog.

185
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:31,687
Exactly. She's not even thinking
about it and bam! On her first try.

186
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:35,714
Well it might have been her first time
but it was with at least 8 dogs.

187
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:42,828
8 mutts. And we are gonna have to
raise her whole trampy unpedigreed family.

188
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:49,884
Elizabeth, mommy can't
look at you right now.

189
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,152
Miranda just doesn't like him.

190
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,614
- This is all about Billy Joel.
- It's not about Billy Joel.

191
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,428
It's about you.

192
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:07,811
We're not going to encourage
you to cross an ocean.

193
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,987
We're selfish bitches.
We like you in New York.

194
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:13,243
Well I like me in New York, too.
But I really like him.

195
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:17,000
- He's great, isn't he?
- Yes. A bit arrogant.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,987
- But he's got the goods to back it up.
- And he can be really sweet.

197
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:23,196
- Then he's got it all.
- Then why does Miranda not like him?

198
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:25,552
She doesn't not like him.
She doesn't know him.

199
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:29,369
She didn't try to get to know him.
She didn't ask him one question all night

200
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:33,003
- and she is all about the questions.
- Well, here's a question.

201
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,919
Why do you care?

202
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,133
Have you ever heard me once ask
what anybody thinks about my boyfriend?

203
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,590
I've never heard
you use the term boyfriend.

204
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,061
My point is it doesn't matter.

205
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:47,862
Nobody knows what goes on
behind closed doors.

206
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:52,061
- You know the most annoying thing?
- What's annoying?

207
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:57,705
Miranda has a point.
What about work and everything.

208
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,860
Maybe I can't leave New York.

209
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,951
I don't know
how I'd do some place else.

210
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:04,963
Believe me,
your fabulousness will translate.

211
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:07,505
And nobody says
he gets to dictate the terms.

212
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,922
Figure out how to do it
so you're comfortable.

213
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,371
Maybe half the time you're there,
half the time I'm there.

214
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:16,502
Well now you're being too supportive.

215
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,736
Voulez vous a la discotheque?

216
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:23,677
Voulez vous a la?

217
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,806
voulez vous allez au restaurant?

218
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,569
Later I still had questions filling my head.

219
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:32,286
But at least they were in French.
Voulez vous a Paris?

220
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:38,212
- Are you coming?
- Yeah I just have to put my earrings on.

221
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:40,082
No, to Paris.

222
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:44,129
Oh. Well.

223
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,131
I haven't decided yet.

224
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:50,722
I'm inviting you to go to France, not to jail.

225
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,102
- I just have..
- More questions? Is it possible?

226
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:59,033
Things to figure out.

227
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,139
My whole life is here.

228
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,904
Could we stay in New York and then...

229
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:13,496
just go to Paris for few months
for your show?

230
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:16,240
Then it wouldn't feel like we're moving.

231
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,780
I need to be in Paris now.

232
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,235
I've been here for three years.
I'm finished with New York.

233
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:26,788
It's time for Paris.

234
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:31,746
But.. I'm not finished with New York.

235
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:44,300
Maybe we could...
do long distance for a while?

236
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,475
Going back and forth?

237
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:49,222
It's never worked for me.

238
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:54,350
You know, someone meets someone,
someone gets bored.

239
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,988
I don't know.
Voulez-vous an ultimatum?

240
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:02,109
Normally a couple doesn't go
from an ultimatum to a party.

241
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,942
But we were in charge of
bringing something very important.

242
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:08,537
Carrie, so glad you came.

243
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:13,990
- Enid, this is.
- Alexander Patrovski. I'm thrilled.

244
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,751
- Pleasure to meet you.
- And this is Martin Grable.

245
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,472
Hi. Looks like it's gonna start
snowing out there.

246
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:25,973
They say it's going to be reminiscing
of the '74 nor'easter.

247
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,226
Hello.

248
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,229
Martin is a food critic for Bon a Petite.

249
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:36,560
Fascinating.

250
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,164
The coat check is right around the corner.

251
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:48,834
- He's very sweet and smart.
- He's a hobbit.

252
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:54,336
Carrie Bradshaw.

253
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,710
Where the fuck have you been hiding.

254
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,311
Lexi Featherington has been one of
New York's legendary party girls

255
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:05,476
who always ended up on page 6 because
of her bar hopping and her bed hopping.

256
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:09,229
I'm gonna go up to the roof and
have a smoke. I'll be back in five.

257
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:16,440
He's just so pretentious.

258
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,491
- Are you still talking about him?
- It's not him.

259
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:23,396
I've been thinking about this
and it's how she is around him.

260
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:25,735
She's different and not in a good way.

261
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,697
- She didn't laugh all night. Not once.
- Miranda,

262
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,597
no offense but you never think anyone's
good enough for you and your friends.

263
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:36,161
- You didn't' think I was good enough.
- That's not true.

264
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,263
Yes it is. And it's fine.
I know you come around.

265
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,466
Large scale light instillations.
What the fuck is that?

266
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:49,129
- He's kind of full of himself.
- Thank you.

267
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,475
Let's not wake the kid, huh?

268
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,693
Miranda, if she moves,
it'll be okay.

269
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:04,116
You'll talk, you'll visit.

270
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:10,321
I bet she won't go.

271
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:15,514
She can't leave New York.
She's got too much here.

272
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,867
Yeah, the best fraud milk white cheddar

273
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:22,561
I ever had was from a farm
and guess where?

274
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,004
I ¡¦

275
00:17:24,004 --> 00:17:27,921
New York. We now rival England
for the best cheddar in the world.

276
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,802
An hour later, I had somehow
ended up on Enid's date.

277
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:36,029
Actually, raw milk couldn't even
be used in the States till recently

278
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,730
because it isn't pasteurized.

279
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,574
It basically goes from the cow right to you.

280
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:46,354
And Enid had somehow ended up on mine.
- That's priceless.

281
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,701
I never liked? either.

282
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:54,555
Martin, can you excuse me
just for a minute? Thank you.

283
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:58,786
You know, I have to tell you,

284
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,191
I've been a fan of your work for longer
than I'd like to admit.

285
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:06,847
I've been doing my work for longer
than I'd like to admit.

286
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,800
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh Carrie, I love this man.

287
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,181
- Yes, I see that.
- Would anybody like a drink?

288
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:20,438
Are you always this attentive?
I'd love a vodka martini. Carrie?

289
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:24,290
- Oh no. I'm fine. Thanks.
- One vodka martini coming up.

290
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:30,662
Carrie, why aren't I with him?

291
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:33,576
Because I am?

292
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:40,635
- What are you doing?
- What?

293
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:46,005
All right. I'm sorry. It's not fair.

294
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:53,013
He's my age and you've got him
and I am in no-mance land.

295
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:56,717
Literally. No man anywhere.

296
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:59,679
Man can date anyone any age,
but let's be frank.

297
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,176
Most of them prefer the bimbos so...

298
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:06,724
if you're a successful 50
something woman,

299
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:15,408
there's a very small pool. It's very small.
It's a waiting pool really.

300
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,541
So why are you swimming
in my waiting pool?

301
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,372
It was another question
I wasn't prepared to answer.

302
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:26,233
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Yeah, it's down the hall.

303
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,427
Outside, the snow was
starting to come down.

304
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:33,548
And inside, it was going up.
- Oh hey. You want some?

305
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:36,270
- No thanks.
- Close the door, close the door.

306
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,432
- Do people still do coke?
- No. Unfortunately.

307
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,439
Oh god, Carrie. I'm 40 years old.
Can you fucking believe it?

308
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:48,488
Don't answer that.

309
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,898
Remember we used to go to Tunnel,
we were like 5.

310
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:55,444
- Need to use the John?
- No, I was trying to get away from Enid.

311
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,454
Euro-intellectuals.

312
00:19:57,454 --> 00:20:01,529
I don't know why I pulled strings
to get an invite to this piece of shit party.

313
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm so glad to see you though.
We're the only two single girls here.

314
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,735
- Well, actually, I'm with someone.
- Fuck you.

315
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,439
And speaking of little piece of shit parties,

316
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:26,472
- Babe.
- No Harry, I cannot come to bed right now.

317
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:28,637
because someone left me
a little present.

318
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:31,984
Because someone is
too pregnant to hold it in.

319
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:34,231
Yeah well someone isn't
holding it in anymore.

320
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:37,179
In fact, someone is giving birth
in the bathroom.

321
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:41,580
- Right now?
- Honey, it's time.

322
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,087
Elizabeth Taylor, mommy's coming.

323
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:54,560
That night, Charlotte embraced
her maternal instinct.

324
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:56,727
And three puppies.

325
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:02,426
And I, embraced my boyfriend
for as long as I still had him.

326
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:06,392
So now, Rama and I split our time
between Los Angeles and Calcutta.

327
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:09,601
- He splits his time.
- Rama hates Los Angeles.

328
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,694
Frozen yogurt is not culture.

329
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:16,403
So she stays in our home in Calcutta
while I headed our movies in Los Angeles.

330
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:18,722
But I get final Calcutta.

331
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:22,861
Nice to meet with you. You too.

332
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:26,706
So. They aren't together all the time.
They seem happy.

333
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:31,502
Carrie, I don't want that.
I want you wake up, you see me.

334
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:36,768
I see you. We go to dinner.
We sit in cafes. Life.

335
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,851
I want you everyday too
but I have a life here.

336
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:46,109
Yes. But what do you want
to come home to?

337
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:50,034
What do you want your life to be?

338
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:54,378
- Carrie, you have a lighter?
- No, Oh sorry I don't smoke anymore.

339
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:56,799
Oh fuck you.

340
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:00,948
Anyway, I'm just a huge
fan of the pomegranate.

341
00:22:00,948 --> 00:22:02,914
Do either you have a light?

342
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,089
There's no smoking in here.
Please go outside.

343
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:09,284
There is no outside.
It's fucking snowing.

344
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:12,600
- Ooh, a candle.
- She was rather rude.

345
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,100
Don't even know how she got in here.

346
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:19,069
Hey. How do you open this fucking thing?

347
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:23,861
Excuse me. Miss.
Could you keep it down?

348
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:25,513
You keep it down.

349
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:27,314
Fucking Jerry Atricks.

350
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,222
Now, our hostess has already
said there's no smoking.

351
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:32,613
When did everybody stop smoking?

352
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:35,404
When did everybody pair off?

353
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,695
This is used to be the most
exciting city in the world.

354
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:42,922
And now it's nothing but smoking
near a fucking open window.

355
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,755
New York is over.

356
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:51,630
O-V-E-R. Over.

357
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,541
No one's fun anymore.
What ever happened to fun?

358
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,843
I'm so bored I could die.

359
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:11,064
It was the first time
Lexi had ever left a party early.

360
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:15,325
An hour later, the snow really started to fall.

361
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:19,488
The first time that winter.

362
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,828
And it didn't stop.

363
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,250
The city was silent.

364
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:32,884
There were no more questions.

365
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:35,341
Only white noise.

366
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,894
Daily News
The Party's Over

367
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,187
I want to go to Paris.

368
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:57,465
It was a day made for first snows.
- Look Brady. Snow angels.

369
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:09,035
And staying home with family.

370
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:13,477
See that? It's called snow.

371
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,889
Two days later,
we said goodbye to our snow angel.

372
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,871
Wait, she tripped on her Manolo?

373
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:32,935
Stannie, the girl died.
It's sad. The end.

374
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:34,524
I'll say it's sad.

375
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:38,613
The scandal of the New York
social scene and I missed it.

376
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:43,326
I need details. Last words.

377
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:46,954
- 'I'm so bored I could die. '
- No.

378
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:50,294
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

379
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:52,707
This funeral is better than fashion week.

380
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:56,546
I know. Marcus is saving us seats
next to Hugh Jackman.

381
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:58,383
I'll see you in there.

382
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,931
- I didn't know Lexi had so many friends.
- She wasn't always so tragic.

383
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:05,225
- Remember the 80s?
- She was the 'it' girl.

384
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,006
I thought I was the 'it' girl.

385
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,896
Well, it's your word against
a dead girl. So you win.

386
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:12,680
You guys, we're suppose
to be in mourning.

387
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,301
- We are. It's the end of an era.
- Yep. The party's officially over.

388
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:30,326
Ladies, if you are single in New York,
after a certain point,

389
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,836
there is nowhere to go but down.

390
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:35,593
18 stories down to be exact.

391
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,270
- I'm going to Paris.
- That's so exciting.

392
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,832
Good for you.

393
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,887
Because you're afraid of
going out a window?

394
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:47,819
No. Because I wanna open a new one.

395
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:51,192
- What about your job?
- I quit.

396
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:54,652
- What? When did you..
- Stop.

397
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:59,025
We are done with the question
portion of the program.

398
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:02,495
I'm happy. I'm going.

399
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:06,665
Now let's go say goodbye to Lexi.

400
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,683
Well, it really is the end of an era.

401
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:22,883
After the funeral, a couple of friends
walked a couple of blocks.

402
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,709
- You wanna get something to eat?
- I'm not hungry but I'll go sit with you.

403
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:32,412
- Okay. Isn't Gordan's around here?
- It's two blocks.

404
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:36,653
I can't believe you quit your job.

405
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:41,685
Couldn't you write the column there?

406
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:45,563
No. They weren't really into
my American girl in Paris angle.

407
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:50,508
New York paper, New York girl.
Got to be such a hassle so.

408
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,459
Are they gonna have someone new writing?

409
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:59,041
Don't know. Probably some 29 year old
single girl with all new problems.

410
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:03,636
- I think you're making a mistake.
- Miranda, please.

411
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:07,260
Carrie, you can't quit your column.
It's who you are.

412
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,130
No, it's not who I am, it's what I do.

413
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,822
That's my column.

414
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,515
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- What? I'm not allowed to have an opinion?

415
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:22,684
You have an opinion.
You've had it for quite some time.

416
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:26,924
What are you gonna do over there
without your job? Eat croissant?

417
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:29,438
Why can't you be happy for me?

418
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:31,338
I'm sorry but...

419
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:35,835
I don't understand why you have to
move away and give up your life.

420
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:38,671
- You moved to Brooklyn.
- That's just Brooklyn.

421
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:43,090
I cannot stay in New York
and be single for you.

422
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,079
- What?
- This is about you.

423
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,266
As long as I'm here,
in the same place, writing my column

424
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,501
- then nothing has really changed.
- No, This is about you.

425
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:56,193
No, you moved on, Charlotte's moved on.
Even Samantha's moved on.

426
00:27:56,193 --> 00:28:02,105
I can stay here and write about my life
or I can go with him and live my life.

427
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:04,949
You mean his life.

428
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:11,283
Carrie I love you, come on.

429
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:16,366
- Just say it. You don't like him.
- Fine, I don't like him.

430
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:20,333
Then don't you go to Paris with him.

431
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,717
You're living in a fantasy.

432
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:34,648
Maybe I was living in a fantasy.

433
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:38,141
But I found a man
who could make it a reality.

434
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,687
And I wasn't gonna question any of it.

435
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:46,960
Not even how he found a horse
drawn sleigh in the middle of Manhattan.

436
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:53,399
