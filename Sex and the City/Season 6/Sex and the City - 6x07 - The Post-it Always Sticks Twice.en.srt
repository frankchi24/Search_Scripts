Epi 7. the post-it always sticks twice

11
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,942
New York City is a great place to be engaged.

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,927
Miss.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,815
Oh. Sorry. Did you want this cab?

14
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:03,005
- Why.. thank you.
- Sure.

15
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:09,900
And it¡¯s an even a better place to be enraged.

16
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:15,611
Oh. You¡¯re so busy. You¡¯re so busy.

17
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,677
Boy, do I have news.

18
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:34,973
So do I. I didn¡¯t wanna say anything
until we were all together but

19
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:38,320
Harry and I made up.
And he asked me to marry him.

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,025
- Oh my god. Congratulations.
- Sweetie, that¡¯s great.

21
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:43,602
Look at that ring.

22
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:47,813
I know. He had it made based on the one
that Richard Burton gave Elizabeth Taylor.

23
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:50,529
Well. It is fabulous.

24
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:53,167
Even more fabulous than your first one.

25
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:58,165
So Carrie. What was your news?

26
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:01,341
Oh. Berger broke up with me on a post-it.

27
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,242
On a post-it?

28
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:08,022
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yep.
Read it and weep my friends.

29
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:10,815
¡®I¡¯m sorry. I can¡¯t. Don¡¯t hate me¡¯.

30
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,063
The motherfucker¡¯s concise.

31
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,286
First of all, I thought you were gonna break up with him.

32
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:20,694
Yeah I was. And I should have but he said that
he wanted to try to 'work things out'.

33
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:24,126
A.k. a. leave in the middle of the night.

34
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,055
A post-it? That¡¯s infuriating.

35
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:29,600
Yeah I remember when breaking up over
the phone was considered bad form.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,725
I once was broken up with by a guy¡¯s doorman.

37
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:37,329
¡®I¡¯m sorry Miss Hobbes.
Jonathan won¡¯t be coming down. Ever¡¯.

38
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,532
I miss having a doorman.

39
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,853
Are you gonna call him?

40
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:47,728
No. I¡¯m not gonna dignify his behavior with a response.
I am not even going to leave him one of those

41
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:52,129
angry answering machine messages.
¡®Hi it¡¯s me. You¡¯re a dick!¡¯.

42
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:55,379
But sure felt good saying it right now. Even to you.

43
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,632
Well, that¡¯s what we¡¯re here for.

44
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:58,468
I¡¯m sorry.

45
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:03,500
Yeah I¡¯m sorry too.
That relationship was a complete waste of time.

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,434
No, it¡¯s never a complete waste of time.
I mean even in the worse relationship

47
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:08,784
you always learn something.

48
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:12,235
You might not wanna say that
to a woman carrying a loaded post-it.

49
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:16,023
But Carrie, everything happens for a reason.
Even if you don¡¯t know what it is yet.

50
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,467
That¡¯s such bullshit.

51
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:24,296
It¡¯s not. Look at me. If I had never married Trey,
then I never would have gotten divorced

52
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:30,090
and I never would have met my divorce
lawyer Harry, and I wouldn¡¯t be engaged now.

53
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,386
Uh-huh. Paper covers rock.

54
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:40,975
Maybe everything does happen for a reason.
If Berger hadn¡¯t left me in the most horrible way

55
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:45,385
anyone could ever imagine, I wouldn¡¯t have the afternoon
free to walk you to your hair appointment.

56
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,339
We¡¯re all being protected by the universe.

57
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:54,136
When it comes to men, I think you may have been right all along.
Keep it light, don¡¯t get too involved, don¡¯t get too hurt.

58
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:58,966
Exactly. If you¡¯re never someone¡¯s girlfriend,
you can never be someone¡¯s ex-girlfriend.

59
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:05,006
You know what? I¡¯m gonna spend as much time
mourning this relationship as he spent ending it.

60
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:14,007
Okay I¡¯m over it. Hey. Let¡¯s go somewhere fantastic tonight
and have a fantastic time. What can we do that would be fantastic?

61
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,012
I know. I¡¯m taking you to ¡®Bed¡¯.

62
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:18,867
I¡¯m not that off men.

63
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:24,493
No. ¡®Bed¡¯. It¡¯s a new club opening tonight.
We¡¯ll all go. I think I have the invitation.

64
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:30,276
Listen to me being all hurt. Look how many men
have broken up with you and you¡¯re fine.

65
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,759
Oh.

66
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:35,307
Come to Bed. Come to Bed! Wow.

67
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:39,296
People say everything happens for a reason.

68
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,904
These people are usually women.

69
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:45,003
And these women are usually sorting through a breakup.

70
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,340
It seems that men can get out of a relationship
without even a goodbye.

71
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,205
But apparently women,
have to either get married or learn something.

72
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:59,758
Why are we in such a rush to move from confused to Confucius?

73
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:04,483
Do we search for lessons to lessen the pain?

74
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:08,195
Meanwhile, Samantha was at home dressing a man for a change.

75
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:14,032
I called some designers and I told them that
the ¡®absolute hunk¡¯ was going to do TRL on MTV

76
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:19,853
and they jumped ASAP. Gucci, YSL, D&G, take your pick.

77
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:27,159
You know, I¡¯m not really comfortable wearing labels.
If it¡¯s okay with you, I thought I¡¯d wear some jeans and this.

78
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:36,025
That¡¯ll work too. You are going to be the fantasy of
every adolescent girl and sexually confused boy in America.

79
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:41,595
How¡¯d I get hooked up with such an amazing girlfriend?

80
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:45,057
And that was a label Samantha wasn¡¯t comfortable wearing.

81
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:48,569
Okay. You should get ready. The car will be here any minute.

82
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,417
You sure you can¡¯t come?

83
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:55,200
Oh I can¡¯t. I promised Carrie and the girls.
But I will catch the replay tonight.

84
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,419
Should I hook up with you later?

85
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:04,422
No. Go out with the MTV crowd and have fun.
You¡¯re the ¡®absolute hunk¡¯. Work it.

86
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:12,467
And as your publicist, let me just say:
calling someone your girlfriend isn¡¯t a good idea right now.

87
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:14,553
Someone or you?

88
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:25,196
Either way. So when anyone asks if you have a girlfriend,
you should say you¡¯re still looking and haven¡¯t found anyone special yet.

89
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:25,922
That¡¯s what you want.

90
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:28,548
That¡¯s what I want.

91
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,706
Samantha.

92
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:39,513
But I do insist you top off that tag with some Dior sunglasses.
It¡¯s MTV. If you¡¯re not wearing something the kids can¡¯t afford,

93
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:41,165
how will they know to look up to you?

94
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:46,007
There. Much better.

95
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:54,245
That night, as Charlotte was deciding what to wear,
she noticed that everything went with her new engagement ring:

96
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:56,156
except her old wedding dress.

97
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,549
Meanwhile, in another closet,

98
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:05,535
I don¡¯t think I can go. I¡¯m not feeling so hot.

99
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:06,701
Are you sick?

100
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,401
No. I mean. Literally.

101
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:11,882
Openings of hot new clubs are for hot childless people.

102
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:14,676
I¡¯m not even one of the hot mommies at ¡®Mommy-and-Me¡¯

103
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:19,906
Miranda I don¡¯t wanna have to resort to this but
if I have to, I will play the post-it card.

104
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:24,060
Just explain to me why I have to leave my house to go to bed?

105
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,880
Because this can¡¯t be the day that I was broken up by a post-it.
This has to be the day that something else happened.

106
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,078
How about the day your friend discovered that
all her clothes are covered in spit-up.

107
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:37,667
You are going. No excuses.

108
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,050
Okay. Okay.

109
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:46,681
And speaking of no excuses, there they were.
Her skinny jeans.

110
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:51,496
The jeans that every woman keeps in the vain hope
that someday she¡¯ll fit into them again.

111
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,979
Oh my god Tony, what are you doing here?

112
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:20,480
Ladies. This is a miracle. I am in my skinny jeans.

113
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,010
I haven¡¯t fit into these since 1985
and that is only because I had mono.

114
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:31,458
Miranda, I¡¯ve never noticed before but you¡¯ve got one hot ass.

115
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,091
- Really?
- Yeah. And you look good.

116
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:35,002
How¡¯d you do it?

117
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:39,068
Well. I got pregnant, became a single mother,
and stopped having any time to eat.

118
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,114
Oh that¡¯s a diet I won¡¯t be trying.

119
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:45,301
I can¡¯t believe I am in my skinny jeans.
I am never taking them off.

120
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:46,723
Charlotte, can I wear these to your wedding?

121
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:48,901
I¡¯m kidding.

122
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:55,126
Oh no, it¡¯s just.. I just feel kind of silly that
I made such a big fuss about my ring earlier.

123
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:58,441
Oh honey, a diamond that big deserves a parade.

124
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,175
But this is the second time around.

125
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:03,781
I already did the showing of the ring,
I already did the big wedding, you were there!

126
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:04,704
It was lovely.

127
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:10,546
So this time, I¡¯ve decided
that it should just be really small and tasteful.

128
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:11,694
So no denim.

129
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:17,401
Right. And I don¡¯t wanna disappoint you.
I¡¯ve decided not to have bridesmaids.

130
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:22,489
Hallelujah!

131
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:23,852
Okay let¡¯s go to bed.

132
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,389
Since people often go to bars to try to get someone into bed,

133
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:36,388
it was only a matter of time
till someone cut out the middleman and put the beds in bars.

134
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,986
Now this is my kind of place.

135
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:40,586
And I thought they were being ironic.

136
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:45,244
If I had known it was gonna be like this,
I would have brought my bite guard.

137
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:49,614
Bed for four please.

138
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,452
All the beds are booked right now.

139
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:53,089
Oh damn, that always happens to me.

140
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,721
We¡¯re in the VIP list. Samantha Jones.

141
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:58,211
Perfect. I¡¯ll be right back.

142
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:01,791
I have to find the bathroom. I need to pee.

143
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:06,507
Oh really? Or do you just wanna stare at your ass in the mirror?

144
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:07,888
Well that too.

145
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:09,685
Shake it sister.

146
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,608
- We¡¯re ready. Follow me.
- Oh that was fast.

147
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,786
What can I say? I know how to work it in bed.

148
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,293
And I didn¡¯t even have to buy you dinner.

149
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,002
I¡¯m sorry. Someone pushed me.

150
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:33,715
- You want me to have them killed?
- Would you?

151
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:36,039
- Just say when.
- When.

152
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,346
- Okay. I¡¯m bluffing.
- Yeah I knew you were all thought.

153
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:41,888
Yeah. I¡¯m Peter.

154
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:45,899
Miranda. Well. Thank you for letting me crash.

155
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,019
Why don¡¯t you hang out?
It¡¯s not that often I have such a beautiful woman in bed with me.

156
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,170
Oh. Okay. But move over. That¡¯s my side.

157
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,421
All the men in here seem kind of old.

158
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:07,157
That¡¯s because you¡¯re dating Smith.

159
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:08,530
Who¡¯s basically a zygote.

160
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,924
I¡¯m not dating him, I¡¯m fucking him.
Now I¡¯m looking for someone else to fuck.

161
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,944
Well I think you made have come to the right place.

162
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:24,144
- Oh no. that¡¯s Berger¡¯s friend.
- Where?

163
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:28,878
In the next bed. Oh god I hate New York.
Is there no other club opening tonight?

164
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,550
What should I do?

165
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,192
Ignore them.

166
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,495
No I can¡¯t. It¡¯ll get back to Berger that I acted childish.

167
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:41,296
Just go over there and say hi.
Act like Berger¡¯s the last thing on your mind.

168
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:47,066
Right. I¡¯ll take the high road.
I¡¯ll be calm and classy and just say hello.

169
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,269
- Billy hi.
- Hey Carrie.

170
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,829
- Hi. How are you?
- Fucking great.

171
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:04,121
Chris, Andrew. This is Berger¡¯s girlfriend Carrie.
Is Berger with you?

172
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:15,515
it is kind of uncomfortable but we broke up. This morning.

173
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,721
Oh. I¡¯m sorry to hear that.

174
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,489
I knew you guys had all kinds of problems.

175
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:32,656
Yeah. And he was bad in bed.
Well you look great Billy.

176
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:43,163
You know that angry message I didn¡¯t wanna
leave on Berger¡¯s machine, I just left it on his friend.

177
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,437
What happened?

178
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:51,116
I took the lowest possible road.
I told him Berger was bad in bed, which isn¡¯t even true.

179
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:53,653
Two times. Don¡¯t you forget anything?

180
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,063
Why did you say that?

181
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:57,677
I don¡¯t know.. it just came out.

182
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,954
Well it¡¯s understandable.
You¡¯re suffering from post-It traumatic stress syndrome.

183
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,224
I need to find a way to erase that message.

184
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:09,649
Go back over there and explain.
Just tell them you¡¯re hurt and that you didn¡¯t mean it.

185
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,452
Oh great. Now I have to admit that I¡¯m hurt?

186
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:15,888
First, a little nerve cli-co(?).

187
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:34,379
Hey. That thing I said before. Terrible and not true.

188
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:42,131
He was fine in bed. Great in fact. Fire works. Rockets.

189
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:49,175
I don¡¯t even know why I said that. I¡¯m hurt. Okay?

190
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,333
Sure. Breakups are tough.

191
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:57,675
Yes. Under normal circumstances they are tough.
And this case, tougher.

192
00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:05,253
Look, I don¡¯t wanna drag you into this but..
Berger broke up with me on a post-it.

193
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:15,082
Yeah I know as Berger¡¯s friend you can¡¯t
have a normal reaction but just so you know.

194
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:17,143
The normal reaction has been..

195
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,679
not that I¡¯m going around telling everyone,
just some girlfriends.

196
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:28,812
You know, I¡¯m trying to understand why someone would do that.

197
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:30,957
Well. Maybe he was afraid.

198
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,626
Interesting, how so?

199
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:34,614
Women can get really angry.

200
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:38,630
Well I assure you, I would have been very understanding.

201
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,355
- Right.
- Excuse me?

202
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:47,157
You all say that but then you just freak and get all psycho-bitch.

203
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:50,798
Really? So now it¡¯s our fault?

204
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:54,855
All we¡¯re saying is there really is
no good way to breakup with someone.

205
00:14:54,855 --> 00:15:00,041
Well it¡¯s funny you should mention that Billy because actually there is.

206
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:06,980
You can have the guts and the courtesy to tell a woman
to her face that you no longer wanna see her.

207
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,228
Call me crazy but I think that

208
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:12,091
you can make a point of ending your relationship

209
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:17,003
in a manner that does not include an e-mail,
a doorman or a missing person¡¯s report.

210
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:26,051
I think you can all get over the fear of looking like the bad guy
and actually have the ¡®uncomfortable breakup conversation¡¯

211
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,589
because here¡¯s what.

212
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,508
Avoiding that is what makes you the bad guy.
And such so you know, Alan.

213
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:33,104
Andrew.

214
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:36,537
Most women aren¡¯t angry irrational psychos.

215
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:45,759
We just want an ending to a relationship
that is thoughtful and decent and honors what we had together.

216
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,022
So my point Billy is this.

217
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:55,099
There is a good way to breakup with someone
and it doesn¡¯t include a post-it.

218
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,904
Okay.

219
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,005
Much better.

220
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,316
You think? We have to get out of here immediately.

221
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,809
So.. what? You have a boyfriend?

222
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,991
Me? No.

223
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:22,714
- Right.
- I don¡¯t.

224
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:25,732
Come on. How¡¯s that possible?

225
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:31,226
I have no idea.

226
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:34,785
Well neither do I. You¡¯re hot.

227
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:39,428
Hi. Sorry. We¡¯re leaving.
I just learned you should never go to bed angry.

228
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:43,008
Oh. Well.

229
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:48,197
Oh. Well. It was really great meeting you.

230
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:54,229
It was good to meet you. I¡¯ll see you. And thanks.

231
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:55,097
For what?

232
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:06,095
Okay so I¡¯m angry. So those guys will
tell Berger that I¡¯m angry. I can live me with that.

233
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:13,610
Oh, oh. Do you smell that?

234
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,788
Pot.

235
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:19,991
- Let¡¯s get high.
- I¡¯d get high.

236
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:21,847
Wait. Are you serious?

237
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:28,986
Yes. That¡¯s exactly what my mind needs.
Cloudiness. I¡¯m still too lucid on the facts of the day and night.

238
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,929
Hey, when was the last time you smoked pot?

239
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,930
I think I was wearing these jeans.

240
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,748
I¡¯m not smoking pot.

241
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:35,546
Post-it.

242
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:38,413
How would we even get any?

243
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:41,193
Well I¡¯d call my dealer but he¡¯s at the cape.

244
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,222
Oh damn those dealers and their summerhouses.

245
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:45,551
I¡¯ll ask those guys.

246
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:51,678
Excuse me, fellas. Excuse me.

247
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:59,759
Hey. My friends and I were wondering if you ¡¦

248
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,013
I like her in those jeans.

249
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,172
Is it safe to buy pot from strangers?

250
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,496
They¡¯re not strangers. They are new friends of pot.

251
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:07,451
Okay.

252
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:16,302
Okay. They¡¯re going around the corner to ¡®Drown the Hound¡¯.

253
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:20,411
There¡¯s a guy there who deals and I get the one with the glasses.

254
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:24,606
My, when she scores, she scores. All right.

255
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:35,899
¡®Drown the Hound¡¯ and I thought they were being ironic.

256
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:40,203
I see our guys.

257
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,089
Yeah go get ¡®em.

258
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:48,111
If that last place was called ¡®Bed¡¯,
then this should be called ¡®Smell¡¯.

259
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:54,344
Well hold your nose. I promised Smith I¡¯d
watch him on TRL. And this dump has a TV.

260
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,302
What¡¯s this all over the floor?

261
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,307
Peanut shells.

262
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:01,525
Why?

263
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,330
I don¡¯t know.
Do peanut shells have to happen for a reason?

264
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,550
Here¡¯s a twenty. I assume in a place like this,
that covers three drinks and a channel change.

265
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,357
Does the bride need another jello shot?

266
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:18,978
- No way.
- Yes.

267
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:23,031
One more.

268
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:26,028
Look at them. So happy.

269
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,976
Hey sweetie, what¡¯s wrong?

270
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:35,921
I just.. I wish I¡¯ve never been married before.

271
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:38,686
But if you haven¡¯t married Trey, you wouldn¡¯t have met Harry..

272
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:43,345
I know. It¡¯s just.. I hate that this is my second ring.

273
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:45,494
And that this is my second marriage and..

274
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:51,057
I hate that I finally found the love of my life
and I can¡¯t celebrate it in a big, big way.

275
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,006
You can do whatever you want.

276
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:58,698
No I can¡¯t. It¡¯s inappropriate.

277
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:01,391
Excuse me. Hi.

278
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:04,692
Would you take a picture of me and
my girlfriends? She¡¯s getting married.

279
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,410
- Sure.
- Thank you.

280
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,475
You know, she got engaged last night.

281
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:16,536
- Congratulations.
- No, no, it¡¯s my second.

282
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:21,802
She¡¯s getting married to a wonderful man
and look at this rock.

283
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:24,492
- Oh wow.
- Beautiful.

284
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:27,194
- Thank you.
- You have to be in the picture.

285
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:30,558
- That¡¯s okay.
- Come on.

286
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:39,701
- All right. Everyone say ¡®bride¡¯.
- Bride.

287
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,322
So when are you getting married?

288
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:46,208
- What¡¯s the dress look like?
- Where¡¯s the reception?

289
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:51,388
And finally Charlotte¡¯s inner judge was
silenced by some very loud bachelorettes.

290
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,211
Sorry. I guess he¡¯s not here tonight.

291
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,411
Oh well. You can¡¯t cry over spilled pot.

292
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:00,887
I could buy you a drink.

293
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:03,032
I said I was buying her a drink dude.

294
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:04,932
You have a girlfriend.

295
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,819
Gentlemen, please.

296
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:12,126
The secret of the skinny jeans.
It¡¯s not so much a state of behind as a state of mind.

297
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,238
What have a got to do to get a beer around here?

298
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:20,442
Hey listen. This is Lala now.
You¡¯ve seen him naked on a billboard right here in Time Square.

299
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:25,312
And now he¡¯s on TRL wearing clothes, damn,
but it¡¯s still all good cause he is the absolute hottest,

300
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:30,883
the absolute awesome, the absolute hunk,
give it up for Smith Jared. Hey.

301
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:37,268
Man we have a lot of family out.
Let¡¯s get ready for some questions.

302
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:39,687
Hi. I¡¯m Amber.

303
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:41,276
Hey what¡¯s up Amber?

304
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:45,135
- Okay.
- Nice, relaxed, sexy and modest.

305
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:48,956
One. What is it like to be the absolute hunk?

306
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:53,625
I have to say it¡¯s been a real trip.
But I met some really awesome people.

307
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,645
You¡¯re hot enough to be on TV.

308
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:57,060
Take that to the dartboard.

309
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,790
And two, do you have a girlfriend?

310
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:01,957
No. I¡¯m still looking.

311
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:04,907
You¡¯re really not dating anyone?

312
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,522
I am dating but I¡¯m not seeing anyone special.

313
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,628
And even though Samantha had designed it herself,

314
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:18,580
she realized no one special was another label,
she didn¡¯t care for.

315
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,114
I change my mind. Kiss me.

316
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:29,471
And to prove that Smith was no one special to her,
she kissed someone even less special.

317
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:33,322
Unfortunately, he was someone special
to a somewhat drunk person.

318
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:35,615
What the fuck do you think you¡¯re doing?

319
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,672
- What happened?
- She kissed Frankie.

320
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:40,427
Oh, who the fuck do you think you are?

321
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:45,342
Fucking city girls, you think you¡¯re such hot shit
that you can go around kissing all the girls¡¯ boyfriends?

322
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:48,141
- I¡¯m gonna kick your ass.
- I¡¯m gonna slap the shit out of you.

323
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,067
- Oh my god.
- Relax.

324
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:54,214
You fucking relax.

325
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:04,113
If I ever fucking see you again, I¡¯m gonna
put my shoes to fire up your ass and your leather.

326
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:11,450
Okay I get it. Angry woman can be scary.

327
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,941
Very few women can pull off anger in a tube top.

328
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:19,348
Oh. This night is turning into a total bust.

329
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,289
Not total.

330
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:26,712
Oh my god. I love you. Where did you get that?

331
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:34,986
Well. Apparently, twenty dollars will buy you
three drinks, a channel change and a joint.

332
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,408
All right.

333
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:44,961
Fucking men.

334
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,445
Men are bullshit.

335
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:54,564
That¡¯s what I¡¯m talking about.

336
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:56,771
Being someone¡¯s girlfriend.

337
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:02,250
No good can come of it.

338
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,260
That¡¯s what I¡¯m saying.

339
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:12,313
Wow. This is strong weed.

340
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:22,603
Oh. It¡¯s Smith. Hello.

341
00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:23,548
Hi, did you see me?

342
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:25,019
Yes we saw it.

343
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:25,762
How¡¯d I do?

344
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:28,043
Perfect! Just like we planned.

345
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:34,775
Can you hear me?
I¡¯m not getting any reception here. Let me..

346
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:36,022
Hello?

347
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:36,601
Are you there?

348
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:47,062
As I contemplated the fact, that my relationship had gone to pot,
literally. I realized no high or low would make this day,

349
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:51,849
any day other than the day I got broken up with, by a post-it.

350
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:55,887
Police. Stay right where you are.

351
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:01,592
That¡¯s the way it goes. We have to take you downtown.

352
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:07,480
Officer, please. I¡¯m a lawyer and a mother.
This woman is my friend. She¡¯s an extremely law abiding citizen.

353
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,886
Who just broke the law.

354
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:13,931
Yes but in her defense, she¡¯s had a very, very bad day.

355
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,757
Her boyfriend just broke up with her.

356
00:25:15,757 --> 00:25:16,884
On a post-it.

357
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:19,368
Come on. That didn¡¯t happen.

358
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:26,383
¡®I¡¯M SORRY I CAN¡¯T. DON¡¯T HATE ME¡¯.

359
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:29,883
Wow. Brutal.

360
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:34,394
Tell you what. I¡¯ll write you up for smoking in a bar.

361
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:37,055
Oh come on. Can¡¯t you just let her off?

362
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:40,784
Sorry. I can¡¯t. Don¡¯t hate me.

363
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,309
Oh. Hear that?

364
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:47,024
It¡¯s midnight.

365
00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:54,901
The official end to what will now be known as
the day I got arrested for smoking a doobie.

366
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:59,380
I said doobie. It¡¯s great.

367
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:02,673
You didn¡¯t¡¯ get arrested.

368
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:06,641
See? Your post-it was your ¡®get out of jail free card¡¯.

369
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:08,450
So if you never met Berger, then you wouldn¡¯t..

370
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,484
Stop. You¡¯re killing my buzz.

371
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:14,574
I have to say I¡¯m starting to agree with Charlotte¡¯s way of thinking.

372
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:19,684
If I hadn¡¯t accidentally gotten pregnant by Steve,
I never would have had Brady.

373
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:20,292
Oh.

374
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,861
I¡¯m not finished. And had no time to eat.

375
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:29,698
So I never would have fit into my skinny jeans
and realize this city is full of cute men.

376
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,850
Now that¡¯s my kind of thinking.

377
00:26:32,697 --> 00:26:35,335
Carrie. Don¡¯t Bogart. Let¡¯s split.

378
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:38,413
Okay. I know what I learned from my Berger relationship.

379
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,912
Wait a minute. I just had it.

380
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:52,977
What?

381
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,750
You know what? I changed my mind.

382
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,381
You don¡¯t think everything happens for a reason?

383
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:03,002
NO, NO. Not about that. About the wedding!
I really want you guys to be my bridesmaids.

384
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:08,011
You don¡¯t have to wear the matching dresses, I promise.

385
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:10,385
All right to that.

386
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:11,826
Can I get that in writing?

387
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:16,849
Oh I think I had enough. My jeans just popped.

388
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:27,458
I might never find the lesson in why Berger and I split.

389
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:31,023
But at least, for the moment, there was a banana split.

390
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,411
