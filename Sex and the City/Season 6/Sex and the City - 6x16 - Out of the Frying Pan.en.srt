Epi 16. Out of the Frying Pan

11
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:51,112
When you're dating someone new,
everything can seem foreign.

12
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:54,141
Especially when you're dating
someone foreign.

13
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,229
My Russian had been taking
me around the world.

14
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:01,161
Greece in Astoria, Italy in the Bronx.

15
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,979
Tonight, it was Korea; on W.32nd St.

16
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:14,630
Wow. You look..

17
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,453
Why thank you. So.

18
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:18,968
Where to tonight?

19
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:22,876
Very, very exotic place.

20
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,499
Really?

21
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,583
Well just so you know,

22
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,308
I'm fully vaccinated.

23
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:29,672
Good.

24
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,044
So, should we get a cab?

25
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:33,464
I've not been to this mysterious place before.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,135
But I believe we can walk.

27
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:37,907
I'm intrigued. Continue.

28
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,961
Turn around. We're going to your place.

29
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:55,756
Art smart. The man can cook.

30
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:59,555
Have never made the risotto
in frying pan before.

31
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:02,840
I'm sorry. I don't use my kitchen.

32
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:08,252
And I don't usually make my guests
sit on the floor next to my stack of Vogues,

33
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:11,383
which I ordinarily hide in the tub for company.

34
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:15,694
And the walls..

35
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:19,087
I love your house. It's so you.

36
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:20,351
Small and artless?

37
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:22,640
No. Warm and lovely.

38
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:26,747
Are you okay?

39
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,025
My foot sleeps.

40
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,317
Now we'll have espresso?

41
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:34,186
Great. Where?

42
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,489
I don't have an espresso machine.

43
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,281
And you call yourself a writer, yeah?

44
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:46,461
Well. I may have an old
Mr. Coffee One Cup but,

45
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,552
don't hold your breath. Oh my god.

46
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,060
Okay. We go out.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,695
Oh okay.

48
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:07,240
Oh that mouse is dead. Wow.

49
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,353
It was a rodent.

50
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:11,812
You don't want this in your house.

51
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:16,541
Well maybe he was just crossing through
to get to the much nicer apartment next door.

52
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,447
You call this denial.

53
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:22,335
Where there's one, there will be more.

54
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,996
Yeah, we're going out.

55
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,603
At least it didn't happen in a room
I actually used like my closet.

56
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:37,713
Good humor me.

57
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:40,512
The next morning, we were determined to
use our good humors

58
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:45,570
to make Samantha's kemo lounge
as close as possible to a cocktail lounge.

59
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,147
Look at Miranda working Mr. Grape there.

60
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,352
Steve is one lucky guy.

61
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:52,987
Samantha.

62
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,190
Well you guys are having a good time.

63
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,649
You bet. Cancer is hilarious.

64
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,333
Are all you as fun as Samantha?

65
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,316
We try.

66
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,989
I'm her favorite patient.

67
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:03,991
- Any mouth sour sweetie?
- No.

68
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:05,582
Great. Just keep up the Popsicles.

69
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,290
Samantha I have to say, you are amazing.

70
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,996
I am. And if you love me in kemo,

71
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:13,422
wait till you see me at Smith's movie premiere.

72
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,175
I'm getting a hot dress, fantastic shoes.

73
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:19,433
I'm going to kick cancer
and that red carpet's ass.

74
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:22,935
Hear, hear.

75
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:25,903
It's not at all what I expected.

76
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:29,937
They have these barker loungers
and videos and Popsicles.

77
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,655
You throw in Shuffle Board,
it'd be a vacation in Miami.

78
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:34,541
Ah, here they are.

79
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,747
Later, the Russian took me somewhere else
I've never been before.

80
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,875
The Kitchen Supplies Department.

81
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,371
She doesn't even look sick.

82
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:42,583
But she is sick, yes?

83
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:46,826
Well, she was. But she's gonna be fine.

84
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:49,216
Had a friend who had breast cancer.

85
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:53,712
She died.

86
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:56,098
I think this one is you.

87
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:04,438
From Kitchen supplies to a kitchen surprise.

88
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,394
Hello.

89
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,851
Oh, hi Dr. Steiner.

90
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,286
Oh.

91
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,378
None of them?

92
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,207
Sure. I understand.

93
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:28,468
Thanks for calling on a Saturday. Bye.

94
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,553
None of my eggs were viable.

95
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,342
Oh baby.

96
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,346
Again.

97
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,470
What do you want to do?

98
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:48,532
Try the? again.

99
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,527
Sure? We've already tried it twice.

100
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:53,599
Yeah. I'm sure. It'll work.

101
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,895
I mean, it has to.

102
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,066
You okay?

103
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,863
Yeah. I'm gonna go for a run.

104
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,752
In high school,
Charlotte was voted most popular,

105
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:16,632
head of the track team and class president.

106
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,682
She had won everything.

107
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,968
Except the baby race.

108
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:35,142
Meanwhile, across town a couple
who had won the baby race,

109
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:37,825
had lost their bedroom to their baby.

110
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:41,275
Wait, we saw this one. Charming,

111
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,274
mid-town two-bedroom?

112
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:44,869
Why don't they say what it really is?

113
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,486
Crack house on a airshaft.

114
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,361
Scout, off! Off!

115
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,826
Hey. Listen to this one.

116
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:55,929
In our price range, three-bedroom.

117
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,206
I'm putting my shoes on.

118
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:59,168
- Outdoor space.
- I'm getting my bag.

119
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,717
- Finished basement.
- It's a house.

120
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,338
- In Brooklyn.
- Okay, shoes are off.

121
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,558
What did I tell you about
that side of the paper?

122
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,178
What, it's a good place.

123
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,093
Steve, we're not moving to Brooklyn.

124
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:11,274
I'm a Manhattan girl.

125
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,427
I don't like anything not Manhattan.

126
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:15,271
Hey, I'm Queens and I'm pretty cute.

127
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:16,779
Let's just look at it.

128
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,597
Sleeping in the dining room isn't so bad.

129
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:20,492
We're near the kitchen.

130
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,084
Did you let Fatty out of the laundry room?

131
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:26,622
We don't even need this.

132
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:28,532
We can hear Brady through the wall.

133
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,575
Miranda, we can't keep living like this.

134
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:35,122
Scout, down.

135
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:39,836
Fine. I'll look at it.

136
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:48,084
Oh. Wow.

137
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,690
- What?
- That is some strong coffee.

138
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,471
Oh. Well. No wonder you work all night.

139
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:55,807
That's the way I like it.

140
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,579
I'm gonna need a little milk in this.

141
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,244
Then it's not espresso.

142
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,106
Milk will ruin it. Keep sipping it.

143
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:03,734
You'll see.

144
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,495
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Yes.

145
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,755
You know the other day
when I was talking about my friend?

146
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:21,164
One with cancer?

147
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:22,585
Her name is Samantha.

148
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:29,500
I just felt like you weren't being
very sensitive about my feelings.

149
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,422
I mentioned her and your first response
was to tell me about your friend.

150
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,008
Who died. Yeah.

151
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:41,564
Yes. See, exactly.

152
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,982
I'm sorry about your friend.

153
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,773
But my friend is going to be fine.

154
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:48,329
And my friend died.

155
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,737
See? You're doing it again.

156
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,045
Not everyone dies.

157
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,717
Then they're lucky.

158
00:08:55,916 --> 00:09:02,206
Okay. Maybe I'm not being very clear.

159
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,216
Oh, you're being clear.

160
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,352
You don't want your friend to die.

161
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:08,856
Please. Stop saying die.

162
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,754
But to be realistic,

163
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:13,221
you must acknowledge this possibility, yes?

164
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:16,758
No. They caught it early at Stage 1

165
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,759
and she's having the Cadillac of kemo.

166
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,346
No, she is going to be fine.

167
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,572
And your scaring me isn't helping.

168
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:25,600
All I'm saying when my friend died,

169
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,647
Okay I don't know why but..
you are not listening to me.

170
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,028
You're not listeing to me.

171
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:35,660
Are you kidding? All I've said is...
please don't talk about your friend who died.

172
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,369
Her name was Sophie.

173
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,207
I'm leaving.

174
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:41,536
What are you talking about?
We're having espresso.

175
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:43,539
No, we're not espresso.

176
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,540
We are not listening.

177
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,790
Sit down, finish your coffee. It's hot.

178
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:56,143
I'm leaving.

179
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:58,364
Excuse..

180
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:03,468
you know, I asked you
not to mention your friend.

181
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,858
And now all I can think about is your friend

182
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:09,708
and my friend has nothing to do
with your friend

183
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,646
Think you're acting like a child.

184
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:14,023
And I think you're acting like an asshole.

185
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,522
Maybe you should go for now.

186
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,034
I'm already going.

187
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,277
It was my first fight with the Russian

188
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:34,224
and I didn't know
if it was the strong espresso

189
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,187
or the strong words but either way,

190
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:39,572
not even my feet slept that night.

191
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,557
Oh my goodness.

192
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,103
Look at you and your little coat.

193
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:49,398
Did you go shopping?

194
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,993
Princess Dandy Rich Brandy Wine. Come!

195
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:54,373
Oh, I got her.

196
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:56,536
Oh my goodness, so cute.

197
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,658
- Thank you.
- That's a mighty name for such a little dog.

198
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,214
It's a dog show name.

199
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:07,850
Oh my god, I love dog shows.

200
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,973
- Has she ever won?
- This one? Two-time loser.

201
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:12,772
She doesn't show anymore.

202
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,673
She was bred from two champion
Cavalier King Charles Spaniels

203
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:19,592
but when I tried to show her,
it turns out she has a defect.

204
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:21,030
Oh no.

205
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,776
One of her hind legs is too short.

206
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:25,035
Such a shame.
She had so much promise.

207
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:26,528
She just isn't a winner.

208
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:30,307
Well. She's awfully cute anyway.

209
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,691
I'm Charlotte York Goldenblatt.

210
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:38,246
Trudy Stork. All right. Come on.
That's enough.

211
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:45,049
- Okay. Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.

212
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:46,366
Bye.

213
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:50,502
That was the day a King Charles
met an Upper East Side princess.

214
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:55,226
Taxi.

215
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:58,760
And an upper east-sider went to
see a house in Brooklyn.

216
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,022
Where to?

217
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:08,815
Brooklyn. Please.

218
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:11,268
I don't go to Brooklyn.

219
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:15,154
Yeah, neither do I.

220
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,576
Miranda tried to see her future in Brooklyn,

221
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,953
but she just couldn't get there.

222
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,672
Oh yeah. Shitty.

223
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,338
Oh god you're good.

224
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,386
Oh fuck.

225
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:36,633
What? Oh Jesus.

226
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,479
What do I¡¦

227
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,474
Just give it to me.

228
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,380
That's a lot of hair. Does that hurt?

229
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,739
No, I'm fine. Really. So.

230
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:49,765
Where were we?

231
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:54,650
- oh.
- I'm sorry.

232
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,955
I'm gonna take a bath.

233
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:02,007
Apparently, Samantha wasn't the only one
losing something that night.

234
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,785
Samantha's not gonna die, right?

235
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,428
Of course not. She'll be fine.

236
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:12,305
Her hair started falling out
at a really bad time.

237
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,166
Oh god. Was she at work?

238
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,878
No. But she was definitely doing a job.

239
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,140
No.

240
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,099
Oh yes. Ma'am.

241
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,563
She's a trooper. She'll be fine.

242
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:24,845
Yeah I know.

243
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,810
But according to my Russian friend,
we're all in denial.

244
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,307
What? What goes he say?

245
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:30,763
Well, it went like this.

246
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,642
Him: your friend might die, yes?

247
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:36,142
Me: No. You're all asshole.

248
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:38,525
We had our first fight.

249
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:39,856
I picked up on that.

250
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:45,193
This is a man who is so sensitive
about so much but then this death,

251
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:46,289
deal with it.

252
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:49,292
I know he's Russian, but Jesus, come on.

253
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,786
Maybe it's the language barrier.

254
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:53,338
It's definitely a barrier for me.

255
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:57,018
Is this who I'm seeing?
A man kills mice and optimism?

256
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:00,252
It's not denial. They got it early.

257
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:01,761
She's gonna be fine.

258
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:05,314
You are aware that you've said
she'll be fine three times in half a block.

259
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:08,050
Yeah. I just picked up on that, too.

260
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:11,183
In any way, how's it helping her
if we freak out about it?

261
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,638
It is our job to think positive.

262
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:14,650
Exactly.

263
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,782
Can you believe we're actually
having this conversation?

264
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:21,281
No. And here's another thing
I've never thought I'd be saying.

265
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:24,329
Steve wants us to move to Brooklyn.

266
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,754
Okay. Stop. Now,

267
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:30,953
that is information I can't handle.

268
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,134
I know. I can't move to Brooklyn.

269
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:35,374
Even cabs won't go there.

270
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,653
My conversation with Miranda
brought me back to reality.

271
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,444
Or more specifically,

272
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,520
the people who want us to live in it.

273
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:53,743
The world tells us to get real.

274
00:14:53,743 --> 00:15:00,495
But what happens when living in reality
means living in pain, fear, or Brooklyn.

275
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:04,080
If the defense mechanism can get us
through the difficult times,

276
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,422
how bad can it be?

277
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,046
Maybe the reality is we need denial.

278
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,926
Denial: friend or foe?

279
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,710
Denial had become Charlotte's best friend,

280
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,844
next to Harry.

281
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:23,054
Going for a run?

282
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,885
- What are you looking at?
- Doing some research.

283
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,516
- On what?
- Adoption.

284
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,561
It could be just a backup.

285
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:36,015
You know?
If we put ourselves on some lists.

286
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,683
By the time we know what's what,

287
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,116
we'll have some choices.

288
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:40,522
What do you think?

289
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,823
That seems like the right thing to do.

290
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,049
- Hi. Trudy.
- Hi.

291
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:58,267
Hi Dandy Rich. Hi.

292
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:01,637
I brought you a present.

293
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,963
It's turkey bacon. Is that all right?

294
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,801
Oh sure. She's not a show dog.

295
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:12,189
Do you like that?

296
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:15,935
Well she really loves you.

297
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,284
Who wouldn't love her.

298
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:19,984
Look at that face.

299
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:29,483
You know. Just because somebody doesn't
perform the way that you want them to,

300
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:32,285
doesn't mean you should just give up on them.

301
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,883
Oh I'm sorry. I swore I wouldn't cry.

302
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:44,833
I'm trying to have a baby
and it's just not going very well.

303
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,845
That day, thanks to a dog with one short leg,

304
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:52,307
Charlotte stopped denying her short comings.

305
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:57,186
I don't care for babies. Or labs.

306
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,573
Thanks for coming.

307
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:04,911
Are you kidding me?
This is gonna be fun.

308
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:07,367
I used to do this
when I was 16 at the mall.

309
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:09,948
Without the cancer part.

310
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:18,385
I have a movie premiere and I need to
look like myself at my most fabulous.

311
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,787
What would you like, natural hair or acrylic?

312
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,381
Sweetheart, does it look like I'd do acrylic?

313
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,918
These are our best natural hair.

314
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:29,707
Sassy and pretty-me.

315
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,959
No and no.

316
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,102
Fine. Let's try this.

317
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,855
It's from the Riding the Greek Mine.

318
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,450
This looks like you?

319
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:48,529
Carrie, how do I look?

320
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,824
You look like Florence Henderson.

321
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:52,704
Florence Henderson in a bad wig.

322
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:57,288
Listen, I can't be on the red carpet
in a bad rug.

323
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,919
Do you understand?

324
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:03,368
I know.

325
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:08,924
This is Candy. She's very popular.

326
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:13,765
I don't think you're listening.

327
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,054
I don't wanna look like Candy.

328
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,308
I just wanna look like myself.

329
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:21,899
Ma'am. These are wigs.

330
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:24,729
They're not ever gonna look exactly like you.

331
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,773
That is not acceptable.

332
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,118
We could style the bang.

333
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,643
Don't touch my head.

334
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:32,628
I've worked with many women with cancer.

335
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,856
I don't have cancer. I have a premiere.

336
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:39,366
And I don't want some second rate wig
named after a hooker.

337
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,327
My hair is my thing.

338
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:45,538
This is bullshit.

339
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:46,955
Carrie?

340
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:48,344
We're going.

341
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:53,134
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,680
I'm just so angry.

343
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,233
The Kemo I can handle.
But this hair thing. It's too much.

344
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,725
Sweetie, we'll find you a better wig.
I have left hair all over Manhattan.

345
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,576
Every time the wind blows,
I have to check to make sure I'm not bald.

346
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,729
It's only temporary. It'll grow back.

347
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:12,652
Until then, I have to look like a sick person
and I don't do sick person.

348
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,739
Because you're not.

349
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:17,581
You're someone had a little blip
of bad luck and now it's over.

350
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:18,869
What if it's not over?

351
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,242
It's over. So over.

352
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:23,118
What if it comes back?

353
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,072
I can die Carrie.

354
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,830
With really bad hair.

355
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,430
Hey, you are not going anywhere.

356
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:38,599
Carrie, please. Let me talk about
what I'm afraid of. Please?

357
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:42,226
The denial part of me wanted to
say you'll be fine.

358
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,303
Instead I said.

359
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,197
Okay. I'm here.

360
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,814
Maybe I should just shave it all off.

361
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,415
Yeah. You could be one of those fantastic
bald women who's all about earrings.

362
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,453
I better not look like fucking Co-jack.

363
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:05,862
Cancer. Turns out, not so hilarious.

364
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,415
After Samantha lost control, she did
the only thing she knew to get it back.

365
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:28,985
Babe?

366
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,110
What are you doing here?

367
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,871
I got your blackberry message.

368
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,692
What do you mean you're not coming
to my premiere?

369
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,416
I'm very busy.

370
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:50,087
I'm shaving my head, all right?

371
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:53,095
And it's scary and awful
and you can't handle it.

372
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:54,463
Who says I can't handle it?

373
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:57,208
You freaked out after just a few little hairs.

374
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,267
- You freaked out too.
- You lost your heart on.

375
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:02,635
Shit happens.

376
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:06,890
Let me be here for you.

377
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:12,282
Listen, this is very intense
and you're being very sweet

378
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:15,602
but there is no way that you can
relate to what I'm going through.

379
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:20,398
What are you doing?

380
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:25,030
No you can't. Your hair's your thing.

381
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,231
Chill out, I'm busy.

382
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:35,352
When I'm done cue balling here,

383
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,257
I'm moving right over to you.

384
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,349
That night, Smith gave Samantha
the very best head of her life.

385
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:48,734
The next day, Miranda endured
her first out of Borough experience.

386
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:53,143
Broken.

387
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:55,367
Broken.

388
00:21:55,617 --> 00:22:00,575
You mean.. Brooklyn, Brooklyn. Here.

389
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:03,080
Let me show you what we could do.

390
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,322
We tear out these closets,
we make this the dining room.

391
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:09,365
Which you wouldn't have to sleep in.

392
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:12,912
open up this fireplace,
imagine all of our friends over here,

393
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:15,346
fire's going on, having some beers.

394
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:18,169
None of our friends are coming
to Brooklyn but continue.

395
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:23,756
Miranda.

396
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,979
This isn't just about you anymore.

397
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:29,355
Brady's only gonna get bigger, god willing.

398
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,400
Look at all this space.

399
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:36,038
You want the all of us.
You, me, Brady, Scout, Fatty.

400
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:39,153
To really look at this place,

401
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:40,768
we're a family.

402
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:46,743
Oh my god. I'm married.

403
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:49,164
And that was the reality.

404
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,238
I'm gonna take Brady and the dog outside.

405
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:56,045
You let me know hat you think.

406
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:01,679
Come on let's go out back. Yeah.

407
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:18,778
Let's chase the dog.

408
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:20,745
Let's chase the dog around.

409
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:31,626
That day, Miranda couldn't deny
what was best for her family.

410
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:37,744
So, what do you think?

411
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,520
We're very interested but I'll gonna
wanna bring in an engineer.

412
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,220
I'll require a long escrow,
and if the furnace isn't up to code,

413
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,770
we'll need it replaced.

414
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:53,154
And so, she negotiated
her way into her future.

415
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,582
And Samantha realized
she couldn't deny cancer.

416
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,960
She may never be exactly
who she was again.

417
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,603
So for that night, she decided to be Lil' Kim.

418
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:44,238
It was a very special delivery from Ms. Stork.

419
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:46,540
You'll give her a better home than I ever could
Trudy Stork

420
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:52,532
Oh my goodness. Thank you. Hi.

421
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,261
It was a girl. 8 pounds 2 ounces.

422
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:00,911
Oh my goodness.

423
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:03,541
Hello, are you hungry, precious?

424
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,332
Who is that?

425
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:07,545
She's a present. Can we keep her?

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,938
Anything that makes you smile like that.

427
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:12,767
I'd be crazy not to. What's her name?

428
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:15,489
Princess Dandy Rich Brandy Wine.

429
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:17,430
Oh that's impossible. You gotta change it.

430
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,110
What should we name you pretty girl?

431
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:25,069
Who's the prettiest girl in the world.

432
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:28,870
Elizabeth Taylor.

433
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:33,882
Elizabeth Taylor Goldenblatt.

434
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:37,958
That was the day Elizabeth Taylor
moved in with Harry and Charlotte.

435
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:43,507
And something far less glamorous
moved in with me.

436
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,367
You'll stay at the fancy neighbors' now huh?

437
00:26:02,472 --> 00:26:03,698
Thanks.

438
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:07,946
I didn't think I would hear from you.

439
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,446
I was upset.

440
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:17,585
you know, I need you to not talk so that
I can say this without you confusing me.

441
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,371
Samantha is my friend.

442
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:27,592
She's my family. My insides.

443
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:32,471
She will be fine
because she has to be fine.

444
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,684
That's how important she is to me.

445
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:40,593
So, for you to say that she may not be just..

446
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:44,442
it feels very hurtful.

447
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,915
And really unnecessary.

448
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:52,270
Let me explain. My friend who died.

449
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,063
My god.

450
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:57,877
Wait. Wait. When she died,

451
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,591
I was surprised.

452
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:04,536
The amount of pain.

453
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:08,967
I didn't want you to be surprised like I was.

454
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:13,801
Well, you could have just said that.

455
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,547
We are different.

456
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,758
Yes we are.

457
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:22,340
I need my relationship with a little bit of milk.

458
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:26,156
It's clear who's the writer here, huh?

459
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:30,613
Your friend would be fine.

460
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:35,793
Thank you. And I'm sorry about Sophie.

461
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:39,070
Thank you.

462
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:44,408
That night, for the first time,

463
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:46,631
we spoke the same language.

464
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:52,462
So while Samantha's life and
my life with the Russian would continue,

465
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:56,506
it was clear that Miranda's life
as we knew it, was over.

466
00:27:56,845 --> 00:28:00,546
Brooklyn. I can't even say it,
let alone live in it.

467
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,388
You'll all come visit, right?

468
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:03,942
Talk about denial.

469
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:06,724
Stop. We'll all come, won't we?

470
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:09,224
Well I won't. I have cancer.

471
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,642
How long are you gonna play
that cancer card?

472
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:13,871
As long as it takes for you to move back.

473
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:15,744
But it's just a subway ride away.

474
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,251
Subway that goes under water.
That's not normal.

475
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:22,330
- Another Manhattan?
- Please. For all of us.

476
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:28,119
That night, Miranda was determined to
drink in as much Manhattan as she could.

477
00:28:28,377 --> 00:28:32,542
Do you remember that awful apartment
that I had on 17th street?

478
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,312
The one with the water box?

479
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,171
What about your horrifying Studio
sublet in River Side Drive?

480
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:38,630
Oh I blocked it.

481
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,762
Man, I have had some really
shitty apartments here.

482
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:44,823
Why do I think living in Manhattan
is so fantastic?

483
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,534
Because it is.

484
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:50,978
- Here we go.
- Thank you.
