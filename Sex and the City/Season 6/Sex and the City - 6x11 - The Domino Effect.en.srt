Epi 11. the domino effect

11
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:04,891
There are some New York nights
that are monumental, gigantic, historic.

12
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:07,519
Others, are just big.

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,522
Bet you can't get your steaks like
this in your little Napa Village,

14
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:13,145
now can ya?

15
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:16,491
Where do yo think these cattle comes from?
A ranch on Canal Street?

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,314
Well, what we lack in livestock,

17
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:21,518
we make up for in cabs.

18
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:22,997
Napa has cabs.

19
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:25,415
Fine, you win,
and I don't wanna fight about it.

20
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:28,787
Oh, let's.
Let's fight, then we can make out.

21
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,915
So, what's on your New York agenda?

22
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:35,614
Making some deals, breaking some hearts?

23
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:36,920
Can I tell you a secret?

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,203
That's not your real hair?

25
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm having a little heart thing done.

26
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:46,264
What?

27
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:48,816
They found a blockage.
So I'm getting a, you know,

28
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,562
angioplasty.

29
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:52,772
Simple procedure, no big deal.

30
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,056
But,

31
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:56,322
I can kiss these good bye.

32
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,946
Carrie.

33
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:03,815
Calm down.

34
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,119
Come on.
Don't be such a sissy.

35
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,193
It's nothing.

36
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:11,711
They do a million of these a day.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,408
It's like having your teeth cleaned.

38
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,620
Um, miss?

39
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,462
Um,

40
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:21,713
she's fine.

41
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:23,931
Could you bring some extra napkins?

42
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,768
And some violins.

43
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:34,721
Uptown, there was a different kind
of dinner being prepared.

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,398
With less cholesterol and no tears.

45
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,818
Oh my god.

46
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,123
Hey.

47
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,403
How ever you got in here,

48
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:45,662
I don't care,

49
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,127
I applaud you.

50
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:49,278
Miranda's new neighbor,
Doctor Robert Leeds

51
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:51,790
had quicky become her new boyfriend.

52
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,407
Doctor of all trades.

53
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,879
Magda let me in.
She was very excited at the idea of

54
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,285
someone actually using your kitchen
to prepare food.

55
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:00,049
Well, it's a first.

56
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:02,466
I didn't know you could cook.

57
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,677
I make one thing.

58
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,974
Enchiladas, baby.

59
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,391
Spicy.

60
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,387
You can handle it.

61
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,663
Oh my god.

62
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,575
I have plate's mats?

63
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,873
How am I gonna repay you for all this?

64
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:38,999
I only make lean cuisine.

65
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,411
I have one idea.

66
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,662
Done.

67
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,756
No, it's another idea.
But it's related.

68
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,672
Take tomorrow off.

69
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,181
From work?

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,756
I don't do that.

71
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:53,813
Just think about it.

72
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,019
Brady's with his dad,

73
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,817
I don't have to work until seven.
We can spend the whole day together.

74
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,863
Bet you have a few personal days stored up.

75
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:03,978
Just think about it.

76
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:08,789
Truth be told, Miranda had never
taken a personal day in her entire career.

77
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,991
But then again, no one had evermade her enchiladas before.

78
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:33,590
Whoa, geez, whoa.

79
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,258
- Arghh.
- Oh, oh, hey.

80
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,323
Steve, what are you doing here?

81
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,305
Oh my god, are you ok?

82
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,320
I see spots.

83
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:44,983
Let me take a look at that.

84
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:46,608
Who the hell are you?

85
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:47,600
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,355
I forgot Brady's eardrops.

87
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,704
What are you doing here?

88
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,283
I took a personal day.

89
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,111
- I'm Robert.
- This is Robert.

90
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:55,663
- I'm a doctor.
- He's doctor

91
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,489
and my boyfriend.

92
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,910
I'm sorry. Is it weird that I just
called you that?

93
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,372
No, I like it.

94
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,502
Hey, do you wanna help me
here or what?

95
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:05,161
Yeah, yeah, let's take this in the bathroom.

96
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:06,417
Can you get some ice?

97
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,468
Bend your head forward slightly
and have a seat.

98
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:11,471
So, how long have you two been hanging out?

99
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:13,421
Oh, about a month.

100
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,091
I was gonna mention it
when the time was right.

101
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:19,361
I was just waiting for the right time.

102
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,844
- Apply pressure.
- So, anyway, this is Steve,

103
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:23,511
- Brady's dad.
- Good to meet you, Steve.

104
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,143
Oh my god.
Who's watching the baby?

105
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:28,570
My ma, and Debbie.

106
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,437
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just bruised.

107
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:32,149
- I'm gonna need a tampon.
- What?

108
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,359
- What the fuck?
- It's a little trick we use at work,

109
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,736
and some scissors.

110
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,995
What are you,
some nose guy or something?

111
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:41,419
No, I'm in sports medicine.

112
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:42,406
For the Knicks.

113
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,838
Adding insult to injury.

114
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,415
Now, this should do it.

115
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:59,212
So, that pretty much solves the problem

116
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:01,219
of how Robert and Steve are going to meet.

117
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,807
I guess I can check that off my list
of things to do.

118
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,937
That's horrifying.

119
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,236
I will continue to be horrified
by that story all day long.

120
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,976
And poor Steve,

121
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:16,535
he was in such a vulnerable position
with the sex and the bloody nose,

122
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,404
and the doctor boyfriend.

123
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,735
Well, you won.

124
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,240
It's not a competition.

125
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:22,384
You're right.

126
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:26,328
She's being fucked by a hot, black doctor
and Steve had a tampon up his nose.

127
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:27,533
No contest.

128
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,260
Ok, I hate to admit this,

129
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,087
but there is part of me that took
some pleasure in the whole thing.

130
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,052
Is that terrible?

131
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:38,803
Well, no.
It's not as like you planned it that way,

132
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:39,513
did you?

133
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:40,802
No.

134
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:43,026
I'm crazy about Robert.

135
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:45,681
So, why do I even care what Steve thinks?

136
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,183
Because you've been through a lot with him.

137
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:49,815
Some people just get under your skin
and stay there.

138
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,234
- When I say Big the other night,..
- Big is in town?

139
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,652
Yeah, he's here for a little heart thing.

140
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:56,332
What? Is he on the list to get one?

141
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,443
No.

142
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:01,444
And you're going to feel
incredibly bad in a minute.

143
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,331
He's here because
he's having heart surgery.

144
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,708
Ok, I'm officially a monster.
Please continue.

145
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,784
No, it's ok.

146
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,496
It's actually a fairly routine procedure.
They found a blockage.

147
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:17,007
Honey.

148
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,844
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,974
This is exactly what happened
the other night when he told me.

150
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,817
I know, I know he's gonna be fine.

151
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:28,564
But,

152
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,311
what is going on with me?

153
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,977
Yoo hoo, ladies lunching.

154
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,989
Bitsy Von Muffling had recentlymarried cabaret singer, Bobby Fine

155
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:41,956
known to everyone
but Bitsy as the gayest gay man alive.

156
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,831
Hi.

157
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,531
My goodness. Look at you.

158
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,583
Can you believe it?
Me, pregnant.

159
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:52,881
It's a girl Bobby is so excited,
he's already got two names picked out.

160
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,376
Judy or Barbara.

161
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:56,369
We're gonna wait to what she looks like.

162
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,305
I like Judy.

163
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,261
And I owe it all to Dr. Mao.

164
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,547
Or as we call him Dr. Wow,

165
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,902
acupuncturist slash miracle worker.

166
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:10,677
Seriously, I couldn't take it anymore with
the IUl's, and the IVF's, and the I give up.

167
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:13,687
Anyway, then I go to this guy,
and poof, I'm with child.

168
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,194
Just from going to acupuncture?

169
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:19,104
I don't know how the hell it works,
but this guy could get a cactus pregnant.

170
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,273
Anyway, I've got to run.

171
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:23,070
Or shall I say, waddle.

172
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,414
It was great seeing you girls.

173
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:26,840
Bye.

174
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,285
How is that physically possible?

175
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:33,868
That woman is like 50 years old.

176
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,207
And married to a fag.

177
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,215
I have got to go see that Dr. Mao.

178
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,304
Hello.

179
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,310
I have a three o'clock with Dr. Mao?

180
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,811
I know someone who tried for 5 yearsand never saw results.

181
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,896
Did she drink the teas religiously?

182
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:03,152
Tell her to drink the teas. They're smelly, but they work.

183
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:05,995
My friend Lois got pregnant on her third visit.

184
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,705
I knew a woman who was toldshe'd never get pregnant ever,

185
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:11,256
because she wasn't ovulating.

186
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:14,369
And guess what,she's expecting her fourth this Christmas.

187
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:16,244
That's fabulous.

188
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:19,422
And then this woman said that the
teas and the herbs are really important.

189
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:22,749
And I'm just wondering because
I started facility treatments with my first husband,

190
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,020
but now I'm remarried.

191
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,550
So, this woman thought that I should..
Mrs. Goldenblatt,

192
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,296
I have all that information.

193
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:30,527
Let's just concentrate on what
we're doing here,

194
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,682
in this room.

195
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:33,557
Now, I'll be back in twenty minutes.

196
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:36,113
Just relax with your own thoughts.

197
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:50,446
I knew a woman who was told
she'd never get pregnant ever,

198
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:52,507
because she wasn't ovulating.
And guess what,

199
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,627
she's expecting her fourth this Christmas.

200
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:59,798
From eastern medicine on the Upper West Side

201
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,476
Hello?

202
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,801
to western medicine on Upper East Side.

203
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,447
Hey, kid.

204
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,944
How are you?

205
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,237
I'm alive.

206
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:22,735
Asshole.

207
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,038
What did you think?
I'd be dead already?

208
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,915
I don't know.

209
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:29,629
Hospitals scare me.

210
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,334
Oh, I'm fine. I'm great.

211
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,860
I've never felt better.

212
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,806
Boy, you should've seen your face.

213
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,722
You're such an easy mark.

214
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,543
Oh, oh. It's Ruby time.

215
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:48,341
- Ruby's my favorite.
- He says that to all the nurses, doesn't he?

216
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:49,765
It's a safe assumption.

217
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,653
All right, darling. Come on. Up.

218
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,911
Oh boy, there she goes again.

219
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,907
All waterworks.
come on, take it easy.

220
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:05,194
I'm sorry. Just ignore me.

221
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:09,381
Oh, so sweet.
She's worried about you.

222
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:13,380
Don't cry.
You husband will be fine.

223
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,413
No, no, I'm not.
He's not my husband.

224
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:21,210
Meanwhile, Samantha welcomed
Smith back from his movie location

225
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,669
with open arms.

226
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:25,877
Now, put your index finger
on my clit.

227
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:28,893
Oh, good.

228
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,022
But less pressure.

229
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:34,351
Ok, now two fingers.

230
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,105
A little higher.

231
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,660
A little bit more to the left.

232
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,524
Now, do you feel that?

233
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,482
Did you take a directing seminar
while I was gone?

234
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:49,524
I did some summer reading.

235
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:52,711
Ok, now keep your finger there
but move your thumb.

236
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,590
Higher, higher.

237
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:58,886
Oh, I missed those hands.

238
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:04,371
- So, what do you want to eat?
Later, without directions,

239
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:07,189
Smith tried the most intimate
hand position of all.

240
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,897
I don't know. What do you feel like?

241
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,505
Sushi, maybe.

242
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:14,591
Or Thai.

243
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:17,197
Oh, I just had..

244
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:21,726
Babe?

245
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:24,238
You ok?

246
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,755
I have a new sympathy for the disabled.

247
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:35,030
What happened to you?

248
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,664
Oh, I'm fine, I just fell into one of those
hatches on the sidewalk.

249
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:38,783
It was stupid.

250
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,283
Oh my god, that's my biggest fear.
How did that happen?

251
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:43,175
It was Smith's fault.

252
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,044
He did something to me that was so perverse.

253
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,392
Ok, I'm just gonna say it.

254
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,217
He tried to hold my hand.

255
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:54,438
You mean to tell me that
Smith is a hand-holder?

256
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,385
And to think he once served us food.

257
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,813
You laugh,
but it's part of a bigger problem.

258
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:03,654
Do you know I didn't fuck
a single or a married guy

259
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:07,201
the whole time Smith was out of town.
And I'll tell you something else.

260
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:09,906
I missed him.

261
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,938
Well, it sounds to me like he missed you too.

262
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,955
Hence the deviant behavior.

263
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:18,038
Like it or not, that little tadpole is
wide open in there for you.

264
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,668
Life's short,

265
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:22,126
you might wanna consider holding his hand.

266
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:23,880
Yuck.

267
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,554
Ok, it happened again.
The crying.

268
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:30,545
When I visited Big at the hospital.

269
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:32,015
That's three times now.

270
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,218
I suggest water proof mascara.

271
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:37,141
I finally figured out that the only way
to have Big in my life was to

272
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,603
block oput certain feelings, and now

273
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:42,642
every feeling that I've ever had
is bubbling up all over the place

274
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:45,100
with nowhere to go except myeye balls.

275
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,229
So, what are you gonna do about it?

276
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:48,024
Nothing. There's nothing to do.

277
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:50,538
Big is who he is.
He's never gonna change.

278
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,607
He's limited and I acept that.

279
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:56,111
So, he'll go back to Napa,
and I'll go back to not crying.

280
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,794
The end.

281
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,451
Honey, if it hurts so much,
why are we going shopping?

282
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:03,457
I have a broken toe,
not a broken spirit.

283
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:05,680
Well, come on then.
Move that booty.

284
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,046
If New York City's signature fruit is the apple,

285
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,800
then its signature sound is the ambulance siren.

286
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:21,646
It seems like all day,
every day people are getting hurt.

287
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:23,894
And the whole city has to hear about it.

288
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,582
But what about the injuries that don't get a siren.

289
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:31,480
Whether you're falling into the hole
in the street

290
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,417
or possibly falling back in love.

291
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:38,001
Just how dangerous is an open heart?

292
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:55,318
Hi, can I please be connected to room 817?

293
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,176
Let me see.

294
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,593
That patient left the hospital this morning.

295
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,270
Well.

296
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,395
How d'you find me?

297
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:09,983
When you weren't at the morgue,

298
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,740
I figured you were at the Four Seasons,
and here you are.

299
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,643
You know I'd invite you in, Sniffles.

300
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,289
but I've run out of Kleenex.

301
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,909
Should I call the concierge
or did you bring your own?

302
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,846
Oh, I'm sorry.

303
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:24,572
You must have me confused with
someone else.

304
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:28,172
I'm Candy, your Candy striper.

305
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,534
- Stop.
- Put your coat back on.

306
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:32,878
Are you trying to kill me?

307
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,881
I can't smoke, I can't drink,

308
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,639
and I can't get excited.

309
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,901
About anything.

310
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,294
I'm in the union.

311
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:42,976
- I know the rules.
- It's a damn shame, too

312
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,601
because I love a cute candy stripper.

313
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:48,039
This isn't about stripping,
it's about striping.

314
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:51,386
Um, it's a complete waste of hotel room
if you ask me.

315
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:52,824
What are we gonna do now?

316
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:57,113
Oh, Candy's got a whole bag full
of PG fun in here.

317
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,666
Oh, goodie.

318
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,466
Starting with

319
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:01,972
dominos.

320
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:03,035
Classic

321
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:04,943
- and day glow.
- Dominos?

322
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,834
Why don't you just take off your dress
and kill me now, get it over with?

323
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,179
Nobody wins with that kind of attitude.

324
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,834
Meanwhile across town,

325
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,254
another caregiver has taken precautions.

326
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:22,298
I know, I know. Almost done.

327
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,518
Here, there we are.

328
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:25,850
Now we're..

329
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:34,276
Steve might have gotten knocked out
the other night,

330
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:38,315
but Miranda had no idea
his girlfriend was a knock-out.

331
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,791
- Hey.
- Hi, Miranda.

332
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,169
Hello, it's nice to..

333
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,962
Oh my gosh.

334
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,365
I'm fine.

335
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,563
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Miranda.

336
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:51,758
This is my girlfriend, Debbie.

337
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:54,234
Are you sure you're ok?
You really came down hard there.

338
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:57,213
I'm fine, really. Thank you.

339
00:16:57,213 --> 00:17:00,642
Hey there, Bradylicious. Hi.

340
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:03,158
Oh good, you're back.

341
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:06,980
Robert, this is Debbie.

342
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:09,559
- And you remember Steve.
- Yeah.

343
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:11,396
You're sure all right, babe?

344
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:13,437
Cuz I saw you go flying there.

345
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,773
What?

346
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,125
I'm fine. It was nothing.

347
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:22,374
Robert is just over protective
because he's a doctor.

348
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,323
Oh.

349
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:25,330
- For the Knicks.
- Get out.

350
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,700
Did you hear that, Stevie?
The Knicks!

351
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,736
Yeah, yeah, I know.

352
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:29,823
What a cool job!

353
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:32,825
It's like crazy cool.

354
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:35,266
Debby works for Mastercard,
corporate headquarters.

355
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:37,254
Really?

356
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,418
I have a Mastercard.

357
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:41,083
You know Steve won't even let me
talk on the phone

358
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,191
when there's a Knicks game on.

359
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:43,677
Even if I'm in the other room.

360
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:45,108
I didn't know you were a Knicks man.

361
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:46,901
Yeah, I follow all the New York teams.

362
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,428
He lives for the Knicks.

363
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:51,536
One time he took me to a game,
and our seats were so high up.

364
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,470
What do they call that section?

365
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,021
The nosebleed section.

366
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:58,165
I can use to(?) scrounge up a few
courtside seats if you're ever interested.

367
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,184
That's ok. I like my seats.

368
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:02,777
- Take the seats.
- I don't need the seats.

369
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:03,571
Take the seats.

370
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:07,390
As Miranda and Steve continued
needling each other on the playground,

371
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,673
Dr. Mao was busy needling Charlotte
in his office.

372
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:15,308
And this time, she was determined to
drown out the voices in her head.

373
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:17,373
I'll be back in about twenty minutes.

374
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,923
Just try to relax and find your center.

375
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:22,145
Ok.

376
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,779
Unfortunately, she couldn't drown out the
voices on the street.

377
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:44,731
When Charlotte opened her mind to
Chinese medicine,

378
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:48,004
she didn't expect a visit
from the Cuban Liberation Front.

379
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,053
Dr. Mao.

380
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:55,799
Hello.

381
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:58,173
Dr. Mao.

382
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,479
I can't get centered.

383
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:04,084
Is there a quieter room?

384
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:05,452
Cuz i'm trying to relax and find my center,

385
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:07,586
but I just can't do that with all these noise.

386
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:09,011
Charlotte,

387
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,977
the city will never quiet down.

388
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:14,424
You're gonna have to learn to
block out that New York noise

389
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,367
and listen only to yourself.

390
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:23,559
Charlotte was beginning to think
that the solution to her problem

391
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,533
wasn't finding her center,

392
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,595
but finding some earplugs.

393
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:31,734
The actors are cool,
location was great.

394
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:33,478
whole thing was off the hook.

395
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:35,999
Man, I missed you.

396
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,883
Look, I know where you want to put your hand

397
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:42,350
and I'm sorry,
but I'm just not that kind of girl.

398
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:45,967
Samantha, I like you,

399
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,374
you like me.

400
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:49,408
And I've had enough with this horseshit.

401
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:52,864
Just fucking hold my hand.

402
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:57,891
Fine,

403
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,195
but only until my foot heals.

404
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:06,245
And that's how Samantha
lost her virginity to Smith.

405
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:19,300
Hmm. you've had too many
on that end and they're crooked.

406
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,073
Especially those last four.

407
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:25,238
Hey, I'm doing all the heavylifting here,
you're sitting there like a log.

408
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:26,916
I'm in recovery.

409
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,386
Oh, excuses, excuses.

410
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,898
And they're too closely spaced together.

411
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:36,059
See, you don't understand the delicate
balance of physics involved in this.

412
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,099
Well, that's true, This is really
more your generation's game,

413
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:42,123
whereas I came of age in the part(?) cheesy era.

414
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:48,038
So I guess this is what we'd
be like in our seventies, huh?

415
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,623
No sex and board games.

416
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,999
Oh, you're already thinking about
your next birthday?

417
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,215
Seriously, kid.

418
00:20:57,904 --> 00:21:00,689
You and me,

419
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,911
we really were special.

420
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,357
Yes, make me big potato, I'll meet you there.

421
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,952
Are you ok?

422
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:22,016
Oh my god, you're burning up.

423
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,187
Here come on, let's get you in bed.

424
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:25,944
Uh-huh, ok.

425
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:31,168
Well, it's down to 101.

426
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:34,366
Well, that's good to hear.

427
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:36,487
Right.

428
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:39,446
So, I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.

429
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:42,713
Ok, thank you so much, doctor.

430
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,173
Well, he thinks you're gonna be fine.

431
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,502
Is this wash cloth still cold?

432
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:54,384
Yeah, that feels nice.

433
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:55,977
Good.

434
00:21:57,712 --> 00:21:59,801
You're an angel, you know that?

435
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,876
Nah, I'm just doing my job.

436
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,233
I'm serious.

437
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,173
What are we doing?

438
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:13,947
I'm talking about us.

439
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,493
Life's too short.

440
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,748
What are we doing?

441
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:37,223
I don't know.

442
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,407
It took the best heart surgeon in New York,

443
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:09,634
but Big's heart was finally unblocked.

444
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,390
In fact, it was wide open.

445
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:22,159
The next morning by the light of day,

446
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,581
both injured parties were rebounding nicely.

447
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:27,940
- Hi.
- Hey, bobs.

448
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,831
- How was he?
- Good.

449
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,036
- A little cranky when he woke up.
- Yeah?

450
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:33,570
So,

451
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:37,202
- that was funny the other day.
- Yeah, it was fun.

452
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,459
Wait, did you say it was fun or funny?

453
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:41,943
I said funny, I think.

454
00:23:41,943 --> 00:23:43,613
But I guess I meant fun.

455
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:46,949
Debbie seems really nice.

456
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:49,186
Thanks. I think so.

457
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:51,369
So does Robert..

458
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,810
- Is he Rob or Robert?
- Robert.

459
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,546
Yeah, He seems like a really good guy.

460
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:58,654
Yeah.

461
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,727
Miranda.

462
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,536
Hey, morning, Steve.

463
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,060
How's that nose.

464
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,725
- You little guy.
- Much better.

465
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:18,394
I keep telling people that Debbie punched me.

466
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:20,044
She loves that.

467
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,971
Well, then. I'm outta here.

468
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:25,595
Hey. Later.

469
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:34,628
Oh my god, Charlotte.

470
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:36,552
Hey there. Hi there.

471
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,592
Heather Greason told me
she saw you at Dr. Mao's.

472
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:42,372
Didn't you love him?
You feel like a pin cushion, I know,

473
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:44,573
but can't you feel it working?

474
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:45,685
Sort of.

475
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,137
Well, do you know Isabelle Reed?

476
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,055
Horrible woman.

477
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,061
But she's got a great story.

478
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,973
she tried everything, and I mean
everything before she went to Dr. Mao's.

479
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:56,997
Anyway, she started going four times
a week, taking the herbs.

480
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,336
You have to take the herbs.
Are you taking the herbs?

481
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,821
It turned out that Dr. Mao was a miracle worker.

482
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:05,026
Because in just two short sessions,

483
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:08,933
he taught Charlotte to block out all the
New York noise she didn't need to hear.

484
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,267
Hey.

485
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,299
How long have you been up?

486
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,819
Just a few minutes.

487
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,471
How are you feeling?

488
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,224
Better.

489
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:29,919
I feel like myself again.

490
00:25:30,243 --> 00:25:33,230
- Let's see.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

491
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,943
Excuse me.

492
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,041
It was a shift imperceptible to anyone but me.

493
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:50,297
But I knew Big's heart had closed again.

494
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:55,995
Maybe it would reopen in another
five years, maybe it wouldn't.

495
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:59,559
But I knew myself well enough to know
that that's not enough.

496
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:07,646
Hey, I'm gonna order breakfast.
What do you want?

497
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:10,255
Just get me some cornflakes and juice.

498
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:11,642
Thanks.

499
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:13,319
For the first time all week,

500
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,368
I didn't feel like crying.

501
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:26,332
Life's too short.

502
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:43,540
