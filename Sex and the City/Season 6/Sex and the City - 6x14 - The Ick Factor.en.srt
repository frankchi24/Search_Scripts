Epi 14. The Ick Factor

11
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:54,574
In autumn, New Yorkers treat every nice day
as if it could be their last.

12
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:59,515
I'd have another? what do you say?

13
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,105
You're a bad influence.

14
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:04,113
I waited and waited.
You said to meet you at the subway.

15
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:06,861
I was at the subway.
I was at the foot of the stairs.

16
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:09,965
You were at the subway?
You was in the subway.

17
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:12,983
Oh you don't know how to give directions!
I waited three¡¦

18
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,002
- It's gonna be us in thirty years.
- Pease don't say that.

19
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,918
I'm kidding. That could never be us.

20
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:18,761
That already was us, remember?

21
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,838
Yeah but that was then.

22
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:24,705
So for the future, I don't wanna become that.

23
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:27,482
Okay. I don't want you to worry
about becoming that.

24
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,839
Okay. I won't.

25
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:31,893
Anything else we don't want?

26
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,564
Yeah. I don't want you paying for these beers.

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,356
I'm serious. Your turn.

28
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:39,699
Okay.

29
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,533
- I don't wanna become your mother.
- That's good.

30
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,725
I don't wanna slack off like I used to.

31
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:48,318
I don't wanna be so moody. This is fun.

32
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,921
I don't wanna lose you again.

33
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:55,197
Even if I screw up all the other stuff,
that's the one that matters.

34
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,284
I don't wanna lose you either.

35
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:02,786
Will you marry me?

36
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:08,555
Are you serious?

37
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:12,643
Yes. Will you?

38
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:15,102
Hell yeah.

39
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:20,413
Some couples have to say their I don'ts before
they can ever imagine saying their I dos.

40
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,711
80 blocks and a world away,

41
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:35,706
I was enjoying a different kind of happy hour
at Aleksandr Patrovsky's.

42
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,495
That's pretty. What is that?

43
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:55,274
It's a little tune I've made up for you.

44
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:58,050
What? No you didn't.

45
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,475
Yes I did.

46
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:02,318
La femme avec les yeux lumineux.

47
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:09,198
Which means a woman with a luminous,
shining, sparkling eyes.

48
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:25,749
That is the cheesiest thing
I have ever heard in my life. Ick!

49
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:28,873
I know. I can't even look at you all right now.

50
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:30,122
I'm so embarrassed.

51
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,210
It all sounds very old world to me.

52
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,096
Very 18th century Russia.

53
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:37,047
Yes and I live in New York City Circa now.

54
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,732
I think it's romantic if someone offers
me a sit on the subway.

55
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:41,516
That is romantic.

56
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:45,731
We are just starved for real romance
and that is the sad truth.

57
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,297
I'm not starved. Smith is in LA for the week

58
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:50,769
and he calls me every night
before he goes to sleep.

59
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:52,032
Phone sex does not count.

60
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,193
I'm drinking a glass of wine while we do it.

61
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,959
I wanna hear more about the romance.
What else? What else did he do?

62
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,877
Well. There was one more thing
but if you I tell you,

63
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:04,290
it will be the ick heard around the world.

64
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,917
It will not.

65
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:08,793
You know the song that he wrote for me?

66
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,296
Yeah. Ick.

67
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:12,738
Well, it had a name.

68
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,155
La femme avec les yeux lumineux.

69
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:22,303
The woman with eyes that Sparkle?

70
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,072
What's French for ick?

71
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:24,887
EEEck.

72
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:28,598
And I swear to you while he was playing it,
I floated up out of my body

73
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:32,870
and I was on the ceiling looking down at myself thinking¡¦

74
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,603
'come on!'

75
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:37,819
He was just expressing genuine
emotion in an old fashioned way.

76
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,953
But it's not genuine. It's pure show.

77
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:42,934
I can't stand all that artificial hoo-hah.

78
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:46,552
That's why I proposed to Steve over $3 beers.

79
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:51,416
You proposed?

80
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,546
You proposed marriage?

81
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:56,352
Okay. Everybody stop. It's not a big deal.

82
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,010
I'm not engaged.

83
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,047
I'm not doing the big circus wedding.

84
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:03,506
There will be no white dress or bridesmaids or posed pictures.

85
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,597
I hate all that shit.

86
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:09,781
Well that's your choice.
Every bride has to find her own style.

87
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,023
When is it gonna be?

88
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:15,122
Soon as I can find some place
that doesn't make me hurl.

89
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:17,148
It's just gonna be a simple, nothing thing.

90
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:19,507
I don't even care about the wedding.

91
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,325
I just wanna be with Steve.

92
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,659
Oh. Miranda.

93
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:25,262
Okay. This is exactly what I don't want.

94
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:26,491
No tears.

95
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:27,796
Oh my god.

96
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,536
I can't believe it.

97
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,422
That's it. You're all freaking me out.

98
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,881
Samantha, I expected more from you.

99
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,272
He just felt inspired to write her a song
and then he played it for her.

100
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,523
Isn't that the most romantic thing
you've ever heard?

101
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:48,161
Yeah. Not bad.

102
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,851
I used to play clarinet when I was little.

103
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,064
This is so good. You have to have some.

104
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,313
Doesn't that taste like real butter pecan?

105
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,776
Okay. If that's what we're playing, sure.

106
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,135
I can pretend it's whipped flavored
air's the real thing. Yum.

107
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,637
I mean it's something out of the Victorian novel.

108
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:07,951
People just don't do those things anymore.

109
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,874
Hey I can be romantic too, you know.

110
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:12,423
Oh honey I know you can.

111
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:15,837
I think it's romantic that you walk me
to the Tasti-Eelight every night.

112
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:17,729
Don't humor me.

113
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,018
I know how to do romance right.
It's not just for foo foo foreigners.

114
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:25,934
In fact, I am gonna take you out
for a real romantic night on the town.

115
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,121
Wining and dining baby. Really?

116
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,281
You bet. Let me get another lick of that.

117
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,281
I don't wanna make a big entrance.
I don't want everyone staring at me.

118
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:40,144
And from looking to loving.

119
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:42,406
I just wanted to be like us. Like...

120
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:46,364
not like one of those millions cookie
cutter weddings I had to suffer through.

121
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,753
How do we do that?

122
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:51,378
What about one of those boat rides that
goes all around the island? That's different.

123
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,993
We're not boat people. When have we ever
been on a boat together, ever?

124
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:57,962
Okay. You got a better idea?

125
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,561
- Shit.
- Oh, shit.

126
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:04,522
This is so us. We are pathetic.

127
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:08,227
This gum is like super glue. Look at this.

128
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,349
You see? We're bad people, not boat people.

129
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,326
We should get married right here in this mess.

130
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:16,701
We're gonna have to if I can't get this gum off.

131
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:20,892
Hey.

132
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,665
That's a nice garden.

133
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:26,119
Yeah. It's pretty.

134
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:28,794
But not corny.

135
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,783
What do you think?

136
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,746
I don't hate it.

137
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:39,162
The only thing harder than choosing a spot
for a wedding when you hate weddings

138
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:40,329
What about a guestbook?

139
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,768
Is choosing a wedding gift
for a friend who hates weddings.

140
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:46,526
Sweetie, there's gonna be like 8 of us there.
There's no one to keep track of.

141
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,928
- Can't believe Miranda's getting married.
- I know.

142
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,557
- This is pretty.
- She'll hate that. Too domestic.

143
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:53,964
And too bridy.

144
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,235
Yeah. Let's try not to piss her off.

145
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:59,305
Well maybe we should just buy her a stapler
and wrap it in brown paper

146
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:00,710
and just smear just dog poo on it.

147
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,817
You think she'd be comfortable with that?

148
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:07,237
Fine. We'll get the dish.

149
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:11,504
Ladies. I have something to tell you.

150
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,714
And you're not going to like it.

151
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:16,972
If you get married and leave me all alone,
I will kill you.

152
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:20,437
As you know I have always loved my body
just the way it is.

153
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,534
My legs are fantastic, I have killer abs.

154
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,137
My ass is perfection.

155
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,919
Is this the part we're not gonna like?

156
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,910
But I have decided after careful consideration

157
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:33,235
that I might be ready for bigger boobs.

158
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,349
Since when?

159
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,913
Since I had a cold hard dose of reality.

160
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,688
From this. Look.

161
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,607
You're in 'In Touch' magazine?

162
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,451
And that's your source of reality?

163
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:49,452
Yes. They named Smith Jarred
the number one hot guy to watch.

164
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,460
They followed him all over town for a week.

165
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,494
I'm in half the pictures. See.

166
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:57,115
There are my boobs on Wednesday.
See how small they are?

167
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,833
There they are again on Thursday.
Teeny tiny.

168
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,811
And there they are having lunch.
You can barely see them.

169
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,454
I should have bought my loop.

170
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:08,413
I can't believe you would actually
consider having a boob job.

171
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,775
I can't believe you went to Planet Hollywood.

172
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:13,628
You are a confident intelligent woman.

173
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:15,475
Why would you wanna look like a bimbo.

174
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:18,075
I wouldn't be getting the watermelon
freak show kind.

175
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,455
I'd get something tasteful. Something like...

176
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:26,481
- yours. Yours are good.
- Mine?

177
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:31,670
- What's wrong with mine?
- They're not bad either. Let's see.

178
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,531
Okay. All right. Get hers.

179
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,763
No.

180
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,679
A few days later the rain came.

181
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:41,373
Listen if you like this poem.

182
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,166
Poem?

183
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,951
And so did the poetry.

184
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:49,636
So long had life together been that
once the snow began to fall

185
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,874
it seemed an ending

186
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:56,113
that leads to flakes should make her eye lids wince.

187
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,193
I chilled them with my hand and

188
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:02,860
they pretending not to believe that
cherishing of eyes would beat

189
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,982
against my palm like butterflies.

190
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,564
That is some serious stuff.

191
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:13,982
Had enough, huh?

192
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:16,676
No. It's beautiful.

193
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,629
How about I read you a little bit of
my favorite poetry?

194
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,927
Please.

195
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:29,214
Cocktails at Tiffany's calls for classic charm.

196
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:33,252
Oscar Delarenta(?) sleeveless silk five.

197
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:38,222
Full skirted dress with black-patented
leather bow belt.

198
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:43,799
Now that is pure poetry.

199
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,646
Oscar's a good friend of mine.

200
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,515
I'll tell him you like the dress.

201
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:51,743
Oscar? You call him Oscar?

202
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,702
It's his name, isn't it?

203
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,778
So you feel uncomfortable with the poetry.

204
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:59,578
Why is that?

205
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:06,677
Look. I'm sorry. Perhaps we were
not properly introduced.

206
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:13,792
I write a column based on the assumption
that romance is either dead or just phony.

207
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,089
You think I'm phony?

208
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,954
No. Not at all. I'm the one that
feels like a phony.

209
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,981
Frankly, I'm just not used to these grand gestures.

210
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:32,230
You mean no other man,
no one write you a little poem

211
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,833
or played a little music for you?

212
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,847
No. No they have not.

213
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,231
Wow.

214
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,818
Okay.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,095
I'm in over my head. Where are you?

216
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,469
Shopping for my wedding dress
on my lunch hour.

217
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,344
I said no white, no ivory.

218
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,440
No nothing that says virgin.

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,033
I have a child. The jig is up.

220
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:11,318
So. Yesterday the Russian read me
a Russian poem.

221
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:14,597
- But you know, in English.
- Are you just making this stuff up now?

222
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:19,733
No. And this might sound crazy
but I don't think it's an act.

223
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:22,843
I think he actually means it.

224
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,791
That doesn't make it okay.

225
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,840
Has he considered your feelings?

226
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,714
You're right. He's a selfish pig.

227
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:35,474
I'm serious. I think you should tell him
this whole romance thing gives you the icks.

228
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:39,303
Turns your stomach and that he's dating you,
not Anna Karenina.

229
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:42,822
Okay I'll tell him that. I can't tell him that.

230
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:47,017
And let me ask you something.
If you're so anti-romance,

231
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,910
why are you having a wedding at all?
Why not just go down to city hall

232
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,033
and get it over with?

233
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,274
You know, I thought about that.

234
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:58,705
But then I realized I actually do wanna
say those vows out loud to Steve

235
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,140
in front of the people I care about.

236
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,466
Are you gagging over there?

237
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,369
No. The opposite.

238
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,256
My god Miranda,
you're my cynical touchstone.

239
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:12,363
Do you promise to still be cynical
even after you're married?

240
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:15,648
I do. I have got to go.

241
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:18,688
There's a big pile of too-toos coming at me.

242
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:22,308
Okay. We need to have another talk.

243
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:28,822
One of the great things about living
in New York City

244
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:31,295
is that you don't have to sugar
coat your feelings.

245
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,190
But have New York women settled
for a sugar free existence as well?

246
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:40,387
We accept Tasti-Delight instead of real ice cream.

247
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,730
E-mails instead of love songs.

248
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,238
Jokes instead of poetry.

249
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,780
It's no wonder that faced with the real thing,

250
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,418
we can't stomach it.

251
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:52,937
Is it something we could learn to digest or

252
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:56,004
have we become romance intolerant?

253
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,212
#@#%#$ course, we would like the foie gras,

254
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,284
followed by the "boeuf" bourgignon
avec la legume a la creme.

255
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,678
it was Harry's version of a serenade.

256
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:16,681
And Charlotte ate it right up.

257
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:19,905
The plate or the cart?
We have a lovely cheese cart.

258
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,819
Mais oui. Bring us the cart.

259
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,090
Tuit suit for my sweetie.

260
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:27,380
I had no idea you could speak
French so well honey.

261
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,623
The French learn romance from me baby.

262
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:36,790
Downtown, in the name of boob job research,

263
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,816
Samantha decided to go where the biggest crop will be on display.
- Woo, nice!

264
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,091
Some were little boobs,
- That is so bad.

265
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:46,885
some were big boobs,

266
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:58,523
some were ridiculously big boobs. - Oh,
boy. - Okay that's my wife right there.

267
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:02,911
And then there were the two biggest
boobs of all. Right beside her.

268
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:11,921
Can I get you something?

269
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:16,162
You either have the most naturally
beautiful breasts I've ever seen

270
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,309
or I need the name of your doctor.

271
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:21,047
You want doctor Bevel. He's the best.

272
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,303
They paid for themselves in tips alone.

273
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,904
Meanwhile, back in the 18th century,

274
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:34,558
Oh. I'm sorry. Is this a formal sleepover?

275
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,659
Actually there's an opening at the Met tonight.

276
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:44,741
It's La Traviata. And you're going with me.

277
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:50,044
Man, I was this close to throwing
on my ball gown but I ignored my instincts.

278
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:53,777
- All right, I'll go home and change.
- No. You'll be much faster.

279
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:56,554
Come in.

280
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:02,989
Come on, Open it.

281
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,942
Tonight only your poetry, not mine.

282
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:23,855
From the magazine. You like it?

283
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:28,992
If I had been on a romance free diet,
this seemed like a good time to binge.

284
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,052
That was the most romantic, elegant.

285
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,601
Pardon me. That was weird.

286
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:48,051
Decadent, 7 course.

287
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:54,734
I'm sorry honey.

288
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:56,866
Oh boy.

289
00:16:57,803 --> 00:16:59,906
Are you okay?

290
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,196
Honey.

291
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,239
Are you gonna be long in there?

292
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,454
Maybe. Oh definitely. Why?

293
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:18,908
That's okay. I'll go to the other one.

294
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:21,580
When you splurge on romantic 7 course meal,

295
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,391
you generally want to remember every bite.

296
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:27,470
There was the soup course, the dessert course,

297
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,563
and all the other yummy courses in between.

298
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:34,160
That's gotta be it. I'm done.

299
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:39,216
Harry and Charlotte had romance shooting
out of them every 20 minutes.

300
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:41,322
- Oh I'm not.
For the rest of the night.

301
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:44,279
Wouldn't go in there if I were you.
It's not pleasant.

302
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,847
- I can't make it to the other one.
- It's the fucking fromage.

303
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,204
No.

304
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:51,918
That fucking fromage.

305
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,099
Look out. I'm coming in.

306
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,379
Surviving a night of food poisoning together
wasn't the stuff of great romance

307
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:06,312
but it was the stuff of lasting love.

308
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:13,521
Meanwhile, a funny thing happened
on the way to the opera.

309
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,855
Wait, wait.

310
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:23,246
This music. This place.

311
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,106
You.

312
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,200
Isn't it perfect?

313
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:32,462
Will you dance with me?

314
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:41,291
It was the most romantic moment.

315
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:47,550
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?
- Is she all right?

316
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,898
You okay?

317
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:56,011
No. It's too much. I'm an American.

318
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,940
You gotta take it down a nudge.

319
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:01,234
- She need any help?
- No, he's got it.

320
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:07,044
And then a quarter a pound of cheese.

321
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:08,946
McNuggets.

322
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,746
Would you like to super size that?

323
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:14,294
- Can you handle it?
- Absolutely.

324
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:16,288
Absolutely.

325
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:23,931
- I'm sorry about the opera.
- Don't be silly. Other time. Other dress.

326
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,880
May I offer you a fry?

327
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,150
- They're French.
- Oh, then.

328
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:49,242
Okay. I think I might be up for a quick spin now.

329
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,818
- If you'll still have me.
- Of course.

330
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,125
That'll be $9.54.

331
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:10,054
And there beneath the florescent moonlight,

332
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:13,666
I was finally laughing with romance and not at it.

333
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:17,920
And if I went any bigger than this,

334
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,308
I think I'd look ridiculous, don't you?

335
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:23,430
Well, that's not my work. But I did hers.

336
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:25,635
And hers right before the golden globes.

337
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,082
Wow, they're winners.

338
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:28,491
Other arm please.

339
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:34,537
I have been a? in two months that
I'd really like to have a little cleavage for.

340
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,452
Will they be up and running by then?

341
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:41,107
Ms Jones, you have a little lump I'd like you to
have checked out before we begin our work.

342
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:43,860
It's right here, you can feel it yourself.

343
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,488
Are you kidding?

344
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:47,376
No, I'm afraid not.

345
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:52,015
Okay. But it's not serious, right?

346
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:55,021
Well, it's probably just a sys
but we wanna be absolutely sure.

347
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:57,888
I'd like you to have it looked out,
as soon as possible, okay?

348
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:07,934
By Miranda's wedding day,
I felt the whole world have gone romantic

349
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,020
when Samantha insisted on
picking me up in a cab.

350
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:15,024
What has come over you?
This is a hundred block out of your way.

351
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,354
Now we're going to 10th and 6th avenue please.

352
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:19,221
- Boy you look nice.
- So do you.

353
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:20,447
Thank you.

354
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:24,908
So I had my breast consultation
with a plastic sergeant.

355
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,751
Please tell me you've changed your mind.

356
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,636
Well not exactly. He found a lump.

357
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:33,341
And I had it biopsy-ed,
and it turns out I have cancer.

358
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:35,640
You what? When?

359
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,795
Well I had it biopsy-ed on Wednesday
and I found out yesterday.

360
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:41,822
I'm going to give you all the informationand I don't want you to get upset

361
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:45,535
or start worrying and the only reason
I'm telling you now and not later

362
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,791
is I didn't want to accidentally blurt out

363
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,486
'I have cancer' in the middle of Miranda's wedding.

364
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:54,910
Could you please take 5th?
Broadway's a disaster.

365
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,319
Okay. I'm listening.

366
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,440
And please don't tell Charlotte and Miranda.

367
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,133
I don't want to ruin their days too.

368
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,905
Of course, whatever you say.

369
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:07,000
So. What exactly do you know?

370
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,961
Just that there are cancer cells
and I it monogrammed and they think

371
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,087
it's small which is a good sign.

372
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:15,213
And I won't know anything else
until they take the fucker out next week.

373
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:18,427
So there, now you know everything
and we can talk about something else.

374
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:23,293
So do you like my skunk?

375
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,717
Well, thank you for telling me.

376
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:29,643
Sure.

377
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:32,370
I'm sorry to put a big cloud over the whole day.

378
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:33,805
Samantha.

379
00:22:33,805 --> 00:22:36,446
I know I'm gonna be fine. I know that.

380
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,749
It's just..

381
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:43,667
I don't wanna lose my breast.

382
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:47,714
- They're fabulous.
- They are.

383
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,713
For better or worse.
For richer or poorer,

384
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,625
For richer or poorer.

385
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,432
To love and to cherish for
as long we both shall live.

386
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:03,141
To love and to cherish for
as long we both shall live.

387
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:07,230
This is my solemn vow.
This is my solemn vow.

388
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,413
Now Miranda. I Miranda Hobbes.

389
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:12,402
I Miranda Hobbes.

390
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:16,262
Take you, Steve Brady.
Take you, Steve Brady.

391
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:19,112
To be my husband
To be my husband

392
00:23:19,112 --> 00:23:21,993
Look, mommy and daddy are getting married.

393
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:24,904
For richer or poorer,
For richer or poorer,

394
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,544
In sickness and in health,
In sickness and in health,

395
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:31,537
To love and to cherish
as long as we both shall live.

396
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:35,203
To love and to cherish
as long as we both shall live.

397
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:38,547
This is my solemn vow.
This is my solemn vow.

398
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,244
Do you promise to uphold these vows

399
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:44,453
you've made here today witnessed
by your closest friends and family?

400
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,765
- I do.
- I do.

401
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,637
With the power invested in me
by the State of New York,

402
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:54,598
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

403
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:05,333
Come on everybody, it's happy time.

404
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:11,259
It's happy time. Come on. Everybody.

405
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,593
The one wedding ritual Miranda never
had a problem with was the part

406
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,406
where everyone eats and so we did.

407
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:24,843
Samantha, you look so pretty today.

408
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:27,379
- Thanks. I have cancer.
- What?

409
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:29,941
- Are you all okay with drinks?
- No we're not okay with drinks.

410
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:32,156
- Keep 'em coming.
- Cool.

411
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,350
- I like the color of your dress.
- Thank you.

412
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,845
I admire you for not pretending.

413
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:46,823
So we're family now and there's something
private I wanna tell you.

414
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:50,985
- Oh you don't have to.
- The day I married Steve's father,

415
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:53,013
I wore white.

416
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,507
But I shouldn't have. I slipped.

417
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,715
Once. God forgive me. Don't tell Steve.

418
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:06,712
When I walked down that ail at St. Agnus,

419
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:12,432
I had a white dress on the outside
and my little Jackie on the inside.

420
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:23,025
Steve?

421
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:26,480
Hey. Ma. Still hungry?

422
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,724
Come on. Let's get some chow.

423
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:34,828
Oh my god. I am legally bound to Steve's mother.

424
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:36,973
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

425
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:42,864
What? Why are you being weird?

426
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:44,299
We're not being weird.

427
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:45,763
No, we're just talking.

428
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:47,319
About me, right?

429
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,597
You think I'm an asshole,
that I've become one of them.

430
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:52,139
- That I'm a Stepford bride.
- No.

431
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:55,232
Then tell me what you were talking about.

432
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:57,571
I'll tell you tomorrow.
I don't wanna ruin your special day.

433
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:02,276
Forget about my special fucking day
and be normal, please. I beg of you.

434
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:08,906
I have breast cancer.

435
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,111
What?

436
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,039
See? It's now my special fucking day.

437
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:17,761
You have breast cancer?

438
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:20,463
Hey, no tears.

439
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:24,370
Miranda, I expected more from you.

440
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,128
See, this is what we were afraid of.
Go back to your people.

441
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,750
We'll talk about this later.

442
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,360
You are my people and we'll talk about it now.

443
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,795
Now start at the beginning.

444
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:37,688
You are the bossiest bride in the world.

445
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:40,515
Yes I am and you have to do everything I say.

446
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,999
Oh.

447
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:46,232
Now start talking.

448
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:49,961
Okay. Do you remember when¡¦

449
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,032
For better or for worse,

450
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,910
we were all ourselves that day.

451
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:59,476
Just the way Miranda wanted it.

452
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,095

453
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:10,484
There are 6 episodes left of Sex and the City.

454
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:13,436
Is this little trip your honeymoon?

455
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:14,694
Who's taking care of Brady?

456
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:16,200
I could take care of him part of the time.

457
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,679
We are going to spend the afternoon
at the Hotel Petrovsky.

458
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,413
Is he a baby person?

459
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:25,327
I plan on being naked for the next 4 days.

460
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:26,886
Hello.

461
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,362
I am having an anxiety attack.

462
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:29,554
Help!

463
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:31,668
- I'm Samantha Jones.
- Please stay behind the partition.

464
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:33,096
I am a nun.

465
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,047
Are you allowed to masturbate?

466
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:38,089
You are lucky to have touched my breasts.

467
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,400
And the question that I need to ask,
it's impossible to ask.

468
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,817
- And what is that?
- Oh my god!

469
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:44,914
No!

470
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,247
