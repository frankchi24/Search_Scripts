Epi 15. catch-38

11
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:49,612
I've been dating the Russian for two months
when we hit a relationship benchmarks

12
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:53,610
so rare I didn't even know it existed.

13
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:57,012
He gave me his alarm code.

14
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,059
And I had the keys made.

15
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,358
You made me a set of keys?

16
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,377
I had my assistant go to locksmith, but...

17
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,370
yes, keys were made.

18
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,124
Ok, what's the code?

19
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:16,080
Uh, it's...

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,918
4, 7, 3,

21
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:27,931
5?

22
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:31,016
I'll write it down for you.

23
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,389
It was a kind of security I'd never
experienced in a relationship.

24
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,186
His alarm code.

25
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:40,552
Like it was nothing.

26
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:42,720
Do you really wanna hear about this now?

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,488
Oh, yes, I need the distraction.

28
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:48,918
Samantha was feeling less secure as we
waited for the results of her lumpectomy.

29
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,865
It's gonna be fine, sweetie.

30
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:53,535
They got it out, it's going to be fine.

31
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,446
I know, I know.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,118
So, Petrovsky?

33
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,881
Oh, ok, well, it was just so easy.

34
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:04,537
I mean Big made me beg for a key
in front of his doorman whereas

35
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:08,539
the Russian had just welcomed me
into his life and his apartment.

36
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,831
Did I mention the extra robe in the bathroom?

37
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,348
Is it as nice as this one?

38
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,351
Even nicer if you can believe it.

39
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:19,809
Hi.

40
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,070
Hello, I'm Dr. Pinkner.

41
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,053
Hi, how do you do? I'm friend Carrie.

42
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:24,432
Hello, doctor.

43
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:25,765
Well, Samantha, I have good news.

44
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:27,485
The lumpectomy went very well,

45
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:31,398
all your scans look clean,
and I classify you as stage one.

46
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,731
And one is..?

47
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,446
- The best. Right?
- Yeah.

48
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,743
Ok, ok.

49
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, cold.

50
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:41,864
You're healing nicely.

51
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:44,211
Now, because of the nature of your tumor,

52
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:46,787
I would still recommend a course of chemo.

53
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:47,995
I still have to have..

54
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:50,147
Chemotherapy, yes. As a precaution.

55
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,837
I don't understand how this happened to me.

56
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:57,972
It could be gentics, but since there's no
breast cancer in your family,

57
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,110
it could be a variety of factors,

58
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,693
- diet, lifestyle choices.
- Lifestyle choices?

59
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:05,637
Some studies have shown women
who haven't had children

60
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,279
have an increased chance of getting it.

61
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,810
I see.

62
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,586
So I brought this on myself?

63
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:13,534
No, I'm just giving you the basic...

64
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,118
I think we're done here.

65
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:16,742
Maybe I wasn't clear.

66
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:19,191
Give me my chart.
I'm going to find some woman doctor,

67
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:22,931
some hot woman doctor who understands
what this is all about.

68
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,453
I just meant statistically...

69
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,887
You're lucky to have touched my breasts.

70
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:30,715
Carrie, my purse.

71
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,690
It was hard to be huffy in a cloth robe
but somehow Samantha pulled it off.

72
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:38,467
All right then, good to meet you.

73
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:41,946
Like it's my fault.

74
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,509
I shouldn't be punished for not having kids,

75
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:44,987
I should be rewarded.

76
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,776
Since when did kids become the
get-out-of-cancer-free card?

77
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,518
He's basically saying that I'm a whore
who deserves chemo.

78
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,712
No, I don't think that's what he was saying.

79
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:57,539
What I don't understand is if they got it all
why do you need chemo?

80
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,912
Because he's an asshole.

81
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,586
Evidently there can be something microscopic.

82
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:01,406
Like his dick.

83
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:03,573
Excuse me, do you have cancer or Tourette's?

84
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,462
I'm getting a new doctor, a woman.

85
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,423
I think you should.

86
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,140
I have heard great things about Dr. Mc..

87
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,960
Andrew, I'm on it.

88
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,145
Top graded(?) oncologist by New York magazine,
four years running.

89
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:14,731
I'm trying to get in.

90
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:16,252
Oh, I'm sorry.

91
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:17,733
I gotta get back to the office.

92
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:20,184
I'm taking a long weekend
so I can't take a long lunch.

93
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:21,594
Long weekend?

94
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,810
You never take long weekends.

95
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,384
Steve wanted to go on a little trip,

96
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:26,778
so we're driving up to some
mountain lodge tomorrow.

97
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:31,266
- It's supposed to nice.
- Slow down there, miss.

98
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:34,413
Is this little trip your honeymoon?

99
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:38,948
No, it's just a whatever.

100
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,191
And yet, you just got married last week.

101
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,051
- That's interesting.
- It's your honeymoon.

102
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:47,666
- Here we go.
- Who's taking care of Brady?

103
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,171
We're bringing him.

104
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:51,539
Well, it's not a real honeymoon if Brady's there.

105
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,034
Then I guess it's a whatever.

106
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,484
What have you got against honeymoons?

107
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,308
It's basically sex with room service, right?

108
00:04:56,846 --> 00:05:00,688
You have to have a real honeymoon.
It's very important.

109
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:01,770
To whom?

110
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,507
Yeah, I'm with? Davis on this one.

111
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,007
Just leave Brady with Magda.

112
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,017
It's four days.
I've already given her the time off.

113
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,648
She's made plans, she's going to
nanny paluza or something.

114
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,981
I'll take him, I'd love to take him.

115
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,915
He's adorable.

116
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,150
It's four days, adorables tops
after a day and a half.

117
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,887
Well, I could take care of him part of the time.

118
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:23,466
What? I'm his godmother,
it's the least I can do.

119
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,864
I can handle him for a couple of days.

120
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:27,888
I saw that.

121
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,756
- You guys would really do that?
- With pleasure. / Absolutely.

122
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:35,669
I wouldn't because Smith is coming
back into town

123
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,467
and I've always chosen sex over babies.

124
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,339
And that's apparently why I got cancer.

125
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:45,233
The next day, I tried on two labels.

126
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:48,190
Classic Vuitton and new mommy.

127
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:57,724
Yeah.

128
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,197
Now we're gonna go into carriage
and we're gonna see the..

129
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,900
oop, my phone is ringing.

130
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:03,558
You stay here.

131
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:07,368
Yeah, hello.

132
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:09,037
So how's it going?

133
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:12,699
I think that I was just mistaken
for a mother by a mother.

134
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,129
So he's okay?

135
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,121
Yes, Brady and I are having a lovely time.

136
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:20,422
In fact, we are going to spend the afternoon
at the Hotel Petrovsky.

137
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,233
Is he a baby person?

138
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,476
Well, I wouldn't have guessed it but
when I told him I had Brady for the day

139
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:25,459
he said to bring him over.

140
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,096
But is it safe?

141
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,139
Are there stairs?
What about sharp edges?

142
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:33,290
Charlotte, it's death trap, we're just gonna strap
a pillow around the kid and hope for the best.

143
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:39,120
And further downtown, Samantha was in
hot pursuit of the hot woman doctor.

144
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:45,081
Hi, I'm Samantha Jones,
we've spoke on the phone several times.

145
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,182
Uh huh, please stay behind the partition.

146
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,238
Sorry, I know that you said
Dr. McAndrew was booked,

147
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:54,707
but I was referred here by Dr. Ward
and Dr. Pappum

148
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:58,002
who both attended the Paint for
the Cure Benefit I threw.

149
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,464
I'm sorry, the doctor can't.
She's booked through March.

150
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:04,563
My good friend Susan Schaeffer who threw
the Dance for the Cure Benefit

151
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:08,506
said that sometimes Dr. McAndrew can
squeeze you in if you just show up.

152
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:09,516
March.

153
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,474
Well, who do you have to fuck
to get chemo around here?

154
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:12,681
Excuse me?

155
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,239
I'm sorry, I'm upset.

156
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:16,222
I'm dealing with cancer.

157
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,374
All of New York is dealing with cancer.

158
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,079
Not to mention some very pushy people
in Los Angeles and Miami

159
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,998
Fine. I'll just take a seat
and hope for an opening.

160
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:28,330
No, doctor has no openings till March.

161
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,245
You already said that.

162
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,531
You know, I've been here since 9 am so

163
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:41,923
if anyone's going to get in
without an appointment

164
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:43,007
it's me.

165
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:44,855
Loud and clear. Don't worry about me.

166
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,017
I'll get in.

167
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:49,157
Well, I've been waiting for two days
and so far no one's gotten in yet.

168
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:54,143
I was once told I wouldn't be able to
get backstage to see Mick Jagger.

169
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:57,857
Well, I did get backstage and I blew him.

170
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:01,586
Oh.

171
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,732
Excuse me, I don't know if this is
an appropriate question to ask.

172
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,281
I think we passed appropriate
a few seconds ago.

173
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,487
What kind of cancer do you have?

174
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,598
- Breast.
- Breast. Me, too.

175
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:19,368
- I'm curious, do you have children?
- I'm a nun.

176
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:23,173
- You have none.
- No, no, no, I am a nun.

177
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,045
But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy
your Mick Jagger story.

178
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:28,836
I thought that nuns had to wear..

179
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:30,694
Oh, I haven't worn a habit in years.

180
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:34,385
So then, you don't have sex.

181
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,740
- No.
- Never had sex.

182
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,136
- No.
- Ah.

183
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,184
- Just one more.
- Oh, go right ahead.

184
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:48,778
Are you allowed to masturbate?

185
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,879
I never asked.

186
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:54,722
But thanks for getting my mind off cancer
for the first time in a week.

187
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,969
Oh, happy to help.

188
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,951
Samantha felt a little better knowing that
saints and sinners, despite their habits,

189
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,934
get the same treatment
when it comes to cancer.

190
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:08,590
And so far, that was no treatment at all.

191
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,208
Ok, we're here. Hey, come on in, Brady.

192
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,861
He gave us a candy.(?)

193
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,438
Oh no, no, no, no.

194
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,401
Oh my gosh. ok.

195
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,780
4, 7,...

196
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:30,945
Oh hi.

197
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:36,986
Brady knocked the vase over.

198
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,840
That's pathetic, blaming the baby.

199
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:45,334
Well, my other plan was just to leave
and pretend you'd been burgled.

200
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,924
You want the keys back right now?

201
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,466
Noise, yes. The alarm.

202
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,611
Yes, she's clumsy, isn't she?

203
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,676
Look at you.

204
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,657
Aleksandr holding the baby was the most
disarming thing of all.

205
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:04,899
And upstate, in honeymoon central.

206
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,546
That was really great.

207
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,528
Now what?

208
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:15,269
What do you mean?

209
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,470
Relax.

210
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:22,931
- Do you think we should go for a walk or something?
- Nah.

211
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:25,712
Let's just? here. Hang out.

212
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,934
- How often do we get to do that?
- That's true.

213
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:35,473
- So do you think we should get dressed?
- I plan on being naked for the next four days.

214
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:43,746
I'm gonna unpack.

215
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:47,709
Knock yourself out.

216
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,488
There's no TV or radio.

217
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,604
Are you ok there, partner?

218
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,218
I'm fine.

219
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:08,511
But hey, there is a CD player and a CD.

220
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,238
Sounds of mohonk mountain.

221
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,737
Shit.

222
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:29,605
What's the matter?

223
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,566
I forgot my cell phone charger.

224
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,855
You're not gonna need your cell phone,
it's just you and me.

225
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:38,137
As Miranda got a crash course in life
as a twosome,

226
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,034
I got a glimpse of life as a threesome.

227
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,542
He's good. This is your best of work yet.

228
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:47,513
The guy's a genius.

229
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:49,660
Reminiscent of the early Basquiat.

230
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,311
You're very good with him.

231
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:53,636
Have you ever thought about having children?

232
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:55,134
I have one.

233
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:56,189
Oh.

234
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:57,643
Many years ago.

235
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:00,135
No more children.

236
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:02,934
Actually, I cannot. I..

237
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:06,866
- Yeah.
- So.

238
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,695
Closed the factory.

239
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,386
How about you?
You never wanted children?

240
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:18,231
No, I've always thought that I might,

241
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:21,992
I just, you know, I just haven't
gotten around to it yet.

242
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:24,830
And when are you planning to do this?

243
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,096
How old are you? 38?

244
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,308
I felt like I was just shot with a.38.

245
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:36,754
The Russian doesn't want to have kids.

246
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:38,505
Had one a long time ago.
It's done.

247
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:41,013
Well, then Dosvedanya or however you say it.

248
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,988
What? No, for you maybe, but not for me.

249
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,314
Don't you wanna have the option?

250
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:48,500
Well, yes. But it is my experience
that man like him

251
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,933
don't come along that often.

252
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,265
But we're 38.

253
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:52,623
These are the years.

254
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:56,271
Yes, I know. I've heard I'm running out of time.

255
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,685
- I don't even have time to eat this cookie.
- How is it?

256
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,770
? I forgot to have children.

257
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:06,481
Maybe he'll change his mind.

258
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:07,953
No, no, I don't think so.

259
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,215
- He had a vasectomy.
- But those are reversible.

260
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,554
Is he willing to have it reversed?

261
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,706
I can't ask him that.

262
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,776
- I don't even know his birthday yet.
- Well, too bad.

263
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:20,886
At our age, you have to be able to talk about
having children if you think it might get serious.

264
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,553
That attitude, by the way,
that awareness on the part of a woman

265
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,860
that time is ticking is very sexy to a man.

266
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,030
But you can't be scared to have those talks.

267
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,437
Why not?

268
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:34,065
It is, it's a perfectly scary conversation.

269
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,645
I didn't even wanted to have it with myself.

270
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:36,775
What is that mean?

271
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,184
It means that if I really wanted to have a baby,

272
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,070
wouldn't I have tried to have one by now?

273
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,872
I wantd to be a writer,
I made myself a writer.

274
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:47,699
I want a ridiculously extravagant pair of shoes,

275
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:49,581
I find a way to buy them.

276
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,075
But this is totally different.

277
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:54,268
You have been waiting for the right
man and the right time.

278
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,893
Yes, that's exactly the way
it goes in my head too.

279
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,143
Maybe I'm not just a baby person.

280
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:05,347
Why should you give up having a baby
for a man who you hardly know?

281
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:08,312
Why should I give up a man for a baby
I hardly know I want?

282
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,431
I think you're a baby person,
you're a closeted baby person.

283
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:14,276
What?

284
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,023
You didn't even want to leave
Brady for two days.

285
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,856
Well, look at how well you did.

286
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:21,121
Hi.

287
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,760
I think you should definitely have a baby.

288
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:26,739
Ok.

289
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,722
So what did he have? A boy or a girl?

290
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,938
Um, I forgot to ask.

291
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:37,266
See, baby person would've asked.

292
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,236
All right, I should get home,
get some work done.

293
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:45,637
Well, then why don't you just keep Brady
a little longer till dinner time at least?

294
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:47,760
What, you think I'm gonna decide
if I'm a baby person

295
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,143
in the next couple of hours?

296
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:51,062
You still have a couple of years.

297
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,629
I'm starting to prune.

298
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,674
You know what would be romantic?

299
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,079
We have a fire, a bubble bath, champagne.

300
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:18,373
What would be romantic?

301
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,251
I wanna wash your hair.

302
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,688
I washed it already.

303
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,389
I know, but I wanna wash it for you.

304
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,392
You know, like in 'Out of Africa'?

305
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,770
Hold this soap.

306
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:42,655
Ok.

307
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,249
What could be better than that?

308
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,128
Ou

309
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,835
- Hurts Soap in my eye.
- Ok.

310
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:03,106
Hello.

311
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:04,954
I'm having an anxiety attack.

312
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,984
Brady is fine.

313
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:08,640
Good, but that's not why I'm calling.

314
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,174
I'm in the woods in my neglige
and my cell phone only has two bars left.

315
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:13,741
- Help!
- Are you lost?

316
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:14,658
Completely.

317
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,074
This whole place, this whole trip is screaming,

318
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,028
you should be having sex
with your husband again.

319
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,161
The fire, the tub.
We've already done it twice today.

320
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,236
It's like sex is the only thing on the itinerary.

321
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,730
So you two are getting along.

322
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,648
Of course, it's our honeymoon.

323
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:30,570
Where's he?

324
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,331
In bed. It's our honeymoon.

325
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,139
- He thinks I'm getting ice.
- Well, then, don't forget the ice.

326
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:40,674
Last night, Steve and I held hands for an hour
and a half watching the fire.

327
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,344
He was looking into my eyes,

328
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:45,490
I was looking for the remote.

329
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,362
It feels good to be sarcastic.

330
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:51,851
You can't be sarcastic on your honeymoon.

331
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,970
You should talk to Steve.

332
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,110
I can't talk to Steve. He's on his honeymoon.

333
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:58,658
How's Brady? I miss him.

334
00:16:58,658 --> 00:16:59,852
He's great.

335
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,938
We're great.

336
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:05,163
So, this whole motherhood thing,
all it's cracked up to be?

337
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,621
Ok, there's something in the bushes

338
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:13,915
and I hope it's wild animal and not Steve
coming to have sex with me again.

339
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,647
I should be able to do this, Carrie.

340
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,841
This should be the most romantic time of my life.

341
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,195
Racoon.

342
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,859
After Miranda used the's' word twice,

343
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,012
I wondered if should was another
disease plagueing women.

344
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:35,284
Did we want babies and perfect honeymoons,

345
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:39,573
or did we think we should have babies
and perfect honeymoons?

346
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,811
How do we separate what we could do
and what we should do?

347
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,975
And here's an alarming thought.

348
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:50,209
It's not just peer pressure,
it seems to be coming from within.

349
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:54,657
Why are we should-ing all over ourselves?

350
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:58,796
Then there are the shoulds of promoting film

351
00:17:58,796 --> 00:18:00,958
which Samantha should have been in favor of,

352
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:01,913
but she wasn't in the mood.

353
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,735
You should stay at the party.
Harvey Weinstein is here.

354
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,894
I did enough parties in L.A.

355
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:08,517
I'd rather go home with my girl(?).

356
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,268
Smith, Smith, right here.

357
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,385
I really don't feel like having
my photograph taken tonight.

358
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:18,912
I'm gonna go out first
and we'll talk tomorrow.

359
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:22,520
What's going on?

360
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,458
We haven't spent a night together
since I've been back.

361
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:28,000
- Did I do something?
- No, no, it's not you.

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,502
Something's up. You're quiet all night.

363
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:33,159
You didn't even talk that much
last couple of times we had phone sex.

364
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:41,420
Smith, when you were in L.A.,
they found a lump in my breast and it's cancer.

365
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:44,166
Smith.

366
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:51,385
The next day, at the Hotel vasectomy,
I had some questions for the man next to me.

367
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,684
So, this child you had.

368
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,700
- Yes?
- How old is..?

369
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,990
- She.
- She? Yes.

370
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:03,253
Her name's Chloe, she's twenty-two.

371
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:07,626
She lives in Paris,
and her mother lives there too.

372
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,902
And you were married to her mother?

373
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:15,039
Yes, it's the only time I was married.

374
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:18,469
Lasted seven years, five of them good.

375
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:29,627
It's my little thing at age four.(?)

376
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,583
In our little house in Santorini.

377
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,615
- She's beautiful.
- Still is.

378
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,758
- That's her mother?
- Uh-huh.

379
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:40,606
She's lovely and so young.

380
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:42,932
I was young then too.

381
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,702
So...

382
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,412
why only one child?

383
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:54,027
I like my life the way I like it.

384
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:56,734
I got really lucky with Chloe.

385
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,433
Somehow, it worked out.

386
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:02,357
Look, it's her seventh birthday.

387
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,030
Everything is purple.

388
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,000
Purple cake, purple dress, purple shoes.

389
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:09,552
It was great.

390
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:11,307
So, so funny.

391
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,359
There it was, wrapped up in a bow.

392
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,628
The whole life that I am never
gonna have with him

393
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:20,986
because he had it already
with somebody else.

394
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,968
And I know I shouldn't say this
to someone with cancer,

395
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:25,990
but...

396
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,291
why me?

397
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:29,371
Let her rip.(?)

398
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,823
Well, I guess it's not going to happen.

399
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,155
That life, if I'm with him.

400
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:35,687
Then, bye bye baby.

401
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:37,337
What else is on the menu?

402
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:38,859
What do you mean?

403
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:42,454
There are a lot of fabulous things in life
that don't include a baby.

404
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:45,584
What would that be like?

405
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:51,630
Well, him, sex, and travel.

406
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:58,638
Comfort, love, and extraordinary adventures.

407
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:01,024
Not too shabby.

408
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:02,277
If that's where this is going.

409
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:07,062
And at this point I've been only invited in
as far as a security code and a robe.

410
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,948
And the question that I need to ask is just..

411
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:12,312
It's impossible to ask.

412
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,455
And what is that?

413
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,771
Will you love me enough..

414
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:20,205
to make up for the fact
that I didn't have a baby.

415
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,780
Oh honey no.

416
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,330
Exactly, it's only been two months.

417
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,581
38 years and two months.

418
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:29,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

419
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,841
I know. It's too early in the relationship
to have that conversation and...

420
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,949
But it's too late in life not to.

421
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:41,265
It's a catch-38.

422
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:47,426
And after safely putting Brady
to bed in his very sturdy crib,

423
00:21:47,426 --> 00:21:50,344
Charlotte and Harry enjoyed
some romance as well.

424
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:51,879
Oh my god.

425
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,200
Oh my god.

426
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:56,157
Oh my god! Stop!

427
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:57,745
What? What happened?

428
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,030
Brady saw us having sex.
I've scarred him for life.

429
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,096
Him? You scarred me for life.

430
00:22:03,444 --> 00:22:06,418
Brady.

431
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,131
Look away.

432
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,178
Hello.

433
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:21,885
I have bad news.

434
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:23,970
Ok, you need to spit it out.
Do we need to come home?

435
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,680
Brady saw us having sex.

436
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,894
- And?
- He was looking at me during.

437
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,387
Charlotte, he doesn't know
what he's looking at.

438
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,445
He doesn't know where his nose is.

439
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,147
Are you sure?

440
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,625
Harry, Brady can't be anywhere
near this conversation.

441
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,246
I think it may be too late.

442
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:42,784
He just said sex is dirty.

443
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:44,298
That's not funny.

444
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:46,838
Charlotte, he's fine.

445
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,426
But..

446
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:52,294
you sound tense,
maybe I should still come home.

447
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:55,805
No, I'm sorry to bother you.
Go back to your honeymoon.

448
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:58,257
I still have a bar left. No!

449
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,916
What?

450
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:01,996
Are you on a phone?

451
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,055
Charlotte panicked, but everything's fine.

452
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,945
Then, come back to bed.

453
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:12,610
I don't need to come to bed. I'm rested.

454
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,809
So am I. Come on.

455
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,371
Steve, I can't have sex anymore.
I have a brain.

456
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,061
I know you have a brain.

457
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:23,310
I love you, but I can't love you this often.

458
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,748
I can't love you twice a day, everyday.

459
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:27,231
I'm going crazy here.

460
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:30,175
I miss ESPN, and NPR, and Dateline.

461
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,314
I am not the honeymoon type.

462
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:34,874
Do you hate me?

463
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:36,713
No, I don't hate you.

464
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:40,290
But it was my honeymoon, too.

465
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,144
I like being quiet sometimes.

466
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:43,802
I like reading a book.

467
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:46,054
Four days is a long time.

468
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:48,234
It isn't, actually.

469
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,324
But it's all I have from work.

470
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:54,128
Suddenly, Miranda understood
the new should in her life.

471
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:57,256
The things you should do for someone you love.

472
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:00,364
I'm sorry, Steve. I'm an asshole.

473
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:02,609
Yeah, you are. But you're my asshole.

474
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:06,709
That's sweet, and gross at the same time.

475
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:09,511
Well, relax.

476
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,562
We're leaving in the morning.
The honeymoon's over.

477
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,170
Say that again.

478
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,382
The honeymoon's over.

479
00:24:20,217 --> 00:24:24,789
For Miranda, once the honeymoon was over,
it could finally begin.

480
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:27,848
Hey, I got a brain, you know.

481
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:36,790
The next day, at Dr. McAndrew's office,

482
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,278
impatient patients were getting desperate.

483
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:44,570
God bless.

484
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:52,848
Pulling out all the stops, huh?

485
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:55,196
Well, what else was I gonna wear?

486
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,624
A big tumor?

487
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,681
This is my second day at this fu..?

488
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:12,973
office and my good friend features
editor at Vanity Fair..

489
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,987
Ms. Jones, I told a thousand times.

490
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,111
There's nothing I can do.

491
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,208
Oh my god.

492
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,170
Is this..?

493
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:24,446
You're Smith Jerrod's girlfriend?

494
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:28,461
Well, yes, I suppose I am.

495
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:31,763
It was the one name Samantha hadn't dropped.

496
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,313
- Oh my gosh.
- I love him.

497
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,257
- He's my screensaver.
- Oh.

498
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:42,381
What's he like?

499
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:44,304
Well, he's a..

500
00:25:44,304 --> 00:25:47,518
He's a very loyal boyfriend,
always by my side.

501
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,530
He would probably come here with me
if I had an appointment.

502
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:54,164
- Here, Smith Jerrod in this office?
- Ah-huh.

503
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:57,373
Oh my gosh, um. Let'see. Um, well.

504
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:01,009
Sometimes, I make an appointment at 8 o'clock.

505
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,457
She doesn't like it, but she'll do it.

506
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,764
I can come at 8.

507
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,920
And Smith, does he get up that early?

508
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,034
For this, I think we would.

509
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,845
Oh, and um, if you could get her an appointment,

510
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,462
he might kiss you on the lips.

511
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:18,821
You're tomorrow at 8 a. m.

512
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:20,389
She's 7:45.

513
00:26:20,907 --> 00:26:22,509
Thank you so much.

514
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:25,356
Smith turned out to be more than a screensaver.

515
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:27,039
He was a life saver.

516
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,892
We're in.

517
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:30,878
Oh my god.

518
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:32,538
No, oh my boyfriend.

519
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:35,651
And that is how Smith got Samantha in plus nun.

520
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:43,615
Are you cold?

521
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:44,868
No, I'm ok.

522
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:48,085
You're very quiet today.

523
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:51,384
What is it?

524
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:56,812
This vasectomy,

525
00:26:58,723 --> 00:27:00,497
it's not reversible, is it?

526
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:03,587
I guess not for me.

527
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:06,265
Ok.

528
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:12,893
And we're quiet again, huh?

529
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,069
I know you may think it's way too early to saywhat I'm about to say but...

530
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:26,446
it's not.

531
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:27,792
Say what?

532
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,751
I think that...

533
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:36,643
I could really be with you

534
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:40,958
and I just wanna say that...

535
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,021
if this is something you are thinking,

536
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:49,842
I need to know because...

537
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:56,871
I'm 38 as you said and so..

538
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:01,522
I'm 38.

539
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,064
38 is young.

540
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:05,150
Well..

541
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,163
It depends who you're talking to.

542
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:11,488
So here we are, so soon.

543
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:17,027
As you said, I...

544
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:19,592
I could really be with you as well.

545
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:25,191
But believe me, I know who I am
and I won't change my mind.

546
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:29,259
I'm simply too old for that.

547
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,135
Being a parent is an extraordinary thing.

548
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,824
I wouldn't want you to miss that

549
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,151
if it's something you want.

550
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:42,167
And you should have everything you want.

551
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,464
I am kinda cold.

552
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:51,714
Come here.

553
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:02,924
I didn't know what exactly I wanted,

554
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:06,046
but I felt like I was getting warmer.

555
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:15,926
