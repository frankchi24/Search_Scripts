pick-a-little, talk-a-little

11
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,660
In New York City,

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,572
it is a statistical fact
that once every 7 minutes,

13
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,221
an unsuspecting woman.

14
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:01,105
Shut the fuck up!

15
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:02,020
Dates an actor

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,868
Let me go.

17
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:04,601
My husband will be home any minute.

18
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:05,262
For Samantha,

19
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:07,802
one of the perks of dating Jerry the Actor

20
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,400
was getting to stage full scale fantasy productions.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,685
Please.
Please don't hurt me.

22
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,511
I'll do anything, anything.

23
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,991
Just shut the fuck up!

24
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,835
Shut the fuck up!

25
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,932
Oh. You are really good.

26
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:22,667
I said, shut the fuck up!

27
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:24,257
No, you shut the fuck up

28
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:26,157
and fuck me before my husband gets home.

29
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:27,577
Now!

30
00:01:28,532 --> 00:01:31,336
And then he pretended to tie my hands
behind my back

31
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:32,801
and the whole time he kept screaming

32
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,655
'shut the fuck up.

33
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:35,732
Shut the fuck up' I tell you,

34
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:40,429
it is so refreshing to be with someone
who likes to fuck outside the box.

35
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,482
And this is my friend Samantha.

36
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:45,523
The wallflower. Right.

37
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:47,620
That is incredibly offensive.

38
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,112
Violence against woman
is very serious issue.

39
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:51,814
Oh please. It was a fantasy.

40
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:53,606
Fantasies can't be censored.

41
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:56,218
Actually I think the supreme court
is working on that right now.

42
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:58,452
All fantasies are healthy and harmless.

43
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,853
Don't you agree?

44
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:01,378
You know as a guy,

45
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:02,919
I've always on the impression

46
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:08,909
that great or anything in great family
is just not a good idea.

47
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,417
Can I go home now?

48
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:13,824
There is no greater sound than your friends
laughing at your new boyfriend's jokes.

49
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:16,690
Well that's not the only scenario we play.

50
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,686
Sometimes he's Senator Smith or Principal Smith.

51
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:20,551
Cellmate Smith.

52
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,067
Okay. Moving on.
Uh, Miranda.

53
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,809
How was your date
with the real estate guy?

54
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,707
Actually it wasn't horrible.

55
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:29,177
He was kind of cute and funny and..

56
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:32,110
Hello? Oh. Doctor Smith.

57
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,207
Thank you for returning my call.

58
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:37,428
Excuse me.

59
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:40,490
He thinks I may have the mumps.

60
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,603
Now that's hot.

61
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,439
So how did the date end?

62
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:47,983
He walked me home.
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,108
Are you maxed out on girl talk?

64
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:51,668
No, no, no.
I'm good.

65
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:53,546
- I'll let you know.
- Okay.

66
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:56,026
So he kissed me good night at the door.

67
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,075
I invited him up,

68
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,046
he couldn't because he had an early meeting.

69
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,085
We kissed again.

70
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,586
Then he said he'd call.

71
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:04,338
Two kisses. Very promising.

72
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:05,988
You think?
Even though he didn't come up?

73
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:06,600
Definitely.

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,740
It means he likes you
but he wants to take it slow.

75
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,031
That's nice.

76
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,435
Berger, what do you think?

77
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,051
You really wanna know?

78
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:17,610
Please. I would love to have
a man's opinion for a change.

79
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,219
All right.
I'm not gonna sugar-code it for you.

80
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:21,874
He's just not that into you.

81
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:27,270
That's not true.
Don't listen to him.

82
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,664
No. No.
I'm intrigued.

83
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,127
Elaborate.

84
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,522
Look, I'm sorry but
when a guy's really into you,

85
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:35,922
he's coming upstairs meeting or no meeting.

86
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,384
Oh, that's is ludicrous.

87
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,231
What about extenuating circumstances?

88
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:41,647
What about you're stressed out;

89
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,457
you're on deadline;
you have a migraine?

90
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,192
Or.

91
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,092
A lot of guys are afraid of getting their feelings hurt

92
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,039
and they don't wanna ruin a friendship.

93
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,797
Or they're freaked out
by their own feelings?

94
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:54,677
There's a lot of push-pull out there.
A lot of mixed messages.

95
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,855
Yeah.
I have to say that's all code for

96
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:58,693
he's just not that into you.

97
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:00,784
I'm sorry but with guys it's very simple.

98
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:02,172
If we're into you, we're coming upstairs.

99
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:03,999
We're booking the next date.

100
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:05,834
There are no mixed messages.

101
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:08,139
No mixed messages? But..

102
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,211
I've spent my whole life
deciphering mixed messages.

103
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,078
I've made a whole career of it.

104
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:16,395
Wow.
He's just not that into me.

105
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,252
He's just not that into me.

106
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:20,868
Oh honey.

107
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:21,759
Ignore this person.

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,287
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

109
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:26,258
You are fired.

110
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:27,616
Look. If he's not into you,

111
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,202
the guy's obviously a weenie so..

112
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,294
No. No. I love it.

113
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,872
It is the most liberating thing
I have ever heard.

114
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,268
Think how much time in therapy
I could have saved

115
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,786
over the last 20 years if I had known this.

116
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:41,460
I still think that real estate guy is gonna call.

117
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,330
Yeah I think you got an uncomfortable e-mail
coming your way.

118
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:44,803
You know.

119
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:46,814
Something like 'sorry I haven't called.

120
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm in a place in the world
where they don't have phones'.

121
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,197
(I love him)

122
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:54,096
The best part of a night out with your friends

123
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,385
is talking about them all the way home.

124
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,854
Charlotte is a trip.

125
00:04:57,854 --> 00:04:59,103
Samantha's hilarious.

126
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:01,502
- They all are.
- They thought you were hilarious.

127
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,953
Miranda, how do you not love Miranda?

128
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:04,991
I know. I love her.

129
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,988
And I love that you loved her.

130
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:08,739
Oh god, she loved you.

131
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:09,852
They all did.

132
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,337
And they are a tough crowd.

133
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,446
I'm a tough crowd.

134
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,896
Okay. Your choice.

135
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:17,681
Fudgesicle or nutty-buddy.

136
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,489
Oh my god.

137
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:20,030
I wanted this one.

138
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,230
We're perfect!

139
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,059
Oh and when you went to the men's room
they were all¡¦

140
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,111
Stop.

141
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:25,760
What?
Am I talking too much?

142
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,260
No.
I wanna say something

143
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,220
and I don't want you to say anything back okay?

144
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,657
Promise?

145
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,664
I love you.

146
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:35,899
I love you too.

147
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,145
And I am not saying it
because you said it to me I promise.

148
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:41,429
I was gonna say it before..
I was thinking it the whole night.

149
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,015
I love you.

150
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,861
I just wanted to say it again on my own.

151
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,719
In my euphoric state,

152
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,793
I knew there was only one kind of person
who can tolerate me.

153
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:53,966
I'm in love too.

154
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,577
I'm so happy for you.

155
00:05:55,577 --> 00:05:57,063
It's the fastest I've ever said I love you

156
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,317
but I literally could not hold it in my mouth.

157
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,513
And why should you?

158
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,059
There's no reason.
You're in love.

159
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,298
I'm in love.

160
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,961
I love Harry so much it hurts.

161
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:07,414
Sometimes I look at Berger

162
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:08,727
and he's so cute

163
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,968
I just wanna squeeze his face off.

164
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:14,817
This Friday night is my first official Sabbath.

165
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:18,517
So I am cooking a big traditional dinner for Harry.

166
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:20,609
I'm so excited to finally be a real Jew!

167
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,998
Here's your brisket ladies.

168
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,232
Oh listen. Listen.

169
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:24,689
I said lean!

170
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:33,484
Just when I thought my week couldn't get any better,

171
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:36,774
I came home to find a little surprise from Berger.

172
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,110
Sure you love me... But
can you love my book? -B

173
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:53,388
From Berger's book to Samantha's books.

174
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,611
I'm sorry Ms. Jones but...

175
00:06:57,611 --> 00:06:59,963
you owe the US government 300,000 dollars

176
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,554
in bag taxes.

177
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,915
But auditor Smith.

178
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,827
I don't have that kind of money.

179
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:06,307
What are you gonna do?

180
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,485
Take the shirt off my back?

181
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,809
Take the shirt off my back.

182
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,927
This is what I call internal revenue!

183
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,115
In my Fantasy,

184
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:27,097
¡°Hurricane Pandora¡± would be brilliant.

185
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:28,395
In reality,

186
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:31,589
it was.

187
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,989
All right if you're still not finished,
it's all over between us.

188
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:42,769
I just finished it just this minute,
I swear.

189
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:43,883
Did you stop for meals?

190
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:46,499
Hey. It's been two days.

191
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,647
It's 400 pages.

192
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:49,698
Yeah well,
I can't date a slow reader.

193
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:50,991
Are you done?

194
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,999
- Question is, are you done?
- Yes I'm done.

195
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:55,224
And if you would shut your trap,

196
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:59,215
I could tell you that I love,

197
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:04,159
love, loved it! I loved it.

198
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,796
Except for one huge problem.

199
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:11,772
You have your leading lady running
all over town wearing a scrunchie!

200
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:13,668
A scrunchie.

201
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:16,130
The hair thing?

202
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,168
What's wrong with that?

203
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:19,575
Nothing. Unless you're writing about women
on the island of Manhattan,

204
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:22,672
in which case uh..
where do I begin?

205
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:23,740
What are you talking about?

206
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,775
A lot of New York women wear scrunchies.

207
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:27,087
In the bathroom maybe,

208
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:28,905
when they're washing their faces.

209
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:30,021
You're full of shit.

210
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:33,896
I see women every single day,
all over New York City wearing scrunchies.

211
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,468
Okay but here's the thing.
Here's my crucial point.

212
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:38,380
No women who works at W-magazine

213
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,833
and lives on Perry Street would be caught dead

214
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:46,623
at a hip downtown restaurant wearing a scrunchie!

215
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,888
Man, it's a good thing I came along

216
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:50,809
because you may know the fellas

217
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:52,944
but I know the ladies.

218
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:54,450
Great.

219
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,368
Okay.

220
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,125
- Can I read you my favorite part?
- No.

221
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,882
I'm done talking about the book.

222
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:02,142
We ordering in?

223
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,605
He completely shut down.
Why?

224
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,968
Why did I have to get up on the sassy horse

225
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:11,103
and ruin everything?

226
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,965
Yeah.
Sass will bite you on the ass.

227
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:15,279
And the thing that kills me
is I loved the book.

228
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,632
I could have gushed about it all night.

229
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:18,540
Why did I have to go straight
to the negative

230
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,820
and just pick at it.

231
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,179
Because you're in a relationship.

232
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,684
I used to pick at Steve about everything.

233
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:24,981
The way he held his fork,

234
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,891
his grammar, his dirty fingernails.

235
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,334
Used to?

236
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,237
He has a new girlfriend for that now.

237
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,965
Debbie!

238
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:33,362
Do you think Debbie picks at Steve?

239
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:34,321
Of course.

240
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,367
All women pick.
It's in our DNA.

241
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,105
It's our little way of showing that we care.

242
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:39,935
Well I think I made it abundantly clear

243
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:41,687
just how much I care.

244
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:43,540
Well you have to work it out with him.

245
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,524
Berger has single handedly changed my life.

246
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:47,604
I still haven't heard from the real estate guy.

247
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:48,745
But it's fine.

248
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,285
He's just not that into me.

249
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,731
I think right now,
Berger's just not that into me.

250
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:54,670
So talk to him about it.

251
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,055
He just seem like
he can laugh your way through anything.

252
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,866
Yeah. That kind of thinking
is what got me into this in the first place.

253
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,259
One of the signs that a female gorilla is in love

254
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:10,409
is that she can be seen picking nits off
her male companion.

255
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:18,340
And yet in humans,

256
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,317
nit picking can ruin a perfectly good evening.

257
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:23,154
Not to mention a relationship.

258
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,057
Women are known to be more verbal than men,

259
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:31,555
but, when does criticism
that's constructive become destructive?

260
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:35,647
Are there times when the ladies
should just shut the fuck up?

261
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:43,983
The next morning,
another woman was making too much noise.

262
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:48,645
What an earth is all that banging?

263
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:50,194
Oh good morning Mrs. Collier!

264
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:52,456
I'm a Jew now.
How are you?

265
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,875
I know he'll call eventually.

266
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,386
He's just going through
a really hard time right now.

267
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:05,924
His boss got laid off¡¦

268
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:09,188
Later on her lunch hour,
Miranda checked her BlackBerry.

269
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:10,509
There it was,

270
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:14,065
the uncomfortable e-mail Berger had predicted.

271
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,620
He's really busy it's like

272
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,882
'ah~ I can't call.
My God, I'm so stressed. '

273
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:18,881
He'll call you.

274
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:19,967
Yeah he's gonna call.

275
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,951
And his kitchen's being rewired.

276
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:24,579
- That's all so complicated.
- Yeah that's like a two-day process.

277
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:26,377
At least.

278
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:27,411
Excuse me.

279
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:29,965
I couldn't help overhear your conversation

280
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:35,061
and I hope what I'm gonna say
will save you a lot of time and energy.

281
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,919
He's just not that into you.

282
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,573
So move on. Have a great day.

283
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,323
Having passed on the gospel to these New York women,

284
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:48,426
Miranda could only hope they would spread the word,

285
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:49,334
far and wide.

286
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,695
- Bitch.
- Who the hell asked her?

287
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:52,748
Not me.

288
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:54,783
- I know you didn't.
- I hate these people in New York.

289
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,644
- He is so gonna call you.
- I know.

290
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:59,199
And as two women's fantasies
were being shattered,

291
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,820
another's were being brought to life.

292
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,331
Samantha Jones?

293
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,307
Detective Smith.

294
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,077
Department of Homicide.

295
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:13,128
Afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you some questions ma'am.

296
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,853
Why certainly detective.

297
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:18,057
Am I in some kind of trouble?

298
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,403
- Two martinis please. Straight up.
- Yes ma'am.

299
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:22,083
Actually make mine a seltzer.

300
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,604
Of course.
You're working.

301
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:27,686
But do you know detective.

302
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:30,382
My little drink won't kill you.

303
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:34,382
- He'll have a martini.
- No, it's a seltzer.

304
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:35,948
Seriously Samantha,
I'm in AA.

305
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,601
That sobered Samantha right up.

306
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:41,142
I was toally like fucked up
for eight years in Seattle.

307
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:45,772
You know, I just realized I have a presentation
first thing in the morning so¡¦

308
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,058
sorry.

309
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:55,427
Jerry had taken the fantasy
into dangerous territory-

310
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:56,475
reality.

311
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:58,418
Two martinis.

312
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,026
No, dude, I said a seltzer.

313
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:04,249
Meanwhile, Charlotte was hard at work
on her fantasy role.

314
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,126
Martha Jewart.

315
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,865
Okay, the kugal's in the over.

316
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,098
The Matzo Balls are boiling.

317
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,320
There's three hours till Sabbath.

318
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,162
I think we should start braiding the hallah.

319
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:13,034
Doesn't Sabbath mean the day of rest,

320
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,746
i. e., ordering in?

321
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,177
We're wearing aprons.

322
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,619
Do you own aprons?

323
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:19,723
- The hallah!
- Okay, okay.

324
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:22,283
You don't have to hallah!

325
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,480
Miranda, like this.

326
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,099
Oh. I don't know what I'm doing.

327
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,753
Why did you call me over here?

328
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,614
Because I didn't want to spend
the rest of the week saying

329
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:33,128
'yes, you had to be there'.

330
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,752
Hey. Did Harry's friend ever call you?

331
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:38,852
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I'm seeing him tonight.

332
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,344
You think I could get away with this outfit?

333
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:42,763
Definitely.
The apron softens you.

334
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,293
Can you read me
what's next after it's braided?

335
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,624
With her high school boyfriend,

336
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,008
Charlotte doodled.

337
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:53,777
With Harry, she jew-dled.

338
00:13:53,777 --> 00:14:00,266
Um.. I think it calls
for two cups of Mrs. Harry York Goldenblatt.

339
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,466
Did I miss something,
did you get married while I was at work?

340
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:06,370
No. But that's where we're headed.

341
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,555
You forget Charlotte Yorkenblatt.

342
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,801
Actually, I've been making some calls
and I was wondering

343
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,834
how you both felt about November.

344
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,374
November for what?

345
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:16,794
For our wedding.

346
00:14:17,638 --> 00:14:20,211
Most of the synagogues are booked through the fall.

347
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,665
November works for me.

348
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:23,379
Has Harry even proposed yet?

349
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,398
Miranda.

350
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:26,801
No. But he will.

351
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:29,754
Aren't you counting you
Matzo Balls before they rise?

352
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:32,319
Miranda. Zip the lip.

353
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,113
Harry and I have an understanding
about our future.

354
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:35,829
We don't have to talk about it all the time.

355
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:38,063
It's 'bereshit'.

356
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:39,416
I don't know what that means.

357
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,962
It's meant to be.

358
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,540
I would never have gone through all this trouble

359
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,669
if I didn't know for sure that we were getting married.

360
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,195
I'm sorry;
I just don't want to see you get hurt again.

361
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:58,851
And ever since her reality check with Jerry,

362
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:01,714
Samantha had no interest in seeing him again.

363
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:06,101
However, when a certain government official called,

364
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,465
she was more than happy to take a meal.

365
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,421
Secret service agent Smith.

366
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:16,701
If you're here,

367
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:19,246
who's protecting the president?

368
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:21,262
You know I changed my mind.

369
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:24,074
I thought of something even hotter for us to play.

370
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:25,828
Hotter than secret service sluts?

371
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:27,946
- Yeah.
- Oh.

372
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:31,927
I'm me, you're you.
Go.

373
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,972
You know when I told you the other night

374
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:38,025
I was in AA,
you bolted.

375
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,266
What's up with that?

376
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:43,307
Jerry. It is Jerry, isn't it?

377
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,999
I'm afraid we want different things.

378
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,736
You want to tell me all about you

379
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:50,870
and I don't want to you tell me all about you.

380
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,179
It spoils the fantasy.

381
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,247
- That's harsh.
- Yeah. I am harsh.

382
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,691
I'm also demanding,

383
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,303
stubborn, self-sufficient and always right.

384
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:04,514
In bed, at the office,
and everywhere else.

385
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:05,523
I already knew that.

386
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:08,558
And that's just a little bit about me.

387
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,238
All right. Cool.

388
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,142
Let me tell you one little thing about me.

389
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:14,901
See, this is exactly what I¡¦

390
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,295
At least let me tell you my last name.

391
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:18,816
It's Jared.

392
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:24,956
Your parents named you Jerry Jared?

393
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,868
No wonder you drank.
Right.

394
00:16:27,868 --> 00:16:31,230
There would still be accountants
and undercover agents in their future

395
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,221
but that night,

396
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:35,095
Samantha and Jerry got off on playing themselves.

397
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:40,545
Meanwhile, I was looking forward to
putting the scrunchie moment behind us.

398
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:48,012
Unfortunately,
it was staring us in the face.

399
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,813
Okay. I'm sorry to have to do this

400
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:59,350
but I do believe we are in the presence of a scrunchie.

401
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,809
I also do believe,
and correct me if'm wrong,

402
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,398
that we are in New York City proper,

403
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,694
this woman is not appear to be washing her face.

404
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,361
She appears to be standing on line

405
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,177
at a hip downtown restaurant.

406
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:15,938
So, kinda kills your New York Women Theory.

407
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:18,753
Tough break Bradshaw.

408
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,401
- She's not from New York.
- What?

409
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,248
It doesn't matter.
Did they say how long it was gonna be?

410
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:28,341
Excuse me.

411
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:29,739
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

412
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:32,529
We're just wondering
what part of New York you live in?

413
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:37,406
I may! Oh gosh.

414
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:40,809
I am from Macon, Georgia.

415
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,266
But thanks you made my whole day.

416
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:44,446
Honey did you hear that?

417
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:47,855
These people think I live in New York.

418
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:50,815
I'm so hungry
when are they gonna let us sit down?

419
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,116
Downtown over 'Kareem mat at Chutny',

420
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:58,153
Miranda found herself presently
surprised by Charlotte's matchmaking skills.

421
00:17:58,153 --> 00:18:00,753
That was one spicy baryonic.

422
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:01,887
I know.

423
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:04,750
I've lost all feeling in my tongue.

424
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,174
Listen, I know a great place around the corner

425
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:09,241
if you wanna get coffee.

426
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,400
Oh I..

427
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,425
you know I wish I could
but I really should call it a night.

428
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:19,007
Hey. It's fine.
I understand.

429
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,590
You're just not that into me.
And it's okay. I get it.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,890
No No. I like you.

431
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,571
I just¡¦ really have to go.

432
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,774
Paul. Come on,
you can stop lying.

433
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,356
I am not lying.

434
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:32,687
Come on, be a man.

435
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:33,970
Tell the truth.

436
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,150
I have diarrhea.

437
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:41,999
Apparently,
there is one rare exception to Berger's rule.

438
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:44,724
And it often involves curry.

439
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,266
After dinner,
Berger ate banana cream pie

440
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:48,546
and I ate my words.

441
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:51,224
Another thing I love was the way
you used the sister's phone calls

442
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:53,365
as little land posts.

443
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,277
I mean.. land marks. Miles..
mile post. I don't know.

444
00:18:57,277 --> 00:19:01,039
Anyway, I just loved those sort of punctuated the story.

445
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,240
It's just really nice touch.

446
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:09,008
Oh my god.
The introduction, brilliant!

447
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,886
You're instantly on this guy's sight

448
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:14,090
even though he's a complete mess.

449
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,701
You really just nailed him.

450
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:26,224
While I was working overtime,

451
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:28,829
Charlotte's work was finally coming to an end.

452
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:32,293
Harry. You can come on in now.
Sorry it's so late.

453
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:33,373
What's all this?

454
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,046
Well since it's our first Sabbath together,

455
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,578
I wanted to make it a little special.

456
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,522
A little?
This is phenomenal.

457
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:41,390
I just need to get the candles
and then we can say the Bracha.

458
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:55,529
Oh, come on.

459
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:00,547
Honey, please turn that off.
We're about to eat.

460
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,796
Smells incredible.

461
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:11,709
And you made brisket.
I cannot believe you made brisket.

462
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:49,373
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath sweetie.

463
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:54,992
I cannot believe you made all this.

464
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,614
What did I do to deserve you?

465
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,388
I feel the same way.

466
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,356
I've been thinking about blessings

467
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:03,797
and you're such a blessing to me.

468
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,239
What are you¡¦

469
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,867
why is the TV on?

470
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,139
It's on mute.
Mute? Mute?

471
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,620
We're having Sabbath dinner.

472
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,268
It's a big game honey.

473
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:17,225
Turn it off.
I want you to turn it off right this minute.

474
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:19,075
- But it's¡¦
- Off now.

475
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:20,594
Let me just watch this one pitch.

476
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,268
I gave up Christ for you

477
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:24,043
and you can't give up the Mets?

478
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:26,420
It's gonna be a long life
if you keep that up.

479
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,702
I gave up Christ for you,
take out the trash.

480
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:31,595
I gave up Christ for you,
pick up your socks.

481
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:36,216
Do you have any idea how hard
I worked to prepare this meal for you?

482
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:39,940
I went to Zabar's everyday this week.

483
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,812
I had to make 30 Matzo Balls

484
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:45,752
just to get four that were the right size and shape.

485
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:47,849
Not to mention the months of studying

486
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,022
and cramming like a maniac to convert to Judaism.

487
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,855
And what have you done for me?

488
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,682
Set the date!

489
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:55,934
Set the date.

490
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,376
What are you talking about?

491
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,381
You said you couldn't marry me

492
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:01,352
unless I was Jewish and now I'm Jewish.

493
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Set the date!

494
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:05,128
You're acting crazy.
Do you hear yourself?

495
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:08,077
Do you know how lucky
you are to have me?

496
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,897
Do you know how we look?

497
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:14,389
Do you know what people out there think
when they see us together, do you?

498
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:17,539
Yeah I know what people are thinking.

499
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:20,254
I just didn't think you were one of them.

500
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:23,048
Finally, it was Charlotte who was on mute.

501
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:27,388
I don't need this. I'm leaving.

502
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:33,330
To think I bought a ring.

503
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:39,828
The Mets won that night 5 to 4.

504
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:42,685
But Charlotte lost everything that mattered to her.

505
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,432
Oh. I just remembered another hilarious part.

506
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:49,131
And later,
on the corner of 73rd and Mayacovar,

507
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:52,336
You know the scene where the dishwasher guy

508
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,372
is spooning up the rice checks

509
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,223
and he's putting them back in the box,

510
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:56,732
it's perfection.

511
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:58,295
How'd you come up with that?

512
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,578
That's so lame.

513
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,815
No it was not.
It was hysterical.

514
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:03,079
I'm not talking about the book.

515
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,616
I'm talking about what you're doing right now.

516
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:09,926
I just wanted you to know
how much I loved your book.

517
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:11,593
Because I did.

518
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:14,804
And I'm sorry I muddied it up
with the whole scrunchie thing.

519
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:18,406
- It's not that big a deal.
- Okay.

520
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:21,954
I think I'm gonna call it a night.

521
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,700
I gotta get an early start tomorrow.

522
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,247
Are you kidding?

523
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,343
No. Thanks for dinner.

524
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:29,684
I'll call you tomorrow.

525
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:33,729
And then there are times
when a New York woman should not shut the fuck up.

526
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:41,084
Hey. Berger. Berger.

527
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:45,505
You can't just pull that line on me and walk away.

528
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,750
Well this time it's true.

529
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,116
You're obviously still pissed

530
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:51,587
and I'm sorry but you can't just shut down like this.

531
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:53,790
We have to be able to say what's on our minds.

532
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,142
If you thought that I had made some kind of mistake,

533
00:23:57,142 --> 00:23:59,174
I would want you to tell me.

534
00:23:59,174 --> 00:24:02,568
Oh? Nice hat.

535
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:06,493
Carrie.

536
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,750
It's fabulous and you just said
that to hurt my feelings.

537
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,220
Well that's how you made me
feel the other night.

538
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,882
Fabulous.

539
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:13,309
So you can just walk away now.

540
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:14,161
Yes I can.

541
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,815
Well look. I'm sorry. All right?

542
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:17,807
What was I suppose to do with
that scrunchie comment?

543
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:21,234
Was I suppose to hop in my time machine
and go back, fix my entire book?

544
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:22,379
I don't know what your problem is

545
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,656
but it doesn't have anything to do with a scrunchie.

546
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:28,135
Yeah. It's about the fact
that my book is a big fat fucking failure.

547
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:28,761
What?

548
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,252
It's just, you know,

549
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:31,533
I already feel like shit.

550
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,313
You trying to pump me up all night,

551
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:35,038
not helping.

552
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:41,340
I'm sure this is all very sexy you probably never¡¦.

553
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:44,462
Stop.

554
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:48,389
I wanna say something
and I want you to listen.

555
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:52,005
You're a beautiful writer.

556
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:55,500
And I loved your book.

557
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,716
And I love you.

558
00:24:57,716 --> 00:25:02,743
And I still think you're very sexy.

559
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:06,707
And I'm not gonna let you make a joke right now.

560
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:10,656
Then I got nothing.

561
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,429
Come on.

562
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,465
Saying I love you is easy.

563
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:26,602
What comes next is a little scrunchier.

564
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,229
Harry hadn't called in two days

565
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:33,384
except to say he was sending

566
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,676
someone over to pick up his TV.

567
00:25:39,427 --> 00:25:40,775
Just what New York needs.

568
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,991
Another single Jewish girl.

569
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:51,231
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

570
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:53,255
Mind if I get in there and wash my face?

571
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:54,889
Not at all.

572
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,261
Oh gosh.

573
00:25:59,261 --> 00:25:59,952
Where'd you get that?

574
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:01,115
Well, Macon, Georgia.

575
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:02,677
Why, you wanna try it on?

576
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:03,147
No.

577
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:05,657
You're gonna look so pretty
with this scrunchie on.

578
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:10,096
No!

579
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,063
