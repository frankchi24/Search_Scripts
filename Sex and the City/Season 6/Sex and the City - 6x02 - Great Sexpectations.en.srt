Season 6
Epi 2. Great Sexpectations

12
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:42,744
The only thing as delicious
as those first few bites of a truly great burger

13
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:47,145
are those first few dates with someone
truly great like Berger.

14
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,807
It's sort of like that's cool.

15
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:51,365
I'll do a book reading in my hometown.

16
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:52,881
Right about after the fifth question,

17
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:55,236
I realized that my mother is heckling me.

18
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:55,928
She was not.

19
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:56,822
No, no. She was.

20
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:59,488
You can ask anybody at the diner's grill bar
know about it all right?

21
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:01,556
They still talk about it.

22
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:05,897
Come here.

23
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:09,117
Everything is fresh. Everything is a first.

24
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:11,069
You like your beef?

25
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,949
Everything is foreplay.

26
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:18,011
Even a trip to Bed Bath & Beyond
can become an ecstatic errand.

27
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,937
I don't see you as a fish person.

28
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:23,208
Yeah the problem with the fish
is then you need a whole fish theme.

29
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,848
You have the fish soap, fish bath mat.

30
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:27,797
Pyramid scheme. The shower curtains.

31
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:31,677
Now this one, is the one I have at home.

32
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:33,564
So don't mind China is covered in mold.

33
00:01:33,564 --> 00:01:36,138
And here they thought communist was a problem.

34
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:40,473
You know, it's a very intimate
thing-shopping for shower curtains.

35
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:41,851
Oh yeah?

36
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,938
Wait till I get you into bedding.

37
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:51,530
And of course, those first kisses are
the greatest kisses in the world.

38
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,321
Good night.

39
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,555
All right. We should get out of here
before they turn the lights off.

40
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:07,296
The wait staff couldn't wait any longer.

41
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,454
And neither could I.

42
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:11,728
I wanted Berger in my Bed Bath and Beyond.

43
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:12,724
Immediately.

44
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,686
I'm either leaving a very big tip

45
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,472
or a dry cleaning receipt.

46
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:27,412
My hair.

47
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:28,666
Sorry.

48
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,230
Just.

49
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,208
No just.

50
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,838
The next night Samantha
convinced us to go to Raw.

51
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:58,422
Where the scene was hot
and the food was not.

52
00:02:58,422 --> 00:02:59,997
You think a place that eliminated cooking

53
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:01,428
could eliminate waiting.

54
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,300
What do you mean,
they don't cook the food here?

55
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,733
That's why they call it Raw.
The Raw Food Movement?

56
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,053
People love it.

57
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,286
Sting, demi, soonyi, soon-me?

58
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:12,070
Now, what is raw food exactly?

59
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,231
Vega non dairy.
And nothing is cooked over 118 degrees.

60
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,673
In other words, raw vegetables.

61
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,244
And sometimes flowers.

62
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,550
And you knew about this?

63
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,952
I read a review in the times.

64
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,412
Where, in the gardening section?

65
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:29,792
I heard it's delicious.
People, the emperor has no oven.

66
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I didn't get enough sleep last night.

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,174
Really? Did you finally bugger Berger?

68
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,762
How long have you been waiting to say that?

69
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:38,925
It just occurred to me.

70
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,486
Yes we finally buggered.

71
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,816
Yeah.

72
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:43,784
You realize you are now applauding intercourse?

73
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:46,022
It was their first time
and she really likes him.

74
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:50,013
Jones. Your table is ready.

75
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,861
So details.

76
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,607
It was good. it was fine.

77
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,288
Fine?

78
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,738
I don't really wanna talk about it.

79
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:01,655
He couldn't get it up?

80
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,612
He could get it up.

81
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:06,716
That wasn't the.. you know what?
There was no problem. Moving on.

82
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:12,220
Enjoy your meal.

83
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:19,684
What?
I don't wanna make a big deal about it.

84
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:21,647
It was just the first time.

85
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:25,883
We're so good everywhere else.

86
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:28,401
We're great in restaurants,
it's like ºü»ß¸®ºü»¤ ^^;

87
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:32,074
And the kisses are great.
And then in bed,

88
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:36,034
there was no sexual chemistry.

89
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,382
I don't know what happened. He just..

90
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:39,609
Couldn't find you clit?

91
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,704
He knows what he's doing.

92
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:44,086
Then what are we talking about?

93
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,627
It was.. it was just quiet.

94
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:50,471
I wouldn't worry about it Carrie.
If the kisses were great,

95
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,175
then the sex will eventually big good.

96
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,175
I'm not worried.
How quiet was it?

97
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:55,935
It was so quiet that at one point

98
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,725
I heard the M-11 bus.

99
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:58,674
I heard the doors open,

100
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,053
I heard people getting off.

101
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:04,024
Well at least someone was getting off.
And speaking of.

102
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:06,050
Hey. Welcome to Raw.

103
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,597
Hello.

104
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:14,650
We'll like to get you started with a little amuse bouche.

105
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,664
I'd like him to amuse my bouche.

106
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,396
Well this just looks delicious.

107
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:20,402
It's our summer vegetable soup.

108
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:23,341
I see you guys are set for drinks
so I'll give you a minute with the menus.

109
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,677
Oh and our specials tonight
if you're interested.

110
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:32,250
Oh I'm extremely interested.
Leak papaya patties and zucchini enchiladas.

111
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,785
I'm gonna need a pizza after this.

112
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:36,297
I'm gonna need a napkin to dry off my seat.

113
00:05:36,297 --> 00:05:38,727
That waiter was hot.

114
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:39,877
And the soup is not.

115
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:40,815
What is this?

116
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:42,338
Bad. This is bad.

117
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:43,856
It is like lawn in a bowl.

118
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:46,694
Maybe something should be
over a 118 degrees.

119
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,100
Like sex, for example?

120
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,700
Can we please forget I said anything?
Seriously.

121
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,598
Who else has news?

122
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:54,555
I do.

123
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,657
But you're gonna have to put down your menus
because I need your undivided attention.

124
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,483
Well you'll have to shoot our waiter.
Will you look at that ass.

125
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,994
Do you mind?

126
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:09,166
I have something a bit shocking to say.

127
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:14,317
And after I say it I don't want anyone to react
because I'm very happy with my decision.

128
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,799
I'm becoming a Jew.

129
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:22,850
What?

130
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,315
I can feel you reacting.

131
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:29,019
I love Harry very much and he loves me.

132
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,800
So tomorrow,
I'm meeting with the rabbi to discuss converting.

133
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,015
Isn't that a lot of hoop jumping for a man?

134
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:35,909
Look.

135
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:39,921
Harry's not who I expected to fall in love with,
but I did.

136
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,853
He makes me laugh

137
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,254
and he says what he means.

138
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,836
And I feel like I can be myself around him.

139
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,526
But yourself is a Episcopalian.

140
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:52,175
And it is still the most exciting sex
I've ever had.

141
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:54,465
Mazel tov.

142
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:55,898
Now this is food.

143
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,637
And you know what's even better?

144
00:06:57,637 --> 00:06:59,335
While I'm eating this slice of pizza,

145
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,766
my boyfriend is home taping my favorite TV show.

146
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,172
And to which boyfriend are we referring?

147
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:06,231
My boyfriend TiVo.

148
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:08,047
You've traded Steve-o for TiVo.

149
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:10,386
We don't talk of Steve-o anymore.

150
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,062
Thought if I changed his name.

151
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:12,646
Who needs him?

152
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:14,707
With TiVo, if there's something I don't enjoy,

153
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:16,161
I just speed right through it.

154
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,431
If only we could do that in life.

155
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:21,907
Exactly. And he surprises me
with things he think I might like.

156
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:22,737
Which is how I got hooked on Jules and Mimi.

157
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:25,762
I stopped watching television
when people started putting leaches down their pants.

158
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:26,408
No. No. No.

159
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,082
This is BBC America.

160
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,089
It's about a beautiful black man from Brickston,

161
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,120
and a white woman from Hamsted Heath.

162
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,552
I don't know what that means exactly,

163
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,587
but apparently there's a great divide.

164
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:38,704
And he rents the flat above her hat shop

165
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:41,021
and tonight, they're finally having sex.

166
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:43,653
Well, good luck to them.

167
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,545
Carrie, it was the first time.

168
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:46,510
I know.

169
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,903
And sometimes you have to work at it.

170
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,320
Have you ever had to work at it?

171
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,340
I'm dating a digital recording device.

172
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,218
Well I have never had to work at it
with someone I really like.

173
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:55,976
You should probably keep that to yourself.

174
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,138
Okay but Miranda.

175
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:02,226
I gotta tell you.
It was not good.

176
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:06,661
There was no, no rrrrr, no throw-down.

177
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:09,361
It was more like a slowdown.

178
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:10,040
Hmm

179
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,425
Yeah and it got me completely off guard
because I thought it would be amazing.

180
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,502
Well maybe that's the problem.
/What?

181
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:18,337
Your expectations were too high.
Of course you were disappointed.

182
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:22,002
From now on people should tell it like it is.
First time sex, tricky.

183
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,508
Non dairy vegan ravioli, kindergarten paste.

184
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:37,270
As I tried to scrub the smell of uncooked ochre off me.

185
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,447
I started thinking about sexpectations.

186
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:46,747
We're aware as smart single women
that we can't expect perfection.

187
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:50,291
But life still manages to throw us curve balls.

188
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,283
Maybe once you're into your mid-thirties,

189
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,118
it shouldn't be called dating,

190
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:59,118
it should be called waiting for the other shoe to drop.

191
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:02,073
If it's not the sex between me and you,

192
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,596
then someone has to become a Jew.

193
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:07,941
Why is it always something?

194
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:11,917
Unless you're in a problem free relationship with TiVo.

195
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:25,976
No. No. Maybe later.

196
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:27,897
Hello. Shut up, shut up.

197
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:31,880
Thank you.

198
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:38,381
Jules. Are you there?

199
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,551
Hello Mimi.

200
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,123
You always answer the door
without the shirt on.

201
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:47,685
The heat isn't working
and that's why I rang you up.

202
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:52,648
Seems to be working.
It's definitely barmy in here.

203
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,143
No. Problem is in the bedroom.

204
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:58,815
Right. Of course. The bedroom.

205
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:04,518
The next day, Charlotte boldly went
where no York had gone before.

206
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:06,278
The synagogue.

207
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,691
Shalom. Where would I find the rabbi?

208
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:15,691
His study. Inside.

209
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:19,586
Thank you.

210
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,132
Are you the rabbi?

211
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:24,911
Yes.

212
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:26,664
Hi. My name is Charlotte York

213
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:30,675
and I'm here today
because I would like to consider joining the Jewish faith.

214
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:33,188
We're not interested.

215
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,888
Hello.
I need to report a very rude man.

216
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:51,647
I was just saying that my name is charlotte York
and I would like to consider joining the Jewish fai¡¦

217
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:54,958
I don't know what is with these people.

218
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:55,840
I never¡¦

219
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,513
You know how much I love you for doing this?

220
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:00,405
Do you know how sexy you look?

221
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:02,530
That's it.
I have to have you immediately.

222
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,744
Harry definitely had a throw-down.

223
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:07,330
But Charlotte was too thrown and down to care.

224
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,716
Stop Harry.

225
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:11,770
I'm feeling very rejected by your people.

226
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,350
That's the game baby.

227
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,003
They try to make it hard for you.

228
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:16,669
What?

229
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:17,860
It's part of the process.

230
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,581
Traditionally they turn you down three times
to make sure you're serious.

231
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,967
Suddenly Charlotte understood.

232
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,641
They were playing hard to get.

233
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,021
They were rules, Rabbis.

234
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,363
I can play that game.

235
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:35,080
I invented that game.

236
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:37,611
No man rejects Charlotte York.

237
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:39,498
I don't care what any Rabbi says.

238
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,463
You are my chosen person.

239
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:49,500
Miranda was looking forward to another perfect night
with her perfect boyfriend.

240
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,163
But unfortunately there was another woman.

241
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,846
I think I did something bad.

242
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,042
What do you mean, Brady?

243
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,138
I just checked on him.

244
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:59,968
No, boy is beautiful. He's fine.

245
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:05,662
TiVo?

246
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,234
What did you do?

247
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:10,415
Exactly, what did you do?

248
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:13,896
I sit on.

249
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:15,149
And then nothing

250
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:20,466
You sat on TiVo? Is it okay?

251
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,168
Nothing is recorded.

252
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:23,110
How could you do this?

253
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,890
This is 'Jules and Mimi - The Morning After'

254
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,049
No. No. No. No. No.

255
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,007
Yes.

256
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,307
And across town.

257
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:36,337
I lay in bed willing Berger to call me

258
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:38,199
which never works.

259
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,393
Hello.

260
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:45,476
Hey it's me.

261
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:46,845
I'm sorry for not calling earlier.

262
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:50,730
And I know this is the same excuse
that every guy gives but in my case it is true.

263
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,166
A 64 raccoon was attacking the village
and I had to trap it and kill it and stuff it.

264
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,664
And everybody's safe now.

265
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:03,126
Even the little Flanders girl
who was stuck in a tree.

266
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:05,359
But I might have rabies.

267
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,532
What have you been up to?

268
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,297
Oh same old. Same old.

269
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:09,979
Did the Time's cross word puzzle.

270
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,810
Found a cure for cancer.

271
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,426
You did the Time's cross word puzzle?

272
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,800
Monday's not Sunday's.

273
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,714
Oh okay.

274
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:20,301
I need like three people to do Sunday's
- one of them has to have the answers.

275
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:24,633
I was thinking that if two people can be good in bed
when they're not in the same bed,

276
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,886
how hard a conversion could it be?

277
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,570
I have some answers if you have cab fare.

278
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,310
Oh yeah?

279
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:50,743
Dump him.

280
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,296
Fuck me badly once shame on you.

281
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:55,428
Fuck me badly twice, shame on me.

282
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,457
Is that the saying?

283
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:58,760
That's my saying.

284
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,924
I don't wanna dump him.

285
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,011
I think he's fantastic.

286
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,719
And aren't we getting a little old
to jump to the dump?

287
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,508
What about working on things?

288
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:08,341
Look at Charlotte.
She's becoming a Jew.

289
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:12,104
Hi. I need something that will make a guy come at his pants
as soon as he sees me.

290
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:14,494
Got it.

291
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,370
You talk to salespeople like that?

292
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,021
I'm here all the time.
They love me.

293
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:22,159
Is this for a specific gentlemen
or do you just look for that generally?

294
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,910
It's for that hot waiter from Raw.

295
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,302
I'm sleeping with him tonight.

296
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,493
But he doesn't know it yet.

297
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,418
I think I have to talk to him.

298
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,910
No.

299
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,519
We talk about everything else.

300
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,506
Honey, when it comes to sex,
spray it, don't say it.

301
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,088
Okay that was unnecessary.

302
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:39,412
I'm trying to salvage your love life.

303
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,629
The only words you should be saying in bed
are dirty ones.

304
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,554
I can't do that-without alcohol.

305
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:46,969
Then start drinking.

306
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,642
Because if you want a hotter sex life,

307
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:50,851
you're gonna have to turn up the heat.

308
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,440
Starting with.

309
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,176
I don't wear furry shoes.

310
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,033
They're not for you, they're for him.

311
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,747
He mostly wears loafers.

312
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:00,560
Are you sure I can't talk to him about it?

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,955
Honey.

314
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:03,869
If the sex isn't great,

315
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,505
it doesn't help to say it's not great.

316
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,816
That's usually a downer.

317
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:10,578
And by that I mean uh-uh. Uh~

318
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,503
Yeah. Plus he must know it's not great.

319
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:15,516
He can't think this is good.

320
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,586
Oh god.

321
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:20,551
Is it possible he thinks this is good?

322
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,086
Here we are.

323
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,924
Oh, as a matter of fact.
I'm gonna take this.

324
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,375
No, we'll take two.

325
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,260
And these in a 7.

326
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:34,928
That evening Miranda had one of those regrettable discussions
that results from the belief

327
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:37,900
that you and your significant other
should be able to talk to any problem.

328
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,975
We have been over this before.

329
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:42,757
I feel like you are not listening to me.

330
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:48,037
I turned the system off for ten minutes
and nothing changed.

331
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:54,712
I'm sorry. I'm upset.

332
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:56,799
I'm just so disappointed.

333
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,603
I got used to coming home to something.

334
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:02,101
Can't you work with me on this?

335
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,799
You told me to do that already.

336
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,768
What is wrong with you?

337
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:16,472
Friday night with Berger.

338
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:20,600
I had my sexy lingerie under my cool couture

339
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,159
and I was feeling good.

340
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,859
You look so hot in that shirt.

341
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,531
Are you being serious?

342
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,360
Okay. We're gonna need some drinks.

343
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,634
Oh hey
/Hi.

344
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:33,626
well it's still at the half hour so frozen margaritas
are two-for-one.

345
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,286
All right. Okay.

346
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,381
When in Rome.

347
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:39,932
Since we were oh for two,

348
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,818
I figured two for one was a good idea.

349
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:51,020
And after three unreturned phone calls

350
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,172
Charlotte decided to make a house call.

351
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,011
Hello Rabbi.

352
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,661
I brought you some kosher wine.

353
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:10,537
I'm sorry but my husband can't see you now.

354
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:11,566
Excuse me.

355
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,701
I don't mean to be rude
but I think he can.

356
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:18,551
Miss. What¡¦

357
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:21,536
Look. I'm 37 years old.

358
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:23,035
I'm reproductively challenged.

359
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:24,713
I'm in love with a Jewish person

360
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:26,255
and it took me 20 years to find him.

361
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,696
I don't have time to play these games.

362
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:44,597
All right Charlotte.

363
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,854
Lesson number 1.

364
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:47,647
You have to give it a rest.

365
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:50,416
Because it's about to be Sabbath,
the day of rest.

366
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,477
You wanna be a Jew?

367
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:57,160
Sit

368
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,740
Watch

369
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,208
Learn

370
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:06,167
Oh that is so sweet
but actually I'm suppose to meet my boyfriend¡¦

371
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:11,677
I can skip it.

372
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:14,499
Come girls. Gather.

373
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:29,838
Oh. Sorry.

374
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:48,520
Amen.

375
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,108
And Samantha was at Raw.

376
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:54,295
Ready to get things cooking.

377
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:55,482
Hey welcome to Raw.

378
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:58,923
Hello. I was here the other night.

379
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:00,357
That's what happens.
You come once,

380
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,803
you just keep coming over and over.

381
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:04,901
Here's hoping.

382
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:07,191
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'm getting slammed tonight.

383
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:10,120
For some reason the hostess keep
sitting everyone in my section.

384
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,478
Be right back.

385
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:17,371
Hey
/Hi

386
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:26,465
Suddenly, Samantha realized
why the Raw Food Movement was a movement.

387
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,828
Women weren't there for the cold food.

388
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:32,837
They were there for the hot waiter.

389
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:40,689
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

390
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:43,028
Hey. Look who's home.

391
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,868
Oh I got held up at work.

392
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,659
Thanks for filling in.

393
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,025
hi. Hi cutie. Hi cutie.

394
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,362
Did the TiVo guy come?

395
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:52,247
No.

396
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:56,668
They called and said they have to reschedule
for week from Thursday.

397
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:58,587
A week from Thursday?

398
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:02,200
Yeah. But I played around with a
few things and I think it's okay now.

399
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,620
What do you mean, it's working?

400
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,259
Yep.

401
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,459
I love you. I mean you know,
for fixing that.

402
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,731
Yeah. Well Magda said it was kinda important.

403
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:18,799
So. Listen, I gotta take off.

404
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,840
Hot date?

405
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,262
Yeah. I got this dinner thing.

406
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:25,057
So. See you later champ, all right?

407
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,856
Some things, like a broken TiVo can be repaired.

408
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:37,736
And others, like a broken heart
are a little more complicated.

409
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,276
4 hours and 4 courses of uncooked food later,

410
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:45,275
Samantha and her competitors waited it out.

411
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,458
Can I get you anything else?

412
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:24,073
Oh no.

413
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,258
I'm just enjoying my delicious mushroom tea.

414
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:28,950
Okay.

415
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,877
Did you want anything else?

416
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:32,626
You know what.

417
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:36,394
I would like to have some of that key lime custard.

418
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,003
It sounds too good to pass up.

419
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:40,846
Okay.

420
00:21:56,396 --> 00:22:00,108
Honey you put up a very good fight
but you have no idea who you're dealing with.

421
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:01,746
I'm going home with him

422
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:04,274
and you're going home with key lime custard.

423
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:09,596
So, what do you say,
I buy your dinner and we call it a night. Huh?

424
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,370
Okay.

425
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,790
Check!

426
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,530
Meanwhile, I was finally confident
I could heat up my sex life.

427
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,131
Because I was a sex columnist.

428
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:24,905
I was resourceful.

429
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:28,524
And I was drunkety drunk drunk.

430
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:38,982
Okay.

431
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,684
There. Oh.

432
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,784
I got a little something for you.

433
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:54,442
And you're gonna love it.

434
00:22:57,247 --> 00:23:00,694
Look at that. Hmm?

435
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:13,101
Get ready mister cause,

436
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,165
cause I got something under here for you.

437
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:26,094
Oh. And I have shoes.

438
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:30,376
Wait till you see me in these. Hmm?

439
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:42,965
Are you okay?

440
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:46,073
Yeah I'm fine.

441
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:57,357
And after a night of Raw food,

442
00:23:57,357 --> 00:24:06,161
Samantha enjoyed a all nighter of raw sex.

443
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:23,467
Hey. Can I tell you a secret?

444
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,424
You're twelve.

445
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,025
Didn't have to order all that shit.

446
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:30,364
I was ready to go home with you last Tuesday.

447
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:31,273
Now you tell me.

448
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:33,777
I ate a fucking cactus.

449
00:24:33,777 --> 00:24:36,315
Get back down there and make it up to me.

450
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,510
Awesome.

451
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:59,885
Samantha was still having sex
when it dawned on me Berger and I hadn't.

452
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:14,862
Hey
/Hey

453
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:19,686
We both knew it was now or never.

454
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:31,580
That morning I resigned myself to the idea
that I would never again have frozen drinks or hot sex.

455
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,668
I suck. This is awful.

456
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:34,650
I know.

457
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,430
Hadn't even been this bad.

458
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,673
Look, I don't wanna tube my own horn here all right

459
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,417
but I'm way better than this.

460
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,023
I've actually been told that I'm good at this.

461
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:44,432
I don't know what the fuck is happening.

462
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:46,298
We're so good everywhere else.

463
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:47,768
Would you look at us in restaurants?

464
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:48,625
We're the best.

465
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,023
We're the couple you wanna be.

466
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:52,588
All right.

467
00:25:52,588 --> 00:25:57,148
We gotta make the bed more like a restaurant.

468
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,876
Are you coming back?

469
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:06,534
Yeah. Grab something that'll help.

470
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:13,453
Now we're talking.
What have you got there, a pet?

471
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:16,589
Shoes.

472
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:22,661
Oh. Here.

473
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,676
Berger what if we're just not good together in bed?

474
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:28,209
No. don't say that. All right look.

475
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:31,252
I chocked. We had it all going on.

476
00:26:31,252 --> 00:26:32,086
We did.

477
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:33,216
And I thought it would be great

478
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,880
and I wanted it to be great and I chocked.

479
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,301
And I came over the next night

480
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:40,245
and I thought it would be better and..

481
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:40,785
I chocked.

482
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:41,603
What's up?

483
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:44,671
We should be smoking not chocking.

484
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,018
I think sometimes the rhyme helps.

485
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:48,643
I agree.

486
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:52,669
Those are some very sexy shoes.

487
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:53,857
Shall I put them on?

488
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:58,762
Yeah. Hey.
Couldn't hurt.

489
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:05,219
All right. Here.

490
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:06,787
Throw some of that over your left shoulder.

491
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:10,806
Come on. You want things to get worse?

492
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,809
I was gonna talk to you about it but.

493
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,681
Yeah I wanted to talk to you but.

494
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:15,799
Well let's make a deal.

495
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,683
I talk to you, you talk to me.

496
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:19,922
We should be able to talk about these things.

497
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:20,993
Let's talk about it.

498
00:27:20,993 --> 00:27:25,118
We'll talk.

499
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:35,750
That morning, the other shoe dropped.

500
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,548
And it wasn't bad at all.

501
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:41,325
In fact, it was kinda hot.
