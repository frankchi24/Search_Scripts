Epi 3. the perfect present

12
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:47,573
in a single gal's life,

13
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,732
there are three important firsts.

14
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:52,280
The first time you have sex;

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,192
the first time you have good sex;

16
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:58,909
and the first time you seea guy-you-just-started-dating's apartment.

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,228
Hey. Come on in.

18
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:13,945
Wow. Nice. Very nice.

19
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,732
Thank god.

20
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,144
You were expecting¡¦

21
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:20,640
Well one never knows.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,117
Gentlemen left their own devices.

23
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:26,025
Oh you name it I've seen it.

24
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:29,827
Leather couches,

25
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:32,115
two foot bongs.

26
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:33,511
Dead body in the corner.

27
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,672
Dead body, huh?

28
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:37,062
I only went out with him for a week after that.

29
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:41,318
But ah.. so far.

30
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,175
Nothing in here says scary bachelor.

31
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:45,093
Except me.

32
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:49,248
Hey. I really like this wall color.

33
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:50,912
Yeah. I can't take credit for that.

34
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:51,761
That's Lauren.

35
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:52,640
Ralph Lauren?

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,976
No. Lauren Lauren.

37
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,577
My ex-girlfriend.

38
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:57,051
She was the decorator.

39
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,898
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:00,181
I'm sorry. Is that weird?

41
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,012
Please. Please.

42
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:04,069
You have a decorator,

43
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:06,581
I have a decorator.

44
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:12,145
There is really no need forthe ex-decorator conversation.

45
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:15,397
Got it.

46
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,633
Should I set the alarm?
Do you need to get up early?

47
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:22,931
Nope. I'm all yours.

48
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,798
Good night.
/Good night.

49
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:27,158
Welcome to my house.

50
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:41,052
Oh.

51
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:43,565
Okay what's going on there?

52
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:46,250
Oh. That's my sound machine.

53
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,031
I'm a troubled sleeper.

54
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:50,381
Kinda hooked on it.

55
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:51,910
Frogs?

56
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,546
Yeah. It's the Gettys.

57
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:56,191
Officially around the rainforest.

58
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:59,965
Oh. That.. there's a bird.

59
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,368
Oh. I feel like I'm camping.

60
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,622
Not a big fan of camping.

61
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:08,423
Tomorrow morning,

62
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,499
I'll make you s'mores.

63
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:18,256
Always wondered about those.

64
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,476
Actually, it was a gift.

65
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:21,493
Oh. From.

66
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,897
Yeah Lauren.

67
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,397
She got for me about two weeks
after we started going out.

68
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:27,525
She hated it when I tossed and turned.

69
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,477
It was her therapist's idea.

70
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,481
Lauren always did everything her therapist..

71
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:35,092
Hmm. Okay. Okay.

72
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:37,875
So. Frogs?

73
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,843
What's so bad about frogs?

74
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:44,955
Good night.

75
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:49,115
You'll see. After a while,
you won't even hear it.

76
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:53,946
I could only hope he was referring
to his ex-decorator's name.

77
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,689
Okay. One drink and then we leave.

78
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,041
And one drink means one drink.

79
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,718
Tell me why we're going to this again?

80
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:04,465
She's an old friend going through a breakup.
We're being supportive.

81
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:05,861
On a Friday night?

82
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,107
She tried to kill herself.

83
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,326
It was six Advil's.

84
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,578
On an empty stomach.

85
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:10,620
Oh.

86
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,051
The good news is I'm off the Zoloft.

87
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,250
I lost ten pounds

88
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,192
and after that asshole dumped me,

89
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:20,629
I realized I have this amazing gift
for designing bags.

90
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,924
It's a purse party.

91
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:27,357
Oh.

92
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:28,972
Isn't this precious?

93
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:30,672
You can take it to lunch.

94
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:31,919
Hmm

95
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,800
Isn't life funny?

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,948
Because of that fucker,

97
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:38,791
I've discovered I'm Fendi!

98
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,598
Buy away.

99
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:50,636
When did making bags become
the fall back career?

100
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:56,042
Someone should tell crazy that owning a hot
glue gun does not make you a hot purse designer.

101
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,434
Don't call her crazy.

102
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:59,403
Look at this,
I'd rather carry a grocery bag.

103
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,470
Ladies these aren't bags. They're baggage.

104
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,458
We are standing among
the ruins of her last relationship.

105
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:08,302
And it was one ugly breakup.

106
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,536
I resent this.

107
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:12,251
The only one who should have to
pay for a bad relationship

108
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,427
is the person in your next relationship.

109
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,526
True and here's hoping that isn't me.

110
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,872
Last night Berger started opening the ex-file.

111
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,894
Fascinating. What do you know so far?

112
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,459
Well. Her name is Lauren,

113
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,012
she bought him a sharper image sound machine.

114
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,240
She's a monster.

115
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,518
I mean we just started dating.

116
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:31,942
Do I really need to hear about the ex already?

117
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,599
Yes. The sooner the better.

118
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,911
Maybe it should be the later the better.

119
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,655
Or better yet, the never the better.

120
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,000
It's good tuna.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,624
Carrie you have to know where he's been
so you know what you're getting.

122
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:42,793
As long as what you get doesn't itch,

123
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:43,873
I say you're fine.

124
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:45,482
Look. He has a past, I have a past.

125
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:47,439
Do our pasts really have to have a present?

126
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,971
Yes. At least find out how they broke up.

127
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:52,162
That will tell you a lot about their relationship.

128
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:53,594
See I was hoping to skip all that

129
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,337
and start fresh this time. Is that crazy?

130
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:59,789
No. Here comes crazy.

131
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,426
Look at this one.

132
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:02,921
Little shoes.

133
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,312
Isn't this fun?

134
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:06,529
Who needs a balding 38 year-old boyfriend

135
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,094
with a rectile disfunction

136
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:09,359
when you can have a new career

137
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,231
and cute cater waiters?

138
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:12,367
Excuse me.

139
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,365
Champagne for the girls.

140
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,080
Have fun!

141
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:17,619
Katie.

142
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:18,247
Hi.

143
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:18,903
Shoes.

144
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:21,573
Hey. Doesn't that waiter look familiar?

145
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,858
I fucked him.

146
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:24,887
Oh. That guy.

147
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:27,150
It's that waiter from Raw also known

148
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,580
as the best sex I've had in years.

149
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,652
This party just got a whole lot more exciting.

150
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:34,823
Okay.

151
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:38,740
Just one glass and
we've got dinner reservations at 66. Yes?

152
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,431
Okay but I can't stay out late
because I have a 9 a. m. conversion class

153
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:42,666
at the synagogue.

154
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,953
You had a 2-hour class today.

155
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:46,482
I know. I'm accelerating my studies.

156
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:48,526
There's just so much to take in.

157
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:51,358
the history, the tradition, the philosophy.

158
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:54,821
Oy! You guys!

159
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:58,700
That was my first oy!

160
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,011
Hi Victoria.

161
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:02,630
Hi. A whole bunch of folks just arrived

162
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,403
so I'm gonna need some more tuna tartlets.

163
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:14,425
Hello.

164
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,549
Oh my god.

165
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,498
I'm way too fucking fragile to see this.

166
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:31,982
You're fired.

167
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:34,697
This is my big purse party.

168
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,965
Victoria.

169
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,628
Does this come in any other colors?

170
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:48,764
Do I look like a fucking department store?

171
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:51,590
Get the fuck out of my apartment.

172
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,397
Come on you bitches.

173
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:53,507
Get out of my apartment.

174
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:58,195
Give it. Look what you did.

175
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:01,107
I cut up my bedspread for this.

176
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,551
Okay dinnertime.

177
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,171
The next day at Temple Emmanuel..

178
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:09,541
Soon, you'll be ready for your mikveh.

179
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,082
Who can tell me what the mikveh is.

180
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:14,237
Yes Charlotte.

181
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:17,912
It's the ceremony that
marks our official conversion to Judaism.

182
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:19,498
Very good.

183
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:25,217
and what does the service entail?

184
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:26,755
Yes Charlotte.

185
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:31,249
It's a ritual bath
where we are immersed in water and reborn a Jew.

186
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,627
Very good.

187
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:35,100
Charlotte, always the straight-A student,

188
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,642
took to her Judaism class like a gefilte fish to water.

189
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:41,226
As you come to rebirth as a Jew,

190
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:44,036
you'll find special and new traditions to embrace.

191
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:47,345
However, you must also bear in mind

192
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,349
you'll be letting go of your Christian traditions.

193
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,601
Many find Christmas to be
the most difficult to leave in the past.

194
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:58,005
You must grieve this loss,

195
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,174
it can be quite hard.

196
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,265
And speaking of the past

197
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,895
It's half past two.
You're 20 minutes late.

198
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:11,157
I know. I got held up.

199
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:12,693
I'm barely gonna make my appointment.

200
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:13,772
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,846
Debby had car trouble so I took a cab.

202
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,647
Debby? Who's Debby?

203
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,207
Debby, the girl I'm seeing.

204
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:24,401
Oh. So. Brady's changed and ready to go.

205
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:25,481
Don't forget the diaper bag.

206
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,324
And please try to have him back on time tomorrow.

207
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:30,658
I'm sorry. I'm never late. It's just her car..

208
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:31,939
Steve I don't need to know.

209
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,717
I just need you not to be 20 minutes late again.

210
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:37,866
Thanks.

211
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,972
Excuse me Rabbi Minch.

212
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:43,789
Yes Charlotte.

213
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,601
I was just wondering
what you said about Christmas.

214
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,861
How exactly black and white is that?

215
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,525
Charlotte, as a Jew,

216
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,430
you have to embrace the new holidays

217
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,417
and let go of the old.

218
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:59,279
Keeping Christmas would be like being a vegetarian

219
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,429
and still eating meat.

220
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:01,462
I wouldn't go to church

221
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:04,055
or anything but maybe I can still have a tree.

222
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:06,182
No.

223
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,704
Caroling?

224
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:12,414
Uh-uh.

225
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:13,666
Rudolph.

226
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,441
(No)

227
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:15,633
But Rabbi Minch.

228
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,622
Charlotte,

229
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:19,797
if you are serious about becoming a Jew,

230
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:23,564
you'll have to let go of your attachments to your past.

231
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:24,707
From that day on,

232
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,360
Charlotte would always think of him

233
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,515
as the Minch who stole Christmas.

234
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:32,208
That night, miles from the Amazon,

235
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:36,603
I was just drifting off the sleep when

236
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,845
Hello.?

237
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:48,852
Remember that red dress you had?

238
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,545
What? Where are you?

239
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:53,903
In California. In bed.

240
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,367
Oh. I was sleeping.

241
00:10:58,605 --> 00:10:59,866
Alone?

242
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,800
Yes. You woke me up.

243
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,809
You never used to need so much sleep kid.

244
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:08,814
I'm old now. Like you.

245
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:10,754
So the red dress.

246
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,267
Versace or Gucci?

247
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,786
That tiny little strap.

248
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,344
Gucci.

249
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,471
And when I stripeed one strap down,

250
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,167
the other would fall.

251
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,649
Remember that dress?

252
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,229
Yes.

253
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,552
You look good in that dress.

254
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,233
Yes.

255
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:31,669
Remember when I found you in your closet

256
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:34,022
just heels and a bra?

257
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:35,144
I came behind you

258
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,549
and you put your hands against the wall?

259
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,189
Remember that?

260
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:41,800
Yes.

261
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,296
So what'd you last night?

262
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:46,200
When to bed early.

263
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,266
Had accidental phone sex with Big.

264
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,046
What?

265
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:50,591
Brunch is suddenly looking up.

266
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:52,805
Well actually, he had phone sex.

267
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:55,585
I was on the other end trying to
figure out a polite way to get out of it.

268
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:56,932
It turns out,

269
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,884
there is no polite way to get out of phone sex.

270
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,288
I wasn't aware that you and Big had phone sex.

271
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,309
Occasionally. Since he moved away.

272
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,858
You have phone sex?

273
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:07,992
Well I prefer to think of it

274
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:12,365
not as phone sex so much as a trip down memory lane.

275
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,419
Well the next time he calls,

276
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,998
just tell him that you're
in a serious relationship with Berger.

277
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:18,215
But I'm not in a serious relationship with Berger.

278
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,729
We're still dating.

279
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:20,677
I mean it's good dating

280
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:22,038
but we don't know where it's going yet.

281
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:25,230
Well you're never gonna know
where it's going if you keep reminiscing with Big.

282
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,334
One doesn't have anything to do with the other.

283
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:28,707
I just don't know why you wanna drag

284
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,179
all that Big baggage into the new relationship.

285
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,567
It's not baggage, it's Biggage.

286
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:36,998
And Big is no more threat to Berger than Lauren is to me.

287
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:39,431
Thank you. It's all in the past.

288
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:40,725
And on your phone bill.

289
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:44,773
He called me. I'm a lady.

290
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,665
Oh. Come on pudding.

291
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:53,353
Hey. I'll get you a pacifier.

292
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:56,989
Yeah. Look at all that shit Steve has in here. Oh honey.

293
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,117
Isn't the baby birth control enough?

294
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:02,357
They're Steve's and Debby's-he's new girlfriend.

295
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:04,730
That's her name. Debby.

296
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,399
Where they doing it? Gymboree?

297
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,111
Debby does day care?

298
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:13,322
Oh honey relax.

299
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:16,399
I have those in my mouth all the time.

300
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,410
Later that day.

301
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,970
I got to thinking about tense relationships.

302
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,094
And by that, I mean a relationship

303
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,872
and its connection to the past,

304
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:26,247
present and future tense.

305
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,440
At a certain age,

306
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,899
we've all had relationships that far from past perfect.

307
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,066
But how much does that past relationship

308
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:36,148
affect our dream of a future perfect?

309
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,416
And as I became more and more tense,

310
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,460
I couldn't help but wonder,

311
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,383
can you get to a future if your past is present?

312
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,951
And over at Samantha's,

313
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:53,483
a day of great sex was about tofade into the past.

314
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:54,546
Are you absolutely sure you can't stay?

315
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:57,054
Yeah I gotta pull an extra shift overat the restaurant.

316
00:13:57,054 --> 00:14:01,236
I got fired from my other gig, remember?

317
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:04,826
Listen, I do feel bad about what happened.

318
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:07,353
And I wanted you to have this.

319
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,529
300 dollars?

320
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:14,660
I made some calls.

321
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,631
That is what the A list cater is paid.

322
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,520
Lady you are fucking out of your mind.

323
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:26,717
The next morning,

324
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:29,856
after another fitful night of frogs.

325
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:31,119
So you're gonna be okay here?

326
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,866
Absolutely. Go.

327
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:35,475
You know it's just stupid steaming breakfast thing

328
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,898
with a bunch of writer buddies.

329
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:39,946
I'd ask you along but we're a pretty pathetic bunch.

330
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,025
Please go. And for the record,

331
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:47,263
you, my friend, are not pathetic.

332
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:52,701
Hey you gonna get that?

333
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,562
You know what? 9:30 in the morning,

334
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,912
one word. Telemarketer.

335
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:59,742
I think that's a two word hyphen it.

336
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:02,417
Hey Jack it's Lauren.

337
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,792
It was official.

338
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:07,237
Lauren controlled every machine in the apartment.

339
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:09,224
And uh.. call me I wanna talk to you.

340
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:14,648
Fuck you and fuck you! Bye-bye.

341
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,532
Bye-bye.

342
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:21,159
You don't' want your new boyfriend

343
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,136
to still be in love with the ex
but you don't want¡¦

344
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:30,787
that is not the way you talk to your ex-decorator.

345
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:34,388
Damn, just when you thought
you didn't have to open the ex-file.

346
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,492
So he's doing a fuck you to the ex.

347
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:37,694
As long as he keeps fucking you,

348
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:38,898
what's the problem?

349
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,788
The problem is what's going on there?

350
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,499
What big thing happened between them

351
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,175
that would cause a double finger situation?

352
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,151
And if it wasn't big,

353
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,627
why is he still so angry?

354
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,471
Does he have a problem with anger?

355
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,853
And here come the questions.

356
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:53,384
You're right. Men are crazy.

357
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:54,906
I fucked that waiter at the party

358
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,227
and he got fired for it.

359
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:58,282
So I gave him 300 dollars the next time

360
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:01,243
we fucked and now I think he's upset.

361
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,165
Okay. Not the same situation.

362
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,434
I don't see what the problem is.

363
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:05,828
It's like a big tip.

364
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,829
300 dollars in a restaurant is a big tip.

365
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,543
300 dollars in the bedroom is a big prostitute.

366
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,346
Well at least it wasn't phone sex.

367
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:15,505
He called me.

368
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:18,115
Yeah keep telling yourself that.

369
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:21,382
Right on time.

370
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:23,578
And I appreciate that. I do.

371
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,980
Come in.

372
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,591
I'm just getting
Brady ready to go out for a night with his dad.

373
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,214
Packing up the old diaper bag,

374
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:34,297
making sure he has everything he needs.

375
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:40,577
Bottle, binkie, Trojans.

376
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:41,493
Look, Miranda.

377
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:44,586
I'm not exactly thrilled
that our baby is having sex already,

378
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,918
but I sure am glad that he's using protection.

379
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,294
Haha hoho. Got your point. Very funny.

380
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:51,621
No Steve. Not funny, fucked up.

381
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:52,973
Come on, it's just condoms.

382
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,344
In the diaper bag, Steve?

383
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:57,656
How much sex are you having that
you need rubbers in the diaper bag?

384
00:16:57,656 --> 00:16:59,769
What's it to you?

385
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,519
Apparently, some of Miranda's baggage
had shifted during fight.

386
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,967
I just don't think
you're taking this parenting thing seriously.

387
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:08,743
What?

388
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:10,550
You show up late to pick him up.

389
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,458
One time.

390
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,683
More than one time.

391
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,852
There was that time that other time
when you were late.

392
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:16,851
Okay. What's you're problem?

393
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,057
This is not about me.

394
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,502
This is about your need to start taking responsibility

395
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,110
for your child and clearly,

396
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,344
there are times when you can't

397
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:25,031
because your mind is somewhere else.

398
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:26,394
What are you talking about?

399
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:29,683
Like when your penis is in some girl's vagina

400
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,334
and when you're having an orgasm

401
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:34,623
when our baby is quietly suffocating in the other room.

402
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:36,390
Debby and I never do it when he's awake.

403
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,680
Okay. Steve. You're not getting this.

404
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,686
I am saying your focus needs to be totally

405
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,032
and completely on Brady.

406
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:48,385
My focus is always 100 percent on Brady.

407
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,818
Brady!

408
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,579
See?

409
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,038
That night, the only thing Miranda and Steve

410
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:03,403
could agree on was separate diaper bags.

411
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:23,900
Hey beautiful, I'm here.

412
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:28,632
What's all this?

413
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:31,629
It's my last Christmas tree.

414
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:32,758
It's July.

415
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,292
That's right so it doesn't count.

416
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:38,317
Charlotte, honey. You can have a tree.

417
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,534
Lots of Jews do.

418
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:44,674
Wouldn't be appropriate.

419
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,182
Oh look.

420
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:48,449
It's my favorite ornament.

421
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,246
Silent night holy night. See?

422
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:54,123
That's the holy family in the nativity.

423
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,325
This was my Grandma York's.

424
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,398
It's so old.

425
00:18:57,398 --> 00:19:01,009
See how there's hardly any glitter
left on the baby Jesus?

426
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:05,240
It's very rare to have a blue Christmas ornament.

427
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,619
Is that a fact?

428
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,473
Yeah.

429
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:16,425
They're usually red or green. Silver. Gold.

430
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:21,120
Keep Christmas, who cares?

431
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,060
I do. I'm gonna do this right.

432
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,237
I'm not gonna be a meat eating vegetarian.

433
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,004
No, these all have to go.

434
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:31,126
Except this one. We're keeping this.

435
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:35,318
What the hell? They were Jews too.

436
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:40,854
Dreidl, dreidl, dreidl, I made it out of clay.

437
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:43,935
And when it's something, something.

438
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:45,530
Dry and ready.

439
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,588
Impressive. Dry and ready.

440
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,767
Oh dreidl, I will play.

441
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:59,368
That night Charlotte realized the memory
she was giving up, might be nothing

442
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:01,716
compared to the memory she was getting.

443
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,484
And Samantha realized, to make things right,

444
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:08,492
she would need to service someone else for a change.

445
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:11,806
Hello. My name is Samantha.

446
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:14,003
I'll be your waitress this evening.

447
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,158
Tonight I will be serving you.

448
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:20,849
You are fucking crazy.

449
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,119
Well Mr. Waiter you have no idea.

450
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,512
You don't know my name, do you?

451
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:29,246
Of course I do. Paul.

452
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:30,493
It's Jerry.

453
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,073
I took a shot.

454
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:33,798
When you're a waiter,

455
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:37,173
you must always be aware,

456
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:41,547
that the customer comes first.

457
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:46,348
It's a hard, hard job.

458
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,359
You know, Samantha,

459
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm not just a waiter.

460
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,264
Oh, is that right Jamie.

461
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:55,584
Jerry.

462
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,676
You're right.

463
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:59,311
Yeah. I'm an actor.

464
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:04,183
Oh god. There goes my hard-on.

465
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:11,732
It's a good thing I still have mine.

466
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:14,354
Samantha had had many waiters in her past

467
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:15,984
but to the present day,

468
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,958
this was her very first Jerry.

469
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:26,258
As for me, I spent another night

470
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:29,955
not sleeping in Berger's bed.

471
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:40,756
You okay?

472
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:42,619
No. I can't sleep.

473
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:43,810
Frogs?

474
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,920
Frogs are fine.

475
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,703
What's up?

476
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,203
Nothing. Nothing.

477
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:54,631
Go back to sleep.

478
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:55,998
Jesus.

479
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,608
It's the frogs. I'll turn it off.

480
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:01,371
No. No, it's not the frogs.

481
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,031
It's Lauren.

482
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:06,788
What about her?

483
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:08,137
Okay for the record.

484
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:11,865
I was hoping to skip this and start fresh.

485
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:14,574
But what's going on with you
and the double finger?

486
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:15,726
The double what?

487
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:19,139
The other day to the answering machine?

488
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:22,604
Right.

489
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:23,851
Do we need to talk about this?

490
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,811
She just drives me crazy.

491
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,996
You know, she keeps calling here.

492
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:29,089
she wants to go out to lunch for closure.

493
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:30,130
That's her word.

494
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,363
I would never say closure,

495
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,649
I mean, not two in the morning.

496
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,210
She keeps bugging me.

497
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:44,292
She thinks it's important in order to move on.

498
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,042
What do you think?

499
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:49,931
I think that it's gonna take a lot more than a lunch.

500
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:54,351
What?

501
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:58,272
No. It's embarrassing.

502
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:02,610
She cheated on me.

503
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,812
That's how it ended.

504
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:06,506
She broke my heart.

505
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:07,758
And very much killed me

506
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:12,624
and I was dead. Till you.

507
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:22,308
And then there is another important first.

508
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:27,469
The first time you realized
this really might be something.

509
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:29,910
You ever been that hurt?

510
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:36,420
Yep. You wanna tell me about it?

511
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,396
And just like that,

512
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:45,351
we moved out of the present and into our future.

513
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,579
How much time you got?

514
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:48,565
I got all night.

515
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:50,632
So now,

516
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:53,086
it was time to clear up the past.

517
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:11,183
Hey it's me.

518
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,892
Well hello there.

519
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:13,952
Have you got a minute?

520
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,050
Yeah sure.
I'm just relaxing in my hot tub.

521
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,351
A hot tub? Oh shame on you.

522
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:22,072
That is such a cliche.

523
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:24,367
No. A Jacuzzi is cliche.

524
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,703
A hot tub is retro.

525
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:30,281
Hey remember the time
when we were in the Jacuzzi in the 4 seasons?

526
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:31,744
Okay. Okay.

527
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,101
Hold on there partner.

528
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:36,483
This is not gonna be one of those types of calls.

529
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:38,409
What type of calls?
I was talking about

530
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:40,555
when you lost your necklace in the jets.

531
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:41,373
oh

532
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:43,461
But if you'd like to make it one of those phone calls,

533
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,287
I'm a $1.50 for the first minute

534
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,405
and 50 cents for each additional minute.

535
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:49,076
Please stop..

536
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:51,452
What's on your mind baby?

537
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:53,599
I was just calling to tell you

538
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:59,510
that we won't be having anymore of those calls.

539
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,543
Really? Why is that?

540
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,639
Because we're just friends now.

541
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:05,443
Those are friendly calls.

542
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:08,711
I don't talk to my friends like that.

543
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:09,606
I do.

544
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:12,819
Well maybe that's why you have so few.

545
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:16,329
You got me there.

546
00:25:19,024 --> 00:25:20,951
I started seeing someone.

547
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:23,512
Were you seeing someone the other night?

548
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:27,080
Yes. But it just got serious.

549
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,280
I see.

550
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,823
So. I think we have to leave all that in the past.

551
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,995
Consider it in the past.

552
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,055
But we'll stay friends.

553
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,425
Friends.

554
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:45,088
Good friends.

555
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:49,029
His name is Jack Berger.

556
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:50,830
He's a writer as well.

557
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:57,876
Okay kid.
Hey give me a call sometime.

558
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:01,153
Any kind of call you want.

559
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,854
That night in the basement of a synagogue,

560
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:15,035
after 75 accelerated classes,

561
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:17,836
Charlotte, the Episcopalian princess

562
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:21,722
was reborn a Jew.

563
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:26,074
Leaving the old Charlotte behind.

564
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:28,624
Was this tub drained before me?

565
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:32,961
Well, not all of her.

566
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:41,378
Hey.

567
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:44,052
I finally figured out what you needed.

568
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:44,888
Oh yeah?

569
00:26:44,888 --> 00:26:47,435
I thought about it and I thought about it

570
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:50,639
and I narrowed it down to two choices.

571
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:55,918
A palate surprise for this.

572
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,043
Well I already have a Pulitzer.

573
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:58,119
You do?

574
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,567
Well I don't like to brag it.

575
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:03,009
Well then, I choice right.

576
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,278
It's for a fresh start.

577
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:08,022
It's the newest sound machine

578
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:11,459
they make with many other sounds besides frogs.

579
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:13,652
I don't care for frogs.

580
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:16,443
New start, new sound.

581
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:19,637
Deal.

582
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,187
That same night,

583
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:35,637
next to Berger and Surf Sounds #4,

584
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:36,737
I slept more soundly

585
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:41,861
than I have as long as I can remember.
