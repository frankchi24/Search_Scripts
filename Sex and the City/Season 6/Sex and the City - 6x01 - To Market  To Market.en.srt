Epi 1. to market, to market

12
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:47,838
When you live in the citythat never sleeps,

13
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:50,474
it comes as a bit of a shocking when somehow,

14
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:52,527
you manage to oversleep.

15
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:58,138
Oh. Oh. Taxi! Taxi!

16
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:07,955
Oh, excuse me.

17
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,215
Oh, Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:19,752
Oh, taxi!

19
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:28,644
Thank you

20
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:45,499
Sir. Sir, I have to be downtown in 30 minutes.

21
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,389
Thank you.

22
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,609
Keep the change.

23
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:18,692
Excuse me, Hi.

24
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,122
Which way is the Stock Exchange?

25
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:21,188
There.

26
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:21,597
Thank you.

27
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,190
Oh, excuse me.

28
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,652
? / Ok.

29
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,330
Stop.

30
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,731
Oh, here, can you hold that?

31
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:41,805
Let's go. Stop. Arm.

32
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:46,834
I'm sorry. Oh. Oh,

33
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,163
sir. Sir, can you hurry? I'm here to ring the bell.

34
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,017
Go right ahead.

35
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:59,707
Thank you.

36
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:04,208
All right.

37
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,023
You have to put this onand we gotta hurry up.

38
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,899
This way.

39
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:26,041
Today, one of New York's favorite newspapers,the New York Stars going public,

40
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:32,115
and here at open trading,is one of its favorite columnists, Carrie Bradshaw.

41
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:37,079
You can press it.

42
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:43,869
The day after the stock market,

43
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,996
I met the ladies for lunch in the fashionable meat market.

44
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:52,066
It was so exciting. It almost made me invest in something.

45
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,413
I love the stock market. A room full of screaming sweaty men, all trying to get it up.

46
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:58,022
I don't invest in anymore. It's too volatile.

47
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:00,708
Exactly. I want my money right where I can see it. Hanging in my closet.

48
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:06,253
Actually, your stock is up. I bought some shares of your newspaper yesterday.

49
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:08,774
Really? Well thank you sweetie, was it expensive?

50
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:10,696
Oh, no you're cheap.

51
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:11,992
Well, I never.

52
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:13,038
Menus.

53
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:15,113
Thank you.

54
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:17,466
Twenty dollars for a hamburger. Oh that's reasonable.

55
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:24,167
Pathetic. When I moved to this neighborhood,the only thing that cost twenty dollars was a hand job from a?

56
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,335
I'm serious. It's all gotten so sanitary.

57
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,817
I mean no smoking in bars.

58
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:30,882
What's next? No fucking in bars?

59
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:33,332
Well first there would have to be a no fucking section.

60
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:37,221
I mean, just look at this street. Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen.

61
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:40,471
The only designer name that belongs in the meat packing district,

62
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,727
is Oscar Meyer.

63
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:44,424
I never liked his clothes. Too fatty.

64
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:48,130
But that's what great about New York. There's always a new neighborhood, a new restaurant.

65
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,468
A new man.

66
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:50,545
Oh.

67
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:55,108
That's right. Friday night, my first official date with Jack Berger.

68
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:57,643
That is so exciting. Isn't that exciting?

69
00:04:57,643 --> 00:05:01,150
Oh sure. It's all fun and games till someone has a child.

70
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,427
So, what do you two have planned?

71
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:07,511
Well, he hasn't said yet so many, many outfits needed to be scouted.

72
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,637
Oh you kids today and your dating.

73
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:13,142
I know. I feel like a girl of 35 again.

74
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:16,703
Oh.

75
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:18,054
I really like him.

76
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,509
And you better find out his bottom line, right up front.

77
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,997
If Harry had told me that he could only be serious about me if I were a Jewish,

78
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:25,970
I doubt I'd be in my situation.

79
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,609
I don't get it. What kind of man passes up pussy for Purim?

80
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:37,005
Soup and a tenderloin of pork. What's with the face?

81
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,200
I didn't make a face.

82
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,177
I said pork, you went¡¦

83
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:43,961
But it's just I'm confused.

84
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,332
I mean you can order pork

85
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:48,789
but you can't get serious about a future with mebecause I'm not Jewish.

86
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:55,031
And from the meat market, to the marriage market.

87
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,645
Charlotte, it doesn't work that way. I'm not kosher, I'm conservative.

88
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:58,004
I'm conservative too.

89
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,270
Yeah well my conservative doesn't have anything to do with wearing pearls.

90
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,452
Look I know what you're thinking. Okay?

91
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,859
Why did I let things get this far without talking about this?

92
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:05,893
Why did I sleep with you?

93
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,009
Why did I even kiss you.

94
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,036
Why did you?

95
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,279
Because I couldn't not kiss me.

96
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,813
Not sleep with you. Not see you. Believe me,

97
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:18,393
I never thought a shiksa a goddess like you would fall for a putz like me.

98
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:20,949
You're not a putz.

99
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,031
Do you even know what a putz means?

100
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,414
Yes. Shmuck(?).

101
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:29,863
Sure you're not Jewish?

102
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,245
And from Jewish to Poo-ish.

103
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:40,012
Um.. Miranda. You got a little dootie on your forehead.

104
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:42,167
What? Where?

105
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,615
Oh, now you got more. The other side.

106
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:47,794
Which side? How's it.. well help,

107
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:54,668
it's not funny! Baby wipe me. Get it off.

108
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,433
Baby wipe me.

109
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:11,584
I did not say it like that. Just get it off. Baby wipe me. Oh yeah. Let's see how you like it. You like it? You don't like it?Miranda, Miranda, no. Mister, mister I'm your baby. Brady help. Tell mommy to stop chasing daddy. What?

110
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,149
I just don't think it's fucking funny.

111
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,242
You weren't the one with shit on your face.

112
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:15,778
You were chasing me.

113
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:18,875
You know, I don't have time for this. I have to get up early.

114
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,410
I don't even know why you're still here.

115
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,711
You dropped off the baby hours ago.

116
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:26,817
I don't have time to stand around while you read the paper and order food in.

117
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,565
don't you have a life?

118
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:36,476
Yeah I got a life. Bye Brady.

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,487
Hey. I'm in love with Steve. Hold this.

120
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:50,642
Oh my god I can't believe it.

121
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,799
Come on, are you seriously telling me you didn't know?

122
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,282
Oh I knew. I just can't believe you admitted it.

123
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:57,090
I need a drink. What have you got?

124
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,896
It's 11:30 on a Saturday morning.

125
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:03,587
Did you not hear me just say I'm was love with Steve?

126
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:07,844
I think I got an old bottle of? somewhere.

127
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:11,930
Okay. Hold on there Brady. Mama needs a cocktail.

128
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,433
Last night we were in the dining room

129
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,311
and we were laughing and all of a sudden,

130
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:21,047
I looked over at him and I realized we belong together.

131
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,620
Oh Miranda.

132
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,651
Yeah. So I picked a huge fight and threw him out of my apartment.

133
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:30,629
Good thinking. Okay.

134
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:33,582
These Triskets have been in here since the mid 80s.

135
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,784
I so cannot be in love with Steve.

136
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:39,100
Steve's so is not the guy for me.

137
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,489
Oh Miranda.

138
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,800
You're right. Steve's so is the guy for me.

139
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:47,633
Oh no no. I was just asking ifBrady can eat crackers yet.

140
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:51,583
No. I can I have been wrongall these years?

141
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:56,031
You weren't wrong. It just took you a while to get here.

142
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:59,349
So, what are you gonna do?

143
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:02,294
I don't know. I have a lot invested in this relationship.

144
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,678
Plus we have the baby.

145
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:06,228
Yeah plus you said you were in love with him.

146
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,401
Yeah.

147
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,602
So how are you gonna tell him?

148
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:14,989
Maybe I should take him somewhere romanticwhere I can't start a fight?

149
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:19,106
Oh my god, Miranda,do you know what this means?

150
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:22,244
You're asking Steve out on a date.

151
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:27,604
Hi Samantha. /I Al.

152
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:31,845
Looking good Sam. /Hi.

153
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,494
That night as Samantha walked home,

154
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,247
past her friendly neighborhood bar the Rampole,

155
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:39,860
she saw something truly upsetting.

156
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:52,475
Just what we need. Another wall street asshole with money.

157
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,803
Hold the door.

158
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:07,099
Hi. Thanks.

159
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:10,798
I live here, see? Here are my keys.

160
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:13,099
Chip Kilkenny. I just moved in.

161
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,797
Samantha Jones. 3F.

162
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,920
I'm 4F. you live right under me.

163
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,023
That sounds promising. It's quite a car.

164
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:28,951
I love a nice hummer. Well. Good night.

165
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:39,547
And up time, in a slightly less obvious maneuver.

166
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:40,746
Oh, I'm close.

167
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:46,983
Oh honey. Is this all Jewish thing really that big a deal?

168
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:55,063
No. no. oh god. No. no.

169
00:10:56,758 --> 00:11:00,514
The next morning, bright and early.

170
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:03,932
Good morning.

171
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:06,102
There's a happy face.

172
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:09,946
I am a happy face. It's a beautiful morning,

173
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:12,672
and the sun is shining,

174
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,060
and you changed your mind about the Jewish thing.

175
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,962
Wow. What Jewish thing? When?

176
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:22,318
Last night. I asked you ifit was really that important to you and you said no.

177
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:23,503
I did?

178
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:27,929
Yeah. When we were making love,right before you came.

179
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,659
How could you not remember?

180
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:34,194
Charlotte, honey. I can't remember my own name right before I come.

181
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,734
Well that's what you said.

182
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:39,009
Ask? Judiasm during sex is a clear manipulation.

183
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:45,220
Oh, bla-bla-bla. Just don't understandwhy is it so important to you?

184
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,063
I promised my mother I would marry a Jew.

185
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:49,279
Your mother?

186
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,314
Charlotte had had her fill of potential husbandsand their demanding mothers.

187
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:56,079
Harry's' stock suddenly began to plummet.

188
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,006
Yeah, right before she dies.

189
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,634
And just like that, it was up again.

190
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:06,068
I'm very sorry your mother's no loner with us,

191
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:07,546
because if she met me,

192
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:10,306
She would fall in love with youlike I did and not care?

193
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:14,203
No. Jews don't think like that.

194
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:16,066
Keeping tradition alive was very important to her.

195
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:19,489
She lost family in the holocaust. What?

196
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:25,387
Now I can't say anything

197
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:28,999
because you've brought up the Holocaust.

198
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:35,103
Hi it's me. Leave a message.

199
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:39,812
Hi. It's Jack. Berger. Not Carewack.

200
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,185
Wanted to clear that up.

201
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:43,831
So you're probably standing there screening.

202
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,806
Way to play it. I'm a big fan of the screen.

203
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:50,075
In fact, don't pick up or I'll panic and hang up.

204
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,671
Don't pick up.

205
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,653
I'm not ready for actual voice on voice action.

206
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:57,591
So I'm jumping right in and suggesting dinner

207
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,685
and a movie for the big date.

208
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:02,868
Everybody's really loving that movie 'Craig's Room'.

209
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,756
So, why don't we go and hate it?

210
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:10,998
Here come the movie times. We have 5:15, we have a 7 o'clock.

211
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,022
And he calculated which timesand which theatres would be least crowded,

212
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:18,523
which saids 'take charge' yet left the restaurant choice to me,

213
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:19,901
which saids flexible.

214
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,244
All and all, the perfect machine message.

215
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:27,218
I think Berger and I are gonna be very happy together.

216
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,248
Oh I love this time before the first date

217
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:32,152
when you can make statements like that and almost believe them.

218
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:33,864
Why all the drama?

219
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,417
Because I really like him.

220
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,923
And you can imagine what that does to a girl.

221
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:40,657
Got it. Say no more. Really say no more.

222
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:43,800
Oh, and right after he called,I got a message from this other fella,

223
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,166
who I've known for a year suddenly asking me out on a date

224
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,541
which only proves my theory;

225
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,389
the only thing a girl needs to get a date is another date.

226
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:51,990
Your stock is up.

227
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,018
And did you say yes?

228
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:54,277
No. I already have a date.

229
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,278
Which is why you should say yes to the other one.

230
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:58,974
I think you're putting on a lot of pressure on this Berger date.

231
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:02,093
Honey, Charlotte's right. You need to do something to take the edge off.

232
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:04,479
I'm not going on a simu-date.

233
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:07,232
Carrie, how many new outfitshave you bought for this movie.

234
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:11,539
Be honest. Six. All returnable.

235
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,389
All right maybe just a casual coffeeto take the edge of Berger.

236
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,576
Exactly.

237
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:20,072
Later that day I got to thinking about stock market and dating.

238
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,629
Are they really that different?

239
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,980
If you have a bad stock, you could lose your shirt.

240
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,361
If you have a bad date, you could lose your will to live.

241
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:33,110
And if the date is good, the stakes get even higher.

242
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,428
After weathering all the ups and downs,

243
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:38,215
you could one day find yourself with nothing.

244
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:42,154
So, when it comes to finance and dating,

245
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:44,321
I couldn't help but wonder,

246
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:50,672
why do we keep investing?

247
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:55,661
And speaking of high risk investments:

248
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:07,261
Hey, it's me. I'm not here. Try me at Scout, 957-7297.

249
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:09,681
don't forget the 212.

250
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:16,054
Hi, Steve. Hi. Steve.

251
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:18,819
I need to talk to you about something.

252
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,261
How about we do it over dinner?How's tomorrow night?

253
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:24,193
Magda could sit with Brady.

254
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:27,783
Let me know. Bye. Oh,

255
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:32,255
it's Miranda. And.. bye.

256
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:36,981
Miranda feared it was possiblythe most imperfect machine message ever.

257
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:41,993
And Samantha, decided to say it with a basket.

258
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:52,067
Welcome?

259
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,954
Hi. Excuse the tower.

260
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,372
I was just in the shower.

261
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,661
I brought you a basket filled with goodiesto acquaint you with your new neighborhood.

262
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:03,483
Cheese,?, condoms, handcuffs.

263
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:08,753
Handcuffs?/From the bar next door. Enjoy.

264
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:12,083
If I reach for the, my towel will fall.

265
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:19,821
I'm no fool.

266
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:25,933
A little while later,Samantha blew Chip. Stockbroker.

267
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:31,030
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

268
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,968
Now that's what I call eating in.

269
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:39,243
Look, I never do this but here's a tip.

270
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:43,444
Alarn aceuticals. It's gonna splint through the roof.

271
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:50,546
Alarn pharmaceuticals. Thanks.

272
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:52,030
No thank you.

273
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,556
That was the best effing head of my life.

274
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:59,094
Just like that, their mutual fun,

275
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:02,396
turned into mutual funds.

276
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:08,409
Later that week, I met graphic designer,Willie Applegate for a late afternoon simu-date.

277
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:12,434
It's a cute place. /Yeah, I hope it's okay. I didn't know.

278
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,513
You know, can't go wrong with a garden, right?

279
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:18,367
Yeah, it's great. I hope it's okay.

280
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:22,158
I didn't know. I just said that.

281
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:28,117
It suddenly became clear that a simu-datefor me was a first date for him.

282
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:34,659
Are you looking at my sty?Excuse me?

283
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:38,803
My sty. I have a sty. See, right here. I was gonna cancel but maybe,

284
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:45,531
she won't even notice it. /I didn't even.. no, I wasn't looking at it.

285
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,442
It's good. Oh.

286
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,188
What. Oh.

287
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:51,996
What was that?

288
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:53,591
Have you ever seen anything like that?

289
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:55,753
No, I have never.

290
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:57,527
This is a bad choice of place. I'm sorry.

291
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:59,728
No, it's fine. It's fun.

292
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:04,292
It's like cappuccino, wilderness safari.

293
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:11,856
Ouch. balsamic vinegar in my sty. Ouch.

294
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:18,708
Oh god, here. Here. Here you go.

295
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,023
Thanks. Can this go any worse?

296
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:29,978
What, what the fuck. I'm fine. I'm fine.

297
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:33,816
It was a sudden crash, no analyst could see it coming.

298
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:36,135
And in yet another type of market.

299
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:39,319
Well I hope you're happy. Now I'm twice as nervous about my Berger date.

300
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,298
Caring too much is like a disaster magnet.

301
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:43,313
Poor guy.

302
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:46,369
Can you catch a sty helping someone up from gravel?

303
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,071
Where's the homeopathic section?

304
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:50,698
Maybe they make something called sty-be-gone.

305
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:53,924
Did you know that Elizabeth Taylorconverted to Judaism for Eddie Fisher?

306
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,962
I'm thrown by the change of topicbut I do appreciate the trivia.

307
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:59,577
I'm reading her book 'My Love Affair with Jewelry'.

308
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:00,642
Not surprising.

309
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:03,681
And she changed her religion for the man she loves.

310
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:05,680
And a big and honk a piece of jewelry.

311
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,392
Don't be so cynical. /Sorry, it's my potential sty talking.

312
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:12,432
Love, she did it for love.

313
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:15,435
Are you thinking of pulling an Elizabeth Taylor?

314
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:16,998
I need more information.

315
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:19,095
There's more to being a Jew than jewelry.

316
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:33,170
Wise words. I'll be at the check-out. /Okay.

317
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,842
Charlotte wondered justhow far she would go for her true love.

318
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:47,262
Did you know that Elizabeth Taylorconverted to Judaism for Eddie Fisher?

319
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:50,691
No, don't get too excited. We're just trading information here.

320
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:56,633
Okay. And from a not excited place I ask,is this something you might consider?

321
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,517
I'm just trying to understand. What's so special about being a Jew?

322
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:01,270
It's like I'm on a game show.

323
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,816
Serious. If this is really your bottom line,and you're gonna have to tryand give me a reason aside from your mother

324
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,417
that I can relate to.

325
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:17,568
Well, if we were to get married,

326
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:21,408
we're just trading information here,

327
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:24,408
I would want our children to be raised Jewish.

328
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:25,884
Charlotte, realized,

329
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:30,491
it was time to reveal to Harry, her bottom line.

330
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:39,005
Well if that's really the reasonthen I have to tell you something.

331
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:46,586
I may not be able to give you children.

332
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:50,833
I'm challenged in the reproductive area.

333
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:56,000
It's not hopeless, but it's difficult.

334
00:20:56,736 --> 00:21:01,610
I guess I should have brought it up soonerbut I never thought that we.

335
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:08,939
I understand if you. /Charlotte. I love you.

336
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:14,316
You're the most wonderful thingthat could happen to a shmuck like me.

337
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,481
You're not a shmuck.

338
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:21,451
You're a putz. Seriously Harry.

339
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:26,738
You want a family

340
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:29,869
and what if I couldn't give that to you?

341
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:32,361
We'll adopt or something.

342
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:36,982
But they wouldn't be your own.

343
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:38,765
What are you gonna do?

344
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:46,344
Charlotte York was deeply touchedby Harry Goldenblatt's humor,compassion, and acceptance.

345
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:50,200
If this is Jewish, she thought,that's worth looking into.

346
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:58,803
Meanwhile, downtown,Samantha had moved to a neighbor from stockand bonds to stockings and bondage.

347
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:03,025
Go away, I'm busy.

348
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:08,017
Ms. Jones. /Juan.

349
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:09,698
Who the fuck are you?

350
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:13,201
FBI. Get dressed. You're under arrest for insider trading.

351
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,877
Turns out, Chip Kilkenny was quite the lady's man.

352
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:19,239
And every time a woman went down,the Dow went up.

353
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,596
Ma'am can you undo your cuffs,so we can use ours?

354
00:22:21,596 --> 00:22:28,665
Surely. All the good ones are getting arrested.

355
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:32,540
And at a romantic restaurant,

356
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,928
a 30 year old single motherfound herself on a first date.

357
00:22:37,928 --> 00:22:42,509
You look pretty. You got a date later?

358
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:46,340
No. it's just the dress.

359
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,707
Geez. It's dark in here I can barely read my menu.

360
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:52,196
We need another candle or something.

361
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:58,722
I think it's kind of nice. Steve.

362
00:22:58,722 --> 00:22:59,662
Yeah?

363
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:05,130
I asked you here because I wanted to explainwhy I picked a fight with you last week.

364
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,420
Miranda. I know you wanted to pick a fight with me.

365
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,965
You do?

366
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:14,471
Yeah. You're upsetbecause I'm hanging around too much.

367
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,229
You think I'm getting too close.

368
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:20,517
But you don't have to worrybecause I just seeing someone else

369
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:26,581
and it's going really good so please, relax.

370
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:30,925
I'm not in love with you anymore.

371
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:41,446
All that stuff I said to you about Steve,never happened.

372
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:44,433
Don't mention it to anyone. Don't think about it.

373
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,851
Don't even so much as give me a looklike you might be thinking about it.

374
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:52,585
Like that look.

375
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:56,167
Can't ever never see that look again. Will you please calm down?I think you're overreacting to that thing that never happened.

376
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,235
Do you think I'm overreacting here?You should get inside my head.

377
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:05,920
Miranda, I have to say this next thingbut I will play along and not look at youwhile I say it.

378
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,958
Maybe if you had told Steve anyway,/Carrie, I swear to god I love youbut I will have to kill you. Brady,

379
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,456
come on. Work with mommy here. Please.

380
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:19,094
I'm sorry but I'm looking and I'm talking.

381
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:22,527
This is your life. You two have a baby together.

382
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:28,322
It's not high school. Isn't that Berger?

383
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:33,021
Oh god. I look like shit. You don't look like shit.

384
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:36,485
I look like shit. This is not my perfect outfit.

385
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:45,761
Are you leaving?/Bye. Oh god shit.

386
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:58,466
I was just entering the safety zone when..

387
00:24:58,466 --> 00:24:59,599
there he was.

388
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:07,556
My emotional equivalent,the big crash of 29. Aidan.

389
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:27,627
Hey. Look at you. /Look at you. I had a baby.

390
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:31,102
I have a date.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
