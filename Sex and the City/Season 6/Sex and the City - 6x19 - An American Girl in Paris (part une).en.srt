Season 6 Ep 19. An American
Girl in Paris (Part One)

11
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:50,231
Some outfits wait a lifetime
to be taken somewhere special.

12
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,221
The same can be true of people.

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,743
Hi, it's Aleks.

14
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:03,602
Stop packing,
they have clothes here in Paris.

15
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:06,190
See you tomorrow. Safe flight.

16
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:12,420
Hi, it's Miranda. No, this is not my fortieth
please-don't-go-to-Paris call.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,360
It's been three weeks,
is that funny yet(?)?

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,114
Anyway, I got us a dinner reservation.
You're leaving at 9,

19
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:20,997
so we have to eat at six.
Which makes us senior citizens, thank you.

20
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,709
Or should I say merci beau..
please don't go.

21
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:29,084
Carrie, it's me.

22
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:33,755
I'm in town. Look,
I'd really like to see you, so call me.

23
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,735
Same number and in case
you've forgotten, it's..

24
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:38,594
Deleted.

25
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:43,277
After many more hours of packing,

26
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:46,524
I was off for our version of the last supper.

27
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:54,330
Well, if Mohammed won't come to the mountain.

28
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:58,259
Hiya, kid.

29
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,921
Hi.

30
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,286
I was in the neighborhood,
saw your light on.

31
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,044
Can I talk to you?

32
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,891
Well, I'm late for dinner with the girls.

33
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,634
It's five forty-five.

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,946
Come on, get in, it's cold.

35
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:40,450
- Raoul, give us a minute, would you?
- No, no, it's okay. It's cold.

36
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,755
He's a tough guy. Right, Raoul?

37
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:45,462
I'll tip like a Rockefeller.

38
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,737
I'm sorry for not returning your calls.

39
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,877
Yeah, I was starting to
feel like a needy chick.

40
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:58,839
Did I do something to piss you off?

41
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:03,430
No, it's.. I've just been
busy with other things.

42
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,265
Look, I know I freaked out about us

43
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:12,813
- the last time I was here and I wanted to..
- It's fine.

44
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:16,207
- You were amazing to me and I just..
- You were fine.

45
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:18,751
Would you let me finish?

46
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:22,380
And since then, I've been
thinking a lot about us..

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,038
Look, you don't have to do this okay?
There's really no point.

48
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:32,210
It's all fine.

49
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,388
Raoul's freezing
and I have to go meet the girls.

50
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:39,724
Got it. How about dinner tomorrow?

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,740
Drinks?

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,122
I'm starting to feel like that chick again.

53
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:57,006
I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm leaving for Paris tonight.

54
00:03:57,356 --> 00:04:01,119
Paris, wow.

55
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,489
You're finally taking that vacation, huh?

56
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,323
It's not a vacation.

57
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:09,468
I'm going there with a man
that I'm in a relationship with.

58
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:14,127
He's wonderful, and I'm happy.

59
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:17,766
So, please don't feel bad about anything.

60
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,800
Goodbye.

61
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:23,298
Wait, wait, wait.

62
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:25,860
- What do you mean goodbye?
- I have to go.

63
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,691
Carrie.

64
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:33,649
Carrie, stop.

65
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:39,871
What are you doing? Saying goodbye
and jumping out of the car like that?

66
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:46,212
Are you moving to Paris?

67
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:51,348
When were you gonna tell me?

68
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,999
What, you're not even gonna
tell me who he is?

69
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,335
His name is Aleksandr Petrovsky.

70
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,841
You're moving to France with a Rusky?

71
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,362
Oh, come on, it's a joke, Carrie.

72
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:08,029
You do this every time.

73
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,193
Every time.
What do you have, some kind of radar?

74
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:14,808
Carrie might be happy, it's time
to sweep in and shit all over it?

75
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,422
What?

76
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:19,448
No, no. Look, I came here
to tell you something.

77
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:24,406
- I made a mistake. You and I..
- You and I, nothing!

78
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:29,333
You cannot do this to me again.
You cannot jerk me around.

79
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,244
- Carrie, listen. It is different this time.
- Oh, it's never different.

80
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:35,970
It's six years of never being different.

81
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,669
But this is it, I am done.
Don't call me, ever again.

82
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,676
Forget you know my number.
In fact, forget you know my name.

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,600
And you can drive down
this street all you want,

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,789
because I don't live here anymore.

85
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:11,211
Sure, now that I'm with someone else,
now that I'm leaving, it's different.

86
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:13,746
- You know who he is?
- Who?

87
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:15,564
The boy who cried love.
That's who.

88
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:18,977
And just like in the fable,
it's too little too late.

89
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:21,597
Love, he said he loved you?

90
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,559
No, it's a.. No, it's an allegory..

91
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:28,970
Look, my point is,
he's been doing this for years. Years.

92
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,782
- And I'm done with it.
- Then just put it all behind you.

93
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:32,954
Oh, it is behind me.

94
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:36,410
I'm mostly upset about him
ruining my last night in New York.

95
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,403
Well, fuck him.

96
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:41,746
And you know I never say that.

97
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:47,544
- Would you like another cocktail?
- No, no, no, I can't be drunk on the plane.

98
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:50,840
I wanna arrive stunning
and impossibly fresh-looking.

99
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,540
Ok.

100
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:57,069
Ladies.

101
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,999
Stop, really.
You're gonna make me cry.

102
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,923
She didn't even say anything yet.

103
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,636
But I know it's coming.

104
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:11,064
I want to thank you all
for wishing me well tonight.

105
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:15,701
In spite of some of your personal
opinions about my leaving.

106
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,856
Me? I've never had an opinion in my life.

107
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,409
You guys, stop, please.

108
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:27,877
Easy there, waterworks.

109
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,997
Today, I had a thought.

110
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,298
What if I...

111
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:41,755
what if I had never met you?

112
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,985
Let's put up, shall we?

113
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:07,780
- I'd like to show my face here again.
- Yes, tears have to go.

114
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,265
Right, someone say something
not sentimental.

115
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:13,677
Chemo might have kicked me
into early menopause.

116
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,325
Task accomplished.

117
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:17,400
You cannot believe the hot flashes.

118
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,371
I can barely keep my clothes on.

119
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:21,585
Really? What was your excuse
before the chemo?

120
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,176
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, you cunt.

121
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:30,866
- Oh...
- wow, even cunt didn't stop.

122
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,897
Hey, it's me, leave a message.

123
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:44,115
? car for Bradshaw.
Car number 221, downstairs in two minutes.

124
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:23,620
Ladies, I know it's getting late
and we all need to get up for our pilates.

125
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,034
More hot decaf?

126
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:27,074
Are you insane?

127
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:32,485
But hang in and I know we can make
this breast cancer benefit our best ever.

128
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,498
Mona, the goody bags.
Tell us.

129
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:38,321
- Thanks, Sheila.
- Ok,

130
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:41,493
first, we have the pink ribbon
breast cancer cookie.

131
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:44,636
- Oh jesus.
- Well, what's wrong with the cookie?

132
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:48,803
For the past five years, every fucking
breast cancer benefit I've been to

133
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,427
has had that fucking breast cancer cookie.

134
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:53,966
Now, I don't care about
a breast cancer cookie,

135
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:57,934
- and I had breast cancer.
- Point taken.

136
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,928
And?

137
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:05,640
Well, some of the women coming
to this event are battling cancer.

138
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,724
They need something more inspirational
or outrageous than a fucking cookie.

139
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:14,773
- Is it hot in here?
- Well, the cookies are donated,

140
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:16,342
so we're having them.

141
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:21,368
But you're right, we do this need
something inspirational

142
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:23,755
and outrageous to give to these women.

143
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,460
So I'm giving them you.

144
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:28,664
Excuse me?

145
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:31,674
I'd like you to make a little speech
before you bring me up.

146
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,923
- But what would I say?
- Something inspirational.

147
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:38,643
Something you think they'd like to hear.

148
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:41,353
But...

149
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:45,520
My husband's parents,
the Liebermans are coming, so please,

150
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,629
try not to say fuck so much.

151
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,335
Could I get some water, please?

152
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,995
Fill it up.

153
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,474
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

154
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:15,595
- Bienvenue au plaza athenee.
- Merci beaucoup.

155
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:22,864
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

156
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,396
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, madame.

157
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:30,045
Bonjour.

158
00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:34,118
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

159
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:36,697
Nous sommes ravi de vous accueillir?

160
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:41,463
- A little slow, s'il vous plait.
- But of course, American.

161
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,326
- New Yorker.
- Oh.

162
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:46,258
Um, Je m'appelle Carrie Bradshaw.

163
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:48,595
I'm staying here with Aleksandr Petrovsky.

164
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:53,028
Very good, Ms. Bradshaw. I believe
Mr. Petrovsky is in the salon right now.

165
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:56,181
- Oui?
- Yes.

166
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:59,985
So, um the luggage?

167
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,108
Merci.

168
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:04,268
Thank you.

169
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,051
Oh, Carrie, you're here.

170
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:25,680
Hi.

171
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,813
- So nice to see you.
- Really?

172
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:37,009
I want you to meet my daughter Chloe.

173
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:39,112
Oh.

174
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:43,437
- Bonjour, comment ca va?
- Tres bien, merci et toi?

175
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:46,103
Je suis juste en train de
vivre le pire jour de ma vie.

176
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:49,066
Et il est encore que dix heures et demie
? parce que?

177
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:55,613
I'm sorry, all I got was it's ten thirty.

178
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,672
- Oh, you don't speak French?
- Well, I'm learning but..

179
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:02,658
Chloe was saying that
she's having a bad day

180
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,265
- and she wants to kill herself.
- Oh.

181
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:07,008
She's a bit dramatic.

182
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,146
Boyfriend troubles.

183
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:13,671
Oh well, that's my department.
So tell me all about the bum.

184
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:20,722
Papa tells me this is your first visit to Paris.

185
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,514
Well, not if you include movies.

186
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,144
But I can't believe I'm finally here.

187
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,728
I almost screamed
when we drove by Eiffel Tower.

188
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,395
Terrible, it was tolerable before,

189
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:37,651
but now with that light show at night,
hideous, just hideous.

190
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,305
Oh.

191
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:46,352
Tu fumes trop.

192
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:51,786
I wanted Chloe to meet us
for drinks tonight

193
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:57,016
but only time she could give her old papa
is from now till this afternoon, so...

194
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,938
Oh, well, you two should
have your day alone.

195
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:04,424
You know, all the interpreting for me
is going to cut your time in half.

196
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:10,771
I can unpack and take a nap
and try to get on Paris time. Okay?

197
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,752
Also, I have to meet some people
from the museum for an early dinner,

198
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:19,521
but I'll eat light
so we could go out then, ok?

199
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:23,286
I'm in Paris.
Don't you worry about me.

200
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:25,503
- Ok.
- Ok.

201
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:30,539
- See you.
- Ok.

202
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,707
Enchantee de vous rencontrer.

203
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,807
- It was nice to meet you too.
- Thank you. bye.

204
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:45,567
- Where am I going?
- 625.

205
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,179
- Six cent vingt-cinq.
- Parfait.

206
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,022
Au revoir.

207
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,451
- Merci beaucoup.
- De rien.

208
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,425
Oh, mon dieu.

209
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,072
Les rideaux de fenetre.

210
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,877
Ten hours later,

211
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,396
all dressed up and no Petrovsky to go.

212
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:44,174
Oh, where is the recommendation
from your friend, the judge.

213
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,658
Here.

214
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:51,216
And Carrie left hers at home so I can pick
it up when I get her mail later in the week.

215
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:54,144
It's amazing with all the unwanted
children we have to do all this.

216
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:56,804
Well, this private adoption
is a very competitive market.

217
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:59,645
More competitive than china?
We got like a year's wait on that list.

218
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:04,650
Honey, god is gonna send us
a baby from somewhere.

219
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,881
And it's just our job to file all the papers

220
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:11,956
and to just be as aggressive as we can
up to the point we're obnoxious.

221
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,185
I'm sorry I'm late.

222
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:38,515
This museum dinner turned
into this big long thing

223
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:45,367
with the exhibit sponsors
and other? blah blah..

224
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,698
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you call?

225
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:52,414
I did. You had the do not
disturb on your phone.

226
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:59,468
- Right, I forgot.
- Did you sleep?

227
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,014
Did you get enough sleep?

228
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,342
It's dinner time in New York.

229
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,092
Bon appetit.

230
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,051
You look like dessert.

231
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:26,740
It's under your mille feuille.

232
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,395
Mille feuille. A Thousand layers.

233
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,243
1

234
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:34,942
2

235
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,153
3, 4

236
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:39,095
5

237
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,886
6

238
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,496
7

239
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,289
8

240
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,188
9, 10

241
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,046
Stop. Oh my god.

242
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:57,351
If you want to see the face of
breast cancer, look around you.

243
00:18:57,351 --> 00:19:00,660
It's the woman next to you
at the dry cleaners,

244
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,117
the nurse in pediatrics,

245
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:07,661
the single mother picking
her child up from school.

246
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:11,368
Are you sure the heat is off?

247
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:15,162
Fucking chemo. Where was I?

248
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,089
She's the woman with a knowing smile.

249
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:23,307
A smile that says I beat cancer,

250
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:26,076
I can take on the world.

251
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:29,054
Tada. It's good, huh?

252
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:35,323
- What is that?
- It's kinda stiff.

253
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,969
- I just thought it would sound more like you.
- It's an inspirational speech.

254
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:44,026
At AA, the most inspirational speakers
are the ones who keep it real.

255
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:45,942
Keep it real?

256
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:49,944
I'm speaking at a black tie benefit,
not chillin' at P Diddy's crib.

257
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,884
I'm saying that truth is powerful.

258
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:55,095
Look, you may know AA, but I know PR.

259
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:59,647
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I simply must take my head in the freezer.

260
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,589
After a week in Paris,

261
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:08,337
I decided my french was now
strong enough to brave the ultimate test.

262
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:11,179
A day of shopping.

263
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:15,311
Dior

264
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:18,345
Bonjour, madame.

265
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,533
Bonjour.

266
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:26,577
- Ca va?
- Fine.

267
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:29,116
Yeah, I'm fine.

268
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:31,923
Oh, my purse.

269
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,458
Someone has been shopping, huh?

270
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:51,211
I fell. I fell in Dior, so I decided
that the more I purchased,

271
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:56,651
the less they think of me
as the American who fell in Dior.

272
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,799
- They don't think like that.
- Well, not anymore, they don't.

273
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,190
This is the shopping equivalent of lobotomy.

274
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,119
Poor baby.

275
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,350
My purse went flying,
I had to scoop everything up.

276
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,812
I came all the way from New York
to squat and scoop in Dior.

277
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:17,586
I didn't even bother to check
and see if I had all my credit cards.

278
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:19,276
Well, apparently you had one.

279
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:23,650
One that I won't be using again
for many many years.

280
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,909
- Allo, I'administration.
- Oui, allo.

281
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,760
- Je peux vous aider, monsieur?
- Paul Anterier, s'il vous plait.

282
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,511
Un moment, s'il vous plait.

283
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:34,214
- No, no, no. Oh my god.
- What?

284
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:39,350
My Carrie necklace was in here.
I put it in here and I don't see it.

285
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,682
It's not in here.

286
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,752
- Allo.
- Ne quittez pas, hein.

287
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:46,985
- Un moment, Paul.
- Oui.

288
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:50,277
No, I can't have lost
my Carrie necklace. No.

289
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:53,068
- Was it insured?
- No, no, it's not like that.

290
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:57,701
It costs like nothing but it's priceless.

291
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,280
I've just had it forever, so..

292
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,340
Mais, qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Il y a quelqu'un? / Allo?

293
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,245
Desole de t'avoir faire attendre.

294
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:52,675
- Hello.
- Is it too early?

295
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,255
Carrie, hi. How's it going?

296
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:59,349
- I'm really upset.
- What's wrong?

297
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,990
It's nothing serious. It's just..

298
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:06,926
I lost my Carrie necklace
and it's gone and...

299
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,893
I'll never be able to replace it

300
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:12,974
and I got it at that street fair
when we were all together

301
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,731
and... it just makes me so sad.

302
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:19,091
Sure, I understand.

303
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:23,838
Well, no one in Paris seems to understand
or at least they don't understand me.

304
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:26,699
- Come home.
- I can't come home.

305
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:29,640
I've just only been here a week.

306
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,925
So, aside from the necklace
how's it going?

307
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,898
Well, it's hard.

308
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,294
It's harder than I thought.
I don't speak the language and...

309
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,691
it's too cold and rainy
to walk around all day.

310
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:45,516
I've been to every museum,
you know, like twice.

311
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:51,154
I don't know, I'm just sort of lost.

312
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:52,436
Where's Aleks?

313
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:55,111
Well, the exhibit is taking much
more time than he thought,

314
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:57,640
so... I'm alone a lot.

315
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,786
- Come home.
- It's ridiculous, I just got here.

316
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:05,048
I'm serious. You sound really upset.

317
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:08,491
No, I'm just being a baby, you know.
I lost my necklace and...

318
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:10,620
I saw these girls having lunch and..

319
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:19,849
I just,

320
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:22,905
I just thought how much I missed you guys.

321
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:25,340
We miss you too.

322
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,238
Oh, this is absurd. I'm in Paris,

323
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:29,892
I've wanted to come here my whole life.

324
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:33,745
I just have, you know, too much time to think.

325
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:35,783
What does that mean?

326
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,697
Can I tell you something
and you won't use it against me

327
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:42,030
- when I feel better and everything's great?
- Yeah.

328
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,867
I keep thinking about Big.

329
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:55,130
About... what it would be like
if I come here with Big.

330
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,372
- Hello?
- I'm still here.

331
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:04,423
But that's just something I do when
things aren't going perfect with any guy,

332
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:07,126
you know, I compare him to Big.

333
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:14,900
Oh god, this French phone is saying
something that I don't understand.

334
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,777
Carrie, listen.

335
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:39,845
If you want to see the face
of breast cancer, look around you.

336
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,633
It's the woman next to you
at the dry cleaners,

337
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:50,528
the nurse in pediatrics,

338
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:56,906
the single mother picking
her child up from school.

339
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:00,313
I said inspirational, not perspirational.

340
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:02,535
She's brave.

341
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:06,157
She's capable. She's you.

342
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,500
Oh fuck it, she's me.

343
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:17,886
And if any of you are having hot flashes
like I am, you deserve a fucking medal.

344
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,598
Bad enough I lose my hair, now I
have my face running down my couture.

345
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:29,946
Oh, the hell with it.

346
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:33,722
That's better.

347
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,535
To: Mommy Charlotte From:
Carrie Baby Recommandation!

348
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:52,437
Hey it's me, leave a message.

349
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,214
It's me. I know you said you never
wanted me to call you again.

350
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:59,598
But I'm still in town,

351
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:03,009
I don't even know if you're calling
this number but I had to call.

352
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:07,815
I figured at this point,
I've got nothing to lose except you.

353
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,241
I can't lose you again, Carrie.

354
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,143
I love you.

355
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,594
Hi, it's Charlotte.

356
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,580
And her computer was just
sitting there on her bed.

357
00:28:31,522 --> 00:28:34,476
Well, I know I haven't been
your favorite over the few years.

358
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:36,719
- I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

359
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:45,893
Well, god knows I've made
a lot of mistakes with Carrie.

360
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:50,102
I fucked it up.

361
00:28:50,102 --> 00:28:53,000
Many times. I know that.

362
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,951
Look, I need your advice.

363
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:02,461
You three know her better than anyone.

364
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,370
You're the loves of her life.

365
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,666
And a guy's just lucky to come in fourth.

366
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,714
But I do love her.

367
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:17,210
And if you think I have the slightest chance,

368
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,860
I'll be on the next plane to Paris,
I'll roam the streets until I find her.

369
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,153
I'll do anything.

370
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:30,250
But if you think that she really is happy,

371
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:35,670
well, I wouldn't want to wreck that for her.

372
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:39,324
And I'll be history.

373
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,505
Go get our girl.

374
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,618
What is that?

375
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,252
Oh my god.

376
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,235
I know this is not the Carrie necklace.

377
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,588
It's necklace for Carrie.

378
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,585
These aren't diamonds?

379
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:34,755
Well, let's just say I wouldn't throw it
around in your old purse.

380
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:39,233
I hope this cheer you up.

381
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:43,234
- Want to try it?
- Yes.

382
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:47,164
Ok.

383
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,066
- It's all right?
- It's lovely.

384
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:56,069
- Really?
- Listen, I know I've been busy.

385
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,945
As soon as the exhibit opens,

386
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:03,326
it will be just you and me, ok?

387
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:13,516
Aleks?

388
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,826
Andre!

389
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,726
- This is Andre, my best friend.
- Oh yeah.

390
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:59,921
