Ep 20. An American Girl in Paris (Part Deux)

11
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,112
After two weeks in Paris,

12
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:17,833
it was time for the ultimate
in sophisticated French fare:

13
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:21,375
meeting your lover and his ex-wife for lunch.

14
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,294
Hello. I'm Juliet.

15
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:34,426
- Oh hello. I'm Carrie.
- It's nice to finally meet you.

16
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:38,189
- Sit. Sit.
- Thank you.

17
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,106
Well if I'm fashionably late,
then Alec is very fashionable.

18
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:44,568
Yes. He's always very fashionable.

19
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:48,484
- What a beautiful bag.
- Oh thank you. It's vintage.

20
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:54,153
The silk lining's about a hundred
million years old but I'm so in love with it.

21
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:55,878
It gets along perfectly.

22
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:57,947
I represent accessories for the collections.

23
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:01,011
Wow. Alec's never mentioned
what work you did.

24
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:09,932
Sorry. Ah. Mr. Fashionable. Hello.

25
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,683
Oui, merci.

26
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:19,835
Yes.

27
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:29,268
Sincere apologies.? at the museum,

28
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:32,993
some gigantic decoration problem
with the description over something.

29
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,916
Nothing else exist when art does. Yes?

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,548
Well this is a fantastic restaurant.

31
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:48,541
Yes. Used to be.
Not so much any more.

32
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:52,283
The chairs, they're hideous. Hideous.

33
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,685
Good morning. Channel.

34
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,452
Channel-o. I'm gonna shoplift
just so he can feel me up.

35
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:08,183
Okay. I need something simple to wear for
when we meet the birth parents.

36
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:10,858
- Where is this couple from again?
- Charlotte. North Carolina.

37
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,943
They're from Charlotte.
I think it's a good sign.

38
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,407
Love it. Very TV-Movie of the week.

39
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,957
Stylish social couple opens up
their park avenue home to the dumb,

40
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:21,616
- toothless yo-ho's.
- They're not dumb or toothless.

41
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:24,793
- In my movie they are.
- And you'd be played by Barbara Parkins,

42
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:28,043
- circa Valley of the Dolls.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:30,201
And I'd be played by Collin Farrell.

44
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:33,921
Do you think you look like Collin Farrell?

45
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,601
It's my movie.

46
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:40,416
So in your movie,
how big is my part? Big or supporting?

47
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,736
- What?
- I'll still be in your life right?

48
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:47,650
Because once people have the babies.

49
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,667
Stop. You'll always be in my life Collin Farrell.

50
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:51,941
Good.

51
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:55,752
Can you believe this is finally happening?

52
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,541
I hope nothing goes wrong.

53
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,495
Well if it does I know some gays that
got a Guatemalan kid for like a hundred bucks.

54
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:08,131
? this blonde is going be perfection.
It's called ash.

55
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:12,855
Well. Save it little for him
because he is one hot piece of ash.

56
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:14,503
Oh right.

57
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:18,840
Well?

58
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,645
Sexy. Very sexy. Come here you.

59
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:29,947
Please sir, my hair.

60
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:38,362
Are we ever gonna talk about the fact
that we haven't had sex in a long time?

61
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,160
You're bringing this up here?

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,083
My therapist said not to mention it but¡¦

63
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:48,083
Therapist? Since when have you
been seeing a therapist?

64
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,147
I just thought I should get some
help to deal with all this cancer stuff.

65
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,130
I'm not complaining.
I just think we should talk about it.

66
00:04:57,105 --> 00:05:01,297
Well. I have absolutely no sex drive.
You're leaving town to do a movie.

67
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,424
What's the point of talking
about it right now?

68
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:06,404
Samantha. I see two pairs of feet in there.

69
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:10,528
You had better not be doing it. - Oh we're not.

70
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,024
Yeah right. That'll be a first.

71
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:28,155
I must admit I've been dying to meet you.

72
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:30,688
I begged Alex to organize a dinner with us.

73
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:37,418
But he said as soon as the exhibit opens,
we'd all sit down. As soon as, as soon as.

74
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:39,639
If I heard this phrase one more time.

75
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,479
So. How's my beloved.

76
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,353
- He's wonderful. A bit stressed.
- Why yes. He's very sensitive.

77
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:57,438
Can I just say, I think it's lovelythat you both think so highly of one another.

78
00:05:57,438 --> 00:06:00,412
Why not?
We had a wonderful marriage.

79
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:02,707
While it lasted.

80
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:05,109
But I believe a relationship is like a couture?

81
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:08,659
it doesn't fit perfectly, it's a disaster.

82
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:13,076
And I couldn't quite get used to
what was coming second.

83
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:16,100
It was not for me.

84
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,608
Would you like a cigarette?

85
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,320
Yes. I would. Thank you.

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,226
I thought you might be one of
those Americans who didn't smoke.

87
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:31,029
And I would be.. how do you say.
Guilty of killing you over lunch?

88
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:38,695
So. Chloe tells me
you were a write in New York.

89
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:43,077
I am a writer. Until recently I had
a weekly column in New York.

90
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:47,206
It became a book. It's even been published here.

91
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:51,533
Brilliant. And Alex is comfortable with that?

92
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:54,580
Oh god yes. He's very supportive.

93
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:57,825
Maybe people can change.

94
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:10,194
- It's good.
- Can you hold this?

95
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:15,182
Aren't you gonna say anything
about the fact that I'm smoking?

96
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:16,999
Everybody smokes in Paris.

97
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:19,655
Someone got a great review.

98
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:24,415
- Your review's out already?
- No. please don't remind me.

99
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,669
I'm referring to you.

100
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,829
Juliet was impressed that
you're beautiful, smart and chic.

101
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,900
- I'm sorry. Museum. I have to go.
- Again? It's been like this all week.

102
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,953
I thought we'd at least
have the morning together.

103
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,987
I have to go. I have to go.

104
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,409
Is this going to be everyday?

105
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:09,153
Carrie. I'm under so much pressure.
Don't make me feel worse than I do.

106
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,788
I'm not trying to make you feel worse.

107
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:13,661
I said nothing when you left
me alone with your wife.

108
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,431
I know it's inconvenient for you right now.

109
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,087
But I promise.

110
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:22,814
There will be more time for us
as soon as this exhibit opens.

111
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:26,645
Okay? Carrie. Carrie.

112
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:35,642
That's better. Look we're in Paris.
It's so beautiful. Come walk around.

113
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:39,148
- Take the driver. Go everywhere.
- No. you take the driver.

114
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:42,831
I'll walk around. Do French things.
It'll be very Parisian.

115
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:47,084
Okay.

116
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:51,035
- I like the smoking. It's very sexy.
- It's killing me.

117
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,205
Oh God.

118
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:21,181
Merci beaucoup.

119
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,048
Carrie.

120
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,803
Isn't it amazing Ma?

121
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,483
The whole house is coming together.

122
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,663
Ma!

123
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,986
What's little Stevie doing over there?

124
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,251
What? That's Brady.
I'm right over here.

125
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,159
What are you talking about?

126
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:31,305
- Does my mother seem odd to you?
- You might wanna rephrase that.

127
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:34,269
I'm serious. She looks all loopy
and she's disoriented.

128
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,179
Steve. It's called the one
too many beers syndrome.

129
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:42,323
No. Her eye's not focused
or something. I'm worried.

130
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,895
Really?

131
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:50,277
Hey Ma. You want some ice cream?

132
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:55,817
Don't let little Stevie have any strawberry.

133
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,963
Mary. That's Brady.

134
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:02,414
What are you talking about?
I know that's Brady.

135
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:08,036
But who the hell are you?

136
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,123
I'm gonna run down to the emergency
room and check it out.

137
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:16,977
It can't hurt right?

138
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:20,308
Wanna go for a walk?

139
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,151
If it's a movie about Attila the Hun
why are they filming in Canada?

140
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,784
- Cheaper.
- Oh.

141
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:37,413
And it's pretty scenes from space.

142
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:40,865
Which means nowhere to go
and nothing to do for the next 8 weeks.

143
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:45,739
Listen to me.

144
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:47,962
The operative word being listen.

145
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:52,381
I want you to feel free to have sex
while you're on location.

146
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,220
Are we here again? After everything.

147
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,212
No. We are not here again.
I'm not trying to push you away.

148
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,143
I'm trying to keep you.

149
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:03,552
If anyone knows how important sex
is to a person, it's me.

150
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:07,550
- Correction. Was me.
- It's the chemo.

151
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,018
Your body just needs time to heal itself.

152
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:13,280
It'll be back.

153
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,204
It's like winter. Just because the trees
are bare, doesn't mean they're dead.

154
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,273
Awhile comes spring and bam!

155
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:24,156
I want you to have sex. I'm serious.

156
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:28,423
- I know what we have.
- Sex is just sex. I understand that.

157
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:32,084
I don't' wanna just have sex.

158
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,884
You say that now.

159
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,953
But when you're riding a horse all day.

160
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:43,224
Wearing animal fur, and you see some
sexy Canadian extra in a slave girl outfit,

161
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:45,934
feel free to pillage her.

162
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,584
- Samantha.
- Don't be so prevential.

163
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:53,572
You're playing a barbarian for fuck's sake.

164
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:58,237
Step up there, Ma. There you go.

165
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:02,118
- All right. You wanna watch some TV?
- Yeah.

166
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,723
- I'll be in there in a minute.
- It's cold outside.

167
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,366
So it was nothing right?

168
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:13,259
The doctor says she had a small stroke.

169
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,959
She's got significant memory loss.

170
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,750
Oh god. When did it happen?

171
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,330
Best you can tell, maybe a week ago?

172
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,607
But nobody knows cause
she's been home alone.

173
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:29,930
- I want her to stay here with us tonight.
- Yeah.

174
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,236
So I'm gonna run and grab
her nightgown and stuff.

175
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:34,478
She wants her own stuff.

176
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:37,764
I'll go with you.

177
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:40,233
Magda can stay here with them.

178
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,710
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

179
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,785
Magda.

180
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:07,461
Jesus Christ.
What's been going on here?

181
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,061
Didn't you notice?

182
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:14,187
No. She's always waiting for me
to pick her up downstairs.

183
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:22,734
Cockroach. Okay.

184
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,916
Well this stops right now.
My ma can't live like this.

185
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:31,076
We'll get a maid or nurse or
someone to live with her full time.

186
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:35,711
Nurses do that, right?
You can hire them to do that right?

187
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:39,209
My ma can't live like this.

188
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:42,853
Steve.

189
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,976
Your mother can come live with us.

190
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:51,056
She can?

191
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:56,438
Sure. Why else do we have that big house?

192
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,190
Oh no. Merci beaucoup.

193
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:42,774
Carrie Bradshaw?
You're Sex on the City writer?

194
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:45,688
- Yeah.
- I love Sex on the City.

195
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:53,162
I am a, how do you say,
the single girl. And Paul.

196
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:06,807
Carrie Bradshaw? Sex and the City?
Bonjour. I have the sex.

197
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,844
She has the sex. We all have the sex.

198
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:16,603
We want to make a party for you.
Saturday night.

199
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:24,155
Apparently, I fell right into
my French fan-base.

200
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:27,577
Both of them. They were so fun and silly.

201
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:30,494
And they insisted on throwing
a party in my honor.

202
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:34,007
They want me to meet their friends
who supposedly love the book as well.

203
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,283
Anyway, it's nothing terribly fancy.

204
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:41,879
It's just a cozy dinner and a quite hotel
in Paris with my ten new French friends.

205
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,759
This is what I love about Paris.

206
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,751
You never know what they day will lead you.

207
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:53,528
I know. Anyway, the party is
Saturday night at the La Petite? on the Rue?

208
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,825
- Very good.
- Are you up for it?

209
00:18:56,234 --> 00:19:02,025
I can't darling. That's the night I unveil
my show to the museum curators and stuff.

210
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:06,906
But you go and have a wonderful time.
With the throngs of screaming fans.

211
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:10,707
- I don't mind if I do.
- Do you think they'll really be screaming?

212
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:13,157
- I hope so.
- So do I.

213
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:17,440
And we turned the office back
there into a baby's room.

214
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,499
Anyone like more lox?

215
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:23,829
Is that the fish?

216
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,726
We're within blocks of the best
grammar schools in Manhattan.

217
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:35,053
Not that we would ever
let him or her go alone.

218
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:38,967
Her. It' a her. We just found out.

219
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:42,628
It's a girl? Honey, it's a girl.

220
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:45,149
I always wanted a girl.

221
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,347
We weren't gonna ask cause I didn't
wanna know nothing about it.

222
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:52,445
But then I was there and they asked
if I wanted to know and I said yes.

223
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,492
Ever since then I've been thinkingabout little girl names.

224
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:00,530
I like Tiffany, Britney.

225
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:04,108
Wayne says I like any name
with a 'ney' in the end.

226
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,225
We're not getting the baby, are we?

227
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:16,017
We changed our minds.

228
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:19,317
We're awful sorry.

229
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:27,274
If you knew this before, why did you
come here and put us through all this?

230
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:30,564
We've never seen New York.

231
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:38,121
What are you doing in here all this time?

232
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:40,782
I'm writing an angry e-mail
to our baby lawyer.

233
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,125
She warned about this kind of thing.

234
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,790
How much more can we take, huh?

235
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:57,886
It's okay. That's not our baby.

236
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:00,764
Our baby is still coming.

237
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:04,145
Beginning to think God lost our address.

238
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:09,379
Oh. Come on honey. We're Jews.

239
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:13,109
We've been through worse than this. Eh?

240
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,735
Someone got some flowers delivered.

241
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,250
Oh?

242
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:33,671
Looking forward to spring...
-Smith-

243
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:45,774
- What's up babe?
- I just got your flowers.

244
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,222
- They're so beautiful.
- Did you get the card?

245
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:54,711
Yes. And you know how I said
you could have sex with someone else?

246
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:59,259
Well, if it would be okay with you,
try not to.

247
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,070
Unless you already have
and then that's fine.

248
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,255
I didn't. I won't.

249
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:11,805
I don't mean to be a wet blanket
but how about 'don't'?

250
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,190
Cool.

251
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,136
Cool.

252
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:25,141
Okay you gorgeous Russian.

253
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:27,792
I'm off.

254
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:30,058
Good luck at the museum.

255
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:33,411
What's wrong?

256
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:38,393
It's the cufflinks.. and something
with my hands it's just¡¦.

257
00:22:38,393 --> 00:22:41,647
I think I'm having an anxiety attack¡¦.

258
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,662
I don't know.

259
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:48,016
Breathe. Here. Put your head
between your legs and breathe.

260
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:57,884
I can't¡¦

261
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,809
Why? What brought this on?

262
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,680
What if they think I'm the old man
with a silly light machines.

263
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:11,226
Here, let me do this for you.

264
00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:15,153
The curator's 27 year old.
Can you believe it?

265
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:17,364
- Stop.
- What?

266
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,907
Look at me.

267
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:24,798
You'll be fine.

268
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:28,831
Will you go with me?

269
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:34,044
But I have my party.

270
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:37,387
Please. I need you there.
I need you there.

271
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:43,260
I don't have anybody's telephone
number to call and cancel.

272
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:48,486
Oh no. You go. You're right.
I'll be okay. I'll be fine.

273
00:23:48,486 --> 00:23:51,820
I'll be fine. Yeah.

274
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,651
No. I'll go.

275
00:23:57,275 --> 00:24:00,042
- You will?
- It's important to you.

276
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,480
Oh. Thank you my darling.

277
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,408
And promise not to let go all night. Huh?

278
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:50,408
Genius! Genius!

279
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:13,840
Yes that's a train. Yes.

280
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:19,317
I wanna take little Stevie to the zoo.

281
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:24,038
This is not Steve. This is Brady.
Steve's all grown up.

282
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:32,300
Some days she's perfectly clear and then
she'll have a bad couple of days like now.

283
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,214
How are you handling all this?

284
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:37,180
Not very well. Steve is amazing.

285
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,000
He gets home from the bar late
and then he's with her all day.

286
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:44,602
- Let's get ready to go to the zoo.
- This is the zoo.

287
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,022
- I think you're amazing.
- I think you're amazing.

288
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:54,657
- Mama!
- And I think you're amazing. Yes I do.

289
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:01,729
Why was her coat on?

290
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:08,452
Shit! Mary! Shit!

291
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,711
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know. The Bronx Zoo?

292
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,134
Shit! Shit! Stay with the baby. Shit!

293
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,759
The one place in Paris you can't smoke.

294
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:58,266
Perfect. A whole in my Dior.

295
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,642
What?

296
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:36,541
Tell him I had to go.

297
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,917
Taxi! Taxi!

298
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:41,112
Mary! Mary!

299
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:45,312
Mary! Mary!

300
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,012
Excuse moi.

301
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:20,697
Mademoiselle?

302
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:37,796
Mary!

303
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:48,600
This pizza tastes like garbage.

304
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:55,545
Yeah it's bad. It's cold.

305
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,807
- We're gonna go. Let's go home.
- I'm still hungry you know.

306
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,437
That feels good.

307
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:29,419
Hey. Where'd you go?

308
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,827
I went to my party.

309
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:38,176
- I thought you might. How was it?
- Over. It was over.

310
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:40,735
I'm sorry.

311
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:45,703
How could you just abandon me like that
when I gave up my party to be with you.

312
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:47,692
I didn't abandon you.

313
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:51,482
I sat on a bench alone in a museum.

314
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:56,998
Let's not do this now. I'm tired. I had a stressful day.

315
00:30:56,998 --> 00:30:59,522
I'm in this relationship too.

316
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:03,091
I am a person in this relationship.

317
00:31:03,756 --> 00:31:07,364
Have you any idea
what it's been like for me here?

318
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:14,546
Eating alone and waiting for my boyfriend who
would rather spend time with a light instillation?

319
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:19,005
That's what I do. That's who I am.

320
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:23,811
- You always knew this.
- I had a life in New York.

321
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:30,056
I had a job and friends and
I didn't give all of that up to come here

322
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:33,018
and wonder the streets of Paris alone.

323
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:39,117
Okay. I'm taking a shower
and I'm going to bed.

324
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:42,927
- We will talk more as soon as¡¦
- No. Not as soon as.

325
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:47,035
Please. Carrie.

326
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:54,335
- It was an accident. I didn't mean to.
- Oh my necklace.

327
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,877
I'm so sorry.

328
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:09,359
I thought I was clear
all along about who I am.

329
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:14,981
Well...

330
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:19,710
Maybe it's time to be clear
about who I am.

331
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,926
I am someone who is looking for love.

332
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:31,913
Real love. Ridiculous, inconvenient,

333
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:39,884
consuming can't live
without each other love.

334
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:45,503
And I don't think...

335
00:32:45,503 --> 00:32:50,637
that love is here in...

336
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:58,374
in this expensive suite
and this lovely hotel in Paris.

337
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:04,245
It's not your fault. It's my fault.

338
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,714
I shouldn't have come here.

339
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:25,015
- Carrie.
- Please, don't.

340
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:27,872
I'm fine.

341
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:46,208
Thank you.

342
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:10,053
Well I'm sorry Mademoiselle.
But we have only double rooms available.

343
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:14,610
Well, I'm a single and it would be fine.

344
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,618
- Let me see just a minute.
- Merci.

345
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:38,086
Hi.

346
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:43,998
Hey.

347
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,806
Why the tears?

348
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:52,195
Paris is a mess.
I never should have come here.

349
00:34:53,298 --> 00:34:55,417
Everything fell apart.

350
00:34:56,524 --> 00:35:01,072
We had a big fight and then I got slapped.

351
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:03,825
- You got what?
- No. He didn't' mean it.

352
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:06,781
- It was an accident. It was¡¦
- He slapped you?

353
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:10,792
- What? No. It's not like that.
- I'll kick his ass.

354
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,903
- What? No.
- What room were you in?

355
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,489
- I'm not telling you that.
- I see you were in room 625.

356
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:20,287
Room 625? Thank you.

357
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,893
Wait. Stop. What you..

358
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:27,668
Oh¡¦ hey. Stop.
What do you think you're doing?

359
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:32,171
- I think I'm kicking some Russian ass.
- What? No. It's not like that.

360
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,360
- You've got it completely wrong.
- We'll see about that.

361
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:41,444
I don't need you to do this. Stop.
This is totally unnecessary.

362
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:45,150
What do you think you're doing?

363
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,454
Stop. Slow down.
You're gonna have a heart attack.

364
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:53,325
I mean it. It took care of this myself.
I don't need you to rescue me.

365
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:57,689
Listen. I'm clocking this foreigner
and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

366
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:27,249
I gotta hand it to you kid.

367
00:36:27,731 --> 00:36:30,114
Most people come to Paris
to fall in love.

368
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,616
You came and got slapped.

369
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,333
Why is that funny?

370
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,466
- Are you cold?
- No. I'm still in shock.

371
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:53,189
This is so surreal. What..

372
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:56,865
how did you even get here?

373
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,646
It took me a really long time to get here.

374
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,158
But I'm here.

375
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:15,531
Carrie you're the one.

376
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:24,053
Kiss me you big crybaby.

377
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,736
I miss New York. Take me home.

378
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,715
Hi honey. I'm a bad wife.
I ordered Chinese.

379
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,510
I got something from China too.

380
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:22,525
- They're giving us a baby.
- What? How?

381
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:26,554
I guess God remembered our address.

382
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,647
We get her in six months.

383
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,756
Here she is.

384
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,037
That's our baby.

385
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,655
I know it.

386
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,794
That's really our baby.

387
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,817
What you did.

388
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:10,758
That is love.

389
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,382
You love.

390
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:28,629
Let's not make a big deal of it to Steve.
It'll just upset him.

391
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,590
Hey babe.

392
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:12,626
- What¡¦
- I flew back.

393
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,069
You flew all night? Why?

394
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,417
I forgot to tell you something on the phone.

395
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,482
I love you.

396
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:27,727
You flew back to tell me that?

397
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:30,272
Can you think of a better reason?

398
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,864
No I can't.

399
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:41,451
You have been more to me
than any man I've ever known.

400
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,529
Thank you.

401
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:24,621
You know.

402
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:26,986
I don't live here anymore.

403
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,902
And the Four Season's won't
check you in until one.

404
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:33,723
Oh. Did you wanna come up?

405
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:37,132
Abso-fucking-lutely.

406
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:06,162
- Oh my god.
- You look great.

407
00:42:08,878 --> 00:42:12,502
Later that day, I got to thinking
about relationships.

408
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:16,888
There are those that open you up
to something new and exotic.

409
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:28,268
Those that are old and familiar.

410
00:42:31,988 --> 00:42:34,653
Those that bring up lots of questions.

411
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,877
Those that bring you somewhere unexpected.

412
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:47,850
Those that bring you far from
where you started.

413
00:42:54,296 --> 00:42:56,308
And those that bring you back.

414
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:06,363
But the most exciting, challenging
and significant relationship of all

415
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,817
is the one you have with yourself.

416
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:14,139
And if you find someone
to love the you, you love,

417
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:15,679
- Hi.
- What's shaking baby?

418
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,002
- How's Napa?
- The house is on the market.

419
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:20,558
Look out New York. I'm coming.

420
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:23,455
Well, that's just fabulous.

421
00:43:26,698 --> 00:43:30,245
