Season 6
Epi 17. The Cold War

11
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:49,208
When it gets cold outside,

12
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,970
New Yorkers head inside.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,601
And look for ways to generate heat.

14
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:57,146
Hey. Watch those hands, mister.

15
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:00,691
They are cold, and you are warm, so..

16
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,310
People are looking.

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,798
No one is looking.

18
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:05,735
Petrovsky.

19
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,123
Hey, hi.

20
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,043
You're seated at the star table, I see.

21
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:11,793
Where else would I be?

22
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:13,796
- Come and join us.
- No, we wouldn't wanna..

23
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:16,787
- Yes, come.
- You saved our lives.

24
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:20,300
There's ten thousand restaurants
in New York and everyone's at Pastis.

25
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:22,180
Introductions.

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,164
This is John Paul Sandal,

27
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,969
the most fantastic painter in New York.

28
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,769
I'm not paying for lunch.

29
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,471
You know my assisstant Lee.

30
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,306
Yes, hi.

31
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:35,586
Audra Clark, she's the editor of
Artlife magazine.

32
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:37,843
- Carrie Bradshaw.
- Hi.

33
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:41,151
Handsome Lee has just informed us
of your upcoming show in Paris.

34
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,165
Congratulations.

35
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:46,693
Yeah, right, a solo exhibit at the
Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume.

36
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,811
Just another day.

37
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,883
You are so full of shit.

38
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:52,576
I never said I wasn't.

39
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:55,415
It's your first new exhibit in what,
four years?

40
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:56,675
Six.

41
00:01:56,675 --> 00:02:00,163
Well, the world is waiting with breath
that is baited.

42
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,545
We need menus and a wine list.

43
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:04,248
So how are they?

44
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,762
The oysters are very good.

45
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:07,470
No, his pieces.

46
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:10,521
Oh, um, I don't know.

47
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,892
I haven't seen them yet.

48
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:14,509
- Are you an artist as well?
- No, I'm a writer.

49
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,886
Novels?

50
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,059
No, I write a column for a newspaper.

51
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,682
- The Times?
- The New York Star.

52
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:26,236
It's very good column
about women, men and sex.

53
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,752
Very smart, and very funny.

54
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:30,704
I'm sure.

55
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:32,707
You're not sure, you're snide.

56
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:37,035
- May I borrow your newspaper?
- No, no, what are you... oh..

57
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:38,628
Let's see.

58
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:47,123
It's my belief that the last time anyone
actually enjoyed the 69 position was in 1969.

59
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,093
I think it's funny.

60
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,147
That wasn't one of my smartest ones.

61
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,194
And further Uptown,
Charlotte didn't mind the cold.

62
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:05,834
She had a new puppy love
to keep her warm.

63
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:08,310
Oh, that is the most precious little thing.

64
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,120
- Thank you.
- What's her name?

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,072
- Elizabeth Taylor.
- Oh.

66
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:16,614
That is the fourth person to stop and gush.

67
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:20,333
I swear that dog's getting cruised more than
me, and we're on the corner of gay and gay.

68
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,662
She loves the attention, doesn't she?

69
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:24,251
Look how she prances along.

70
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,172
- Do you see her prancing?
- Yes, she's very prancy.

71
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:29,848
She was a show dog, you know.
She even competed at Westminster.

72
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,059
Did she ever win anything?

73
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:35,145
Well, no, but I think that was only because
her last owner wasn't very supportive.

74
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,634
I think she misses the competition.

75
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,262
- See how she's showing off.
- She's freaking attention whore.

76
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,976
- Cute dog.
- Thank you.

77
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,561
I'm thinking of re-entering her.

78
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,751
I think with my love and a little encouragement,

79
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,608
she could actually win.
What do you think?

80
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,190
What the hell, do it.

81
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,151
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

82
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,283
Dirty Dancing, hello?

83
00:03:56,151 --> 00:04:00,760
And over in Brooklyn,
someone was not feeling so prancy.

84
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,253
Hey.

85
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:06,969
Man, your face is freezing.

86
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,164
I had to walk all the way
from the subway in these heels.

87
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:10,717
My feet are killing me.

88
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,166
Why didn't you just carry and wear
sneakers like everyone else?

89
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,373
Stop.

90
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:17,280
You can take me out of Manhattan,
but you can't take me out of my shoes.

91
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,561
Then stop complaining about them.

92
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,300
You're right. I have much bigger things
to complain about.

93
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,841
Did you get a chance to install
my DSL line today?

94
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,761
I was putting up sheet racks in Brady's room.

95
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:29,522
Steve, you know I can't live
without internet access.

96
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,751
You want your kid to live without walls?

97
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,741
Here.

98
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,776
This oughtta cheer you up.

99
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,839
The Point Express finally got
our address right.

100
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,160
We have mail?

101
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,973
My Tattle Tale came.

102
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:42,653
Finally, a connection to the real world.

103
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,785
I can't believe that you read that crap.

104
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,723
I love it, it's my thing. Let it go.

105
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,213
- Oh, Magda and Brady..
- I'm reading this, you no longer exist.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,978
That night, at the only restaurant
that seemed to exist.

107
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:00,038
Oh, there's Samantha's boyfriend, Smith.

108
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:03,026
- Oh, where?
- Star table, let's say hello.

109
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:03,894
I'm nervous.

110
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,936
He's so unbelievably hot in
that Gus Van Sant's movie.

111
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,252
But can he pull off
a fuschia Oswald Boateng shirt?

112
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,199
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

113
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,276
We've met before.
We're friends of Samantha's.

114
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,694
I hear she's a wonderful woman.

115
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,585
Oh my god, that's a good look for you.

116
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,155
It's very Jefferson Starship.

117
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:29,384
Well, I decided to turn a little hair loss
into a lot of hair game.

118
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,292
You're getting wiggy with it.

119
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,209
Come on.
Jam in here right next to me.

120
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,999
Oh, we don't wanna disturb.

121
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,292
Are you kidding?
Any friend of Samantha's.

122
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,632
Okay.

123
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,052
- This is my boyfriend Marcus.
- Marcus, Smith Jerrod.

124
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,449
- Oh, what are you drinking, it looks yummy.
- Smith Jerrod.

125
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,316
How you doing, boss(?)?

126
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,456
Dude, my girl loves you.

127
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:54,609
- You gotta let me get a picture.
- Only if you get my friends here.

128
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,339
All right.

129
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:03,122
I heard that Aleksandr Petrovsky
is having a solo show in Paris.

130
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,777
Don't believe everything you hear.

131
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:07,808
It's exciting, tell me about your show.

132
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:11,915
Why would I want to talk about my work

133
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:14,502
when I have you in bed with me.

134
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,128
Because I want to know about it,
cuz it's important to you.

135
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:22,677
This looks important to me.

136
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:28,309
- I'm serious, come on.
- So am I.

137
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,227
Very serious.

138
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:36,019
I just wanna know more about what you do.

139
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:40,236
If for no other reason, then I would like to
avoid having this face at restaurant.

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,972
I prefer keep my work
and my private life separate.

141
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,872
All this art talking, it's so fucking boring.

142
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,501
It wouldn't be to me.

143
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,083
Then you're an exception to the rule.

144
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,557
Well, then...

145
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:02,838
if you're not going to tell me
about National Gallery blah blah,

146
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,503
then I need to get serious
about my busy day.

147
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:07,140
Oh, don't go.

148
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,066
I have many, many...

149
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,855
Oh, schedule. You're so New York.

150
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:15,892
Stay here, do nothing, get in trouble.

151
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,547
Be spontaneous.

152
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,193
But I'm meeting people for things.

153
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:27,128
It's cold out there,
stay here where it's warm.

154
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:33,330
Samantha, I don't know how to tell you this,

155
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,789
but I was reading my Tattle Tale
and there's a picture of Smith.

156
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,041
Miranda, what in the world are you doing
reading something like that?

157
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,096
- I love it, it's my thing. Let it go.
- Oh, Smith is always in that rag.

158
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,840
Yeah, but this time, he's gay.

159
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:51,136
Oh, Boys-s-s Night Out.

160
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:54,058
Smith Jerrod cozies up to Broadway dancer,

161
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:58,099
Marcus Adant, and unidentified
older gay gentleman.

162
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,311
Poor Stanford.

163
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,899
- Smith is not gay.
- Of course not.

164
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,195
So this makes you his beard.

165
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:05,984
I'm a beard and a wig.

166
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,816
You're not upset?

167
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:11,661
Oh, please, after the big C,
you don't sweat the small stuff.

168
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:14,549
And besides, once the gay rumor starts,

169
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,332
it means you're really a star.

170
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:22,673
- Hello.
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

171
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,588
Carrie, where are you?

172
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,478
Oh, bad news,
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

173
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,257
You can't come? Are you okay?

174
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:29,928
No, I'm fine.

175
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:30,838
I'm just, you know,

176
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:35,154
I'm just all the way downtown
with the Russian and it's very cold out.

177
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:37,269
She's still downtown and it's too cold.

178
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,605
Well, you know,
we haven't seen you in forever and

179
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,812
oh, I have news.

180
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:45,635
Elizabeth Taylor is going to be in a dog show.

181
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:51,828
- My Elizabeth Taylor.
- Oh. Congratulations.

182
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,875
And Miranda wants to really talk to you.

183
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,249
And Smith is gay.

184
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,952
What do you mean you're not coming?

185
00:08:58,952 --> 00:08:59,893
Smith is gay?

186
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:02,562
Don't try to change the subject.
I came in all the way from Brooklyn.

187
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:04,094
Oh, who are you kidding.

188
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,415
You'd use any excuse to come in the city.

189
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,135
You owe me a trip to Brooklyn.

190
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,142
Carrie, we're fine. Everything's fine.

191
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:13,905
Smith is not gay.

192
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:15,752
It's too cold to leave the house.

193
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:17,846
You stay downtown with your hot man.

194
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:19,142
Okay.

195
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:27,489
Ah.

196
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:32,161
Which is exactly what I did.
For the next four days.

197
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,422
With my column tragically overdue,

198
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:45,134
I finally left the Russian's warm apartment.

199
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:47,134
Oh, good god.

200
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,610
And came hom eto the tropics.

201
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:59,342
When you've been spending
all your time in your new world,

202
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:02,061
it's easy to forget that there might be
people trying to reach you

203
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,440
from your old world.

204
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,719
Hey, kid, how's it going?

205
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:08,316
We just put our new cabernet to bed.

206
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,693
Made me think of you.

207
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,667
Give me a call.

208
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:14,848
Saturday, 10 p. m.

209
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,801
Playing hard to get, huh?

210
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,885
Called your cell,
but I think I copied the number wrong.

211
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:23,546
Unless you're a ticked off guy named Paco.

212
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:26,168
Hey, I wanna talk to you, call me.

213
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:28,725
Monday, 2 p. m.

214
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,258
Carrie, it's me. Again.

215
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:37,145
Listen, uh, did I do something to tick you off?

216
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:40,979
If I did, call me and I'll apologize. Okay?

217
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,522
Ok.

218
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:45,963
Wednesday, 8 p. m.

219
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:52,705
Deleted, deleted, deleted.

220
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,537
I deleted Big.

221
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:58,670
- You deleted Big?
- Yep.

222
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,380
- Did you call him to tell him you deleted him?
- Nope.

223
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,329
Wow, that's new.

224
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,701
Delete, delete, delete.

225
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,208
Three messages last week.

226
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,547
- What do you think he was calling about?
- Don't know.

227
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,735
And for the first time, don't really care.

228
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:15,741
After his last trip, I finally got it.
What's the point?

229
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:19,788
Things are serious with the Russian.

230
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:20,931
Really?

231
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,467
That's great.

232
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:25,185
It's just so different and so..

233
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,189
What?

234
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:30,373
It's grown up. There's not a lot of fuss,

235
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:35,192
there's no confusion about how he feels
about me, he tells me all the time.

236
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,828
Unlike answering machine up there in Napa.

237
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:39,711
- Sounds perfect.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,634
- There's just one thing.
- Thank god.

239
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,742
I was beginning to feel bad
about Steve and me.

240
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:46,160
What's the thing?

241
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,268
Well,

242
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:52,100
we don't really have anything
in common but each other.

243
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,179
We're not really involved
in each other's lives.

244
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,526
He never shares anything about his work.

245
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:00,136
I don't talk to Steve about my work.

246
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,722
- And he doesn't mind?
- I think he prefers it that way.

247
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,432
But you guys share everything else.

248
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,532
Because we're in Brooklyn.
There's no one else to talk to.

249
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:11,533
Besides, Carrie, every couple's different.

250
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:16,749
Yeah, I guess I just had this idea
about a couple sharing everything.

251
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,875
At least their passions.

252
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,036
You want passions on top of passion?

253
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:27,180
Hey, Carrie, welcome back.

254
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,204
You see the new walls?
Nice progress, huh?

255
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:32,120
I'll say. It's really coming together.

256
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,961
What's all that?

257
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,627
Oh, I stopped off and picked up
some dessert for you ladies.

258
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:39,170
Brooklyn's finest,
we have cheese cake...

259
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,157
and cannoli's.

260
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:42,049
What a delightful burrow.

261
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:43,613
I'll put these stuff out in the kitchen.

262
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,690
I love having your friends over.

263
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,941
I want you to meet him, my Russian.

264
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,705
can't waste.

265
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,474
That log is really heating up the joint, uh?

266
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:04,967
Good morning.

267
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,920
All night again?

268
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:09,286
How's the work going?

269
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:14,462
It was clear from his silence we weren't having
passions on top of passions for breakfast.

270
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,798
Hey, what are you doing on Sunday night?

271
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:18,711
I have no idea, why?

272
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:22,903
Well, I was thinking since I met
some of your friends the other day,

273
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,306
maybe you could meet some of my friends.

274
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,193
Those people were my colleagues
and not my friends.

275
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:30,189
My friends are mostly in Europe.

276
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:33,197
Well, my friends are here.
And they're fantastic.

277
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,324
Then on Sunday,
I'll be happy to meet your fantastic friends.

278
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:37,875
Oh goody.

279
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:41,795
And FYI, you have a friend in New York, me.

280
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:44,093
You're not my friend, you're my lover.

281
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:47,043
And that is a much better thing.

282
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,380
Come to bed.

283
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,295
Oh no, no, no. I have to go home.

284
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,690
I have to write my column.
I can't turn it in late again.

285
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,712
Work here.

286
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,441
I can't, my computer's at home.

287
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,260
I have a computer very good
for writing columns.

288
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,199
You would let me use your fancy computer.

289
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:11,944
In exchange for one hour in bed.

290
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:16,832
Okay.

291
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:23,728
They say that opposites attract,
but they never say for how long.

292
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:27,459
Should the relationship-savvy person
stoke the fires of passion

293
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,615
with the kindling of work and friends

294
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:33,404
or shold we simply be satisfied with
the romance that sizzles?

295
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:35,591
I couldn't help but wonder.

296
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:41,334
Without sharing your worlds, can even
the hottest relationship stop cold?

297
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,684
Meanwhile, Samantha was about to
hear the hottest rumor

298
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,689
from the city's hottest rumor mail.

299
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:57,149
Two young PR girls.

300
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,088
Did you see that picture of Smith Jerrod online?

301
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,657
I can't believe he's gay.

302
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,656
No one that good-looking is ever straight.

303
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,587
I thought he was dating Samantha Jones.

304
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:08,860
All this time, I thouhgt she had the hottest
sex life in New York city.

305
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,990
Turns out she's just a fag hag.

306
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,682
And that stopped Samantha cold.

307
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,072
And here comes the hound group.

308
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,772
Everyone's talking about me.

309
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:31,483
In the blink of a tabloid,
I went from Demi to Liza.

310
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:33,443
These people know who you are.

311
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,774
An unidentified older gay gentleman.

312
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,577
Marcus got three auditions off that picture.

313
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,520
I got outed.

314
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,051
Oh, poor Stanny.

315
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,659
How can they just assume I'm gay?

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,828
Ok, I've got ten bucks on Lord Reginal
the Fourth down there.

317
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:53,382
- Any takers?
- Oh, you are a good friend.

318
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:55,955
All the way from Brooklyn to see
a bunch of dogs run in a circle.

319
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,411
She came to see my baby get baptized,
I came to see her baby get judged.

320
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:02,084
I almost didn't show my face. Fag hag.

321
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:05,315
There go years and years of
fucking everything that walks.

322
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:07,958
I thought you weren't gonna
sweat the small stuff.

323
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,689
Look, I can't have cancer
and be a fag hag.

324
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,970
Oh, Hey, you guys want to have drinks
with the Russian tomorrow night?

325
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,933
- Sure.
- I'm in.

326
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,349
Me, too.

327
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,869
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
It's just the girls this time.

328
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:21,814
Oh, what am I now?
Your unidentified older gay friend?

329
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,576
You'd be in the next round,
I promise.

330
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:25,943
Ok, I gotta go backstage
and check on the little mother.

331
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,953
Well, take your time.

332
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:31,078
We still got sporting
and walking and toy. Oh my.

333
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,211
This was not the type of blow job
I was hoping for today.

334
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:41,566
She looks so pretty. Yes, she does.

335
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:44,225
Did you see how impressed
the host committee was?

336
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,851
I really think she has a chance.

337
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:47,848
You know, you think with
all these faggy little dogs,

338
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:50,642
there'd be at least one horny circuit
muscle gay here.

339
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,406
No, nothing but boxy thick naked ladies
and tweety old queens.

340
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:55,699
Shh.

341
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,060
Char.

342
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,638
Did you cut yourself with the scissors?

343
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:00,437
There are drops of blood here.

344
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:04,365
Wait, it's coming from her.

345
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:06,897
No. Don't tell me.

346
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:08,909
Oh no, she's in heat.

347
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,034
Hey, how's it..?

348
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:14,333
- What's wrong?
- The freaking dog just got her period.

349
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:17,701
- Excuse me?
- Oh yeah, Aunt Flo's in doggy town.

350
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,665
- Show over.
- Don't say that.

351
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:24,041
We can still compete. I once won a
junior gymnastics meet when I had mine.

352
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,832
It's a dog.

353
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:28,699
What are gonna do? Run around looking
for a teeny tiny tampon?

354
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,273
You're right, it's not funny.

355
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,103
I'm a woman. I should know better.

356
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:44,478
Trouble.

357
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:46,196
Elizabeth Taylor just got her period.

358
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:47,489
What?

359
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:49,450
Backstage. That time of the month.

360
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,705
I thought she looked a little bloated.

361
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,839
And she was so bitchy earlier.

362
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:57,008
And here come the toy dogs.

363
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:33,107
The judges narrowed it down
to the toy poodle,

364
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:37,783
champion?, the shitzu,
champion Yurosaki.

365
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:44,092
The pomeranian, champion?,
and the King Charles spaniel, Elizabeth Taylor.

366
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,025
Come on, Elizabeth Taylor.

367
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,513
Charlotte was a dog show natural.

368
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,034
Thanks to her blue blood background.

369
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,037
Let me see the move.

370
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:07,843
And speaking of blood.

371
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,008
The judge's examining the dogs' gaits
one more time

372
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:19,044
before he makes decision.

373
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,369
Okay, Elizabeth.

374
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,175
One.

375
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:23,880
Two.

376
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,461
It's the King Charles spaniel
followed by shitzu,

377
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:30,765
the pomeranian, and the toy poodle.
- That's my friend.

378
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,085
All the dogs were champions,

379
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:36,952
but to the judge,
Charlotte was the best in show.

380
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:39,037
Period.

381
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:43,723
Samantha Jones, I thought that was you.

382
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:46,062
Tom, what are you doing here?

383
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:47,997
I'm head of the press for this tacky thing.

384
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:51,635
Listen, could I get Smith Jerrod's number?

385
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,116
Tom, no. I'm fucking him.

386
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,385
Sure you are.

387
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:04,678
I'm a laughing stock.
I have got to put a stop to this.

388
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,668
And from dog show to doggy show.

389
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:08,957
Are you sure you wanna do this?

390
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,051
It worked for Paris Hilton.
I need to set the record straight, literally.

391
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:15,651
But I don't care if people think I'm gay.

392
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,318
This isn't about you.

393
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,439
Now, when we get going,
make sure to say,

394
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:25,665
Samantha Jones,
you are one hot piece of ass.

395
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:29,203
I could fuck you all night long,
Samantha Jones.

396
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:31,988
How are you going to get this around?

397
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:36,911
I'm a PR pro. I know exactly
whose hands to drop this into.

398
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,617
The very next day, two PR girls
got an anonymous triple X from FedEx.

399
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,403
You have to come next time,
she was so happy.

400
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,628
You know what would make her happy?

401
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,230
Letting her off that show leash.

402
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,221
Oh no, I don't thnk so.
What if she gets hurt?

403
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:01,977
Come on, honey.
Give her a little victory lap on her own.

404
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:07,547
You're right. Okay, Elizabeth. Go play.

405
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:21,453
Oh look, she made a little friend,
isn't that sweet?

406
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:30,684
Oh, oh, no. No, stop, stop that.

407
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,144
She's a blue ribbon winner, stop.

408
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:35,740
Stop it. Honey, go.

409
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,517
Do something, Harry.

410
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:43,347
- Stop it. Harry, hurry.
- She's in heat. No.

411
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,246
- Stay away.
- Get off Elizabeth Taylor.

412
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,906
Watch out for the big one.

413
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,065
Elizabeth Taylor got gangbanged in the park?

414
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,118
Oh god, that is so 80's.

415
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,792
There we were at Asia de Cuba
waiting for my lover de Russia.

416
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,050
Hi, where are you?

417
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:09,078
Seriously, I could not believe
how many dogs she was with.

418
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,631
It was disgusting, my sweet little girl.

419
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,471
Well, I thnk she's a woman now.

420
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,836
Oh really?

421
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,013
No, no, I understand.

422
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:21,794
Ok, I will.

423
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,440
Ok.

424
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,306
- Well, he's not gonna make it.
- Ah, that's too bad.

425
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,073
Is he okay?

426
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:31,785
No, he's just in the middle of
something at his studio,

427
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,612
- he can't stop right now.
- I understand.

428
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:35,743
If he's feeling inspired
then he shouldn't stop.

429
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:39,459
He's getting ready for this big exhibit
at some Paris museum.

430
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,162
He's been staying up nights.

431
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:44,526
Oh, I'm disappointed.
I wanted you guys to meet him.

432
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:46,004
Another time.

433
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:52,093
Compliments of Mr. Petrovksy
with sincere apologies.

434
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,589
Hey, you know what,
why don't we finish these off,

435
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:58,354
crack this open and give him some time
and go over there and say hello.

436
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,050
Oh honey, you sure you want to disturb him?

437
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,511
Yeah, yeah, we'll just go say hi.

438
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,603
He's always telling me
to be more spontaneous.

439
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:09,413
A couple cocktails
and a bottle champagne later.

440
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:13,546
Eighth floor, Lingerie.

441
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,989
Apartment, studio.

442
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:21,226
He has the whole floor.

443
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:25,443
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

444
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:27,456
This has got to get ready.

445
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:33,801
Hello?

446
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,142
Hi, hi.

447
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:46,144
- What are you doing?
- I'm being spontaneous.

448
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,967
I told you I was working.

449
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,596
I know, but I wanted my friends to meet you.

450
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,596
Well, Charlotte, you've met.

451
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:57,960
But, this is Miranda and Samantha,
a. k.a. Foxy Brown.

452
00:23:58,894 --> 00:23:59,987
Hello.

453
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,381
And I wanted them to see the house.

454
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,905
When I say I'm working, I'm workling, ok?

455
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:11,336
I'm sorry guys, I'm very, very busy,
but please do stay.

456
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:15,779
Enjoy the apartment,
we'll meet one day, alright? Sorry.

457
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,833
I'm sorry, I thought..

458
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,673
- It's fine.
- If he's working...

459
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:30,309
Oh, do you guys still want to
see the apartment?

460
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:35,902
Oh, it's late. I should get back to Brooklyn
before Steve thinks I've defected.

461
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,955
Another time.
Foxy's ready to hang over her wig.

462
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,289
Do you wanna come share
a cab with me uptown?

463
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:47,292
No, no, I'm think I'm gonna stay.

464
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:51,133
- Ok, nighty night.
- Sleep tight.

465
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:54,049
Bye.

466
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:09,870
- I am so glad to be home.
- You are?

467
00:25:12,215 --> 00:25:14,351
I love you for loving my friends.

468
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:20,798
And I love you for no walls
and cheese cake, cannoli.

469
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,426
Well, if you love me for that stuff,
what's gonna happen now?

470
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,419
I put in a DSL line.

471
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:35,513
Steve.

472
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:52,184
And although Steve had satisfied Miranda,

473
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,153
she still wanted more.

474
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,080
Samantha Jones,
you're one hot piece of ass.

475
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:12,744
I'd fuck you all night long,
Samantha Jones.

476
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,555
Samantha's hot tape cooled her love
of gossip for good.

477
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,150
Or at least for now.

478
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,916
And try as I might, I could not forget
the Russian's icy treatment of my friends.

479
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:38,218
Hey, I need to talk to you.

480
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:46,083
I know that you're busy,
but those were my..

481
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:49,744
Is something..

482
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:51,580
Are you ok?

483
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,503
Yeah, I'm fine.

484
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,799
No, you are not fine.

485
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,928
Did something happen with the piece?

486
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:15,735
Hey, come on, talk to me.

487
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:22,732
What if it's not enough?

488
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,490
On these pieces, huh?

489
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,996
Six years.

490
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,114
It's going to be enough.

491
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:37,687
It's true I don't know anything
about the piece but...

492
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,813
you are brilliant.

493
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,406
The world is waiting with a breath
that is baited.

494
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:50,139
Ohm, she's just an uptight bitch.

495
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,352
Well, that's better.

496
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:54,900
You're a little scary.

497
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,401
So talk to me, what's the problem?

498
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:03,044
I may not understand, but I'll listen.

499
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:09,574
Well,

500
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,656
yesterday I looked up

501
00:28:13,656 --> 00:28:19,584
and the entire thing looked so utterly stupid

502
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,285
and flat and needless and childish.

503
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,310
It's a cold hard fact.

504
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,684
Sometimes, there's not enough time
in a night for both your worlds.

505
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:38,745
