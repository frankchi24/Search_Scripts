Season 6
Epi 10. boy, interrupted

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,239
I didn't go to my high school reunion.

12
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,328
So, when my high school
sweetheart called me, for a reunion,

13
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:59,869
I was curious to see if he looked like
the boy I used to make out with

14
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,233
in front of my locker.

15
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,404
Excuse me, can you tell me how
to get to chemistry class?

16
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:06,117
Actually, he looked better.

17
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,790
Oh my god.

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,053
Jeremy, wow.

19
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,897
That's my name, don't wear it out.

20
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:15,458
Wow, you look great.

21
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,868
I knew you look great cuz I saw
you on the cover of your book.

22
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:18,902
Oh.

23
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,996
But I have to say even better in person.

24
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:22,865
Oh god, I'm so gald you called.

25
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,418
I'm gonna be spending
a month in Connecticut.

26
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:27,698
- So I had to look you up.
- Wow.

27
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:29,445
Well, how are you?
I heard that you married somebody

28
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:30,863
that you met in business school?

29
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:33,381
Yeah, I got divorced like 2 years ago.

30
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:36,115
Really miscalculated that one.

31
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,935
So I'm on my own again.

32
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:39,013
Oh.

33
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,127
How about you?

34
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:42,560
Are you seeing anybody, or..

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,781
Nope.

36
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:45,733
- Wide open.
- How is that possible?

37
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,795
Well, my high school
boyfriend spoiled me for life.

38
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:49,716
Right.

39
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,247
Me and my AMC Pacer.

40
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,718
Oh, the Pacer.

41
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:55,431
Oh man.

42
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,968
I put our names down for a table.

43
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:58,733
Oh, great.

44
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,829
But earlier you said maybe
you might have dinner plans?

45
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,447
- Oh.
- Was that in case I turned out to be a..

46
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:07,132
Yeah, maybe.

47
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,936
But my fictional plans fell through

48
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:12,608
so I'm available.

49
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:16,289
Miranda had no plans that night.

50
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,179
So she was thrilled when her cute
new neighbor stopped by.

51
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,264
- Hey.
- Oh hey,

52
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:23,870
I didn't you'd be home
on a Saturday night.

53
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,317
Motherhood.

54
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:27,782
So, what's my excuse?

55
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,362
I just got Brady to sleep.

56
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:32,274
Do you sing to him?

57
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:33,858
Only if he's been bad.

58
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:39,441
Listen, I have these 2 courtside
seats for Knicks charity game

59
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,100
at the Garden next Friday night.

60
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:42,638
Would you want to go?

61
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:45,522
- I would love to.
- Great.

62
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,307
Great, I'll look for you there.

63
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:49,643
Oh, ok.

64
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:53,193
Thanks, so much.

65
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:54,115
Good night.

66
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,586
You too.

67
00:02:57,283 --> 00:03:02,119
Miranda wsn't sure if it was acharity game or just charity.

68
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:05,091
Hey, I didn't even ask what you
were doing in Connecticut.

69
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:06,737
Nothing.

70
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,192
Well, for a change.

71
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:12,016
I spent the last decade working
my ass off in Denver.

72
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:15,007
So I decided to take a month off,

73
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,447
spend some time with sea level.

74
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,356
So I've just been relaxing in the country,

75
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,748
sorting through some things, you know.

76
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:24,141
Yeah, sometimes you need to get away.

77
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:28,477
Sometimes you wonder
why you stayed away so long.

78
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:36,276
Well..

79
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:38,194
this is my place.

80
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:40,924
It's a nice place.

81
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:43,359
Yeah, I love it here.

82
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:48,300
I feel like I want to kiss you,

83
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,911
but I don't know what..

84
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,744
I know, it's very unclear.

85
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:56,015
Yeah, I mean this isn't our first date.

86
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:57,276
We've already dated.

87
00:03:57,276 --> 00:03:58,929
- And we've kissed.
- Many times.

88
00:03:58,929 --> 00:03:59,823
Hours.

89
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,184
We're in a lip lock for the most of 1982.

90
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,330
So, um,

91
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,757
what's one more kiss.

92
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:14,263
Uh oh, you mean business.

93
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,120
It's a lot better without gearshifts
sticking up my ass.

94
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:44,359
It was a romantic, hot summer night.

95
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:48,273
Followed by a miserable hot summer day.

96
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:51,401
Which was the 14th hot summer day in a row.

97
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,115
Samantha Jones, how are you?

98
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:56,944
Great, Phoebe. How are you?

99
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:58,907
Refreshed.

100
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,355
We just dropped by the SoHo house for a dip.

101
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,946
I mean what else can you
possibly do in this heat?

102
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:07,253
Just sit by the pool and drink cocktails

103
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,282
where they mist you with evian.

104
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:10,815
Isn't it the best?

105
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:11,990
Oh, it's fabulous.

106
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,959
I'm running to a lunch,
otherwise I'd be up there myself.

107
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,225
There's a pool a block from my apartment,

108
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,431
and I can't get in.

109
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,140
What pool?

110
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,448
At the SoHo house.

111
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,518
You have to be a member and
I'm on some kind of bullshit waitlist.

112
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:26,844
Don't they know who you are?

113
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:29,371
and more importantly who we are.

114
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,608
We need to be at the pool with you.

115
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:32,718
You know in high school,

116
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:36,178
all you had to do is jump a fence
and you'd in sombody's pool.

117
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:37,977
Oh, speaking of high school,

118
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:41,313
I saw my high school sweetheart.

119
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:43,257
And I think I might like him.

120
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:44,590
Again.

121
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:45,751
Is that crazy?

122
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,600
No, I love this.

123
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:49,887
You can end up with your
high school boyfriend.

124
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,665
Ok, let's not jump the gun.

125
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,136
But it was the best date
I've had in a long time.

126
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:57,365
And I wasn't even thinking
that it was a date.

127
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:58,985
Oh, when he kissed me good night.

128
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,812
Oh, he kissed you good night?

129
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,823
It was wild, because I actually

130
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,478
remembered what it felt like to kiss him.

131
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,110
Imagine if you slept with him.
Talk about a homecoming.

132
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,865
No, we never went all the way.

133
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:14,661
Why not?

134
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,285
Because we were kids.
We wanted to wait.

135
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:20,630
And now, I think we waited long enough.

136
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,367
You're marrying him.

137
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,460
Will you stop?
He doesn't even live in New York.

138
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,495
He lives in Denver.

139
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,164
People move.

140
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,365
It would be so romantic.

141
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:29,857
Oh tragic. Seriously,

142
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,860
if I had the guy in high shcool,

143
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:35,240
what have I been doing for
the past 20 years?

144
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,019
Why did you two break up?

145
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,692
I broke up because I thought come on
there must be better guys out there.

146
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,412
Turns out, there aren't.

147
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,322
That night, I started thinking about
my retro relationship.

148
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:51,788
Since high school, most women I know
have acquired much in clothes,

149
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:53,423
hair styles, and food.

150
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,840
But what about in men?

151
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,910
Maybe we were better off
when we thought less and kissed more.

152
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:07,230
Have we graduated past our
ability to find true love

153
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,866
when it comes to matters of the heart?

154
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,199
Did we have it right in high school?

155
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:18,509
Samantha was too cool to belong
to any clubs in high school,

156
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:22,213
so she refused to believe that
any club was too cool for her now.

157
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:25,762
Especially, since New York in August
is not cool at all.

158
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,488
- May I help you?
- I hope so.

159
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,229
I'd like to to know what's
holding up my memebership.

160
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,236
I've been on the wait list since June.

161
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,498
Yes, I'm sorry, but we are not
currently admitting any new members.

162
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,000
The pool is so fabulous,

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,079
we're at capacity every day.

164
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,633
Do you know who I am?

165
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,405
No, I don't.

166
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,682
We can't accomodate you right now.

167
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,576
Well, can I at least use the restroom
before I go?

168
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:52,850
Or is there a wait list for that as well.

169
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,399
Down the corridor on your left,
the door marked W.C.

170
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:09,078
Miss, did you leave your cardon the sink?

171
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:11,360
Oh, yes.

172
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,833
Yes, I did.

173
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,279
Thank you so much.

174
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,682
Since they didn't seem to know
who she was at the SoHo house,

175
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:21,546
she figured shecould be Annabelle Bronstein.

176
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:32,664
The next day, Samantha tested
the waters with her fake ID.

177
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:34,775
Excuse me.

178
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,757
Can I get you something to drink,
Ms. Bronstein?

179
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,404
Yes, but I'll just pay cash.

180
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:45,970
And please, call me Annabelle.

181
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,999
Meanwhile a fight was about to
break out in the cafeteria.

182
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:55,346
But this time, Cafeteria
was a trendy restaurant in Chelsea.

183
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:58,511
Thank you.

184
00:08:58,511 --> 00:09:00,557
God, I hate him.

185
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:02,598
Come on, we're going over there.

186
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:03,730
Why?

187
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,624
Because you're in tank top.

188
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,458
- Hi.
- Hi.

189
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,639
You were here, what a small world.

190
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,973
That's Chelsea for ya.

191
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:15,508
Can't swing a dick without running
into someone you know.

192
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:19,764
Well, we'd love to stay and chat,

193
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:22,472
but we have to go get our tuxes for the prom.

194
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:23,937
Did you say the prom?

195
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:28,693
Yes, it's a big fundraiser
at the gay, lesbian, bi, transgenders center.

196
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,775
I'm on the decorations committee.

197
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:34,578
What's the theme?
Queer and queerer?

198
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,813
I have the best memories of my prom.

199
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,249
I was the prom queen.

200
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,911
Of course you were, darling.

201
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,939
I missed my prom in high school,
because..

202
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:44,863
You were gay.

203
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,543
No, my girlfriend and I broke up
the night before because..

204
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,773
You were gay.

205
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,902
No, I wasn't gay until..

206
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,275
You were born.

207
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,844
Never mind.

208
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:00,339
Good bye, Charlotte.

209
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,277
Bye.

210
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:02,980
Bye, Marcus.

211
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,517
Those two should be going to the gay,
lesbian, and the prostitute prom.

212
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,216
Oh, be nice.

213
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:12,019
What?

214
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,359
I happen to know that Marcus
used to be a gay escort.

215
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,499
He was not.

216
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,056
Oh honey, wake up and smell the KY.

217
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,479
I was flippinf through a vintage issueof Honcho.

218
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,473
I saw his ad in the rauncho section.

219
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:27,714
He called himself Paul,
worst hustler name I ever heard.

220
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,870
He and Stanford are in love.

221
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,702
Yeah, well, according to honcho,

222
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:33,987
he used to be in love all over town.

223
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:35,480
You are mistaken.

224
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,617
There's a picture.
I'll send you the ad.

225
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,946
I don't wanna see it.

226
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:40,412
I'm sending it, prom queen.

227
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:46,187
Cute waiter.

228
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,326
I wish he didn't know this.

229
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,666
Do you think Stanford knows?

230
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,314
Probably not, so maybe we shouldn't talk
about it in the Madison Square Garden.

231
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:03,277
I don't think that these people know those people.

232
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:10,985
- Look at how cute he is.
- He is gorgeous.

233
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,889
He looked at me,
did you see him look at me?

234
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,302
He totally likes you.

235
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,124
You think?

236
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,921
Look at these seats.

237
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:20,900
You're right.

238
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,751
These seats are too good to be casual.

239
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,965
Did I ever tell you I was a cheerleader?

240
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:36,650
No. Because you knew
I would mock you endlessly.

241
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,498
Did you used to to that?

242
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,563
No.

243
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,473
We just used some herkies and some kicks.

244
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:23,383
What is she doing?

245
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,668
The blond one in front?

246
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:27,036
Uh-huh.

247
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,270
She's flirting with your boyfriend.

248
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,969
He's not my boyfriend.

249
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,068
What? Is she like 21?

250
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:45,452
It was Friday night.
It was the big day,

251
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:48,481
and Miranda was jealous of a cheerleader.

252
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,411
Two hours later, the game ended,

253
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,578
and Miranda felt like the loser.

254
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,059
Ok, let's just go.

255
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:00,565
No, you have to go over there and talk to him.

256
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:01,966
He's talking to her.

257
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:03,661
You are better than her.

258
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,977
Go on, you can do it.

259
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,028
Are you gonna do a herky now?

260
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,580
Just you go over there and flirt a little bit.

261
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:13,809
Go, go, go.

262
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:21,204
That's it.

263
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:22,913
I'm out.

264
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,841
Meanwhile, I invited Jeremy to
come over and watch a movie,

265
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:30,778
which in high shcool was code
for come over and make out.

266
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,595
And happily, it still was.

267
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:35,089
Oh, I gotta run.

268
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,300
Last train leaves in half an hour.

269
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:40,367
I think you should stay.

270
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,175
I think we should go all the way.

271
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:46,134
- All the way.
- We never did,

272
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,119
and now we can.

273
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,335
And your mother won't walk in
with her laundry and her Tab.

274
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,872
That's true.

275
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:57,612
But Carrie, I need to be honest
with you about something.

276
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:01,588
That's the worst thing you can
hear from someone you really like.

277
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:05,486
I'm not really just taking time off,

278
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,862
I'm sort of in a..

279
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:14,466
mental institution.

280
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:18,215
No, actually, that's the worst
thing you can hear.

281
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,033
I wanted a man who would commit,

282
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,805
not a man who is committed.

283
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:23,749
Apparently, we have to be more specific.

284
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,110
But how was he able tosee you?

285
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,113
Ooh, did he escape?

286
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,184
No, he's voluntary.

287
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:32,860
He says it's not reallya mental institution,

288
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,549
it's a therapeutic community.

289
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,478
Which one?

290
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:37,448
Juno-Spears?

291
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:38,651
Oh, that's supposed to be a good one.

292
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,191
I've had clients go there.

293
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:41,990
Really?Why haven't we heard of that?

294
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,390
Because i'm good at my job.

295
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,531
No one wants to admit they're in a looney bed.

296
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,695
On a first date.

297
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,295
It's all humilliating.

298
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,899
Think about what we have togo through to date.

299
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,764
I'm 38 and I am competingwith a cheerleader.

300
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,032
YEah, and even when you get the guy,

301
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,653
you'll never know whatsome surprise might be revealed.

302
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:01,291
Let me tell you something, ladies.

303
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:05,019
In a good relationship, there are no surprises.

304
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,191
I know everything about Marcus,

305
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,893
and Marcus knows everything about me.

306
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:16,738
I don't think he knows everything.

307
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:18,871
What?

308
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,910
What?

309
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:27,776
Charlotte, like all girls, learned in early age
that only way to get rid of information

310
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:31,249
you don't want to have,
is to pass it on.

311
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,120
Oh my god.

312
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,236
Is this real?

313
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:37,583
Anthony found it in old issue of Honcho magazine.

314
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:39,793
Let me see that.

315
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,522
Ooh nice.

316
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:43,887
Marcus?

317
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,138
What is that?

318
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:48,419
Nothing.

319
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,229
Ok, hand it over.

320
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:54,332
Ok, hand it over.

321
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,946
Where did this come from?

322
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:06,039
Someone better tell me
where this came from right now.

323
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,487
I'm not kidding.

324
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:08,780
I got it from Carrie.

325
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,077
I got it from Miranda.

326
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:12,052
- I got it from Charlotte.
- I got it from Anthony,

327
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:15,117
but I told him that you and
Marcus are very much in love.

328
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:17,944
Charlotte was still a cheerleader for love.

329
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,608
But like the Knicks, her team was havinga bad season.

330
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:23,062
Well..

331
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:25,378
you think you know somebody...

332
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,529
Excuse me.

333
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,340
Which one of you is Annabelle Bronstein?

334
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,509
I am.

335
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,478
Well, that's impossibel.

336
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,843
Ms. Bronstein is in London for the week.

337
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,017
No, I am Annabelle Bronstein.

338
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:44,098
And she's British.

339
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,819
As I was saying,

340
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:47,475
dear sir.

341
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,860
I am Annabelle Bronstein.

342
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,627
I'm fairly certain you're not Annabelle,

343
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,904
I've spoken to her on the phone.

344
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:57,496
I am absolutely Annabelle Bronstein.

345
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:03,339
And I do not pay 900 American dollars
annually to be treated like this.

346
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:07,517
Now, ring round the waiter
and have him tally up the drinks.

347
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,320
What's with the accent?

348
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,871
She's got a case of a Madonna's.

349
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:15,233
I'm sorry but I know for a fact
that Annabelle lost her card.

350
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,109
Yes.

351
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,755
I thought I did.

352
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:22,615
But it was on top of the telly.

353
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:25,985
And Ms. Bronstein is from Sussex

354
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:26,915
as am I.

355
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:31,070
And I venture to guess you are not
in fact from the U.K.

356
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:36,636
Well, that's true.
I was raised in India(?).

357
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:41,045
On any given day, there are a lot of versions
of crazy right here in New York.

358
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:48,099
Today, annabelle Bronstein had
multiple personalities and at least two accents.

359
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,481
Hey, Hobbes.

360
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,309
Where did you disappear to after the game?

361
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:56,381
Oh, I was gonna thank you,

362
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:58,491
but you were takling to that girl.

363
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:03,388
- What girl?
- Some cheerleader.

364
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:04,954
Oh.

365
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:09,630
- Do you like her?
- No.

366
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,330
I like someone else.

367
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,008
You.

368
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,467
This cheered Miranda up immediately.

369
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,413
Now, see, how would I know that?

370
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,524
Well.

371
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,992
Would it be any clearer,

372
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,314
if I did this?

373
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:43,553
Hi, Mrs. McCafrey.

374
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:49,080
I wanted you to have these.

375
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:51,276
Marbles.

376
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:54,568
In case I lose any more of mine,
I wanna know where I can find the stash.

377
00:18:54,762 --> 00:18:56,459
How are you?
Do you wanna come in?

378
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,251
She asked with trepidation.

379
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,112
No. I think it's great
what you're doing.

380
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:02,213
I know I probably put you
through a loop the other day.

381
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,216
But em..

382
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:06,922
I should probably just come right out
and say something about this,

383
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:10,434
but I, truth is I haven't worked out
my rap(?) on it yet.

384
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,568
Well, it's a tough thing to slip in.

385
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,894
Yeah, it is.
So, hi, I might be crazy,

386
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:17,446
would you like to share an appetizer?

387
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,696
The thing is I think I made
it sound worse then it is.

388
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:27,480
You know, if you saw Juno-Spears,
you'd see that it's not a cuckoo's nest.

389
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:29,346
It's more like, a Canyon Ranchfor the brain.

390
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:30,924
Do they have pilates?

391
00:19:30,924 --> 00:19:32,853
They do have pilates.

392
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:35,296
I don't wanna lie to you,

393
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:38,967
I am going through some pretty heavy stuff,

394
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,473
soul searching, really.

395
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:45,666
Trying to figure out why somethingsseem to be harder for me

396
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,817
then they are for other people.

397
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:50,501
I think my family has someting to do with it.

398
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:52,597
It's always good to blame the parents, right?

399
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:53,395
Right.

400
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,802
So, I figured I could spend the next
5 years in therapy

401
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:59,176
or just spend the next month
and really deal with it intesively right now.

402
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,508
It's just more efficient.

403
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,394
Well, you'll make a very good case.

404
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:05,354
That's what my doctor said.

405
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,393
That's it. Tada.

406
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:10,254
I just wanted to explain myself,

407
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:15,783
so that I didn't become known eternally
as that nutcase you dated back in high school.

408
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:19,525
How about my high school boyfriend
who was the best kisser ever.

409
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,792
I could live with that.

410
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,490
You're not bad yourself either,
you know.

411
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:27,271
That night, we went all the day.

412
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,308
And we weren't the only ones.

413
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:43,052
The next afternoon, my other
crazy boyfriend stopped by.

414
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,650
It's true.

415
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,061
Marcus was a gay escort.

416
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,284
But he's been off the market since 1992.

417
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:50,570
So you talked about it?

418
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,920
Yes, and he says he did it
just to put himself through dance classes.

419
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:58,341
But if that's true,
then why keep it a secret?

420
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:00,507
Maybe he was embarrassed.

421
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:03,903
Yes, but it's not the escort thing,

422
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:06,078
but the secret thing that was bothering me.

423
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,775
I was the last to know.

424
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,540
I don't wanna hear the truth from

425
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,512
some bitchy queen
with back issues from Honcho.

426
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:15,012
So..

427
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,231
we broke up.

428
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,752
Oh, Stanny, really?

429
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:19,129
Yes.

430
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:23,042
And right before the prom.

431
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,877
And I still have to go,
because I'm on the decorations committtee.

432
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,362
And I have no date again.

433
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:30,719
Oh, when is it?

434
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,128
Tomorrow night.

435
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,733
Will you please, please, please
go with me?

436
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,904
I can't. I have to visit my boyfriend
at the asylum.

437
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:39,569
Of course you do.

438
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,485
He wants me to see the place for myself.

439
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:43,787
It supposed to be like Canyon Ranch.

440
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:45,874
- Honey.
- I know.

441
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:49,011
- But I like him.
- you'd have to.

442
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:50,820
and who are we to say he's got issues,

443
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,353
he's getting help usually
that's considered a good thing.

444
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,188
And it's New York, everybody's insane.

445
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:57,690
You slept with him, didn't you?

446
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,014
Yes.

447
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:02,009
Oh, that's where the problem begins.

448
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,506
You sleep with someone, you start
rationalizing away all the red flags.

449
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,639
At least he was honest about it.

450
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:10,096
Yes.

451
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:13,335
Unlike Paul.

452
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:29,625
Apparently, the Juno-Spears Center washarder than the SoHo house to get into.

453
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:31,799
Or out of.

454
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:36,119
BRADSHAW

455
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,448
Even as a visitor,

456
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:43,878
I could see how this was a very relaxing
place to get away to.

457
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,526
It's kinda nice, huh?

458
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:50,486
There are great hiking trails all around here.

459
00:22:50,712 --> 00:22:52,953
Maybe later we can do a hike.

460
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:54,432
Oh, I don't really hike.

461
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,117
Neither do I.

462
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:58,827
But I will fill you in something I discovered.

463
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:02,398
Hiking.. is walking.

464
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:03,838
Really?

465
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:06,893
I started to think, maybe
the Juno-Spears Center

466
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,198
should be mandatory for New Yorkers.

467
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:11,627
Like the Hamptons or Fire Island.

468
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:27,075
I guess that doesn't happen
very often in Canyon Ranch, right?

469
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:28,881
I've never been.

470
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,187
It might.

471
00:23:30,187 --> 00:23:33,828
Who am I kidding, this is
a full-on psychiatric facility.

472
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:35,469
With pilates.

473
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:39,676
You're definitely the sanest person here.

474
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:40,978
Well, thank you.

475
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:43,070
That's kinda like being
the best house on a bad block.

476
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,266
People would advise against buying it.

477
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:51,618
Maybe it wasn't the wisest thing to start
someting while I was still in here.

478
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:57,823
Maybe when I get out in 8 to 10 months.

479
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,422
8 to 10 months?

480
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:04,567
Yeah, my doctor still thinks
I have a lot of work to do.

481
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:07,553
And to be honest with you,
I'm comfortable here.

482
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:13,299
I kinda like it. I like that everybody's
craziness is out in the open.

483
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,923
Yeah.

484
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:22,514
- Well, I loved seeing you.
- I loved seeing you again.

485
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:30,379
What I understand we're just in
very different places right now.

486
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:36,092
Ironically, it was the sanest breakup
I ever had.

487
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:42,862
And now, the queen and queen of our prom.

488
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:47,263
Carrie Bradshaw and Stanford Blatch.

489
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:55,132
Oh my god, I love this song.

490
00:24:55,132 --> 00:24:56,608
Me, too.

491
00:24:57,637 --> 00:24:59,240
Oh, thank you very much.

492
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:15,378
This is my best prom ever.

493
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,894
Thank you for coming.

494
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:20,149
Oh, believe me I'm glad to be back
with the normal people.

495
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:22,791
You know the craziest thing of all,

496
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:28,436
I somehow thought that after everything
I've been through,

497
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:31,049
I might end up withmy high school boyfriend.

498
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:35,906
Yeah, I don't think my story's
gonna get tied up like that.

499
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:37,974
Your boyfriend might get tied up.

500
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,666
And taken away.

501
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:43,741
Ok, no more jokes, I might be dating him
in 8 to 10 months.

502
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:46,852
Oh.

503
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,759
May I cut in?

504
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:51,605
No thank you.
I already have an escort.

505
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:57,771
Honey, I didn't tell you because
it was part of my past.

506
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:00,599
It's not who I am anymore.

507
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,542
I was really messed up back then.

508
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,857
But I got it together now.

509
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:07,793
And it's prom night,

510
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:09,967
and we have to have a dance.

511
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:15,730
Why don't I get some punch?

512
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:25,195
Just tell me one thing.

513
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:30,663
Did you ever, ever sleep
with that little bitchy pinenut Anthony?

514
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:32,290
No, god no.

515
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:01,408
So, maybe it won't look the way
you thought it'd look in high school.

516
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:04,584
But it's good to remember love is possible.

517
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:09,012
Anything is possible.

518
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:20,028
This is New York.

519
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:30,327
