Season 6 Epi 09. a woman's right to
shoes (a. k.a. no shoes, no service)

11
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:54,649
The single New Yorker's weekend
is all about buying.

12
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,260
The latest Vogue, fresh flowers,

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,894
and gifts for previously single New Yorkers.

14
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:03,805
Hi. I'm here for the Welker Wedding Registry.

15
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:07,555
I'll take the Newport Soup Ladle
and three Bimini Steak Knives.

16
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:10,711
The Baby Peck list? The Burpie Blanket?

17
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:12,567
Okay. What is left?

18
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:16,417
Fine, fine, I'll take four espresso cups
and a pepper grinder.

19
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:21,659
Yeah. Okay. The L'il Me Activity Chair.

20
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:27,162
That night Stanford and I were invited
to celebrate the arrival of baby boy Bronson.

21
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:29,296
Latest son of Kyra and Chuck.

22
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,019
Easy baby girl.

23
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,113
Hey what you got in there Stanny?

24
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:35,605
A Peter Rabbit dish set with matching bib.

25
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:37,570
Dang. You snagged that?

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,188
Thanks to you I was left with the I'il me chair.

27
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:43,485
Oh and get this. I also got him a CD,

28
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,130
a Free To Be You and Me.

29
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,095
I loved Marlo Thomas, I played
that album all through the fifth grade.

30
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:52,643
I wanted to run as fast as the wind.

31
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:55,389
I played 'William wants a doll' so many times,

32
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:58,546
I almost turned my little sister into a gay man.

33
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:09,200
Hey. Welcome to the party.

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,751
I'm Margo, Kyra's sister.

35
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:14,158
The gifts go over on the table
and the shoes go there.

36
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:19,401
Oh.

37
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,524
Kyra and Chuck don't like outside dirt coming in.

38
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,142
The twins are always picking
things up off the floor.

39
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,620
But.

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,468
This is an outfit.

41
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,074
- They'd really appreciate it.
- Margo!

42
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,848
Good thing I wore my party socks.

43
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:43,021
Gees, If I'd known I was gonna be shoeless,

44
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,822
I would have compensated with a big hat or something.

45
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,607
Okay.

46
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:53,475
Well, now I'm so teeny
I might bump my head on the coffee table.

47
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,675
Watch out 'Little Me'.

48
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:02,842
Our hostess, Kyra Bronson had made
a name for herself in the early 90's taking pictures

49
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:06,325
of anorectic actresses on beds at the Chelsea Hotel.

50
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,410
- Hey you two.
- Hey.

51
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,609
Now she took pictures of fat babies in buckets.

52
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,385
We come from the east, 70s, bearing gifts.

53
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,163
Where's the blessed child?

54
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,417
The baby, he's in his room.

55
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,388
You can't miss him. He looks just like Chuck

56
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,357
except without that sad closed up hole in his ear

57
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:23,775
when he pierced it in the 80s.

58
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:24,848
- Anyway here.
- Oh thank you.

59
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:29,035
I've gotta go. Other people need drinks
and by others I mean me.

60
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:31,217
Hey. Marlo. Allegra.

61
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,073
Waiter. There's a baby in my drink.

62
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:40,421
Up town, Miranda was putting her foot down
in her co-op board meeting.

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,641
Look, we all wanna find the perfect tenant for 10G.

64
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,188
All I'm asking is that we not prolong the interview.

65
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,828
Whatever decision we make about Dr. Robert Leeds,

66
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,137
let's make it quick.

67
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,537
I got a baby downstairs getting over the chicken pox.

68
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,190
I have a cataract.

69
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,798
Hello. Come in. Yes hi.

70
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:05,162
And suddenly, Miranda wasn't so bored
in her board meeting.

71
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,591
- Hi. I'm Miranda Hobbes.
- Hi.

72
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,559
And this is everybody else.

73
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,988
And I'm Robert Leeds but you probably know that

74
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,818
already along with my social security number
and my jacket size.

75
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:24,670
So, Robert, you're a doctor for the Knicks?

76
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,223
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

77
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,990
- How long have you had that..
- Hey, you've had a great season.

78
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:32,096
I take it you're not a basketball fan.

79
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,880
Well, you've got me there. I'm a baseball person.

80
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,964
Yankees or Mets?

81
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:38,639
Please. Yankees.

82
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,561
Should have known.

83
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,546
And what is that suppose to mean?

84
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,760
On page 4 of your tax return...

85
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,683
Lin, Please. We'll get to it.

86
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,944
While Miranda was playing a game of pickup,

87
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,827
You tell him I'll do depositions Friday
but only if my client is ready.

88
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:00,595
Charlotte was picking up as well.

89
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:05,242
Exactly. What, you're gonna push me on this?
Don't push me.

90
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:07,599
Cause if you push me then I'm pushing it back.

91
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,547
I don't have to produce my client for this, you know.

92
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:12,562
Charlotte knew when Harry moved in,
he would unpack his bags.

93
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,446
She wasn't expecting, the tea bags.

94
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,306
And everything else?

95
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,963
Why are you hocking me on this?

96
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:27,548
Keep it slow. Open ears, ready?

97
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,364
Here it comes. I don't think so! Clear?

98
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:33,560
One tax return and a half hour of eye lash batting later.

99
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,787
It was really nice to meet you.

100
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:35,707
You too.

101
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:40,830
And I won't hold that Mets thing against you.

102
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,804
I appreciate that. Bye-bye.

103
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:49,958
Well, he's perfect.

104
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:54,169
Frankly, I am concerned about his financials.

105
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:56,622
His alimony payments are awfully high.

106
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,413
And he's never owned before.

107
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,293
You people are crazy.

108
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:04,752
It's the single ones who always throw
the wild parties with all the girls.

109
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,104
Okay. I think we all know
what's not being said here.

110
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,594
The unspoken thing was that Robert was cute

111
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:17,787
and Miranda was horny.

112
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,298
And then we saw the most amazing house in Saga.

113
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:26,338
I swear I had no idea who we were bidding against.

114
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:28,996
Oh you lie. You two know everything.

115
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:32,143
That's true. We got the house..

116
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:35,639
but we could not get a table at
Nick and Toni's for the rest of the summer.

117
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:40,044
Well it's getting late.

118
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,886
Oh my, we have held you guys captive.

119
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,808
No. We've had a swell time. It's just..

120
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:47,193
it's midnight, he's gay.

121
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:48,598
He has to start his night.

122
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:51,554
Anyway, congrats on the baby.

123
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:55,088
- Thanks.
- Yeah. He's just precious.

124
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,214
- Bye.
- Bye.

125
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:57,614
Nice to meet you.

126
00:06:57,614 --> 00:07:00,913
Then of course, our landscaper takes off
with half of our trees.

127
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:03,211
I might have been one foot out the door

128
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:06,216
but my shoes have appeared to have already left.

129
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:12,656
And I told him, that's what you get for
stealing Billy Joe's firewood.

130
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:17,005
I.. was there another room for the shoes?

131
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,037
No.

132
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:22,079
Well, mine seem to have gone missing.

133
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:24,876
That's crazy.

134
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,443
God, Carrie, I'm sorry.

135
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:30,723
I just can't imagine where your shoes went.

136
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,946
You know, Jennifer was wearing sandals,
perhaps she took yours by mistake.

137
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:38,648
Well actually, they weren't sandals,
they were Manolos.

138
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,223
I'm sure they'll turn up.

139
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:43,499
I can loan you some shoes to go home in.

140
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,158
They say you shouldn't judge until
you've walked a mile in someone else's shoes.

141
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,225
I made it six blocks.

142
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,673
The next day over dessert,

143
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:08,578
I was still not over the fact
that my shoes had deserted me.

144
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:09,860
These were new Manolos.

145
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,193
I haven't even done a full lap around the party.

146
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:14,333
And you know, I don't play favorites with my shoes

147
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,785
but these were very special.

148
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,978
Who would steal shoes from a party?

149
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,853
Someone size 7 with excellent taste.

150
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,290
Why in hell did you take your shoes off to begin with?

151
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,107
We had to. For their kids.

152
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,400
Apparently we drag things in on our heels
that make children sick.

153
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,085
Please, it's children who drag the germs around.

154
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:35,342
Brady got the chicken pox,

155
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:38,404
courtesy of some kid who licked him at the playground.

156
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:39,805
Oh my God.

157
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:41,742
Kyra must have been mortified.

158
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:45,095
Actually, I kept waiting for the mortification
that never came.

159
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,134
She just said they might turn up,
sent me home.

160
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:49,047
Those shoes are not turning up anywhere

161
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,232
but a pawnshop in Brooklyn.

162
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:53,714
Oh stop. I'm gonna cry in my flan.

163
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:58,997
So that's it? They're just gone? Boo hoo?

164
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:01,035
Well legally she owes you for them.

165
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:03,269
I can't ask her to pay for my shoes.

166
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,117
Why not? If you gave a party and told herto leave her baby outside in the hall

167
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:10,245
and her baby was missing at the end of the night,

168
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,269
believe me there'd be payback.

169
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,649
That is the craziest thing I've ever heard.

170
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,281
Children are not shoes.

171
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:18,146
I know, I know. I'm not saying it.

172
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:21,113
You have every right to be upset about your shoes.

173
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,781
I am so sick of these people with their children.

174
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,309
I'm telling you, they're everywhere.

175
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,234
Sitting next to me in first class,

176
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,175
eating at the next table at Jean Georges.

177
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:34,052
Look at that. This place is for double cappuccinos,

178
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:37,800
not double strollers.

179
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,246
- I'm sorry.
- Hey no need to apologize.

180
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,896
I wouldn't bring Brady here.

181
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,920
Mommy needs two hands to eat her eight-dollar cake.

182
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,881
You're not gonna defend children?

183
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:49,579
No. I don't like any children but my own.

184
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:52,353
Look at that dirty little rug rat.

185
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:53,776
That's just chocolate.

186
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:57,187
All children are beautiful but not as beautiful as Brady.

187
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,559
That's true.

188
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:02,151
Hey so how goes the big matrimonial movement?

189
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:05,312
Good. Harry has moved most of his stuff in.

190
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,923
it's going well.

191
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:09,261
And I'm just trying to learn to compromise

192
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:12,038
because sometimes I can be a little rigid.

193
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:14,397
- No.
- That's not true.

194
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,909
There's just one thing. It's small but..

195
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,953
really grosses me out.
We have a tea bag situation.

196
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,689
Oh I understand.

197
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,521
Just breathe through your nose.

198
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:29,723
When you're sucking his balls.

199
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:35,602
What? No. I was talking about Harry
leaves his old tea packs around the house.

200
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,198
Oh I thought you meant tea bagging.

201
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,890
When you hold a guy's balls in your mouth.

202
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,631
Why is it called.. oh I get it.

203
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:47,477
Because they hang. And the dipping.

204
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:51,387
Oh great. Now I've lost my shoes
and my appetite.

205
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,346
Very good.

206
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,826
You know what I love about living with you?

207
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:59,149
Besides those nutty little soaps in the bathroom?

208
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:00,093
What?

209
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,703
Living with you.

210
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,829
Honey.

211
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:09,597
I need to talk to you.

212
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:11,191
What's up baby?

213
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:14,223
I really don't mean to be a nag but it's just..

214
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,551
well.. it's this.

215
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,945
Tea?

216
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,155
No, teabags.

217
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:24,488
You leave them all over
the house and well.. they stain and..

218
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:26,888
and maybe you could just try to
be a little more careful.

219
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:28,768
Damn. I thought I was doing so well too.

220
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:29,243
What do you mean?

221
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,210
Well I've been really trying to watch my ass

222
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,909
you know now that I'm living in your house.

223
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,098
It's our house now and I want you to be yourself.

224
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:39,092
Yeah well.. myself is pretty much
a bull in a china shop.

225
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,700
Then you're bull in our china shop.

226
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:46,772
It's a bull.

227
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:48,908
I get it.

228
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,779
- Just making sure.
- I get it.

229
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:59,780
Hold it. Oh, oh.

230
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:01,631
Hey Yankee.

231
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:05,787
Welcome to the building.

232
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,219
I have a feeling you had little
something to do with that.

233
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:11,388
Let's just say you owe me big time.

234
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,720
You have a pock.

235
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:21,671
What?

236
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,533
On your face. Right there.

237
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:27,372
Oh my god. I must have gotten it from my kid.

238
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:30,115
- Oh I thought you were single.
- I am.

239
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:34,243
It was the perfect first conversation.

240
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:36,549
Minus the pock.

241
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:41,794
All right. Give me the lotion and cotton balls. Stat.

242
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,588
You don't really say stat.

243
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:45,727
No but it sounds good.

244
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:49,757
Hey, Who's the little germ disseminator?

245
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,682
Also known as Brady.

246
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,412
Run while you're still breathing.

247
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:54,299
No, no, it's okay.

248
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,138
I had the chicken pox when I was four.
Hey where you going?

249
00:12:57,138 --> 00:12:58,070
Hi.

250
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,063
Hey.

251
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,689
He's a winner.

252
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,453
Really want one of these some day.

253
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,943
You know, he looks just like you.

254
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,696
- You think?
- Oh yeah.

255
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:13,320
Okay mama.

256
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,749
You know, I could do this myself.

257
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:20,647
Yeah but I'm a professional.

258
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:26,180
Oh. Magda, this is Dr. Robert Leeds.

259
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,413
- He's moving in upstairs.
- Hi.

260
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:30,021
Nice to meet you.

261
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:33,478
- I'll take Brady for nap.
- Okay.

262
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,973
Oh hey, hey. You got another one.

263
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:42,712
Okay Ms. Hobbes, I think you'll live.

264
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,054
But no scathing, doctor's orders.

265
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:46,320
Okie doke.

266
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,486
For Miranda, Robert was just
what the doctor ordered.

267
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,322
Hey Carrie what a surprise.

268
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:54,623
Well I was in the neighborhood,

269
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:56,724
I thought you might want these back.

270
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:57,933
Oh you didn't have to return these.

271
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,437
I had forgotten all about them.

272
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,736
So. Any news on my shoes?

273
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,007
No, it's weird.

274
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:12,116
So. Does Jennifer,
did you ever find her sandals?

275
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,009
What?

276
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:16,145
Well if she took my shoes,
she would have left her sandals.

277
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,323
Just being a bit of a shoe detective here.

278
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,828
I haven't heard from her.

279
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:25,390
Oh.

280
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,662
Oh my gosh, Carrie. I am such a shit.

281
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:30,303
I should have offered to pay you for them.

282
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,232
No. No, you don't have to do that.

283
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:35,214
You know you have kids and
you lose all sense of social decency.

284
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,306
- Come in.
- Okay.

285
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,843
Mylo, honey. Put your trucks back for mommy.

286
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,775
Okay.

287
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,943
So. How much were they?

288
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:58,065
485.

289
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:01,663
Come on, Carrie. That's insane.

290
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,189
Well. That's what they cost.

291
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:08,178
I'll give you 200 dollars.

292
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:11,814
Okay. This is an awkward conversation.

293
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:15,268
I'm sorry, I just think that's crazy to
spend that much money on shoes.

294
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:18,166
You know how much Manolos are.
You used to wear Manolos.

295
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,958
Sure. Before I had a real life.

296
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,016
But Chuck and I have responsibilities now.

297
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:24,994
Kids, houses.

298
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:29,286
485. Like, wow.

299
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:32,981
I have a real life.

300
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:37,223
No offense Carrie but I really don't think
we should have to pay for your extravagant life style.

301
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:40,968
I mean it was your choice
to buy shoes that expensive.

302
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,209
Yes, but, it wasn't my choice to take them off.

303
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,195
They're just shoes.

304
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:52,550
She shoe-shamed me.

305
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,727
I left there covered in shame.

306
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:56,256
She's a fucking bitch.

307
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,711
But she isn't. that's the thing.

308
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,035
She's become this whole other person

309
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:04,121
it's like she's had two cesareans and a lobotomy.

310
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:06,151
She owes you for those shoes.

311
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,260
No, it's not about the money.
I don't care about the money.

312
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,642
I'm talking about a woman's right to shoes.

313
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:14,697
Why did she have to shame me?

314
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:17,880
Because she's trapped in hell
of her own making.

315
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,380
No, wait, that's me. Oh.

316
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:27,214
I am dying to scratch these but if I do,
it'll be worse.

317
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:28,894
How are they today?

318
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:33,194
Biblical. There's literally a pox on my house.

319
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:36,930
If there wasn't a Jules and Mimi marathon
on BBC America this weekend,

320
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,839
I'd have jumped out the window.

321
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,385
Hey, speaking of handsome black man,

322
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:43,854
have you spotted any more of Doctor Knicks?

323
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:47,532
Don't say spot. No. As a leopard,

324
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:48,537
I'm laying low.

325
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:51,751
But according to my sources,
he's officially in the building.

326
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:55,194
Hey is it bad my life is filled with
shoes and not children?

327
00:16:55,194 --> 00:17:00,236
Stop it. And she is a fucking bitch
for making you feel this way.

328
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:01,905
Oh god.

329
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,156
When we were young,

330
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:08,025
Marlo Thomas sang to us about
accepting each other and our differences.

331
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:11,698
But then we got older and
started singing a different tune.

332
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,906
We stopped celebrating each other's life choices
and started qualifying them.

333
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,607
Is acceptance really such a childish concept

334
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,031
or did we have it right all along?

335
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,648
When did we stop being free to be you and me?

336
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:33,745
The next morning, Charlotte learned
just how free the real Harry could be.

337
00:17:33,745 --> 00:17:37,935
Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear,

338
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:44,255
and he shows them pearly white.

339
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:45,611
Morning.

340
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:48,297
Hi.

341
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:53,083
- Are you gonna take a shower?
- In a little while.

342
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,264
Apparently, it took next to nothingto make Harry feel comfortable.

343
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,905
Charlotte felt completely trapped.

344
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,976
She wanted to see Harry be himself in her home.

345
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:33,668
She just didn't need to see that much of him.

346
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,958
Meanwhile, I decided to bear all to Kyra.

347
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:44,615
Hello.

348
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:47,652
Hey. Kyra it's Carrie. Listen.

349
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,214
I feel weird about what happened the other day.

350
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,085
We've been friends a really long time and

351
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:56,405
it's just.. I wanna clear the air.

352
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,940
Oh my god Carrie.
I have forgotten about that days ago.

353
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:03,231
Well I didn't. I've been thinking
a lot about it and..

354
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:05,903
Man, you must have a lot of time on your hands.

355
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,803
Mylo. Pants stay on. I'm serious.

356
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:10,698
Penises stay in the bathroom.

357
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:13,834
Carrie, can you hold on for one second,
I'll be right back. Thanks.

358
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:20,183
Hello?

359
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,291
Hello, Santa?

360
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:28,691
You know what? I am Santa.

361
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:30,945
I did a little mental addition.

362
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:33,825
Over the years, I have bought

363
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:34,728
Kyra an engagement gift, a wedding gift,

364
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:37,843
then there was the trip to Maine
for the wedding, three baby gifts.

365
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:45,248
In toto, I have spent over 23,000 dollars
celebrating her choices.

366
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:50,286
And she is shaming me for spending
a lousy 485 bucks on myself?

367
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:52,899
Yes. I did the bath.

368
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,034
But those were gifts. I mean,

369
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:56,929
if you got married or had a child,

370
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,501
she would spend the same on you.

371
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,225
And if don't ever get married or have a baby?

372
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:05,528
What? I get bubkes? Think about it.

373
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,389
If you are single, after graduation,

374
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,926
there isn't one occation where people celebrate you.

375
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:12,697
We have birthdays.

376
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:14,997
Oh no. We all have birthdays.

377
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:19,110
That's a wash. I am talking about the single gaff.

378
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:24,388
Hallmark doesn't make a ¡°congratulations
you didn't marry the wrong guy¡± card.

379
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:29,446
And where's the flatware for going on vacation alone?

380
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,658
You're right. Why should I get wedding gifts?

381
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,288
Finding Harry was gift enough.

382
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:38,825
No. I'm thrilled to give you gifts
to celebrate your life.

383
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:42,364
I just think it stinks that single people
are left out of it.

384
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:44,596
So the more the story appears to be,

385
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:48,125
until I get married I won't be seeing nothing from Kyra.

386
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:48,918
Oh.

387
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:51,146
- How's the? pasticcio?
- It's so good. You want some?

388
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,275
Yeah.

389
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:55,759
Meanwhile, Samantha was trying to
have a working lunch.

390
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,226
Yeah we got cut off. Look,

391
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,824
I need to get him three VIP seats and.

392
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:07,044
Look at you. Look at you eating your pesto.

393
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:12,820
No, I don't want any shitty house seats.

394
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,073
Listen to me.

395
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,543
No I can't have any..

396
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:19,040
Excuse me. We don't allow cell phones.

397
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,146
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

398
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,409
I'll call you back.

399
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:26,589
I understand that my cell phone
may be annoying to some.

400
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,240
But what are you doing about that noise?

401
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,160
There's nothing we can do about that.

402
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,395
That's a child.

403
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:40,718
And that was all Samantha had to hear.

404
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,946
Hello. I understand that your child and
I have to co-exist in this city.

405
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:53,075
But perhaps you can take him somewhere
more appropriate for a happy meal.

406
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,912
So I could have a happier one.

407
00:21:56,408 --> 00:22:00,289
Shamis. That's wasn't very nice.

408
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,654
Well. I've made my point,

409
00:22:05,094 --> 00:22:07,028
and he's made his.

410
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:12,303
Did you see a monster that smart?

411
00:22:12,673 --> 00:22:15,966
That is real? And it's

412
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,243
Honey. Honey.

413
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,752
Hello beautiful.

414
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:25,066
Hi.

415
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,047
Do you know what we need
to bring back in this house?

416
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:30,861
Cocktail hour.

417
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:37,399
Charlotte realized there was something
grosser than teabags all over her house.

418
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,032
Her husband's tea bags all over her new white couch.

419
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,222
Harry!

420
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:44,912
What?

421
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:48,011
No. I feel bad.

422
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:49,600
About what?

423
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:54,724
Well I'm trying to be less rigid and I really
do want you to be yourself in our house.

424
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:56,775
I know you do and I appreciate it.

425
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:02,415
And I'm almost used to the whole naked thing.

426
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:06,213
I knew it was too much. It's just me.

427
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,907
But I can put on clothes.

428
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:11,045
No. I want you to be yourself.

429
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:16,772
It's just.. maybe you could put something
between yourself and the white couch.

430
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:21,225
Oh I get it. We got kind of a ass
white couch situation here.

431
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,361
I will put on shorts.

432
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:29,965
- Could you?
- Of course.

433
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:34,848
Oh. Now?

434
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:38,829
Love you.

435
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,428
Miranda, you in there?

436
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:02,406
I can see your feet under the door.

437
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:05,480
- Damn.
- Com on, just came by to check up on you.

438
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,471
I'm fine.

439
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:09,554
Hey I've seen it all.
I'm a doctor, remember?

440
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:17,054
I'm fine. Come on in.

441
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:19,820
That's not that bad.

442
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,459
I've seen a 7 foot tall man shinbone
poking through his cabs so.

443
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,031
Where's Brady?

444
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,503
Oh. He's asleep.

445
00:24:27,503 --> 00:24:29,137
Oh that's too bad.
I wanted to give him this.

446
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:34,964
Oh I'm pretty sure his hand-eye coordination
is a still little subpart to make the team.

447
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:38,287
If he's gonna go pro,
you gotta start him young.

448
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,575
What are you watching?

449
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,321
It's just Jules and Mimi. It's silly.

450
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:44,657
What's it about?

451
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:51,358
Well that's Mimi. She's the landlord
and right next to her there is Jules.

452
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,511
And they've slept together couple of times

453
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:57,701
but Jules may be involved with a girl
who works in the sausage shop.

454
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:00,484
- In a nutshell.
- He seems to be pretty into her now.

455
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:02,449
- Yeah.
- I'm intrigued.

456
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:07,174
- Really?
- That and my cable's not hooked up yet.

457
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,470
Jules. You know you didn't have tobring the rent over in person.

458
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:21,509
What's two stops between friends, eh?

459
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:23,846
I love a brother with an accent.

460
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:26,159
Do you think we'll stay friends after this?

461
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,858
I hope not.

462
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:47,040
Oh Mimi. You're so soft.

463
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:53,536
That night, I decided I couldn't wait for a ring.

464
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:56,317
And so, I gave someone else one.

465
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:02,651
This is Mylo. This is Allegra.

466
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:07,120
Mommie and Daddie and baby Henry
and us aren't here.

467
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,183
Leave a message.

468
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,690
Hi. It's Carrie Bradshaw.

469
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,950
I wanted to let you know that I'm getting married.

470
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:22,881
To myself. I'm registered at Manolo Blahnik.

471
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,816
So thanks. Bye.

472
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,376
One giant step for me.

473
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:31,176
One small step for single woman kind.

474
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:38,682
Here they are. That's all she registered for?

475
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,539
That'll be..

476
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,471
485. Yeah.

477
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:47,512
Plus tax. And could you pleasewatch your children?

478
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,695
We don't want them touching the shoes.

479
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,986
Thanks.

480
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:06,228
Carrie, congratulations, we couldn't be happier for you
and you Love, Kyra, Chuck, Mylo, Allegra and baby Henry

00:27:17,322 --> 00:27:20,159
It was my very first wedding present.

482
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:26,951
The fact is. Sometimes it's hard to
walk in a single woman's shoes.

483
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:30,070
That's why we need really
special ones now and then

484
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,551
to make the walk a little more fun.
