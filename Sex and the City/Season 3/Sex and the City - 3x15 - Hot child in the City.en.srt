1
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:52,798
Ifyou live in NewYork for ten years,
you can call yourself a New Yorker.

2
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:57,098
But the trained eye can always
spot the ones who were born here.

3
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:01,401
I want it all, I want it now,
and I want you to get it for me.

4
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,909
After firing her last two publicists,

5
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,410
Jenny Brier,

6
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:06,515
the daughter of a restaurateur,

7
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,742
had decided that Samantha

8
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:10,442
would take over the PR

9
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:12,554
for her upcoming party.

10
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:14,815
I want "Vanity Fair", Carson Daly,

11
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,652
"People", "Teen People", NSYNC...

12
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:23,129
Jenny, sweetie. Don't take this
the wrong way, but how old are you?

13
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,668
- It's my Bat Mitzvah party. I'm 13.
- You're 13?

14
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,827
What are you, 45?

15
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,906
Just like that, the meeting was over.

16
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:36,476
I'm sorry, I don't do kids' parties.

17
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:39,273
Sweetie, my father has invited

18
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,713
over 300 of his powerful friends.

19
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:45,251
They are not all coming.
The Clintons can't make it.

20
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,549
I told Daddy we'll be lucky
if we can swing this for under a mill.

21
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:51,750
But what do I know? I'm just a kid.

22
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,995
We'll never get NSYNC.

23
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,269
After meeting her new client,
Samantha met us

24
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:03,928
for the latest trend in power lunching -

25
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,098
haute cafeteria cuisine.

26
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,444
Coming in for a landing, sister?

27
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:15,277
Cute guy. Thought he was
checking me out for a second.

28
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,509
Where?

29
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,017
Don't turn...

30
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:24,091
- He's a cutie all right.
- Definitely looking.

31
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:27,093
Looking at you looking at him,
like I asked you not to.

32
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,527
- Take your tray over there.
- No.

33
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,098
Why not?

34
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:35,226
This isn't PS 147,
we're adults now. She's married.

35
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:37,770
We have to at least pretend
to know better.

36
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:42,002
- I saw a doctor about my headaches.
- Still looking.

37
00:02:42,177 --> 00:02:44,202
Which you're not helping.

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,144
I've been trying
to diagnose myself on the Internet.

39
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:48,341
You can do that?

40
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:52,920
Type in your symptoms and
wait for the word "cancer" to appear.

41
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:56,057
Anyway, turns out
I'm a tongue-thruster.

42
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:59,126
If you were a man,
that would be a good thing.

43
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:03,288
My tongue pushes against my teeth,
so my bite is all off.

44
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:06,559
- My dentist thinks I have TMJ.
- You have to do something.

45
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:10,536
- I'm going to the orthodontist.
- No, I mean he's really cute.

46
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:14,335
- She could write him a note.
- Even cuter.

47
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,808
Guys, I'm not writing him a note.

48
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:19,708
- Dear Mr. Cutie-Cute...
- You did not write that.

49
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:23,476
- Just your phone number.
- I'm not giving him my number.

50
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:26,553
Relax, TMJ. You don't have to.

51
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,815
- I'll do it for you.
- Carrie.

52
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,926
- Go, girl.
- Oh, my God.

53
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:39,729
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you,
but my friend Miranda over there...

54
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:43,736
- Oh, my God.
- She thinks you're cute.

55
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:48,036
Please tell your friend Miranda
to call me.

56
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:57,575
On the way home,
I decided to brave the afternoon heat

57
00:03:57,753 --> 00:04:02,622
to see if my shoe repair guy
could do anything about my old soles.

58
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,920
But when I got there,
there was no "there" there.

59
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:26,513
- What happened to Artie?
- Artie?

60
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:31,517
My guy, my shoe guy.
He fixed these the last time.

61
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:36,056
He moved back to Williamsburg.
Brooklyn, not Colonial.

62
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,819
He couldn't afford the place
once they destabilized the rent.

63
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:43,020
If the comic business keeps going
the way it is, I won't be able to either.

64
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:47,464
- Comics aren't selling, huh?
- No, especially mine.

65
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:53,606
Power Lad, by Wade Adams.

66
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,506
Is this you? Did you drawthis?

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,072
What's so powerful about him?

68
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,687
He's a superhero, or he wants to be.
His parents were superheroes.

69
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:08,914
He's trying to find his super-powers.
They haven't kicked in yet.

70
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:11,025
It's stupid.
What do you do?

71
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:14,491
- I'm a writer.
- That's cool. What do you write?

72
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:17,063
Turn to page seven
of your newspaper.

73
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:25,099
Yes, I thought you looked familiar.

74
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:28,368
- Would you like to write comics?
- Aren't they a boy thing?

75
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:33,038
No! There are women superheroes -
Batgirl, Supergirl, Black Canary...

76
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:35,241
You've heard ofWonder Woman.

77
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:39,046
With the bracelets and the tiara.

78
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,918
I used to love that even
her accessories had super-powers.

79
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:45,423
Oh, man.

80
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,090
What's wrong with them?

81
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,770
To them, you are Wonder Woman.

82
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,339
- All right, stop. I'll buy some.
- All right.

83
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:12,480
I never did get my shoes fixed.
But the next week, I got new boots.

84
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:17,617
I don't know what came over me,
but I felt compelled to thank him.

85
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,458
Even as a superhero,
I was powerless to resist.

86
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:26,465
That evening, inspired by
Miranda's digital diagnosis,

87
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,500
Charlotte went surfing

88
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,502
for a cure for Trey's condition.

89
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:34,909
There it was,
in both the on- and off-positions.

90
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:39,912
$8,000 worth of hydraulics that
could turn Trey into the Bionic Man.

91
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:42,083
Ordinarily, this was something

92
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:44,082
Charlotte would shy away from,

93
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:46,382
but since her marriage was shy
of wood...

94
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:51,049
That night, I met Wade Adams
alias Power Lad at Bar Code,

95
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:55,356
a Times Square bar that specialized
in real drinks and virtual reality.

96
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:58,295
I can't believe this place,
it's like ten bucks a game.

97
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,492
Yeah, but games come with beer.

98
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,832
They want you to play
half as well and twice as much.

99
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,466
Sounds good to me. What will it be -
Bloodburst or Terrorfright ll?

100
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:11,010
Whatever happened
to Frogger and Miss Pacman?

101
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:15,479
- She got married.
- No! To Pacman?

102
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,620
Good for them.
Man, where have I been?

103
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:20,914
I don't know,
but wanna go to Mars?

104
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:24,387
- For ten bucks? It's a bargain.
- Let's go.

105
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,585
Without leaving the building,

106
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:29,856
Power Lad took me
to the furthest reaches of the galaxy

107
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,660
and right back to seventh grade.

108
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,863
- There we go.
- Oh, God.

109
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,030
It was maddening.

110
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:43,701
Bram and Pippin liked the '78 Lafite,
which was entirely acceptable.

111
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,747
The implant's on/off-switch
had Charlotte thinking about Trey's.

112
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:52,217
She was desperate to turn his on,
but didn't know where to find it.

113
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:55,117
The joke was on him.
We ordered both.

114
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:59,055
Howwas your day?

115
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:06,258
I went to the gallery in the morning
and the framer's in the afternoon.

116
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:10,235
Then I found this on the Internet. See?

117
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:19,479
What on earth is this?
What are you getting at?

118
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,512
Just that...

119
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:27,713
We've tried everything else
and we still...

120
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,690
You haven't... in my... ever...

121
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,352
So I thought...

122
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,499
You can't be serious.

123
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:41,559
What other options do we have?

124
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:55,849
Five beers, four video games,
102 degrees outside later...

125
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,722
- You gotta be kidding.
- What? This is fun.

126
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:10,422
It's cheaper than taking cabs.
Besides, all the kids got them.

127
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,090
- Wanna try it?
- It's too hot to scoot.

128
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:19,071
Let's go to my place. I have a great
view. The breeze is even better.

129
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:22,903
I'm not the kind of girl who scoots
to a guy's terrace on the first date.

130
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,538
I respect that.

131
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:29,240
- I have central air.
- Give me that scooter.

132
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,318
- Ever been on one?
- No.

133
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:33,784
- That's great.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,521
I'm scooting in heels.

135
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:53,907
You said you had a view,
not the view.

136
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:58,342
And this breeze -
it's like there's different air up here.

137
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,710
- How do you have all this?
- Why don't I get us some beers?

138
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,943
Then we can talk
adventures and real estate.

139
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:09,755
How was it possible
that mild-mannered Power Lad

140
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:14,692
had a classic six on the Upper
East Side with a view of the park?

141
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:20,426
Was he Power Lad by day
and a millionaire playboy by night?

142
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,596
Hello?

143
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:25,906
You scared me.

144
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:29,237
- I heard voices outside and...
- You're up.

145
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:33,973
- Did we wake you?
- I'm always keeping the watch.

146
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,140
Did you meet Carrie?

147
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:38,912
Carrie, I'd like you to meet my mother.

148
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:44,548
- Hello. It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
- Yeah.

149
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:48,059
I'm off to bed.

150
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:50,197
You two have fun.

151
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:54,767
But don't stay up too late, dear.
Good night.

152
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:57,063
- Night.
- It's lovely to meet you.

153
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,903
Lovely to meet you too, Mrs. Adams.

154
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,575
- He lives with his parents?
- It's their apartment.

155
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:11,776
The next day at Commune,
daddy Brier's latest restaurant,

156
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:14,285
I asked Samantha
about my prospects with Power Lad.

157
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:18,222
Not sexy. Dump him immediately.
Use my cell phone.

158
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:21,226
He put his money
in the comic book store.

159
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,990
- Still not sexy. What's his number?
- He's saving up for his own place.

160
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:29,831
You know howtough the market is.
Plus he's fun and funny.

161
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,836
Stop while you're still sexy.

162
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:36,808
There's no way you'd go out with
a guy who lived with his family?

163
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:38,969
Maybe Prince William.

164
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:41,344
I'm sorry I'm late.

165
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:45,685
This happens to tongue-thrusters.

166
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:48,823
I have to wear them for a year.
Am I hideous?

167
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:53,917
No. Hey, no.
No, they don't look so bad.

168
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:57,087
- Do you mean it?
- I'm sticking to my story.

169
00:11:57,265 --> 00:12:00,132
Are you in pain?
I'm in pain looking at you.

170
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:03,897
I'm a 34-year-old with braces,
and I'm on a liquid diet.

171
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,733
Pain doesn't begin to cover it.

172
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:09,343
- Look, lunch.
- We didn't order champagne.

173
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:13,311
- Compliments of Jenny Brier.
- You get the nicest compliments.

174
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:18,714
A 13-year-old girl just bought us
a $200 bottle of Dom Perignon?

175
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,186
Do you knowwhat I was buying
when I was 13? Nothing.

176
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,555
I couldn't afford anything.
I served Dilly Bars at Dairy Queen.

177
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,821
Where is she?
Where is that Brat Mitzvah beast?

178
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:35,366
- Is everything fabulous?
- Yes. I didn't knowyou were here.

179
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:39,735
You know Carrie Bradshaw?
You are fucking fabulous.

180
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:43,435
Your column about secret sex -
hello, my life.

181
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:47,048
Seriously. My ex was so completely
about the sex when we were alone,

182
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:49,649
but at school, I didn't exist.

183
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:53,379
- They're all like that.
- Or worse. Men suck.

184
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,724
What?

185
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,952
I'm sorry, are your braces blue?

186
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:03,529
No, they're sapphire.
Oh my God! Look!

187
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:07,499
You have the old-fashioned kind.
I didn't knowthey still made those.

188
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:10,968
I'll be there. We have to dash.
Enjoy your meal, ladies.

189
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,937
You are so fucking fabulous.

190
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:22,242
Her braces are sapphire.
I'm a 34-year-old nerd.

191
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,942
- How old are they?
- 13.

192
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,112
- They sound...
- I know.

193
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:30,314
- They're dressed...
- I know.

194
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,483
Just like us.

195
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,388
Were Jenny Brier and her friends
dressed like 30-something-year-olds,

196
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,467
or were we trying
to look like teenagers?

197
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:46,130
One was sending Dom Perignon,
another was touring on a scooter.

198
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,833
When you're a teenager,
all you want to do is buy beer.

199
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,275
Once you hit 30,
all you want to do is get carded.

200
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:55,041
I wondered,
in today's youth obsessed culture,

201
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:59,550
are the women of my generation
growing into responsible adults,

202
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:03,418
or are we 34 going on 13?

203
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:06,685
After a week
of self-imposed seclusion,

204
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:10,092
Miranda felt strong enough
for solid food and table service

205
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:12,664
with Lance Bloom,
a senior editor at Knopf.

206
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,632
I started out wanting to be a writer,

207
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:19,865
but it's a solitary life.
I'm more interested in collaborating.

208
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:22,942
What are you working on now?

209
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,944
You have a little...

210
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:31,843
I just got these. They're going to
take some getting used to.

211
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,783
Oh my God.

212
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:39,086
What's it like to kiss somebody
with those things?

213
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:43,258
The doctor said it should be fine.

214
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:46,264
But a blow job is
out of the question, right?

215
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:54,341
I was kidding.
That was a joke. I'm sorry.

216
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,806
He didn't want your hardware
getting too close to his software.

217
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,675
It's everybody.

218
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:05,286
I can't open my mouth without
the world thinking I'm a freak.

219
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:09,412
It's like I'm back in Junior High. I was
lucky I got out alive the first time.

220
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:13,083
Think of it as mouth jewelry.
Your tooth bracelet.

221
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:15,161
I'm never dating again.

222
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,266
You are. If the guy's worth dating
he won't care about your braces.

223
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:22,130
That was so After-School Special
of you.

224
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:25,272
In the After-School Special,
you'd see him across the cafeteria.

225
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,466
He'd smile, and he'd have braces too.

226
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:33,671
But the sick thing is, I would never
date a guy with braces. Even now.

227
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:36,942
Are you kidding me?
Don't you think that's childish?

228
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:40,246
- More lemonade, Carrie?
- Yes, please, Mrs. Adams.

229
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:44,483
How about some nice,
homemade Toll House cookies?

230
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,593
Yes, please, Mrs. Adams.

231
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:51,789
On closer inspection,
living with the parents wasn't so bad.

232
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:55,129
It was like having servants
you didn't have to pay.

233
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:58,033
Oh, and Carrie,
can you stay for dinner?

234
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:06,113
Faced with having hydraulic
cylinders placed in his shaft,

235
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:09,546
Trey decided to pursue
the less physically demanding option

236
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:13,847
of counseling with a therapist
he'd found through his college alumni.

237
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:19,324
I sense you're both having difficulty
verbalizing your sexual issues.

238
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,764
With some clients it often helps

239
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:29,927
to create your own non-threatening
language with which to talk about sex.

240
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,369
I'm not sure that I understand.

241
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:41,037
One client rather whimsically dubbed
his anus The Chocolate Starfish.

242
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:43,343
Are you sure you went to Yale?

243
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:49,514
Charlotte, if you could
rename your vagina,

244
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:55,721
something non-sexual, something that
didn't feel threatening to you or Trey,

245
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:57,489
what would you call it?

246
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:01,390
Rebecca.

247
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,095
Rebecca? Why on earth would you...

248
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:08,800
It sounds nice,
and I've always liked the name.

249
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,944
Now you name yours.

250
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:15,708
- This is preposterous.
- Something positive.

251
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:22,753
Trey loves to sail. Don't you, Trey?

252
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:24,949
I do love to sail.

253
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:28,061
How about something like Canoe?

254
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:29,355
Canoe?

255
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:35,828
- Canoe doesn't go with Rebecca.
- What then?

256
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,097
How about...

257
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,767
-... Schooner.
- Schooner's good.

258
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:45,276
Rebecca and Schooner.
Schooner's good, isn't it?

259
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:51,407
It's very good.
This is a wonderful beginning.

260
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:55,956
There's still a lot of work ahead,
some here and some at home.

261
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,957
Tonight, as homework,

262
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:04,121
I want you to lie down together,
side by side, without touching,

263
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:08,793
and share a sexual fantasy.

264
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,499
I'm a fairy princess in a forest.

265
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,404
I'm riding on a unicorn.

266
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:20,742
Suddenly I see a pirate in buckskins.

267
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:23,816
A prince in disguise.

268
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:26,317
That's when you pull me
off my unicorn.

269
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:29,388
You tear away
my gossamer petticoats,

270
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:33,584
and you put your Schooner
deep inside my Rebecca.

271
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:39,690
Nowyou. Where are you?

272
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,833
I'm in hell.

273
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:46,771
I'm sorry, Charlotte. I can't do this.

274
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:52,311
- I'm a respected surgeon. I can't.
- Yes, you can. I knowyou can.

275
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:57,282
We've dealt with this for weeks.
I'm not that sexual a person.

276
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:01,285
But we love each other and...

277
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:04,721
we're married now.

278
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:07,087
Rebecca and Schooner
belong together.

279
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,128
They need each other. Please.

280
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:12,198
You are a fairy princess.

281
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:16,167
I don't deserve you. I'm sorry.

282
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:18,066
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:31,675
That night, Wade and I
had our first sleep-over, at my place.

284
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:34,788
I finally figured out what made
Power Lad so powerful.

285
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:39,689
He had the soul of a teenage boy
in the body of a very grown-up man.

286
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,920
The machine will get it.

287
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:44,189
'Hi. Leave a message. '

288
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:50,201
'Hi, Carrie.
This is Mrs. Adams, Wade's mother.

289
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:51,702
'How are you?'

290
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:54,307
- Oh, my God.
- 'Sorry to bother you. '

291
00:19:54,475 --> 00:20:00,414
'We never heard from Wade about
whether he fed the dog his medicine.

292
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:04,347
'Wade's father
was just about to give it to the dog,

293
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,149
'but if he's already had it,
that would be bad.

294
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:12,987
'If you speak to Wade, please tell him,

295
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,790
'I won't go to bed
until I hear from him. '

296
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:20,195
Yes, Mom,
I gave the dog his medicine.

297
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,597
No, Mom, I'm not mad, I just...

298
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:26,569
I told you not to call me here.

299
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,599
Don't call me here.

300
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,771
I love you, too.

301
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,745
- She wants to talk to you.
- What?

302
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:50,722
Hi, Mrs. Adams. How are you?

303
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:54,925
Several blocks south,
Charlotte's night was interrupted too -

304
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:58,436
by odd noises coming
from her bathroom.

305
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,852
Charlotte felt terrible.
She hadn't meant to make Trey cry.

306
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:22,591
Honey?

307
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:50,189
- He said he wasn't a sexual person.
- It wasn't sexual.

308
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,791
It was tension release.
It helps me sleep.

309
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,761
I understand.
This may be difficult, Trey,

310
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:04,303
but I want you to tell me specifically
which magazine you were using.

311
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,239
"Juggs".

312
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:12,436
All right. We can try and see this
as a positive thing.

313
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:15,707
How? How is this a positive thing?

314
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:22,812
Trey was masturbating to Juggs.
At least we know he isn't gay.

315
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,255
Excuse me,
what exactly is the problem here?

316
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:30,490
It was tension release,
it had nothing to do with my wife.

317
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:33,600
Interesting choice of words, Trey.

318
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:36,532
Maybe that's the problem.

319
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:42,734
We have to find a way to integrate
your wife into your sexual routine.

320
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,312
How are we supposed to do that?

321
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,507
Charlotte had no idea.

322
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:54,383
She wished they were 13, before sex
had made everything so complicated.

323
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:59,993
When holding hands and a kiss
would have been all she needed.

324
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:03,858
To pierce the corporate veil,
the courts look at five factors -

325
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:07,262
whether the subsidiary
is wholly-owned or...

326
00:23:09,036 --> 00:23:12,369
The 13-year-old girl inside Miranda
wanted to disappear,

327
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,341
but the 34-year-old partner in this firm
decided she wasn't going anywhere.

328
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:22,142
You think I'm funny? You think
it's hilarious that I have braces?

329
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:25,114
Let's take a moment
and have a good laugh.

330
00:23:25,286 --> 00:23:29,279
Let's get it out of our systems
so we can work like adults.

331
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:32,517
We were laughing
at the typo on page three.

332
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:40,693
Miranda decided that TMJ was less
painful than a second adolescence.

333
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:43,530
The next day,
she had her braces removed

334
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:46,229
and resumed her life
as a 34-year-old tongue-thruster.

335
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,375
Trey resumed his own brand
of thrusting

336
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:53,241
and discovered that tension release
could be a turn-on.

337
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:07,156
Charlotte discovered a way
to include herself in Trey's sex life.

338
00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:14,765
And she figured out what to do with
those proofs not suitable for framing.

339
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:18,463
The following weekend
at the Brier Bar Mitzvah party...

340
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:23,804
I'm not sure if I have your name.
Let's see, Goldman, Goldstein...

341
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:25,775
I don't see it.

342
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:28,575
I'm sure I'm on the list.

343
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:45,128
I can't believe you still have
actual albums.

344
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:50,236
Oh my God, Styx. I love Styx.

345
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:54,773
- I had this album.
- I loved "Renegade". Hated "Babe".

346
00:24:57,011 --> 00:25:01,414
- How do you have this?
- Are you kidding? This is a classic.

347
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:06,577
This song is me driving my parents'
Oldsmobile without them knowing.

348
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:09,484
- You knowwhat would go with this?
- Roller skates?

349
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,682
No.

350
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:13,258
Canadian super grass.

351
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:16,555
Six times stronger than pot
and 400 bucks an ounce.

352
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:22,465
It was obvious Wade was in no hurry
to save up for his own apartment.

353
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:26,403
- And what is that?
- My bong. I made it.

354
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:31,773
- At Camp Takatoka.
- I'm sorry, Camp Takatoka?

355
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:37,716
I hadn't smoked pot out of a bong
since my eighth-grade boyfriend

356
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:42,016
made one out of tin foil, a BIC pen,
and a bottle of Pepsi Light.

357
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:45,352
I didn't even know
if I'd remember how.

358
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:49,895
Turns out it was like riding a bike...
a ten speed.

359
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,899
Back at the Bar Mitzvah bash,

360
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:57,333
Samantha heard some girl-talk
not suitable for little ladies.

361
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:00,906
I'm gonna fuck at least three of those
NSYNC guys after the after party.

362
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:02,906
The other two are gay.

363
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:06,979
I'd fuck them and their gay boyfriends.

364
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:10,149
Aren't you a little young
for that kind of talk?

365
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:15,046
I'm serious. You have
your whole lives to talk that way.

366
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:20,956
Enjoy being children, at least
until you turn 15, and start having sex.

367
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:24,996
- I've given blow jobs since twelve.
- Really?

368
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,863
- It's the only way guys will like you.
- That isn't true.

369
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:31,368
Talk to the hand, grandma.

370
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:36,066
Samantha had resented Jenny Brier
because of everything she had.

371
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:38,609
But then she realized,
she'd had something

372
00:26:38,746 --> 00:26:42,409
that no amount of money could buy -
a childhood.

373
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:46,383
Suddenly, the Dairy Queen
wasn't looking so bad.

374
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:56,192
I'm thirsty.

375
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:59,355
There's bong water.

376
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,866
Bong water!

377
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,543
Hold this.

378
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:31,359
What are you doing? That's wet.

379
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:40,101
Attack of the spicy chicken wings.

380
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:44,602
Shit!

381
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:48,508
That looks like my parents' car.

382
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,844
Oh, shit.

383
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:58,653
- Shit, shit, shit.
- It's OK.

384
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:02,023
My parents said,
if they caught me smoking pot again,

385
00:28:02,196 --> 00:28:05,290
- I'd have to sleep in the store.
- Wait.

386
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:06,524
What?

387
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,964
If they see billions of chicken wings,

388
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:12,229
they're gonna know...

389
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:16,501
...we've been smoking pot.

390
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:20,738
Fuck the chicken wings.
Where did we put the fucking pot?

391
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:27,246
You're home. Early.

392
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:32,719
Is that marijuana I smell?

393
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:37,120
- No, ma'am.
- God, no.

394
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,331
Then what is this?

395
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:48,074
We told you, if you ever brought
marijuana into this house again...

396
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:49,801
Carrie brought it.

397
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:54,437
I couldn't believe it. Power Lad
would never have ratted me out.

398
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:58,608
Is that true, Carrie? Did you
bring marijuana into this house?

399
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,121
There comes a time when you have to
take responsibility for yourself.

400
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:08,251
A time when I, like Jenny Brier,
had to stand up and say to the world,

401
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:10,363
"Today, I am a woman. "

402
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:15,628
Yes, Mrs. Adams, I brought
the marijuana into the house.

403
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:19,870
And I'm taking it with me when I go.

404
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:29,608
Oh, baby!

405
00:29:31,852 --> 00:29:33,046
There she is.

406
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:37,816
In the end, I decided
I was definitely 34 going on 35,

407
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:41,018
but in a city like New York
with its pace and pressures,

408
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:43,891
sometimes it's important
to have a 13-year-old moment,

409
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,830
to remember a simpler time when
the best thing in life was hanging out,

410
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:54,134
listening to records, and having fun
with friends - in your own apartment.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
