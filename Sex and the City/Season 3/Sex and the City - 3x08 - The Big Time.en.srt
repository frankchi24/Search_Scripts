1
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,959
Manhattan is a place

2
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,068
you can get anything anytime.

3
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,061
cabs at 2:00 am.

4
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,676
chinese food at 3:00.

5
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:09,615
But you can't get your dry-cleaning.

6
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:23,430
charlotte was spending
her time with Trey,

7
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:25,499
a doctor from family money

8
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,261
who had it all.

9
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:30,396
All, but all of charlotte.

10
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,976
Apparently Trey was one New Yorker

11
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,943
not getting everything anytime.

12
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:43,651
Trey is so thoughtful.

13
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:45,685
I wasn't feeling well last night...

14
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,448
so he took me for some soup

15
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:49,716
on 7th street and then we went to 2nd.

16
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:50,825
Avenue?

17
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:53,085
Base.

18
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:56,129
Then did your physics homework with you?

19
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,129
No, I wanna take it slow.

20
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,131
He could be the one.

21
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:02,930
You've only known him for two weeks.

22
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,039
You can know his e-mail address,

23
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:07,141
but not that he's the one.

24
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:11,143
I just know. And it's really hard,
because he's very sexy.

25
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:14,305
But I don't want to
ruin it by having sex too early.

26
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:17,009
oh, so you're everything-but-girl.

27
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:20,986
I like to think of it as...
kissing with extras.

28
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:22,647
Howvery ninth grade of you.

29
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:27,922
I read that if you don't have sex
for a year you can be revirginized.

30
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,091
And probably quite frisky.

31
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:35,636
But isn't it great? You can erase
your sexual past and start again.

32
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:39,332
Who wants their virginity back?
It was bad enough the first time.

33
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:41,601
How old were you?

34
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,441
Eleventh grade. Seth Bateman.

35
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:48,341
His smelly rec room.

36
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:51,475
Half a joint, three thrusts, finito.

37
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:55,452
And ps, it was on the ping-pong table.

38
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:01,955
Meanwhile, I was doing
everything plus with Aidan.

39
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:03,894
I couldn't get out of bed with him.

40
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:08,298
My bed was our restaurant,
our entertainment, our little New York.

41
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,370
open 24 hours.

42
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:20,711
When will they send
a search party for us?

43
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,650
- I guess spring thaw.
- That's an awful long time, my friend.

44
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,587
Downtown another New Yorker
was enjoying her full life.

45
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,097
Samantha had a new apartment
in the ultra chic Meatpacking District

46
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,794
and a new admirer.

47
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:44,462
Well, there goes the neighborhood.

48
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,671
Len Schneider, 4A.

49
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:51,173
- I collect art.
- Samantha Jones, 2D.

50
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:55,750
- I guess you collect compliments.
- oh, Len. Stop.

51
00:03:55,884 --> 00:04:00,480
Really, Len. Stop.
If you'll excuse me.

52
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:04,388
Listen, I would love to have you
come up to my place tonight.

53
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:07,324
I make a mean wine spritzer.

54
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:10,090
I don't think so. Sorry.

55
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:13,531
Samantha said sorry
but what she really meant was...

56
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,465
Since when is it acceptable

57
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,573
for over-the-hill losers to ask out
hot women like her?

58
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,642
I'm keeping you
on neighborhood watch.

59
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:27,874
And just when Samantha thought
her day couldn't get any worse...

60
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:31,878
This is a catalogue
for pre-menopausal women.

61
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,716
"New Transitions. "
Nice name.

62
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:38,485
Why don't they call it what it is?
J.crewfor women who are drying up.

63
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:41,755
FYl, I'm not transitioning.
I'm happening.

64
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,592
You're on the wrong mailing list.

65
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:47,099
I shouldn't have signed up for that
"Mirabella" trial subscription.

66
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:51,763
I bought a back pillow on line and
ended up with catalogues for trusses.

67
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:55,434
- You got a back pillow?
- At I'm getting old. com.

68
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:59,570
Maybe I could interest you
in vaginal lubrication suppositories?

69
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,716
Listen: "Ten years before menopause
you may have symptoms including:

70
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,255
"all month long PMS,

71
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:15,887
"fluid retention, insomnia, depression,
hot flushes or irregular periods. "

72
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:19,990
But people give up their seats
for you on the bus.

73
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:22,831
oh, my God! vagina weights.

74
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,962
My vagina waits for no man.

75
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:29,270
- Look. The Kegel Master.
- What's a kegel muscle?

76
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:32,608
- It helps you sit tight.
- And I have one?

77
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:37,480
- You don't do your exercises.
- What exercises?

78
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:42,022
You have to tighten
and release it for ten minutes a day.

79
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:47,424
Kegel exercises...
I'm doing mine right now.

80
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:49,325
Man, she's good.

81
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:51,989
Well, I can't wait for menopause.

82
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,761
It will be freeing not to have periods.

83
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:57,371
I can't wait till flow stops
coming to town.

84
00:05:57,505 --> 00:06:00,474
- No one calls it flow.
- My grandmother did.

85
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,838
No more mind-numbing cramps.

86
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:06,345
No kidding.
I've got mine right now. Big time.

87
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:09,882
- I hear that, sister.
- My God, I have my period too.

88
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:14,387
We're all synched up.
I've heard about that happening.

89
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:19,291
What?
I'll get mine in a few days.

90
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:23,625
If Samantha was running late,
I was running even later.

91
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,734
The "Gab Magazine" party
was in an hour

92
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:29,234
and my dress was at the cleaners.

93
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:34,038
oh, please, sir!

94
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,472
Shit.

95
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,979
Apparently my fabulous party dress
would be staying in for the evening.

96
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:50,382
Miranda and Steve decided
instead of staying in, they'd go out.

97
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:55,154
Since when did it become appropriate
to bring babies to restaurants?

98
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,820
oh, come on. He's cute.

99
00:06:56,965 --> 00:07:00,059
Yeah. God invented baby-sitters
for a reason.

100
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:05,565
I don't think it's so bad.
It's nice to have babies around.

101
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:09,837
Don't get me wrong.
I love babies, but not with my soup.

102
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:13,937
oh, my God.
Look at you. You're a mess!

103
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,915
- We should do it. Have a baby.
- Yeah, right.

104
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:28,724
I'm serious. We'd have a cute baby,
not one that looks like Khrushchev.

105
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:32,094
- We wouldn't have to get married.
- You're serious?

106
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,133
Yes. The timing is perfect.

107
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:39,639
The timing is not perfect. We've only
been living together for two months.

108
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:44,973
It's way too quick. We cannot
have a baby. You're insane.

109
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:53,109
come on.
I want a baby. It'd be fun.

110
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:58,214
It's not like owning a foosball table.
Do you know how much work it is?

111
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,851
Yeah, I know. But I can
hang out with him during the day.

112
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:05,454
Watch "Sesame Street" while you're
at work, then I go to work at the bar.

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,264
And I'd be up all night with the baby,
alone and getting no sleep,

114
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:16,071
then have to get up the next day
and work 14 hours to make partner

115
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:20,170
so I can afford the apartment
you're watching "Sesame Street" in.

116
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:24,274
Let's hope the baby inherits
my positive attitude.

117
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:28,514
can we please talk
about something else?

118
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,783
No problem.

119
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:38,125
While Miranda was left
contemplating diapers...

120
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:42,066
I was contemplating
McQueen versus Gucci.

121
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:47,038
It's your last chance to attend
a fabulous party with a fabulous girl.

122
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:50,633
- It's a party on a boat?
- correction: fancy boat.

123
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:54,839
And ps, the fabulous girl
is rumored to be easy.

124
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:58,214
- What's the party for?
- This new magazine, "Gab".

125
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:01,481
- Have you read it?
- No, I want the celebrity sightings.

126
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:04,319
I'd be stuck on this boat
with all these celebs.

127
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,654
And celebrity hangers-on.

128
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:10,696
It's tempting, but is it oK
if I stay on dry land?

129
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:15,098
- of course.
- Will you still be easy later?

130
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,864
- Is that a proposition?
- Bon voyage-

131
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,539
Bye.

132
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,819
The "Gab" party was everything
they promised and more.

133
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:44,022
Regis Philbin, Madonna and
"New Yorker" ex-editors were there.

134
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:47,726
- Hey, thanks.
- So, where was I?

135
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:51,669
Unfortunately,
Trey was doing most of the gabbing.

136
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:54,866
- The part about the birthday present.
- That's right.

137
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:58,445
My mother gives me this awful
machine for sorting change...

138
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:00,680
He has a lot of change.

139
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,181
...for my birthday.
I lied to her and said I loved it.

140
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:06,845
I jumped into a cab
and drove that thing right back.

141
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:11,620
So there I was, on...
40th and Broadway.

142
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,253
- I hear a woman yell like a hyena.
- I did not!

143
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:21,528
The cab stops. I almost hit my head
on that plastic partition. I got out...

144
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:24,103
He told him to stop the meter.

145
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:28,437
And there was charlotte, lying on
the street. That's how we met.

146
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,567
And that's how we met.

147
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:35,710
- That's very sweet.
- oh, and the cabbie got mad.

148
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,513
- It's oK, cos I remember.
- Anyway, it was fate.

149
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:43,055
If my mother didn't give me bad gifts

150
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:46,752
this wonderful gift
would never have come into my life.

151
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:50,193
I'd heard the story
at least three times.

152
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:54,631
Another minute of Trey and we would
be in a man overboard situation.

153
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,865
- Hey, I'm gonna go to hit the buffet.
- oK.

154
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,804
Not too hard.

155
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:07,242
As I walked away, I realised I hadn't
seen charlotte that happy in years

156
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:11,045
and with a man
she had known for five minutes.

157
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:14,546
And just when I thought I was safe...

158
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,590
- Hello.
- oh, hi.

159
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,726
cheese.

160
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,485
Hello.

161
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:24,928
...I ran into the man
I'd been happy with for five minutes.

162
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:29,935
- Right. Well, hi.
- I thought I might see you here.

163
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:32,701
You did?

164
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,746
- Where's Natasha?
- She missed the boat.

165
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,011
very crowded.

167
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:47,881
Well, I gotta...

168
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:51,387
Dominick Dunne is holding my place
in the bathroom line.

169
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:57,930
Big and I, trapped together on a boat
without dates.

170
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,967
We were two miles offshore.
There was no way off.

171
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:05,629
children and women
with emotional baggage first.

172
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:09,607
carrie. Look what Trey gave me.
Isn't it beautiful?

173
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:13,271
Wow. cartier.

174
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:17,316
It was a surprise. He said
the last fewweeks have been special.

175
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,649
And that he's smitten.
Look, it's inscribed.

176
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:27,492
Let's see. "To charlotte.
It's about time I met you. "

177
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:29,596
Sweetie, that's great.

178
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:32,222
- When does this boat dock?
- Around 10.:00.

179
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,665
- What time is it?
- It's not set yet.

180
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:39,330
- It's pretty.
- Thanks. I better get back to Trey.

181
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:42,602
I think this is it, carrie.
I can feel it.

182
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:47,679
one woman's "Titanic"
is another woman's "Love Boat".

183
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,552
- Boo.
- Jesus.

184
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:00,857
So what was that back there?

185
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:04,089
I... I don't know.

186
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:09,602
- can't we have a conversation?
- I don't know. can we?

187
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:14,732
Around Brooklyn
there's gonna be a mutiny. Pass it on.

188
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,839
- What a spiffy opener.
- I try.

189
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,815
So what are you? Are you...

190
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:29,513
- Are you seeing anyone?
- Yeah, I am.

191
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,852
He's great.
He's perfect, actually.

192
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,659
Where is he, Mr Perfect?

193
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:41,132
He's home. I didn't wanna subject him
to the slimy media leeches.

194
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,600
Good idea.

195
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:44,500
Present company excluded.

196
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,735
- That's some outfit, kid.
- Really? Do you think so?

197
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:54,780
If you like this, you'll love the one
being held hostage on 74th and Lex.

198
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,812
It's good to see you.

199
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:08,790
The next morning I recovered
from my see-Big sickness,

200
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,731
while downtown, Samantha realised
maybe her ship had sailed.

201
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,964
She was five days late.

202
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:20,835
Later we did brunch and bathroom
at Time cafe.

203
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,479
- I'm in love with him.
- You're not in love with him.

204
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:28,377
You're in love with
the expensive watch he gave you.

205
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:33,613
- Do you have another?
- I'm not Tampax central. Buy them.

206
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:37,485
I have them at home. But they
won't fit in my Kate Spade purse.

207
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,685
Wow, Kate must have a tiny vagina.

208
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:44,890
The watch is a sign
that he's in love with me too.

209
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:49,696
- He's just in blue ball hell.
- Sometimes you just know.

210
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,805
We're the right match. It's fate.

211
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:54,840
It's not fate.
His light is on. That's all.

212
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,944
- What light?
- Men are like cabs.

213
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,571
When they're available,
their light goes on.

214
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:06,949
They wake up one day, decide
to settle down, and turn their light on.

215
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:11,286
The next woman they pick up
is the one they'll marry. It's not fate.

216
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:16,294
- It's dumb luck.
- I can't believe that love is random.

217
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,524
You gotta get them
when their light's on.

218
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,898
- Men I meet are flashing yellows.
- or off duty.

219
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:26,268
They can drive around for years
and not be available.

220
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,375
They shouldn't be allowed
to get behind the wheel!

221
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:30,534
Most men don't stay lit long
before they take the plunge

222
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:34,876
versus most women who
have been lit pretty much since birth.

223
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:38,281
That was my last tampon.
Are you packing?

224
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:42,355
No, I don't have a tampon and
probably will never need one again.

225
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:47,457
- A "no" is good enough.
- I haven't had my period in 35 days.

226
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:51,588
- Are you...?
- No, I'm not pregnant. I'm...

227
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:56,169
- I'm drying up.
- come on. You're overreacting.

228
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,702
- It was a stupid catalogue.
- I'm day-old bread. My time is up.

229
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,638
Enjoy your flows.

230
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:06,907
For someone with no period
you've got a mean case of PMS.

231
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:10,984
You have years of miserable cramps
ahead of you.

232
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:12,744
Ladies...

233
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,446
What I'm about to tell you...

234
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:18,650
may come as a shock.

235
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:26,856
I'm a little...

236
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:32,499
older than you.

237
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:39,906
That night I couldn't stop thinking
about time.

238
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,774
Was every second of our lives
controlled by fate?

239
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:46,318
or is life a series
of random occurrences?

240
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:50,550
If I wasn't always ten minutes late,
would my life be totally different?

241
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:55,128
Would I never run into Big? Would
there ever be a good time to see him?

242
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,753
Was Miranda right?

243
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,297
Is timing everything?

244
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:17,441
could you turn that down?
I'm working.

245
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:26,323
oK, not low enough.

246
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,159
You're gonna have to get used
to the noise with a baby around.

247
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:37,533
Look. I've been thinking
about this baby thing.

248
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:39,829
We're not in a great place right now.

249
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:43,466
can we have this conversation
without "Scooby Doo"?

250
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:47,479
It's the one where they find the ghost
in the salt mine.

251
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:53,084
- I'm serious. Turn off the cartoons.
- But what about the ghost?

252
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,884
- You knowwhat? Forget it.
- Miranda.

253
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:01,483
Then Miranda realised she may have
already had a baby in her house.

254
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,128
I wanna shelve
this baby thing for a while.

255
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,393
oK, you got it.

256
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:10,066
Put a coaster under that glass

257
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,832
and turn off the lights
before you come to bed.

258
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:20,778
We haven't had sex in over a week
and he wants a baby.

259
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:23,110
What's wrong with this picture?

260
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,276
You can always go
the Immaculate conception route.

261
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:29,988
Seriously, we're in this shitty place.

262
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:33,958
We fight and I'm working long hours
for this partner thing.

263
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:39,294
And he's using a baby as a Band-Aid
for everything that's wrong with us.

264
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:42,800
- What is wrong with you guys?
- I don't know.

265
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:47,431
It's like he's a kid
and I end up nagging him all the time.

266
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:51,409
I'm mean mommy and no one
wants to fuck mean mommy.

267
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:52,910
oh, I believe you.

268
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:58,883
Maybe I'm sabotaging the relationship
so I don't have to actually be happy.

269
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,646
Maybe the problem is me.

270
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:03,882
This baby is gonna need
a lot of therapy.

271
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,357
- There is no baby!
- oK, mean mommy.

272
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:12,459
But I do want one eventually
and my clock is running out.

273
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,160
I've only got a million viable eggs left.

274
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:19,500
300 of which we just killed
with those martinis at lunch.

275
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:23,109
That night, Samantha got drunk.

276
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:27,044
She had lost her spirit and no pill
in the catalogue could correct that.

277
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,809
And so she accepted a date with Len.

278
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,019
After all, day-old bread
needed to stick together.

279
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:36,180
- Ever been in a cadillac Eldorado?
- No.

280
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:41,192
oh, those babies are smooth.
They have buttons for everything.

281
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:46,197
There's even a button to adjust
your lumbar. Great for my hip.

282
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:49,429
Did I tell you I have an artificial hip?

283
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,869
- No.
- Hard to believe, baby?

284
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,168
Samantha couldn't listen
to one more minute of Len.

285
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:03,306
So she slept with him
and his hip to shut him up.

286
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,418
Yeah, baby.

287
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:08,246
Give it to daddy.

288
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:19,394
- oh, Jesus.
- What.

289
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,160
Baby, either you're a virgin
or flow just came to town.

290
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:29,301
- My period?
- There's blood everywhere.

291
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:32,276
oh, my God. That is so...

292
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:37,276
These sheets are two grand a set.

293
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:42,253
I'm sorry, really very sorry.

294
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:46,756
Samantha said sorry.
What she really meant was...

295
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:51,763
there are more young studs in this
pre-pre-menopausal woman's future.

296
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:54,925
This is embarrassing. I should go.

297
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:57,437
Thanks for dinner.

298
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:03,469
The next day, Miranda was putting in
time and a half at her firm when...

299
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:07,814
- Miranda Hobbes.
- Hey.

300
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:10,439
I'm busy and can't talk.

301
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,178
Meet me in half an hour
at 56th and 3rd, oK?

302
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,017
- I can't, I got a meeting at 4.:00.
- come on, it will help.

303
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,853
- Please.
- oK.

304
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:27,693
- This is not gonna happen.
- come on. Look at them.

305
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:29,860
How exactly would this help us?

306
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:32,598
Maybe we're not ready for a baby.

307
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,404
- This could be a test run.
- Who would take care of the test run?

308
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:38,636
Me.

309
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:47,416
Please, buyer lady.
Take me home and love me.

310
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,954
- You're insane.
- Not in front of the puppy!

311
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,456
Miranda had been backed
into a corner.

312
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:56,188
Even though she was surrounded
by bitches, she didn't wanna be one.

313
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,922
oK.

314
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:01,933
charlotte and Trey
were performing their usual duet.

315
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,594
...and then I got out and found you.

316
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:07,639
oh, really? I found you.

317
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:15,075
- I think I should come in.
- No, sweetie.

318
00:22:15,215 --> 00:22:20,084
I have an early meeting. But thanks,
I had a lovely time. Really.

319
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,154
Me too.

320
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:27,754
- Good night.
- Good night.

321
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:45,875
- You're very persistent.
- I wanna tell you something.

322
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:49,779
- I love you, charlotte.
- You do?

323
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:54,553
- Yeah.
- I love you too.

324
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:59,758
That night, charlotte
got everything she wanted.

325
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:02,657
Trey got a hand job.

326
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:06,892
And at 3:00 am Miranda
was getting nothing but aggravated.

327
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:10,093
Please, go to sleep.

328
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:13,365
Please, I beg you.
Here. Look.

329
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:19,377
This is supposed to be your mom's
heart beating or... something.

330
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:27,482
- Are you happy?
- Not really.

331
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:30,656
We get this puppy.
I'm the only one taking care of it.

332
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:34,227
I've been up all night. You're asleep.
This was a huge mistake.

333
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:36,591
come on, relax. It will be fine.

334
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,721
For you, because
you're not doing anything.

335
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:41,460
He's just getting used to us.

336
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:45,863
Poochie, poochie, puppy boy.

337
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:51,834
Give mommy a kiss.

338
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:57,117
This is it.
I'm so sick of you being the kid here.

339
00:23:57,251 --> 00:24:02,314
I cannot be in charge all the time.
We're supposed to be equals.

340
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:05,425
You think we can have a baby?
We can't even have a puppy together.

341
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,051
- We're going through a rough patch.
- This isn't a patch.

342
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:12,563
This is it. All the time.
And it's not good.

343
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:18,532
Great. So you're just
gonna give up on us, just like that?

344
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,469
Not just like that.

345
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:24,771
I have been trying not to give up
on us for a long time.

346
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:28,875
- That's nice.
- I'm just being honest.

347
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:32,144
Then Miranda realised something.

348
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:35,255
All this time,
she thought the problem was her.

349
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,687
It wasn't. It was them.

350
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:40,885
And there was never a good time
to say what she had to say.

351
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:45,556
- This isn't gonna work, Steve.
- There's good stuff, here.

352
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,599
Not enough.

353
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:52,171
A baby would've been a quick fix
for something that can't be fixed.

354
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:58,203
- Because you don't want it to work.
- That's so unfair.

355
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:04,144
- I don't wanna fight you anymore.
- Do you think I do?

356
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:06,214
I don't know.

357
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,086
Steve...

358
00:25:11,992 --> 00:25:14,222
I really tried.

359
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:18,290
That night, Miranda lost her partner.

360
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:22,358
The next day, she got a new one.

361
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:26,003
Fifteen of them.

362
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,415
Meanwhile,
I was still enjoying my one.

363
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:42,855
Do you wanna have a sleepover?

364
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,123
Let me set the timer.

365
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:52,827
I didn't know about Aidan
but my light was definitely on.

366
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,295
You have one new message.

367
00:25:56,837 --> 00:25:58,202
Hey, carrie, I'm...

368
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:02,331
I knewwho it was. I couldn't stop Big
coming back into my life.

369
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:05,809
But I could stop him
from coming out of my machine.

370
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:09,905
Hey, you're out of filters.
I'm gonna run down to the Korean.

371
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:20,618
- Hey...
- Yeah?

372
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:24,821
You make me really happy.

373
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,324
- See you in a bit.
- oK.

374
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:38,705
oh, that was very fast.

375
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,219
- What are you doing here?
- Didn't you get my message?

376
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,150
No, I paused it.

377
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:52,156
- What are you doing here?
- That was him, wasn't it?

378
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:56,251
- The perfect guy.
- Yes and he's coming back, so...

379
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,327
Please.

380
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:02,101
What do you want?

381
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:08,363
I don't know.

382
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:13,702
No, go home to your wife.

383
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:18,585
Go.

384
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,814
I'm so fucked up.

385
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,754
I had no idea
what else Big was gonna say.

386
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,765
And I'm not sure
what bugged me more.

387
00:27:36,903 --> 00:27:39,565
That I didn't know or that I cared.

388
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:45,007
Hey, carrie.
I'm here on your corner.

389
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:47,170
I knowyou're home. Pick up.

390
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:53,378
Jesus.

391
00:27:54,187 --> 00:27:57,748
Well, I miss you.

392
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:03,956
I can't fucking stop thinking
about you. There you have it.

393
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:09,529
There it was.
Exactly what I had needed to hear...

394
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,365
a year too late.

395
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:13,666
I should have been happy,
but I wasn't.

396
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:17,368
It was the absolute worst timing of all.

397
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:21,712
Ten minutes later,
Aidan still hadn't come back.

398
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:24,408
Suddenly my life was all about timing.

399
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:27,884
All the right things
said at all the wrong times.

400
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:30,512
My past coming back way too fast.

401
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:35,626
And my future
taking way too long to come home.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
