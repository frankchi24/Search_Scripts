1
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:50,858
one reason Why people still risk

2
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,160
the possible horror of a first date,

3
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:57,567
is the possible magic of
the good-night kiss at the front door.

4
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,573
I had a great time.

5
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:02,040
so did I.

6
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,338
The world slows down for a second

7
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:09,382
as some people take that hopeful lean
into a possible future together.

8
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:24,563
All around my mouth.

9
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:27,565
HoW do you think I felt?

10
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:29,636
His tongue licked my teeth.

11
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:32,036
Did he Wanna fuck you or floss you?

12
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:34,266
Bad kissers are the worst.

13
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:37,071
The worst. The top of the worst.

14
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,772
He has sWeet lips.
I thought he,d be a good kisser.

15
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,440
You can never tell. They look normal.

16
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:45,485
Until their pointy tongue
darts in and out.

17
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,613
Pointy tongue, the Worst of the Worst.

18
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:51,122
The Worst is When they expect you

19
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,727
to do the Work.

20
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,829
Their tongue lays in your mouth

21
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,430
like a clam.

22
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,327
clam-mouth. That,s the Worst.

23
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:03,096
I,d say... Get it out, put it in a cab
and take its lazy ass home....

24
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:06,298
- You,d dump a guy for a bad kiss?
- You have to.

25
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:10,105
If their tongue just lays there,
What is their dick gonna do?

26
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,610
point taken.

27
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:13,772
Maybe We can Work on it.

28
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,918
A bad kisser is a non-negotiable.

29
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:20,283
I'm not dumping Brad because of that.

30
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,083
Then change his name

31
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:24,021
from Brad to Bad.

32
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:27,026
I like him. well, I did until...

33
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:29,892
Until his tongue
Was in your stomach?

34
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:34,892
can you ladies hold it doWn?
This is a respectable restaurant.

35
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,005
Adeena williams Was my neWspaper,s
former food editor.

36
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:40,334
And the chef and oWner of Fusion,

37
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,468
Whose specialty Was a mingling
of trendy food with soul food.

38
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:47,638
Martha steWart meets
Puff Daddy on a plate.

39
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:50,650
poached salmon with okra...

40
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,912
Heaven.

41
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:56,115
This time next year,
okra will be so fashionable.

42
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:01,194
we are leaving.
come and say goodbye.

43
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,859
This is my brother, Who brings me
tons of music industry business.

44
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:10,871
I gotta go, but I,m sending dessert.

45
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,303
- No.
- pecan and praline pie.

46
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,464
Yes!

47
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,947
Didn't we meet at the columbia
Records party for Jennifer Lopez?

48
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:24,711
I don,t think so. My PR firm handled it.
I,m sure I,d have remembered you.

49
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:28,050
I guess I just saWyou.
chivon williams, I used to rep for...

50
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:31,715
Tommy Boy Records.
I remember from the guest list.

51
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:36,729
- You,re good.
- samantha Jones, if you need me...

52
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:39,800
for a party.

53
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:46,264
Ladies, I apologize for interrupting.
Have a pleasant evening.

54
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:50,877
could he any be cuter?

55
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,310
Gotta love a fella
Who loves jeWellery.

56
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:57,316
That is one fine-looking man.
I,d like some of that.

57
00:03:57,486 --> 00:04:00,819
- Don't talk like that.
- Like what?

58
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,427
Relax with the liberal reaction.
That's not black talk. It's sex talk.

59
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:11,430
First of all, it isn,t black talk.
It,s African-American talk.

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,730
You shouldn,t be talking like that.
It,s rude and politically incorrect.

61
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:18,532
samantha is rude
and politically incorrect.

62
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,574
- she,s an equal opportunity offender.
- Precisely.

63
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,268
I don't see color. I see conquests.

64
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,505
Talk about affirmative action.

65
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:34,352
The next day I had just settled doWn
with a cup of fresh coffee

66
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:37,856
and a coffee table
full of fashion magazines, When...

67
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:40,392
- who is it?
- Mr Right.

68
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,796
Have you seen
... The NeW York Times... style section?

69
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,127
I can't handle hard news before noon.

70
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:50,260
There,s a beautiful man doWntoWn,
selling furniture. we,re going.

71
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,670
I got a Whole afternoon planned
with Australian... vogue....

72
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:57,676
I,m not gonna drop everything
to go to see some cute guy.

73
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,939
- He,s straight.
- I,ll get my purse.

74
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:04,710
People with nothing better to do
than ogle some craftsman. Pathetic.

75
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:08,879
Look at this place.
Nothing but baguettes and faggots.

76
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:17,331
If you see anything you like, say
you,re a designer. You get a discount.

77
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:22,061
- I got $50 off my end table.
- You,re a classy guy.

78
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,732
His name was Aidan shaw.

79
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:32,744
He Was Warm, masculine and
classic American. Like his furniture.

80
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,849
The dog is overkill.

81
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:37,611
- Go get him.
- Excuse me?

82
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:41,882
He,s perfect for you. I,ll visit you
and the kids at your cabin up state.

83
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,581
we,re staring. Look aWay.

84
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,694
His name Was Marty Mendleson.

85
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:50,798
He Was Warm, stylish and classic gay.
Like his outfit.

86
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,264
He,s a designer.
And single.

87
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:57,872
Go get him. I,ll come visit you
in your cabin up state.

88
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:05,008
Hey, doggie. Hi.

89
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:14,545
Bad doggie. DoWn.

90
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,923
Pete, there you go.

91
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,127
You should get him a cheWtoy.

92
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:26,633
To his credit,
he picks the best-looking ladies.

93
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,168
You can,t imagine hoWflattered I am.

94
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,567
- I'm Aidan.
- I'm humiliated.

95
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,231
I shouldn't let him run loose
in the store.

96
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,869
This is your store?
I had no idea.

97
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:43,950
when I heard the lie come out
of my mouth, I kneW I Was interested.

98
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:51,149
- This is a beautiful chair.
- This is my favorite piece.

99
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:54,160
You say that about every piece, right?

100
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:57,524
Not really.
This leather is about 100 years old.

101
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,136
I stripped it off
an old railroad car seat. Feel this.

102
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,137
- soft?
- I,ll take it.

103
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:13,440
I Wasn,t really in the market
for a leather chair.

104
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:17,244
But I had to have
Whatever it Was I just felt.

105
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:23,982
I,m a designer. carrie BradshaW.
carrie BradshaW Designs.

106
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:31,761
Let,s see. with the designer discount
and dog humiliation factor...

107
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,060
How's that?

108
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:40,672
- How soon can it be delivered?
- End of the week.

109
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:44,710
In NeW York city retail lingo,
that meant... I like you too....

110
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:50,350
where do you Want it delivered
and can I take you out for dinner?

111
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:54,547
will you knock another $10 off?

112
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:59,092
The dog humping aside, it Was one of
those perfect NeW York saturdays.

113
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,660
I'm back!

114
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:04,855
At Miranda,s, steve Was having
an even better saturday.

115
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,695
- Guess What happened? It,s so great!
- what?

116
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,894
You knoW at the Knicks game,

117
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:13,131
somebody makes a half-court shot
for a million dollars?

118
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:18,473
- Kind of, but go ahead.
- Next Tuesday, it,s me.

119
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:22,139
They picked my name from
the contest I entered at sam Goodies.

120
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,908
Great!

121
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:30,046
It,s not great.
A million dollars. It,s fucking great.

122
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:33,751
It is fucking great.

123
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,660
But don,t get your hopes up.
It,s a tough shot, isn,t it?

124
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,996
For other guys,
but they don,t have my moves.

125
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:46,598
The problem is
you don,t knoW hoW good I am.

126
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:49,073
Don,t let these legs fool you.
I,m great.

127
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,109
I like your little legs.

128
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,271
Let,s go to the playground.
I,ll shoWyou.

129
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:57,940
No, please. I believe you.
You,ve got the moves.

130
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,452
I don,t Want no charity.
seeing is believing.

131
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:05,650
Next Week, come to the playground
and Watch me shoot. Promise?

132
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:08,091
promise?

133
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:15,669
- That,s Ralph Lauren paint.
- I,ll buy you more. I,m a millionaire.

134
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:19,870
I have a crush.

135
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,941
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,773
You haven,t had a crush in a While.
Not since Big.

137
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:28,177
Big Wasn,t a crush, he Was a crash.

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,786
His name is Aidan.
And I believe him to be very cute.

139
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:42,188
so cute, I bought a chair I couldn,t
afford just because he made it.

140
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,660
Did he ask you out?

141
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,063
so the chair is a Write-off.

142
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,204
I haven,t had a crush
since sean cassidy.

143
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,361
No Way.

144
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,168
At this age I,d have to say
I,m crush-proof.

145
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:57,277
what about steve?

146
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:02,075
I forgot about my boyfriend.
Is that normal?

147
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,945
You,re asking me?

148
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,781
steve thinks he,s gonna win
a million dollars.

149
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:10,550
- You told me.
- I have to repeat it until I believe it.

150
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,024
It,s totally illogical
and he Wants me to be supportive.

151
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:18,757
It's a half-court shot.
There are Knicks who can't make it.

152
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:25,203
I would support a real dream,
like opening his own bar. This is silly.

153
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,571
Isn,t that What you couples do,
support each other,s silly dreams?

154
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,769
You,re asking me?

155
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:37,107
That Week, chivon invited samantha
to go uptoWn

156
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:39,719
and hear an artist
he Was thinking of signing.

157
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,550
Back in the line, motherfucker.

158
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,925
Although samantha
had been in the club scene for years,

159
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:59,563
she,d never been asked to spread
without being offered a cocktail.

160
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,810
This is DJ oldman.

161
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:10,281
In a matter of minutes, samantha
felt at home in chivon,s World.

162
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:13,319
Hi, guys. I,m samantha.

163
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,792
In a matter of hours, chivon Was
at home in samantha,s home.

164
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,396
Do you like this groove?
It,s the neW kid.

165
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:26,159
It,s so soft.
I thought all rap had a harder edge.

166
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:29,895
They can be hard or soft, like you.

167
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:34,306
You have so much attitude up front.

168
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:38,811
Look at you noW. soft, sWeet...

169
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,709
sWeet, me?

170
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:45,242
who do you think you,re fooling?

171
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:54,887
I don,t usually sleep with men
Who have nicer accessories than me.

172
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:58,294
where did you get
these fabulous earrings?

173
00:11:58,466 --> 00:11:59,763
Tiffany.

174
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,959
where else?

175
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,068
I hope you can sleep in a little.

176
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,007
sleep?

177
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:13,007
samantha rarely asked a man
to stay over,

178
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,015
but she couldn,t resist
having breakfast with his Tiffanies.

179
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:22,355
one reason some people still risk
the possible horror of a first date,

180
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:26,584
is the possible magic of
the good-night kiss at the front door.

181
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:29,525
My dog is obsessed with you.

182
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:33,895
He kept me up talking all night.
... Her leg, man....

183
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,898
I had to say,
... Pete, let her go. It,s over....

184
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,078
I have a confession to make...

185
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:51,742
I,m not a designer. I,m a Writer.

186
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:56,556
what Was that?
Fiction?

187
00:12:56,758 --> 00:13:01,388
I Wanted the discount.
It,s shameful, but true.

188
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:07,134
But don,t Worry,
I only lie about furniture, nothing else.

189
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,067
Are you upset?

190
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:15,068
You smoke?

191
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:18,673
Just a little.

192
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:23,181
when the lie came out of my mouth,
I realised hoW much I liked him.

193
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,376
If it bothers you, I,ll just...

194
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,491
I had a great time.

195
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:47,167
- I can taste that cigarette.
- I,m sorry, I have an Altoid.

196
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:51,141
I think you,re...

197
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:57,114
I totally get it. I have a mint here.
They are curiously strong.

198
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:01,684
- can you just hold that?
- sure.

199
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:06,486
I don,t Wanna be a jerk,
but I can,t date a smoker.

200
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,958
so... Really?

201
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,572
It,s a thing I have.

202
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:23,176
I couldn,t believe What my crush
Was saying. I Was crushed.

203
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:25,539
Later that night, I Wondered...

204
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,308
when did dating become
so dump-friendly?

205
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:31,815
what happened to the time
When a bad kiss or a cigarette

206
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:35,353
or a ridiculous dream
Was part of a person,s portfolio?

207
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:39,084
In today,s dating market,
is it wise to liquidate certain stocks,

208
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:42,559
the first sign they might not perform
as Well as expected?

209
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,722
or are there things
one should try and negotiate?

210
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,836
In relationships,
What are the... deal breakers...?

211
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:55,138
I think it,s really sexy When you
lightly touch your lips to mine.

212
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,370
Never one to trade a stock
before it had matured,

213
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:02,846
a determined and patient charlotte
tried to teach Bad hoW to kiss good.

214
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:05,679
You like that?

215
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:10,446
And I like it When you
slowly open your mouth...

216
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,789
and just tickle my lips
with the tip of your tongue.

217
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:23,970
You like that?

218
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:31,304
with just a little negotiating,
Brad,s stock suddenly began to rise.

219
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,020
stop it!

220
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:45,353
You,re sucking too hard.
And my mouth is up here.

221
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:51,692
- Is there a problem?
- I can't do this. You're a bad kisser.

222
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,925
It,s my thing.

223
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:58,669
where are you going?

224
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,240
DoWntoWn at Marty Mendleson,s,

225
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:05,311
others Were experiencing
a much more successful first kiss.

226
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,505
Let's move it to the bedroom.

227
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,121
These are my dolls.
I,ve been collecting them for years.

228
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,323
I had no idea.

229
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:31,297
This... is the Queen of siam.

230
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:33,801
she,s my favorite.

231
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:37,706
Bisque china face.
she,s a real collector,s item.

232
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:44,542
And this... is Mary, Queen of scots.

233
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:51,618
- Are they all queens?
- The ones from Madame Alexander,s.

234
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,455
Help me clear the bed?

235
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:04,863
No, the southern Belle
sits on the table.

236
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:12,311
was stanford enough of a queen to
sleep with one Who collected queens?

237
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:16,981
UptoWn at Fusion, samantha felt
a bit like a queen herself.

238
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:20,643
Did I tell you
hoW beautiful you look tonight?

239
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:21,982
Thank you.

240
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,853
what,s up, genius?

241
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:30,157
Genius, over-tired ass
is dragging all over this restaurant.

242
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,530
Aunt Alice and her friends are leaving,
if you Want to pay your respects.

243
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:37,762
Favorite aunt. I,ll introduce you.

244
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:43,501
Aunt Alice is out of the door already.
You go and I,ll talk with samantha.

245
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:54,017
HoW is everything?

246
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:57,021
chivon is right, you are a genius.

247
00:17:57,191 --> 00:17:59,125
Thank you.

248
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:04,026
A non-food related question. what,s
going on between you and chivon?

249
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:07,690
- what do you mean?
- You,ve been in here three times.

250
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,429
well, We,re dating. why?

251
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,539
You,re not just fucking?

252
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:17,943
Not that,s any of your business,
but no, We,re not just fucking.

253
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:20,137
we actually really like each other.

254
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:24,077
I don,t Want you seeing my brother.

255
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:26,948
- Excuse me?
- I don't approve.

256
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:29,954
- You don,t knoW me...
- Let,s not get personal.

257
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:34,083
I,m sure you,re a nice person,
but you,re White.

258
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:38,460
I have a problem with my brother
getting serious with a White Woman.

259
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:42,000
To Adeena, samantha,s skin
Was a non-negotiable.

260
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,435
- HoW can you say that?
- That,s hoW I feel.

261
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:50,009
I,m never going to approve and my
approval means a lot to my brother.

262
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:57,117
Just save us the time and trouble
and get out before anybody gets hurt.

263
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:04,418
I'll send over some
Mississippi mud pie.

264
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:10,553
The only place Adeena Was interested
in fusion Was on a plate.

265
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,758
- she can,t dis me just cos I,m White.
- Please tell me you didn,t say dis.

266
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:19,134
Maybe you should stop seeing him.
Race is a big issue.

267
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,468
There is no reason
to bring race into this.

268
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:24,611
chivon is a sWeet man.
we have great sex.

269
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:26,508
He happens to have the biggest...

270
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:29,673
Black cock.
we knoW he has a big black cock.

271
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,479
I Was about to say the biggest heart.

272
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:35,383
But, yes, he does have
a big black cock.

273
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,320
It,s big African-American cock.

274
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:41,792
- Don,t make fun of me. My chin hurts.
- what happened?

275
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,520
He raped my face.
I,m never seeing him again.

276
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:47,691
To charlotte, a black and blue chin
Was a deal breaker.

277
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:51,269
I,m not backing doWn to her.
That,s not Who I am.

278
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:56,274
she shouldn,t sacrifice Who she is
because somebody has a problem.

279
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:00,540
Like me and smoking.
Too bad Aidan had a problem with it.

280
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,183
But you have to accept people
for Who they are.

281
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:06,548
- You choose cigarettes over a guy?
- He,s not that cute.

282
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:08,882
You bought furniture, he Was so cute.

283
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:12,025
For him to dump me
over a little thing like smoking.

284
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:16,721
smoking is not a little thing.
It,s dirty and you,re killing yourself.

285
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:22,928
we hate it. we put up with it cos We
love you. You have a reason to quit.

286
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:26,800
- I don,t like being ganged up on.
- who,s ganging up on you?

287
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:28,909
smoking is a part of Who I am.

288
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:32,945
I,ll quit When I Want to,
not cos a cute guy told me to.

289
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,105
- Right, samantha?
- No.

290
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:41,051
Fighting for chivon is one thing.
Holding on to cigarettes is just Wack.

291
00:20:41,222 --> 00:20:43,247
Tell me she didn,t say... Wack....

292
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,551
It's all total bullshit.

293
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:47,956
what is Wrong with cigarettes?

294
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,393
Nothing, they,re fabulous.

295
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:53,762
It,s not like you have
a hideous doll-collection.

296
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:57,336
You think that,s an overreaction
to a repressed childhood?

297
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:59,939
who cares? It,s freaky.

298
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:06,671
I could overlook his receding hair.
But the dollies? No.

299
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:10,908
so, it,s... Goodbye, Dolly...?

300
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:13,212
It's too bad. I kind of liked him.

301
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:18,347
well, stannie, if I may call you that.
Maybe you should reconsider?

302
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:22,690
when Was the last time someone
you had a crush on asked you out?

303
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:25,559
You,re no one to talk,
Miss Marlboro Lights.

304
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:29,396
You,re right. I am no one to talk.

305
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:34,100
Maybe I could quit, just a little.
Till I see What,s up.

306
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:38,409
- Et tu?
- Fine.

307
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:40,706
I can,t see myself getting excited

308
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:46,080
because my boyfriend,s three-foot
Lady Di doll is arriving from Qvc.

309
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:51,325
Let,s go.
Time to go shoot hoops.

310
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:56,862
- I can,t. I got behind on this file.
- No, you don,t. You promised.

311
00:21:57,031 --> 00:22:01,866
This has to be ready Monday. I don,t
have time to Watch you shoot hoops.

312
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:06,996
I ask you to do one thing for me
and you can,t. what is that?

313
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:08,869
what,s with the attitude?

314
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:12,206
You knoW hoW many times
I do What you Want?

315
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:15,745
why are you getting so upset?
It,s just a stupid shot.

316
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,749
Not to me it's not.

317
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:24,683
why are you alWays pessimistic?
... You can,t make that shot....

318
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,986
steve, come on.

319
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:30,619
It,s not just the shot. It,s everything.
... we can,t move in together....

320
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,564
If this is ever gonna Work,
I need you to believe in us.

321
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:40,503
I need you to believe in me,
even if you think it,s fucking stupid.

322
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:55,349
All right, hot shot.
shoW me What you got.

323
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:04,754
Nice legs! very nice!

324
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,764
This is for the big money!

325
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:22,778
steve never did win the big money
at Madison square Garden.

326
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,579
But having Miranda shoW up,
made him feel like a million bucks.

327
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:28,949
You Were robbed!

328
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,591
- Do over!
- oK.

329
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,903
- Don,t get any ideas.
- Pete. Let,s go.

330
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:50,265
This isn,t fair.
He Was just starting to get over you.

331
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:55,181
since you negotiated
such a good price for me on the chair,

332
00:23:55,349 --> 00:24:00,377
maybe I can negotiate a little deal
for you on the smoking.

333
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:03,555
what kind of deal?

334
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:07,660
I,ve been thinking
about quitting anyWay. why not noW?

335
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,391
No cigarettes.

336
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,096
can you do that?

337
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:17,464
Maybe you think
I,m more of a smoker than I am.

338
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:20,937
I only have like a cigarette
with cocktails.

339
00:24:23,344 --> 00:24:25,972
I,m done here.
Do you Wanna get some coffee?

340
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,116
The second he said coffee,
I kneW I Wanted a cigarette.

341
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:32,309
I'd love it.

342
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:36,183
It Was one of those dates
When you have so much to say

343
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:39,724
that coffee turns into a movie,
a movie into a long Walk

344
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:43,761
and a long Walk turns into
the beginning of cold turkey rehab.

345
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:46,491
would you like to eat some dinner?

346
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,533
I Was completely ready
to trade in my crush...

347
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:52,027
Hi.

348
00:24:52,206 --> 00:24:56,700
...When it daWned on me hoW much
I Was willing to give up for a cigarette.

349
00:24:56,877 --> 00:24:59,175
Maybe a quick bite.

350
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,597
Her name is sheeba.
she,s French.

351
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,201
MeanWhile,
back in the... valley of the Dolls...

352
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:26,863
stanford thought there Was something
more rare than a porcelain face...

353
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,736
his passion.

354
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:33,577
wait, the dolls.

355
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:57,330
To Marty Mendleson,
a broken face Was a deal breaker.

356
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:04,466
Adeena!

357
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:09,105
samantha Was about to come
face to face with her deal breaker.

358
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:12,047
- what,s up?
- You tell me. I just got here.

359
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:14,278
You knoW samantha.

360
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:17,788
what,s my favorite girl drinking?

361
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,392
- champagne.
- Marguerita.

362
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:22,722
coming right up.

363
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:28,499
what are you doing here?
I don,t Want you dating my brother.

364
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:31,729
I,m a lovely person.
Get to knoW me, then hate me.

365
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:35,273
This is not a game.
This is my brother We,re talking about.

366
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:38,275
For a Woman with such
a progressive vieW of World food...

367
00:26:38,445 --> 00:26:41,744
- That,s business, this is family.
- I don,t understand...

368
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:46,716
I,ll say it to you plain. I don,t care
hoW many Jennifer Lopez dresses

369
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:50,721
you have hanging in your closet,
you don,t belong in here.

370
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:54,927
You,ll never understand What I,m
talking about. This is a black thing.

371
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:59,122
Please go
and leave my brother alone.

372
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:04,704
As samantha turned to leave,
she realised this Wasn,t a black thing.

373
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:06,772
It Was a samantha thing.

374
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:10,934
she,d never backed doWn to a bitch
and she Wasn,t about to start.

375
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:16,174
No Woman, no matter What color,
has the right to tell me Who I fuck.

376
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,444
Get your little White pussy
aWay from my brother!

377
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,145
Get your big, black ass
out of my face!

378
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:25,258
And your okra Wasn,t all that!

379
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:31,390
Get off me!

380
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:36,600
Keep it real.

381
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:38,932
I,m trying to keep it real.

382
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:47,545
seven hours into the World,s
longest date, all I could think Was,

383
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:51,617
...Five more minutes and I can smoke
the cigarette hidden in my purse....

384
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:55,881
- would you like a dessert menu?
- I,ll take a look.

385
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,059
I forgot, I have a deadline.
I have to go.

386
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:01,490
- I,ll Walk with you.
- No!

387
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,631
stay and enjoy your dessert.
I,m fine.

388
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:47,131
carrie...
we,ve got a little problem.

389
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:57,076
what can I say?
Adeena has alWays been there for me.

390
00:28:57,251 --> 00:29:01,620
Ever since Mom died,
it,s only been the two of us.

391
00:29:02,923 --> 00:29:08,520
Adeena has her issues,
but you didn,t have to insult her food.

392
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:12,056
You mean the World to me.

393
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,569
But Adeena, she,s my blood.

394
00:29:25,145 --> 00:29:28,637
samantha kneWthe real problem
Wasn,t her White pussy.

395
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:33,651
It Was that chivon Was a black pussy
Who Wouldn,t stand up to his sister.

396
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:40,958
And for samantha Jones,
that Was the deal breaker.

397
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:46,122
It Was too bad We had to end.
But that,s the Way it goes, I guess.

398
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,260
we had some good times together
and I,m sure We could have had more.

399
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:53,770
But, it,s over.

400
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:04,609
In the end, I really did it for me.
I just hope he,s Worth it.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
