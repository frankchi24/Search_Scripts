1
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:50,728
One ofthe best things
about being in a great relationship

2
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,096
is feeling comfortable enough
to leave it for an evening.

3
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:59,873
what do you girls do
when you get together?

4
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:06,743
The usual stuff - braid our hair,
crank calls, and that weekend stuff.

5
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,576
You don't talk about the boys?

6
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:10,617
I can't lie.

7
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:13,380
Sometimes there is talk of the boys.

8
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:15,149
Men's greatest fear.

9
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,157
- I thought it was hair loss.
- No problem here.

10
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:21,319
- I can tell.
- Feel free to pass that on to the gals.

11
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:24,989
I'll try to work that
into the conversation.

12
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:29,866
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

13
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:38,777
EB white said no one should come
to New York unless they're lucky.

14
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:44,442
I was. I had an amazing boyfriend
who had all his hair, good friends...

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,857
...and a married ex-boyfriend
I had slept with a week ago.

16
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,464
May I just say, "wow!"

17
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,901
what can I say? I've arrived!

18
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:07,132
Samantha had invited us to celebrate

19
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:09,800
her new apartment, three new clients

20
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,912
and her general fabulousness.

21
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,674
who knew this existed

22
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,578
in the meatpacking district.

23
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:18,413
Just yards away from decaying cows.

24
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:21,681
- Homemade baby quiche.
- You made these?

25
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,552
No! I had them delivered,

26
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:25,159
along with dinner, the wine

27
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:28,786
and DvD of "An Affair To Remember"
that we're watching later, drunk.

28
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:31,832
- You can get DvDs delivered?
- I used this new delivery service.

29
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:35,130
Anything you want
they bring within an hour.

30
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,238
Anything?

31
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:41,308
- Last night I ordered condoms.
- You didn't fuck the delivery guy!

32
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:44,546
No, John, the hot guy from the gym.

33
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:47,174
The condoms
came faster than he did!

34
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,840
There's an ad-slogan.

35
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:51,178
Ladies, we have it all -

36
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:52,980
great apartments, jobs,

37
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:55,055
friends, and sex...

38
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:57,817
we can have quiche delivered
and eat it too.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,087
At my age, my mother had three kids

40
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,752
and a drunk husband.

41
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:05,230
- You just have three drunk friends.
- By choice.

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,666
Having it all really means having
someone special to share it with.

43
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,329
Please. That's so barney.

44
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:16,739
I'm sorry. My life wasn't complete
until I met Trey.

45
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,004
And Trey's mom is so great.

46
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,309
You'll meet her at the engagement
party she's throwing for us.

47
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,349
You will love her.

48
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:27,580
Do you see us Manhattan?
we have it all.

49
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:30,123
- Fuck you!
- You wish.

50
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:36,329
carrie, go home.
I can take care of this.

51
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:41,059
Three hours later, Deborah Kerr had
revealed her secret to cary Grant,

52
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:43,898
and I'd still told no one mine.

53
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:49,169
- I slept with Big last week.
- You're having an affair?

54
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:54,509
No, no affair. Just one night,
and it is not happening again.

55
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:01,083
- Please don't tell the others.
- OK.

56
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,519
I am awful.

57
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:09,720
I have this great boyfriend.
I don't know what I was doing.

58
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:13,698
Nothing men
haven't been doing for centuries.

59
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:15,393
was it good?

60
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,698
It was great,
and it's not happening again.

61
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:25,145
Got it. Plates.

62
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:33,514
How can it feel so good
when it's so bad?

63
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,520
They design it that way.

64
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:39,889
Big and I... we have this thing.

65
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:44,294
It's all about the pheromones.
we're just animals reacting to smells.

66
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:49,995
I have a great boyfriend with all his
hair, waiting for me, who smells great.

67
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:52,663
Aidan hasn't said "I love you" yet.

68
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,607
- Until then, you're a free agent.
- The rules according to Samantha?

69
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:59,178
I'm more old-fashioned
than you think.

70
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,508
I don't wanna be a free agent.

71
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,012
Don't you wanna judge me,
just a little bit?

72
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,418
Not my style.

73
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:18,595
Hang on.

74
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:21,335
Hang on.

75
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,401
Hi. God, I missed you.

76
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:33,446
You gotta go see the girls more often.

77
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:37,577
come on.

78
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:44,250
Suddenly I felt safe again.
It had all just been a bad dream.

79
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,623
As long as I was near Aidan,
it would all be OK.

80
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,223
Until the morning.

81
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,663
why do you have to go
to Pennsylvania today?

82
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:57,533
See that chair? It's got owners
that miss it very much.

83
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:01,942
Go tomorrow. come on, stay.

84
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,908
- I'll make you cookies.
- You don't cook.

85
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,243
I'll buy you cookies.
come on, stay.

86
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:13,877
It's just for a couple of days.
You gotta have stuff you wanna do.

87
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:18,954
what I needed to do was not be alone.

88
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:21,152
Be good.

89
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:41,738
Downtown, Samantha woke up
to discover she did have it all.

90
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,817
Including the flu.

91
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:52,482
Shit.

92
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,702
She never wanted a man around
in the morning, until she needed one.

93
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:06,500
- John?
- It's Samantha.

94
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,108
Jones.

95
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:10,176
From the gym.

96
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,107
Yeah, right.

97
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:17,980
I wondered if you might be able to
drop by on your way to work.

98
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:24,148
Honey, I can hardly blow my nose,
let alone blow you.

99
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:28,194
Yeah, I wouldn't want
you to get sick, either.

100
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,735
Later, in the bridal registry
department at Bergdorf Goodman,

101
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:40,602
charlotte discovered,
she wanted it all, and more.

102
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:45,303
- $1,300.
- Yes. we do very well with it.

103
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:48,641
- It's really beautiful.
- Yes.

104
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,877
It'll look lovely under the noodles
we'll have to eat

105
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,521
due to my outstanding loans.

106
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:59,122
No, not that face.

107
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,522
All right. If it's what you want.

108
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm too crazy about you to say no.

109
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:12,095
I gotta get back to the hospital.

110
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:15,072
- Did you do a guest list for the party?
- Oh, right.

111
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:21,448
I almost forgot.

112
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:29,457
Sweetie? what's this?

113
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:35,329
Prenuptial agreements. Standard.
Everyone in the family has one.

114
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:39,263
You sign on page four. Feel free
to have your lawyer look it over.

115
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:43,135
I'll call you later.

116
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,500
This looks normal.

117
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,341
charlotte wasted no time
having a lawyer look it over.

118
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:56,916
we're not married yet, and already
we're talking about divorce.

119
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,053
A lot of people do prenups.

120
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,053
Marriage is supposed to be
about love and happiness.

121
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:05,420
- And the protection of assets.
- That is so unromantic.

122
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:08,255
And necessary. 50 per cent
of marriages end in divorce.

123
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,295
There it is again - divorce.

124
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:15,435
I'm sure you'll live happily ever after,
but I wouldn't marry without this.

125
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:18,128
I'm safe. what's he gonna take
from me - shoes?

126
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,501
Maybe I do need one.

127
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:21,664
what?

128
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,471
This is unusual.
He has you on a vesting schedule.

129
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:29,345
For every five years you're married,
you get a percentage of $500,000.

130
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,452
I'm only worth $500,000.

131
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,056
- Over 30 years.
- Maybe that's your wholesale price.

132
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:40,183
If you have any boys,
you'll get another 100 grand.

133
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:43,354
How much for girls?

134
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,728
- Nada.
- That's bad business.

135
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:51,998
I can't sign that. I can't marry
someone knowing they feel this way.

136
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:55,904
This is just their opening offer.
It's standard to negotiate.

137
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:58,375
I can't even buy stuff on sale.

138
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:02,573
Talk to Trey. I'm sure his lawyers
will take care of this.

139
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:06,414
working over lunch? The New York
office is tougher than ours.

140
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:10,888
George, this is carrie and charlotte.
George works in our chicago office.

141
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:14,289
I'm taking depositions
and restaurant recommendations

142
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,090
from hip and trendy New Yorkers.

143
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:20,291
- You're hip and trendy?
- George is from chicago.

144
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:22,800
- So it's good?
- It's fantastic.

145
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,565
I hope the place tomorrow
lives up to your standards.

146
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:29,210
- I'm sure it will be great.
- I'll drop by your office later.

147
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,402
- OK.
- Nice meeting you, ladies.

148
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,205
Bye.

149
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:36,612
well, well, well, they sure
grow 'em cute in the Midwest.

150
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,980
I know. We have a date.

151
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:44,148
Find out how much he pays
for boys before you get attached.

152
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:48,591
24 hours, three degrees of fever
and two pages of her black book later,

153
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:51,323
Samantha was no closer
to closing her deal.

154
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:56,596
why don't you go fuck yourself.
I won't be doing it again... ever.

155
00:10:57,472 --> 00:11:00,964
Samantha was discovering it was
easier to find a guy to screw her

156
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:03,110
than one who'd screw in
her curtain rod.

157
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,746
She wasn't the only one
who needed a fix.

158
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:09,680
I did everything I could
to keep busy until Aidan came back.

159
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:13,378
I re-arranged my sweaters,
defrosted my fridge...

160
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:25,824
broke into my emergency hidden
stash, and thought about choices.

161
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:30,894
Modern women have been told
that we can be anything we want -

162
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:35,634
an astronaut, the head of an Internet
company, a stay-at-home mom.

163
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,301
There aren't any rules.
choices are endless.

164
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,779
And apparently,
they can all be delivered to your door.

165
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:45,180
Is it possible that we've gotten
so spoiled by choices

166
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,480
that we've become
unable to make one?

167
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,089
That we know
that once you choose something,

168
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:53,455
one man, one great apartment,
one amazing job,

169
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,925
another option goes away?

170
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:59,999
Are we a generation who can't
choose just one from column 'A'?

171
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:03,160
Did we have too much to handle,
or was Samantha right?

172
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:05,295
can we have it all?

173
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:10,135
Two hours later, I had filed
every article I'd ever written,

174
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:13,542
but I couldn't file away
what had happened with Big.

175
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,910
I made a choice.

176
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:20,011
I called him.

177
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:25,889
- Yeah?
- It's me, carrie.

178
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,029
Jesus, carrie. How are you?

179
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:31,893
I'm good, fine. OK.

180
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,626
we need to talk about what happened.

181
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:38,101
- Right now?
- Yes. Rationally and right now.

182
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:43,006
- Apparently you're the boss.
- It was just a physical thing.

183
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:46,670
we gave in to our baser instincts,
shit happens, blah blah blah.

184
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:49,339
- Are you wearing glasses?
- No.

185
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:53,510
- You sound like you are.
- It can't happen. You're married.

186
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:58,990
I'm aware of that. But it was
pretty fucking amazing, wasn't it?

187
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,458
That is so not the point.

188
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:05,725
we're intelligent beings. we have to
learn to rise above the physical stuff.

189
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:08,732
You can learn to do that?

190
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:10,598
Apparently we couldn't.

191
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:13,068
Next time we're going to a hotel.

192
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:16,074
I can smell the guy on your sheets.

193
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,678
woodchips and Paco Rabanne.

194
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:20,973
He doesn't wear cologne.

195
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,673
Maybe he should.

196
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,286
By the way, there will be no next time.

197
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,682
This is gonna be like
"The Bridges Of Madison Avenue".

198
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:32,383
A brief affair
I'll write about to my grandchildren.

199
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,189
can I have a beard
in the book version?

200
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:38,798
I've always wanted a beard.

201
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:40,901
Maybe a goatee.

202
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:43,696
It all felt so easy and so good.

203
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,567
I was like the moth to the old flame.

204
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,469
Meanwhile that night,
Miranda was enjoying her new flame.

205
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:57,282
can't believe I have to
catch an 11 o' clock flight.

206
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,353
But it was fun.

207
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:06,118
If I weren't going back to chicago,
I would try to sleep with you now.

208
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:09,092
I'm drunk enough.
I might have let you.

209
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:11,522
Damn!

210
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,730
- I have to wait till next time.
- There will be a next time?

211
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:19,873
Of course.
I come back and forth a lot.

212
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:23,407
In the meantime,
there's always the phone.

213
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:28,311
- I have one of those.
- I'll call you tomorrow night.

214
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:35,353
Damn.

215
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:40,821
The next night, Miranda was surprised
to hear from George.

216
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,987
I knew you were a middle child.
I love it when I'm right.

217
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:47,430
Yeah, spoken like a true only child.

218
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:50,366
They talked for two hours
about everything.

219
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:56,067
Favorite foods, families... It was one
of the best dates Miranda had had.

220
00:14:56,277 --> 00:14:59,303
- what are you wearing?
- Then the date got even better.

221
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,539
Nothing.

222
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:06,348
- wish I were there.
- Really? what would you do?

223
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:11,857
I would start
by kissing your neck. Slowly.

224
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:15,887
Then I'd work my way down,

225
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:19,090
start licking your nipples...

226
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:22,566
- where's your hand?
- On your dick.

227
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:25,535
Put the other one on you.

228
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:29,609
That night, Miranda started
sleeping with George regularly.

229
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:34,942
She had it all - her own life, and
a great boyfriend she could count on.

230
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:38,574
He always called,
and she always came to the phone.

231
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:43,122
while Miranda came, I was busy
preparing for Aidan to come back.

232
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,124
I had slept in Big's and my sex-sheets
for two days.

233
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,821
Like any good junky,
I knew how to hide the evidence.

234
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,931
Hey, you.

235
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,069
- come on.
- Hi.

236
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,738
Look at you.

237
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:09,576
I was sure he saw the scarlet 'A'
on my chest.

238
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:13,945
If Big could smell him,
could he smell Big on me?

239
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,955
I missed you so much.

240
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:22,523
I should send you
to Pennsylvania more often.

241
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:26,189
You should.
I realized something while I was gone.

242
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,359
- You did, did you?
- Yeah.

243
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,528
I love you, carrie.

244
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,810
Is that too much?

245
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,106
- I thought I shouldn't say...
- No.

246
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,620
I love you too.

247
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:58,098
Not only was my secret safe,
but I had become lovable.

248
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,234
I felt awful. And so good.

249
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:03,495
- wait. No sheets.
- Fuck the sheets.

250
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:07,630
You're bent over,
and I'm playing with you.

251
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,575
- Your dick is in my mouth.
- Jesus, I'm gonna come.

252
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:14,943
The next night, Miranda was
going to third with George

253
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,640
when her second line beeped.

254
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,581
Dammit, hold on.

255
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,688
- Hello.
- Trey says his mom won't negotiate.

256
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:25,121
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?

257
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,284
I'll be right back.

258
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:31,523
Your dick is in my mouth.
Keep it there.

259
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:36,193
The mom's the one holding the cards.
She's the one to go up against.

260
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:40,533
- How do I do that?
- charlotte, I'll call you tomorrow.

261
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,902
But...

262
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,208
Sorry.

263
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:48,405
So am I.
You got me so hot, I just came.

264
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,608
You did?

265
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:55,119
Now we have to take care of you.

266
00:17:56,924 --> 00:18:00,724
The next night,
I went to take care of Samantha.

267
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:03,523
More cough syrup.

268
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:07,428
which for Samantha meant
making her mom's childhood remedy -

269
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:10,570
cough syrup
and Fanta orange soda over ice.

270
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,743
No offence, but this is about
to make me sicker than you.

271
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:22,542
Give me my drink.

272
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:29,348
A frosted martini glass
would make that more appetizing.

273
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:35,353
why don't you ask the super
to fix your window?

274
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,693
I don't have one.
I own this place, remember?

275
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:48,876
I should have got married. Then
at least I'd have a curtain that closes.

276
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:53,537
Oh, carrie, it doesn't matter
how much you have.

277
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:57,047
If you don't have a guy
who cares about you,

278
00:18:57,218 --> 00:19:02,053
- it all means shit.
- Sweetie, calm down.

279
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:08,155
Three days of sleep deprivation had
turned Samantha into a new woman -

280
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:09,694
charlotte.

281
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:14,767
For someone who had it all,
she had never felt more alone.

282
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,870
I'm gonna tell you something.

283
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,636
There's two types of guys out there -

284
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:26,779
the ones that hold your hand,
and the ones that fuck you.

285
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,917
I'd slept with both of them
in the last 48 hours.

286
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:34,487
The guys that fuck you
aren't worth a damn.

287
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:36,782
we're all alone.

288
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:42,658
we are not alone.
we have each other.

289
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,060
- Bed?
- Yeah.

290
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:55,971
Three days of rest later, three healthy
girls attended a very uptown party.

291
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:59,772
Jesus. Looks like
Martha Stewart exploded in here.

292
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:03,314
- Look, headbands are back.
- where's the food?

293
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:08,683
Amazing what days of a cough syrup
and Fanta diet will do for the appetite.

294
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:11,484
They're wASPs.
There's never food, only booze.

295
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:13,956
Fine.
One martini, six olives.

296
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:18,925
I can't believe charlotte wants to be
in this world. Look at these people.

297
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,694
- They're like Ken and Barbie cut-outs.
- You made it.

298
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:26,567
- I see you found the bar.
- we're good that way.

299
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:29,938
Trey, you have to keep people
out of the maid's room.

300
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:34,343
There are photos of me rowing college
crew in there. It's mortifying.

301
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:37,941
These are charlotte's friends.
This is my mom, Bunny.

302
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:40,017
Pleasure to have you.

303
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:42,655
There's Reverend Williams.

304
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:46,919
Maybe we should say hello
before he gets into the Scotch.

305
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:49,722
It's about 20 years too late for that.

306
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:56,361
- I haven't signed the prenup.
- what are you gonna do?

307
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,538
I don't know. I'm confused.

308
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:02,301
I love him, but I feel like
no one cares about me.

309
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:08,471
I thought if we could negotiate,
it'd be OK, but now it all feels wrong.

310
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:13,382
- what does Trey say?
- Nothing. He leaves it to his mother.

311
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:15,021
You can take her.

312
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:19,625
- what should I do?
- we can't tell you what to do.

313
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:24,754
I wasn't one to talk about marriage,
considering I might break one up.

314
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:27,991
You have to do
what feels right to you.

315
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:31,161
It depends how much
you want to marry Trey.

316
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:46,746
- Bunny, do you have a minute?
- Of course.

317
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:50,448
charlotte realized, if she wanted
to close the deal with Trey,

318
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:52,956
she'd have to close the deal
with Bunny first.

319
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:56,893
- I haven't signed the prenup.
- You've been busy.

320
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,532
I have...

321
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,295
...a little problem
with how much I'm worth.

322
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:08,975
I see.
That is the standard amount.

323
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:12,306
It's how it's always
been done in the MacDougal family.

324
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:15,414
Right.

325
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:20,077
Not only would she have to negotiate,
she'd have to play hardball.

326
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:22,722
well, you know...

327
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,227
...we haven't finalized
the wedding arrangements.

328
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:30,225
Trey would be disappointed
if I backed out.

329
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:33,763
"The Times" announcement
would run, there would be questions...

330
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:38,803
- what do you want?
- I'm worth a million.

331
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:45,975
I did it. I negotiated with Bunny,
and I signed the prenup.

332
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,138
That's great.

333
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:52,251
- I'm getting married.
- congratulations.

334
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:57,482
- I love him.
- Ladies, may I sweep my bride away?

335
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:00,159
She's all yours.

336
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:03,660
It was then that we realized
that we didn't have it all.

337
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:07,460
we no longer had charlotte.

338
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,993
Then, there were three.

339
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,799
I can't believe
she's marrying that guy.

340
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:15,339
For a tenth of what she's worth.

341
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,909
I thought you were
Ms Pro Marriage now.

342
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:22,913
I was delirious.
I also saw spots all over my bathtub.

343
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:26,712
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but it feels weird without her here.

344
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,378
That's such a charlotte thing to say.

345
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:32,185
After a week full of Aidan
and no cigarettes,

346
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,919
I felt like I had
finally kicked my addiction.

347
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:37,893
- Emu.
- what?

348
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:42,161
- 32 across. Rare bird - emu.
- I was getting there.

349
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,600
Not with the wrong word in 15 down.

350
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:53,046
Then my addiction found me.

351
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:54,943
- Hello.
- I need to see you.

352
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:58,642
- Miranda, I'll call you back.
- come down or I'll come up.

353
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:01,686
Right, I'll call you later.

354
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:08,393
I told Aidan
I was taking Pete for a walk.

355
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:11,156
He believed me,
which only made it worse.

356
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,860
Don't ever call me
at home again. walk.

357
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,598
You can't just decide
you wanna see me, and I'm there.

358
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,773
- Is this his dog?
- Yes.

359
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:25,378
You want it all - the girl you screw,
and the girl you go home to.

360
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,776
That's bullshit. I just want you.

361
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:33,909
I can't do this any more, sleep with
two people at the same time.

362
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,819
- I'll tell her tonight.
- what?

363
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:40,961
- what?
- No, no.

364
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:43,926
Married men don't just leave their...

365
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:48,067
I have a man who loves me,
and you have a wife who loves you.

366
00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:50,726
Don't talk about him and her
like it's you and me.

367
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:55,534
You have no right to do this.
You can't come and fuck up my life.

368
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:59,304
I think there were two people
doing the fucking here.

369
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,314
Shit. Pete. Oh, shit!

370
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:06,510
- where are you going? wait.
- Pete!

371
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,920
- Pete! Oh, shit.
- carrie.

372
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:14,785
Excuse me.

373
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,302
Pete! shit.

374
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:27,463
- watch out!
- Pete.

375
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,018
God. Shit!

376
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:45,089
No. Go home.
Don't tell anyone. Don't do anything.

377
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:49,958
- I wanna help.
- This isn't helping. Go home.

378
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,967
Back at Miranda's home,
things were heating up as well.

379
00:25:57,137 --> 00:26:02,973
I unbutton the last button, slip
my hand in, and touch your breast.

380
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,509
Your nipple's so hard.

381
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:10,079
I'll be right back.

382
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:26,293
I'm thrusting, I'm thrusting.
I'm deep inside of you.

383
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:28,594
You were touching my breast.

384
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:32,899
Yeah, I'm touching your breast,
and I'm thrusting into you.

385
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:36,201
No, we hadn't gotten to that yet.

386
00:26:36,443 --> 00:26:37,410
Oh.

387
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:45,310
Are you having phone sex
with other people?

388
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:51,083
I don't think we ever said
this was an exclusive thing.

389
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:52,850
Oh, my God.

390
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,053
Miranda stopped being hung up
on George. So she hung up on him.

391
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:04,132
Three hours later, I hadn't found Pete,
and I felt as lost as he was.

392
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:08,263
I had a man who loved me, and a man
who wanted to leave his wife for me.

393
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:10,410
I should have been
on top of the world,

394
00:27:10,544 --> 00:27:12,512
but I didn't feel like I had it all.

395
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,045
I felt like nothing.

396
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:18,480
I had lost Pete,
and I would probably lose Aidan.

397
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:20,119
I decided to come clean.

398
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:28,256
Jesus, I was worried about you.

399
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:36,358
Oh, my God. Pete's here?

400
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:42,169
Oh, my God, I lost him.
I lost him and I looked for him and...

401
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:46,904
Oh, my... Pete, come here.
come here.

402
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,742
Oh, God.

403
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:52,217
- I'm an awful girlfriend.
- Take it easy.

404
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:56,288
- I'm awful.
- He's a dog. He runs away.

405
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,152
He found his way back.

406
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:02,362
So had I.

407
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:07,296
I need to ask you something.

408
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:12,438
- OK.
- I don't wanna be paranoid.

409
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:14,631
You took Pete for a walk.

410
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:18,539
we both know you're not big
on the dog-walking.

411
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,843
I can smell something.

412
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:36,592
Are you cheating?

413
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:46,227
I can smell the smoke on you.

414
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:52,136
You're smoking again, aren't you?

415
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,547
Yeah.

416
00:28:58,085 --> 00:28:59,552
Yeah, I am.

417
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,551
It was the truth.

418
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:07,216
- Are you going to quit?
- I really want to.

419
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:08,861
That was, too.

420
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:12,362
come here.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
