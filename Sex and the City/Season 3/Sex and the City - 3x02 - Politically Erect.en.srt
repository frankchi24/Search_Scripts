1
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:49,895
Ihad been dating politician Bill Kelley

2
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:51,499
for three weeks.

3
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:56,037
Since most of our time was spent
campaigning, I dressed the part.

4
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,207
I found some vintage Halston

5
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:00,399
and did a spin on Jackie Kennedy.

6
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,476
The early years.

7
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:11,219
Who here knows

8
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:13,015
what a city comptroller does?

9
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,114
You do?

10
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:18,123
We made a good match.

11
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:21,059
I was adept at fashion, he at politics.

12
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,825
This city's populace's passion,

13
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,935
love and devotion to their home...

14
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,867
Really, they're both
about recycling ideas

15
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:33,167
and making them seem
fresh and inspiring.

16
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:39,178
It is this love affair, this symbiotic
relationship between citizens and city,

17
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:42,784
that I promise to cherish and protect.

18
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:45,284
Thank you.

19
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:46,944
Great guy!

20
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,954
Yes, he is.

21
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:00,699
can we talk about proposition 114?

22
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,897
- What is that?
- You and me in the bedroom.

23
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:09,101
- Is that on the ballot?
- It ought to be. I'd back it.

24
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:11,906
And that's
whatever position you want.

25
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,407
Which way is the bedroom?

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,845
Put me down.

27
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,763
That was the night I had
my political consciousness raised.

28
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,532
How about a movie
Wednesday night?

29
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:37,798
Wednesday? I'm not sure.
I might be working.

30
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:39,566
Thursday, then.

31
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,938
oK, maybe Thursday. I'll see.

32
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,171
Do you have plans?

33
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:49,614
Steve, you can't just assume
I'm gonna be free every night.

34
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:53,348
Is it a date?

35
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:58,824
It could be a date, so I wouldn't
necessarily share that with you.

36
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:03,364
- I'd like to know. Who are you dating?
- Nobody in particular.

37
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:06,194
- Anybody specific?
- Is this the third degree?

38
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:10,203
I'm trying to figure out
when I get to see you again.

39
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,341
I'm not dating anyone else.

40
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:16,205
I'm not planning on
dating anyone else.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,278
- I just want to see you.
- I see.

42
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,817
Exclusively.

43
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,020
I got it.

44
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:34,151
That's very sweet. I just
hadn't thought about things that way.

45
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,323
- So, think about it.
- oK.

46
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,699
Because I think if we really want
to see if it can work between us,

47
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:46,740
this time we got to make
the commitment to be exclusive.

48
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:52,306
oK. I hear you.

49
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,304
oK.

50
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:04,185
The truth was, there were
no other candidates in sight.

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,696
But Miranda wasn't ready
to let Steve win by default.

52
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,232
You're dating a politician and
you're not even registered to vote.

53
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:18,704
- It's the undecideds they're after.
- He's good-looking, he's got power...

54
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,899
It's got to be a turn-on.

55
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:24,911
Yeah, I'm dating
a potential comptroller. It's hot.

56
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:31,043
- I want to help out.
- You're not interested in politics?

57
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,051
It's a great way to meet men.

58
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:37,659
With carrie, we can meet the inner
circle and the interesting donors.

59
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:40,660
By interesting men
she means single and rich.

60
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:45,891
- Guys, he's not running for president.
- I'd vote for him. He's cute.

61
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:50,368
- So?
- I always vote according to looks.

62
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:53,440
I base my decision
on the swimsuit competition.

63
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:57,237
The country runs better
with a good-looking man in charge

64
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:02,043
Look at Nixon. No one wanted
to fuck him, so he fucked everyone.

65
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,847
- I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
- We need a president in a hat.

66
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:11,721
No one wears a hat anymore.
FDR, good president, wore a hat.

67
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,796
So busy picking a hat,
he forgot to get in the war.

68
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:20,526
- I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
- We tried to ignore that the first time.

69
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,534
It was his crisp, white shirts.

70
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:26,300
- Reminded me of my father.
- So, you were voting for your father.

71
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:30,912
There was something homoerotic
about Quayle and Bush.

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,538
- very Batman and Robin.
- Based strictly on looks,

73
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:39,313
- no one was cuter than JFK.
- or quicker to jump in the sack.

74
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:42,821
I'm glad you three weren't around
during the original 13 colonies.

75
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:46,826
I don't think our founding fathers
were very fuckable.

76
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:50,432
I heard that Thomas Jefferson
was a real fox.

77
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,535
There we were.
Just four girls talking politics.

78
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:58,901
Meanwhile, Miranda was facing a day
at the polls earlier than she expected.

79
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,976
Last night as we were walking home,
Steve asked me to go steady.

80
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,170
How sweet. They still call it that?

81
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,372
I don't know if I can make
that commitment.

82
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,575
How many other guys are you dating?

83
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:13,845
That's not the point. I'm so ambivalent
about Steve and moving forward.

84
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:18,460
You did let him back in your life.
There must be something there.

85
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:22,723
There's plenty there. Flaws that make
me not want to stick my neck out.

86
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:24,923
But there's great stuff too.

87
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,627
Maybe I should be honest
and tell him what I really feel which is..

88
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,431
what if somebody
better comes along?

89
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:33,598
You gotta put a better spin
on it than that.

90
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:35,937
You see... that's my problem.

91
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:39,306
I don't know how to be political
in relationships.

92
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:44,248
It's time for the list. Things you like
about him. Things you don't like.

93
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,412
- See which is longer.
- That's so judgmental.

94
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,048
You are judgmental.
Put it to good use.

95
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:55,095
oK, fine. I'll make a list.

96
00:06:56,432 --> 00:07:00,732
Politics were always as relevant to me
as a new Erica Jong novel.

97
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,963
But I did find it interesting
that a discussion about politics

98
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,699
ultimately became
a discussion about sex.

99
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:11,244
And a discussion about sex
became a question of politics.

100
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:17,545
Which led me to wonder, if the two
were inextricably linked, and if so...

101
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,553
can there be sex without politics?

102
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:24,588
That night, Samantha discovered
her own hot, new candidate.

103
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,923
Hey, Pink Lady.
can I buy that for you?

104
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:31,863
Maybe, if you promise never to use
a lame line like that again.

105
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,264
It worked didn't it?
Jeff Fenton.

106
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:35,528
Samantha Jones.

107
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,468
You are damn attractive.
And that is not a line.

108
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:41,074
How long have you been sitting here?

109
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,905
- My first drink.
- So, you're just naturally forward?

110
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,980
I'm aggressive.
I run a successful hedge fund.

111
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:49,879
My life is about calculating risks.

112
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,614
Telling a beautiful lady she's attractive
is the safest bet I've made all day.

113
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,519
Thank you.

114
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,523
- You like to ski?
- I love it.

115
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:02,391
We have a house in Sun valley.
How long have you been skiing?

116
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:06,694
- on and off for years.
- I can tell. You've got the legs for it.

117
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,770
Got to run back to the office.

118
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,941
How about dinner this week?

119
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:16,168
I told you all about me
but I didn't hear about you.

120
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:19,246
Samantha never felt better.
There were gorgeous women

121
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,248
sitting on either side
and Jeff had elected her.

122
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,851
Fenton Partners.

123
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,284
That's right.
We're up 3200%0 for the year.

124
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,786
Samantha Jones. Public Relations.
very nice.

125
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,487
You must do well.
Who's gonna say no to you?

126
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:39,395
- What about dinner? Friday night?
- I think that might work.

127
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:43,265
Just as her self-esteem
was soaring right off the charts...

128
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,341
Nice to meet you, Pink Lady.
I'll give you a call.

129
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:50,376
Bye.

130
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,750
Later that week,

131
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,218
I brought "the single ladies coalition
to elect Bill Kelley" to a fundraiser.

132
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:04,553
What is the height difference between
a short person and a little person?

133
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,752
- A little person?
- A midget.

134
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,989
- A midget or a dwarf?
- What's the difference?

135
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:14,226
Little person is the proper way
to refer to an adult under 5 feet.

136
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:17,701
I agreed to go on a date
with a very short person.

137
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,738
I didn't realize he was so short.

138
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:24,072
Sitting down he was proportional.
Standing, he barely clears my nipples.

139
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,271
That may be the perfect height.

140
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:29,246
I can't cancel
just because he's a munchkin.

141
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:32,751
This is a politically incorrect
conversation for a political fundraiser.

142
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,389
Less than five feet is unacceptable.

143
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:38,651
I have to go mingle.
There are a lot of cute guys here

144
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,455
and these things
never last beyond two martinis.

145
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,689
charlotte was running
her own campaign.

146
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:48,303
She wanted to be elected wife
before the year was out.

147
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,098
- There's Miranda.
- Give me that.

148
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,605
Hey, you made it.

149
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,005
Tell me,
why are we voting for this guy?

150
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,116
He wants an investigation into
the Board of Education for waste,

151
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:06,515
and he's against large corporations
wasting your tax dollars.

152
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:09,816
- I'm sleeping with him.
- Good enough for me.

153
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:12,356
come on, I'll introduce you.

154
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,563
Jesus christ,
he talks more than I do.

155
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:21,863
This is the lovely Miranda Hobbes.
And her friend Steve Brady.

156
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,835
- Hi.
- I've heard great things about you.

157
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:29,137
You must be reading my clippings.
I pay people a lot to say nice things.

158
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,644
If you win, maybe you can fix
a couple of parking tickets.

159
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:37,309
I owe New York city $500. I figured
I need the money more than they do.

160
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:41,513
It's a joke!
come on, he knows I'm kidding.

161
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:46,983
- I'll get us a drink. Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

162
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:49,662
Excuse me.

163
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:53,324
The dumb jokes. con.

164
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:57,301
cute butt... pro.

165
00:10:57,473 --> 00:11:01,170
I don't believe in the Republican Party
or Democratic Party.

166
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:03,811
I just believe in parties.

167
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:08,939
charlotte was stumping for her cause,
and making newfriends.

168
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:12,712
I love Liechtenstein.
But I loved comic books as a kid.

169
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:16,551
But that's great. His work
is accessible on so many levels.

170
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:21,862
Sweetheart, this is charlotte.
She runs a gallery downtown.

171
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,260
charlotte, this is
my fiancee catherine.

172
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,924
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

173
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,066
- Stanford!
- Hi.

174
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:37,472
I can only stay a few minutes, I have
tickets to the "vagina Monologues".

175
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,635
Why?

176
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:42,645
I don't eat at the restaurant,
but I can still hear the specials.

177
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:47,254
- carrie, give me a sip of your drink.
- This is my friend, Stanford Blatch.

178
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:50,550
- Bill Kelley.
- I represent the queer vote.

179
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,889
If you can carry chelsea,
you've got the city locked up.

180
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm not worried about chelsea.
Have you seen my ass?

181
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,496
Got my vote.

182
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:03,069
- 12 o'clock.
- Excuse me.

183
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:09,510
- Who's that guy?
- That's his campaign manager.

184
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:13,739
- Fix me up.
- How do you even know he's gay?

185
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,749
I've seen him rollerblading
on 8th Avenue.

186
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,044
That's enough.

187
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:20,620
Please?

188
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,457
Great, now I'm a first lady and a pimp.

189
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,296
Hey, excuse me.

190
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:37,700
This is awkward, so feel free
to stop me at any time, but...

191
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,535
there's a person here
who would like to meet you.

192
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,576
- oK.
- A guy.

193
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:47,839
Keep going.

194
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,916
It's the guy right over there.

195
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,290
You mean the blonde guy
with the great arms.

196
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:11,163
Actually, no. It's the bald guy,
with the great sense of humor.

197
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,941
- Do you knowthe blonde guy?
- No.

198
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,671
- He's really much more my type.
- oK.

199
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:22,044
Well... Go Kelley.

200
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:27,482
I wondered howto handle
this political hot potato.

201
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:33,321
- He's not gay.
- I could have sworn he was.

202
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:36,089
I realized
I was getting good at politics.

203
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:40,667
I'm just so at the place
where I'm ready to settle down.

204
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:46,035
It seems like a miracle when two nice
people like you can find each other.

205
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,233
We met in the most unusual way.

206
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,878
one of my girlfriends threw a party

207
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,277
where all the women brought a man
they weren't interested in.

208
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,977
- Somebody brought Bob.
- The rest is history.

209
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:01,088
I love that!

210
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:06,353
one woman's trash
is another woman's treasure.

211
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:09,487
Bill raised $6,000 that night.

212
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:11,633
It really got him in the mood.

213
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,897
You know, you're the first woman
in ages I've felt this intimate with.

214
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:20,802
You're so beautiful.
So funny... you're great.

215
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:22,601
Thank you.

216
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,837
I love making love to you.

217
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,345
The feeling is mutual.

218
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,212
Is there anything you want or need
that I'm not doing?

219
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:32,649
- No, it's great.
- 'cause I want to know.

220
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:36,552
- I want to make you happy.
- I am happy.

221
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:40,718
What about you? Is there anything
you want or need that I'm not doing?

222
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:41,885
No.

223
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,431
- Well... maybe one thing.
- What?

224
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:51,470
Well, I would love
to get you in the shower.

225
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,368
Get each other all fresh and clean.

226
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:58,269
That sounds nice.

227
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:02,440
And then...
I'd like you to pee on me.

228
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:11,083
I would be worried.
The pee could be foreplay.

229
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:14,092
- My God!
- Where there's smoke.

230
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:18,699
It's typical of men in power. They love
to be dominated. Humiliated.

231
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,129
What did you say?

232
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:23,430
I told him I'd just gone,
maybe another time.

233
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:26,631
I can't keep saying that forever.

234
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:30,642
I peed on a guy once during sex,
but it was an accident.

235
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:33,804
- What did he say?
- I don't think he noticed.

236
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:36,849
I once had to stop eating meat
for six months.

237
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:41,853
So this is what it's come down to...
ready, set, pee?

238
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:45,117
Sometimes with the right guy
you have to make concessions.

239
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:49,161
- There's always gonna be something.
- Are you advocating that I do this?

240
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:51,731
Why not?
He's a great-looking political prince.

241
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,667
Sure, it's practically a fairytale..
"The Princess And The Pee".

242
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,874
If you can't work it out with
Bill, bring him to my party on Friday.

243
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,672
Everyone is bringing a guy
they're no longer interested in.

244
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:09,248
That's a great idea,
I can bring my short guy.

245
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:13,217
You're dating a munchkin and
I'm following the yellow brick road.

246
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:17,984
A couple of nights later, and no closer
to a solution, I had a date with Bill.

247
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,286
We went to
his favorite Indian restaurant,

248
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:23,454
that boasted the hottest curry
in the city.

249
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,657
So I just got some new polls.

250
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,132
I'm ahead in Manhattan and Brooklyn
but I'm lagging in the Bronx.

251
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:33,434
I may have to spend another $15,000
to buy myself some voter turnout.

252
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,667
Pretty hot, isn't it?
Have some water.

253
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,142
No, I'm fine.

254
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,114
Excuse me, can I get another one?
You want a beer?

255
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,446
So, I read your column yesterday.

256
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,748
- You did?
- It's great. very funny.

257
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,758
Just one question. Who's
the handsome politico you refer to?

258
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,295
He's just some other fellow
I'm seeing in Washington.

259
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:01,759
- You don't mind, do you?
- My life is an open book. It has to be.

260
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:09,167
What I love about the column
is the way you feel about it.

261
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,745
It's mutual.
Even if I can't put it in print like you.

262
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,113
I am so crazy about you.

263
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:20,948
Me too.

264
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,450
I was hoping we could spend
the night together

265
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,752
but I have an early
meeting with the Brooklyn...

266
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,953
That's no problem.

267
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,996
Rain check?

268
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:39,538
That Friday night,
charlotte threw her "used date party".

269
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,939
Hi, you made it!

270
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,307
There are so many eligible men here.

271
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:50,508
Hi charlotte, nice apartment.
can I get you something to drink?

272
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:53,017
Yes, immediately, if not sooner.

273
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:55,747
You brought Stanford?

274
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:59,154
You said to bring a man
you're not interested in.

275
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,022
You're making a mockery
of this party.

276
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,630
- carrie, charlotte!
- Hi!

277
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,699
- This is Jeff Fenton.
- Ladies.

278
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:09,166
- How do you do?
- It's a pleasure.

279
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:13,498
- I'll take your coat.
- Take your time.

280
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:15,739
Mingle.

281
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,436
Is he the smallest man
you've ever seen?

282
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:21,844
If you'll excuse me
I have to meet my eligible guests.

283
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,918
I've got to get busy too.

284
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,453
- carrie!
- Hey, what are you doing here?

285
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:40,727
I figured, before I finalize the list,
I should see what's out there.

286
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:47,398
- How's that list going?
- Great, fine.

287
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:52,005
I'm guessing
that's Samantha's little friend.

288
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,172
You gotta go to cuba now.
Another year will be too late.

289
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,113
can't you get arrested for going?

290
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,719
Fly through canada.
They love Americans.

291
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,551
- I'll e-mail you some of my pictures.
- I'd love to see them.

292
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,990
- charlotte, right?
- Right, and...

293
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:11,757
- Greg Miller.
- very nice to meet you, Greg Miller.

294
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:20,073
- Having any luck?
- Excuse me?

295
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:24,905
- Meeting someone.
- I'm already here with somebody.

296
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,943
Yeah, an ex girlfriend, right?

297
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,382
What are you talking about?

298
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,785
Get a clue.

299
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:42,891
- You brought me here to dump me?
- Not exactly.

300
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:47,296
I thought, maybe you could meet
someone your own size.

301
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:51,462
Sweetheart, give me an hour in bed,
you'll swear I'm the Jolly Green Giant.

302
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:55,166
- Really?
- I'm the best you've ever had.

303
00:19:55,343 --> 00:19:58,972
She felt so politically incorrect
about dumping a man for his height.

304
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,411
She felt she had to sleep with him.

305
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,416
Fine. Let's go.

306
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:12,360
oK, I'm ready to go.
There's nobody here for us.

307
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:13,959
Speak for yourself.

308
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,462
If these guys are in their thirties
and these women don't want them,

309
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,499
there might just be
a little something for me.

310
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,693
Talk to you tomorrow.

311
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,575
Hi.

312
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:35,114
I'm an adventure travel junkie. I took
the year off after business school.

313
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,478
Trekked the old spice trail in Asia.

314
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:41,588
Talking to Greg, charlotte felt
like she had unearthed a rare coin

315
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:44,088
that some other woman
had discarded.

316
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:48,753
This is my ex, Belinda Peters,
she hooked me up on this thing.

317
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:54,527
You must be a friend of Karen's.
Thanks for bringing this great man.

318
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:58,160
You're welcome.
can I talk to you for a minute?

319
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,398
Sure. Excuse me.

320
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:04,002
Bye. Thanks for coming.

321
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,648
once Melinda saw
Greg talking to another woman,

322
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,688
he suddenly looked
all shiny and new again.

323
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,495
That night, Jeff proved to Samantha

324
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,696
that he more than made up
for his shortcomings.

325
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,073
Samantha told us later it was like
having sex with a horny smurf.

326
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:49,588
Meanwhile, across town, Steve was
busy stuffing Miranda's ballot box.

327
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:04,497
You know, I'm not looking for a quick
answer in the monogamy thing.

328
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:08,164
It's probably something
that's got to happen on its own.

329
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:17,947
It's just that I wanted you
to know how I feel.

330
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,349
You're the best woman I've ever met.

331
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:26,460
I want you to know... to know that.

332
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,833
I love you, Miranda.
I really do.

333
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:43,502
Steve had just said the one big
pro that outweighed all the cons.

334
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:48,843
Later that week, Samantha put her
heels away and gave Jeff a chance.

335
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:52,145
Little boy's room.
I'll be right back.

336
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:08,164
Samantha was stunned.

337
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,600
It was one thing to date a man
who went to the little boy's room.

338
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:16,142
Another to date one who still shopped
at the little boy's department.

339
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,608
Samantha!

340
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:22,682
I'm not feeling very well.
I've got to go. Goodnight.

341
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,909
Wait, I'll take you.

342
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,448
I'm not really sick. Look, Jeff...

343
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:32,753
I can't do this. It's not a good idea.
I don't want to lead you on.

344
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:36,124
Lead me on?
You came five times the other night.

345
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:39,164
- It's not really that...
- Then, what?

346
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,666
What happened
in the past five minutes?

347
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:46,899
- You shop at the boy's department.
- So, what?

348
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:49,635
The clothes fit me better,
plus they're cheaper.

349
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:53,645
Where do you shop,
the big and tall whore store?

350
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:58,115
You're nothing but a big dick
with a little man attached.

351
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:03,053
You're nothing but a big pair of tits,
with too much extra leg room.

352
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:08,393
Surprisingly, Samantha had found
what she was really looking for.

353
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,929
And it had nothing to do with size.

354
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,067
Somebody get me a booster chair.

355
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:17,637
She'd found a man who made
her laugh. They dated for two weeks.

356
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:21,673
Though he was short, it was
a long relationship for Samantha.

357
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:27,203
That night, parched and nervous,
I spent another night with Bill.

358
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:30,407
- Man, that was great.
- Yes, it was.

359
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:33,516
come on, let's take a shower.

360
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:07,487
come on, get in while it's hot.

361
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:14,520
- can I talk to you about something?
- oK.

362
00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:24,801
I've been giving this peeing thing
a lot of thought,

363
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:29,602
and while I think it's totally fine
that that's what you're into, I just...

364
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:32,405
It's just never really been my thing.

365
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:34,203
oh, yeah?

366
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:39,445
Yeah, so I thought instead,
maybe you could close your eyes

367
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,852
and I could dribble warm tea on you.
That might feel good.

368
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:46,359
or... maybe...

369
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:50,025
...you might think it's fun

370
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:54,897
to hear the sound of running water
when we have sex.

371
00:25:56,337 --> 00:26:01,502
And, if things got really serious
between us, I could...

372
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:06,113
maybe, even, leave the bathroom door
open sometime.

373
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,583
Although, I'm really not sure how
comfortable I'd be with that either.

374
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:17,080
You know, there's something
I want to tell you too.

375
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:20,853
Some people connected
with the campaign read your column...

376
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:23,929
and they had a different take on it.

377
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:30,433
- What does that mean?
- They said it was funny and clever,

378
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:33,438
but that it was a lot about sex.

379
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:40,343
They don't think I should date
a sex columnist before the election.

380
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,549
They thought it was kind of seamy.

381
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:52,517
Wait a second, I may write about sex,
but you like people to pee on you.

382
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,695
Yeah, but nobody knows about that.

383
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:12,311
I realized that politics had entered
my bedroom as well as my bathroom.

384
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:18,042
I decided that my bravest political act
would be to tell the truth.

385
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:27,557
I didn't use his real name.
It was much more political not to.
