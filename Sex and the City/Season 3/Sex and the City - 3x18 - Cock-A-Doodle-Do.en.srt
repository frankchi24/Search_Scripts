1
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:10,184
What?

2
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,018
In life, there are
all sorts of wake-up calls.

3
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:24,064
But crowing on East 73rd Street

4
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:26,724
was one I was not prepared for.

5
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,839
It was my own fault.

6
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,741
I'd let my frenzy for a rent-controlled
apartment near Barneys,

7
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:42,680
override the fact that it was
animal-hospital adjacent.

8
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:48,155
That's the thing about New York - you
never know what's around the corner.

9
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:53,820
Or, in Samantha's case,
just outside your window.

10
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:17,576
There they were - Samantha's
neighborhood transsexual hookers.

11
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:20,847
Half man, half woman,
totally annoying.

12
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:23,621
Girl, she got herself
a handful with that one!

13
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:27,057
He was all up in my stuff once.

14
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:31,666
I told him to get that thing
out of my ass or I'll shit on it.

15
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:38,869
"Get that out my ass, or I'll shit on it. "
Is that the dirtiest thing ever?

16
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,134
Let's hope so!

17
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,245
I am paying to live in a neighborhood

18
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,643
that's trendy by day
and tranny by night.

19
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:49,751
- Tranny?
- Transsexuals. Chicks with dicks.

20
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,943
Boobs on top, balls down below.

21
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:56,217
- I don't get the appeal there.
- It's the other white meat.

22
00:02:56,392 --> 00:03:01,694
I understand that pseudo-straight men
have to get laid, but not on my block.

23
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:04,094
I thought my chickens were bad.

24
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:08,464
Every morning at 4:00am they start.
It's like they're putting on a show.

25
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:11,835
The "Up-my-ass Players".

26
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,369
Too early for tranny talk?

27
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:22,449
It's so weird to be sitting here
eating omelet again

28
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,552
like nothing ever happened.

29
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,211
It was our first
Saturday morning breakfast

30
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,416
since Charlotte had left Trey,
her husband of three months.

31
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:35,757
I was married.
And now, what? I'm single again?

32
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:40,459
- You're not single, just separated.
- That's right.

33
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:44,639
I'll never be single again...
I'll be divorced.

34
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:49,503
The only thing worse than being 34
and single is being 34 and divorced.

35
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,111
Thanks.

36
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:55,807
I think it's worse to be 34 and trapped
in a marriage that doesn't work.

37
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:59,148
- Did I try hard enough?
- "Hard" is the word.

38
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:02,654
Sweetie, Trey has
an impotence problem...

39
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:08,127
I am so sick of talking about Trey.
I think and talk about Trey all the time.

40
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:13,425
Change the subject, please.
Talk about the "up my ass" stuff.

41
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,361
OK, here's the plan.

42
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:20,941
Sunday, we all come over, have
an unpacking party and no Trey-talk.

43
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,839
I'll bring the cocktails.

44
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,174
I'll bring the food.
How about roof-chicken?

45
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:34,015
Can I help you?

46
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:37,022
I live around the corner
and my window

47
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:41,151
looks over the roof
with the chickens and the crowing...

48
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,195
- Roosters.
- Excuse me?

49
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:45,697
They are roosters.
Roosters crow.

50
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:49,936
Yes, they do.
And very loudly.

51
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:55,042
Sorry. We just got them. Rescued
from a cockfight in the Bronx.

52
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,735
- My God.
- I'll move them to the basement.

53
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:01,815
You don't have to do that.
They had all that fight-trauma.

54
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:05,112
They need fresh air.
I don't want them to be miserable.

55
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:08,586
Don't worry.
They have a very lovely life.

56
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,555
That's all right. I'll get over it.

57
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,161
Thank you for being so nice.

58
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:20,424
Just gonna take one of these
for my friend. She has a cat.

59
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:29,404
Are you hungry?

60
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,807
Yeah?
I'm hungry too.

61
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:56,827
- Shanghai Garden. May I help you?
- I'd like to order some take-out.

62
00:05:57,005 --> 00:06:02,602
- Address, please.
- 331 West 78th Street. Apartment 4F.

63
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:05,838
I'd like to order some chicken
with broccoli in a brown...

64
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:09,177
Brown sauce with brown rice.
Cold noodles.

65
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:12,582
I know. Every night the same.

66
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,847
Right.

67
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:18,858
The Chinese take-out lady
thinks I'm pathetic.

68
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:21,757
She said,
"Every night, the same thing. "

69
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,160
That's a tad bitchy for a take-out lady.

70
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,733
- Do you think I'm in a rut?
- A food-rut?

71
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:30,599
I'm sitting home with my cat, ordering
the same thing almost every night.

72
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:35,266
The only thing sadder would be
a Cathy Comic on my refrigerator.

73
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,036
Never say Cathy Comic to me again.

74
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:40,875
She giggled at me. The take-out lady.

75
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:45,247
Order from someplace else. There's
600 Chinese places on your block.

76
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,823
This place is my favorite. It's easier
than figuring out where else to go.

77
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:52,492
Then bear the take-out food shame.

78
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,930
There they were.
Our ex-boyfriends.

79
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:03,703
What are they doing together?
Are they friends now?

80
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,737
Apparently. This is bad.

81
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:09,742
What do you think
they are talking about? Their dogs?

82
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:13,211
Yeah, here's their conversation:
"How's your dog? Good, yours?

83
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:16,010
Was that the bitches
who ruined our lives?"

84
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:18,209
They didn't see us.

85
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:28,955
We have a choice. We can run
the other way or move in here.

86
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:32,632
We can't run.

87
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,133
These shoe-straps will break.

88
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:39,996
- How do I look?
- Good. Great!

89
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,143
You look great too.

90
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:45,439
Thank God I didn't wear
my drawstring pants.

91
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,319
Look who it is!

92
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:06,965
Another thing about New York -
who knows who is around the corner?

93
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:10,502
This is what I like about New York.
Street-traffic.

94
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:16,038
Well, look at you.

95
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,412
Look who it is, Pete.

96
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:27,716
My God!
Look how big he got.

97
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,914
He starts college next year.

98
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:33,021
You must be very proud.

99
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:37,928
Two beers at a time. Did we
give you guys a drinking problem?

100
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,232
They are not just for us.

101
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:46,134
I'll have nightmares
about that ladies room for weeks.

102
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:49,504
Carrie and Miranda,
this is Jessica and Susan.

103
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,077
Hello.

104
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:54,272
Honey, do you still wanna see
the movie or just crash?

105
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:55,711
I don't care.

106
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,416
- We have to go.
- Yeah, we gotta go.

107
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:06,584
It was good to see you, Aidan.

108
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:15,535
Come on, this way.

109
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:22,969
That night at Charlotte's - light
unpacking and heavy realisations.

110
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,909
Well, they're over us.

111
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,242
It's just so hilarious.

112
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,510
I'm hemorrhaging inside.

113
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:36,181
We thought they were pining
and they have new girlfriends already!

114
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,452
- Were they cute?
- The point is not if they were cute.

115
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:42,222
The point is, they were there.

116
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:45,195
- They were cute.
- Very cute.

117
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,426
How can they have
new relationships?

118
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:50,332
I'm still in the "I just broke up
with someone" phase.

119
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:55,465
It's infuriating. Women sit around
obsessing about what went wrong.

120
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,646
Men just say "all righty" and move on.

121
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:03,274
I take offence at that. Not all women
sit around and obsess about men.

122
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,578
As soon as my relationships
are over, I move on.

123
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,553
- Relationships?
- You know, dates.

124
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:16,289
I do try to figure out what went wrong.
But I don't think that I obsess.

125
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:19,832
You are Miss Obsess. Big?

126
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,196
Big was tricky.
I still don't knowwhat happened.

127
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:28,308
You should have
a relationship rear-view mirror.

128
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,776
Relationships may appear closer
than they actually are.

129
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:36,384
I didn't obsess about Aidan.
Aidan was clear. He moved on.

130
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:40,214
- It's much easier for men to move on.
- Is it?

131
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:44,586
Please! The ratio of women to men
in this city is huge.

132
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,024
They can sit outside, have a beer

133
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:50,255
and wait for the Jessicas
and Susans to come to them.

134
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:54,368
Maybe we only obsess over
relationships that feel unfinished.

135
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:58,438
I can guarantee that Trey
isn't sitting around with his friends,

136
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:00,632
obsessing about what went wrong.

137
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,334
Men never think anything is their fault.

138
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:05,377
I wish there were no men.

139
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:08,846
Call someone, she's gone insane.

140
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,986
If there were no men,
then we wouldn't feel hurt.

141
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,884
And we wouldn't be disappointed.

142
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:19,186
And we wouldn't be spending
our night obsessing about them.

143
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,295
I'm so over men.

144
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:26,434
What? I am.

145
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:30,470
Later that night I got to thinking about
men, women and relationships.

146
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,973
Or more to the point, howwomen feel
men disappoint them in relationships.

147
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:39,512
Then a radical, earth-shattering
thought popped into my head.

148
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:42,616
What if everything
isn't the man's fault?

149
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,912
After a certain age
and a certain number of relationships,

150
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:50,250
if it still isn't working and the ex's
seem to be moving on and we don't,

151
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,916
perhaps the problem
isn't the last boyfriend,

152
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:56,120
or the one before him
or even the one before him.

153
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,631
Could it be
that the problem isn't them,

154
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:03,396
but horror of horrors,
is it us?

155
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,608
Downtown, the "Up-my-ass Players"

156
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:11,177
were in the middle
of their late night repertory.

157
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,338
"Much Ado About Up My Ass"
and "Long Day's Journey Up My Ass".

158
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:22,487
Samantha decided if she was gonna
get a good night's sleep,

159
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:27,151
she'd have to test how effective
a PR professional she was.

160
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,058
Ladies, hello.

161
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:35,161
I live right up there,
the loft within earshot.

162
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,204
As much as I respect a woman's right

163
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:41,900
for a little something
with certain New Jersey gentlemen,

164
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,045
I have a request.

165
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:46,703
I have a very early business meeting.

166
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,975
And I think we all know,

167
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,520
there are certain dark circles
even the best make-up can't cover.

168
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,316
Am I right?

169
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:59,426
Sorry to wake you, baby.
We'll take it down here.

170
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:03,963
I appreciate it.
By the way, I'm Samantha.

171
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:06,793
- Destiny.
- Chyna.

172
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:10,768
- Jo.
- No "e". She got the "e" cut off.

173
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,540
Those heels are fierce, Miss Girl.

174
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,604
Don't I know it.

175
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:23,082
Samantha knew
howto get her way with men,

176
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,947
even if they were half women.

177
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,158
What?

178
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,457
'Rough night?'

179
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:39,862
- Who is this?
- It's me.

180
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,904
I didn't recognize your voice.
You sounded different.

181
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,600
Did I wake you?
It's only 11:30.

182
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:53,407
No, I was up late working.

183
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:58,109
And there are these chickens
that crow on the roof next door.

184
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:01,221
Roosters. Roosters crow.

185
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,984
The "Fun On The Farm" fact
everyone's aware of but me.

186
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,620
- So tell me, is red a mistake?
- In what way?

187
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:12,732
I'm repainting my bedroom.

188
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:15,802
- A red bedroom?
- Just one wall.

189
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:19,873
But I think it's too red.

190
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,369
It's like sleeping in communist china.

191
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:30,681
She left... We ended it.

192
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:36,588
- I heard.
- You did? How?

193
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,253
I think it was on the news.

194
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,766
Could we have lunch sometime?

195
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,301
I really need to talk to you.

196
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:53,133
- Please?
- Where?

197
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:58,644
Boathouse restaurant, Central Park.
How about Saturday at 2:00?

198
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:02,913
- Carrie?
- I'm nodding.

199
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,247
- So I'll see you at 2:00 then.
- Bye.

200
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:13,817
Later that day, I met Miranda
at my favorite thrift store,

201
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,929
to dig for buried treasure.

202
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:20,227
Do you think I can get away with
a "Hang in there, baby" halter top?

203
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:24,668
Nobody gets away with
a "Hang in there, baby" halter top.

204
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:28,572
Do you wanna go to the
Hopper exhibit Saturday afternoon?

205
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:30,768
I can't. I have to work.

206
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,183
I lied.
I don't have to work.

207
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:42,720
I'm meeting Big for lunch
and I didn't think you'd approve.

208
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,724
- You're meeting Big?
- He called.

209
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:50,297
- He sounded upset and needs to talk.
- Since when does Big talk?

210
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,762
What does that mean?

211
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:58,768
He's upset about Natasha leaving...

212
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:02,238
I'm not holding your hand
through this again.

213
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,005
I'm not asking you to hold anything.
We're just having lunch.

214
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:08,149
It's a huge mistake.

215
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:11,217
It's not a huge mistake, it's lunch.

216
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:16,187
How many more times are you gonna
go through this? He is bad for you.

217
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:21,226
Every time you get near him you turn
into this pathetic, needy victim.

218
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,160
What pisses me off is that you are
more than willing to go back for more.

219
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:29,029
I am not going back for more
and I can't even believe...

220
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,797
I can't believe
you would say that to me.

221
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:35,272
- If you start up with Big again...
- I am not starting up with Big again.

222
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,968
If you do, I don't wanna know
anything about it.

223
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:40,171
No calls. No crying.

224
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:43,249
Are you gonna cut me out of your life
like you did to Steve?

225
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,680
What?

226
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,879
The first sign of any little weakness
and you just write people off.

227
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:52,788
My God, Miranda.
You are so judgmental.

228
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:58,888
You can say I'm pathetic and needy
and I can't say anything to you?

229
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:02,161
Everybody is not
as tough as you, Miranda.

230
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,897
People... Some of us make mistakes.

231
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,943
That's just perfect.
Walk away.

232
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:15,007
It's all my fault.

233
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:18,448
Right there,
next to the two for $5 bin,

234
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,054
Miranda and I had our first big fight.

235
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,585
'You have no messages. '

236
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,560
I thought by the time I got home,
she'd have left an apology.

237
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,376
I was gonna call her,
but wasn't quite sure what to say.

238
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,672
Or whose fault it really was.

239
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:50,609
And at the exact
same moment across town,

240
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:54,721
Miranda was preparing to make
the call she'd been dreading all day.

241
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,986
'Shanghai Garden.
May I help you?'

242
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,095
I'd like to order some takeout.

243
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:04,094
'Address, please. '

244
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:08,827
331 West 78th Street, Apartment 4F.
I'd like some...

245
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:13,963
'Chicken with broccoli, brown sauce,
brown rice and cold noodles, right?'

246
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:17,373
You know what?
I don't need this. Never mind.

247
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,137
'OK. Bye-bye. '

248
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:22,943
After she hung up, Miranda couldn't
get the giggle out of her head.

249
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:26,913
She decided to walk the two blocks
to confront the woman

250
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:31,047
with the judgmental giggle
who thought she was better than her.

251
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:34,995
Shanghai Garden.
May I help you?

252
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,190
OK. Address, please.

253
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:47,399
224 West 78th... Sorry, 73.

254
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:56,143
Miranda realized the giggle wasn't
about her. It wasn't about anything.

255
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:06,755
It wasn't the noodles that kept her
coming back to this restaurant.

256
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,954
It was the fact that
this was their place

257
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:11,292
and it was filled with happy memories.

258
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,367
Twice in one week.
Am I lucky or what?

259
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:24,570
- I thought I got custody of this place.
- I like their hot and sour soup.

260
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:29,342
Are you here by yourself?
Me too. Sit down.

261
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:33,578
I've got this bowl of crunchies
that I'll never get through.

262
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,921
How are you?

263
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:41,186
Not good.
Carrie and I had a huge fight.

264
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,227
About what?

265
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:48,802
Me, her, you, Big... Me.

266
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:56,804
My judgmental stuff.
How bad was it?

267
00:19:56,978 --> 00:20:01,312
- It wasn't good.
- I didn't throwyou away. Did I?

268
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,282
- No.
- She said I did.

269
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:10,280
Miranda, only you and I really know
what happened between you and I.

270
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,325
It's nobody else's business.

271
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:20,632
But she said that, huh?
Must've been pretty mad.

272
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:26,798
I didn't say nice things to her either.
I just don't want her to get hurt again.

273
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:29,408
So you yelled at her?

274
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,001
Yeah.

275
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:36,140
Sounds about par.

276
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,376
I guess your new girlfriend
doesn't yell.

277
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:39,918
No.

278
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:42,147
How's that going?

279
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:44,791
It's ok.

280
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:49,726
- Like to order?
- I'd like the chicken with broccoli...

281
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:55,901
Let me see the menu.
I should try something new.

282
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,971
You should.
Go ahead. Live a little.

283
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,400
There is so much.

284
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:10,082
You're so fucking hot.

285
00:21:10,718 --> 00:21:14,484
I can't believe they go away for one
night and then back three in a row.

286
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:16,919
Forget them. Look at me.

287
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,553
I'm sorry. I'm here.

288
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,598
Where are those cops?
I called them half an hour ago.

289
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,001
Look at me.
Let's bring it on home.

290
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:35,136
I can't.

291
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,210
- I'm close.
- Well, I'm not.

292
00:21:40,314 --> 00:21:43,442
The idea that she'd miss
a night's sleep pissed Samantha off.

293
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:47,711
The idea that she'd miss an orgasm,
was more than she could bear.

294
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:51,658
Shut up, you bitches!
I've called the cops.

295
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:53,691
Suck my cock!

296
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:57,126
Keep talking and I'll come down there
and cut it off for you.

297
00:21:57,331 --> 00:22:03,167
I'd like to see you try, motherfucker.
You think we want that BS? No way!

298
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,402
Are you gonna pull a Lorena Bobbit?

299
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:14,173
$7,000 a month and I have to put up
with a trilogy of fucking trannies?

300
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:16,942
I don't fucking think so!

301
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:21,214
I am a taxpayer and member of
the Women's Business Association.

302
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:25,189
- I don't have to put up with this shit!
- Forget them and come back to bed.

303
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,352
There was nothing anyone could do
to stop her. Samantha was obsessed.

304
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:33,898
She had a date with Destiny,
Chyna and Jo, no "e".

305
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:36,093
Take this, ladies!

306
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:42,005
I'm gonna come up there
and kick your ass, bitch!

307
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:48,110
Get off my hair now!

308
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,752
'Move it along, girls. '

309
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:57,824
You heard the man, move it along.

310
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,985
Hey, where are you going?

311
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:04,927
Home. You freak me out.

312
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:10,226
And Uptown, Charlotte was
a bit freaked out as well.

313
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:12,565
Unable to sleep
and unable to unpack,

314
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,404
she was with the only man
she could tolerate - The Dalai Lama.

315
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,740
- Charlotte? It's me.
- Trey?

316
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,384
What are you doing here?
It's 4:00am.

317
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:32,686
I sawyour light on from the street.
I figured you'd still be up.

318
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,885
What do you want?

319
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:38,189
Ever since you left,
I can't stop thinking about you.

320
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:44,001
- Honey, we're separated.
- I know.

321
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,634
Once Charlotte swore off men,
this man couldn't get enough of her.

322
00:23:56,884 --> 00:24:00,786
He wasn't a rooster and it wasn't
the Bronx but from deep inside,

323
00:24:00,955 --> 00:24:03,253
Trey's cock began to crow.

324
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:10,561
Across town, I was still wide awake.

325
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:13,825
I couldn't get my fight with Miranda
out of my head.

326
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:19,439
I was not only capable of obsessing
about relationships with men,

327
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:23,873
I was capable of obsessing
about relationships with women.

328
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:39,817
East Side Animal Shelter.
Please leave a message.

329
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:43,395
This is your neighbor
who complained about the chickens.

330
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:47,898
I can't take it any more.
Move them in. Thanks.

331
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:52,728
I figured if they had a lovely life,
I was entitled to the same thing.

332
00:24:57,612 --> 00:24:58,738
Well...

333
00:25:00,348 --> 00:25:02,612
All righty.

334
00:25:02,783 --> 00:25:05,411
I knewthat was in me somewhere.

335
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:07,451
You did?

336
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:11,787
I just hadn't felt it since before...

337
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:17,259
Why did you stop yourself?
Before what?

338
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:19,991
Since before we got engaged.

339
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:22,566
Oh.

340
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:25,137
Yeah. Oh.

341
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,069
Do you think our whole problem
had to do with the fact that...

342
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:34,610
What?

343
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:36,579
Say it.

344
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:40,816
- You didn't really wanna marry me.
- No.

345
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:48,087
I think it may be due to the fact that
I didn't want to get married at all.

346
00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:52,756
- Then why did you?
- I guess I thought it was time.

347
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:57,893
I'm of a certain age,
people expect you to get married.

348
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:01,803
Yes, well... That sounds familiar.

349
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,977
- One other thing...
- What?

350
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:09,409
I married you because I knew

351
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,314
I'd never find anyone
as wonderful as you to marry.

352
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:47,682
He may have gone away,
the pre-op transsexual,

353
00:26:47,855 --> 00:26:50,585
but he came back, loaded with eggs.

354
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:53,555
Nowwho's laughing, bitch?

355
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,262
Samantha knewthis was
one relationship with a man

356
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,390
she couldn't walk away from.

357
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,435
Because this man was half woman.

358
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:10,502
- Good, you're there.
- I was just gonna call you.

359
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:12,839
Do you really think I'm pathetic?

360
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:16,779
No, I'm so sorry.
I don't think you're pathetic at all.

361
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,886
I'm outside the restaurant,
hiding in some bushes.

362
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,181
Do you still not think I'm pathetic?

363
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:25,990
'I knowyou think it's a huge mistake. '

364
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,425
It's just something I feel
I need to do to move on.

365
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:33,431
Don't listen to me. I have no idea
what's right for you and Big.

366
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:38,595
But if I'm wrong and it is a mistake,
I need to know you'll be there for me.

367
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:40,263
I'm there.

368
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:44,172
I'm going in.
Any last minute advice?

369
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:48,247
Don't let him kiss you. That seems
to be where you get into trouble.

370
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,579
- 'Carrie?'
- I'm nodding.

371
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,362
Hello, you.

372
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,167
Hello, you.

373
00:28:18,145 --> 00:28:19,976
It's good to see you.

374
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:37,096
Are you OK?

375
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:42,397
My hair is in a duck pond.

376
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,401
My Dior purse.

377
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:46,197
I'll get it.

378
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:53,408
Oh, my God! What is that?

379
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:04,546
- Howwas your shower?
- I no longer smell of pond.

380
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:12,657
Exactly how many
terry-cloth robes do you have?

381
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,358
- Three or four.
- Oh, three or four.

382
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:21,639
I swore I would never be in this room
with you again.

383
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:25,973
You said to take you
to the nearest shower.

384
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:32,149
That is one red wall.

385
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,152
Yes, it's red.

386
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,492
I gotta ask you a question.

387
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:49,667
- Was it all my fault?
- No.

388
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:53,566
It wasn't all your fault.

389
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:57,643
We really screwed that up.
What were we thinking?

390
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:01,271
I have no idea.

391
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,815
Fuck. I was counting on you
for answers.

392
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:15,120
- How are you doing, kid?
- Pretty good. How are you doing?

393
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,820
Good.

394
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:20,398
Aside from the fact
I feel like I've been through a war.

395
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:26,806
Really, we're like war buddies.
War buddies in Calvin Klein robes.

396
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:36,281
I hate to admit this,
but I kind of like living alone again.

397
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,482
Why doesn't that surprise me?

398
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:55,224
- I should go.
- Don't you want to stay a while?

399
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:57,267
I can't.

400
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:59,462
Why?

401
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:04,776
Because, sweet friend,

402
00:31:04,945 --> 00:31:08,506
you and I are like that red wall.

403
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,881
It's a good idea in theory.
But somehow, it doesn't quite work.

404
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,821
And just like that, I realized
Big and I weren't "us" any more.

405
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:29,459
We had become something else.
What it was, I had no idea.

406
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:50,250
'You have one new message. '

407
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:54,827
(Miranda) It's me. I'm wondering how
it went. Call me when you get home.

408
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:12,240
I had no idea where the chickens had
gone, but I hoped it wasn't the Bronx.

409
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:14,404
And I hoped they were happy.

410
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:23,854
Who wants a wiener?

411
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:26,049
Girl, I'm trying to get rid of one.

412
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:30,830
The next Saturday, Samantha decided
to throw a kiss and make up party

413
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:33,193
for the "Up-my-ass Players".

414
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,495
Trey called me three times last week.
He's dying to get back together.

415
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,071
But I don't know.
Is that wise?

416
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:44,442
- I'm obsessing again, aren't I?
- A bit.

417
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:46,602
So, what are we all drinking?

418
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,943
"Flirtinis. " Vodka, pineapple
and champagne.

419
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:51,982
Flirtinis.

420
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:56,486
- Destiny made them.
- I'm past a Flirtini. I need a "Fucktini".

421
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:59,091
Watch your language.
There are ladies present.

422
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:01,193
Where?

423
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:06,623
- You with the flower.
- Are you talking to me?

424
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,701
It's you, girl. Come on.

425
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:15,272
- What do you want?
- I want you to give me a swirl.

426
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:18,002
I need to see you spin first, sister.

427
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,451
- Is that good enough?
- Give me the shake.

428
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:30,848
Don't mind the weight.
Eat something.

429
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:44,533
Don't worry,
they have a very lovely life.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
