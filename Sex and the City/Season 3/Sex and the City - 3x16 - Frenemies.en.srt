1
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,958
In a city where cynicism
is as prevalent as pashmina,

2
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:55,297
there is nothing more hopeful
than getting ready for the first date.

3
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,805
Will O'Connor
was a cute urban planner

4
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,000
Miranda had met at Starbucks.

5
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,668
He mistook her latte
for his double-caff

6
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:05,711
and offered to make it up to her

7
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,906
by buying her a drink that Saturday.

8
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,315
Samantha preferred the saying
good night to the first date routine.

9
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,387
His name was Sebastian Wise.

10
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,683
For Sam, it was a very good night.

11
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,452
Meanwhile, Trey and Charlotte

12
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,652
were practicing their new routine.

13
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:26,029
- All righty. Schooner's sails are up.
- Yes, I can feel it.

14
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:28,693
All righty,
I'm bringing it into the harbor.

15
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,896
Bring it in.

16
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:36,210
All right. Here I come.

17
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:39,281
Here I come.

18
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,315
Honey?

19
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:49,022
The wind died. I'm sorry.

20
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,390
After a week of the same routine,

21
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:59,295
the only thing getting up
in their bed was Charlotte's libido.

22
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:03,460
As for me, my routine
had become very routine.

23
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:07,439
I was spending
almost every night working.

24
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:11,844
My date is three hours late.

25
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:14,175
I'm being stood up, right?

26
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:16,351
- Maybe he got lost.
- Carrie.

27
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,544
Doesn't look good.

28
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,316
And I'm wearing a new dress.
And I'm eating out of plastic.

29
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:24,356
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:28,964
The least he could do is
get to know me before he rejects me.

31
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:31,725
Yeah, that's illegal dumping.

32
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,927
It's crazy. This hasn't happened
to me since I'm 27.

33
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:40,371
I should know better. I thought I'd got
smarter about picking them now.

34
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,943
I can't believe guys still stand girls up.

35
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,580
I can't believe
I'm eating a frozen dinner.

36
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,911
I'm such a cliche.
Do you wanna grab a drink?

37
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:50,985
I can't. I have to work.

38
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:54,247
I agreed to teach
these stupid Learning Annex classes.

39
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:57,187
They're calling it
"Bright Lights Date City".

40
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:01,454
- I'm so embarrassed for you.
- They're paying 300 bucks a pop.

41
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,157
It's a seminar on where to meet men.
Apparently, I'm an expert.

42
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:09,293
- Tell them to steer clear of Starbucks.
- Who would pay for this?

43
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,906
Now? Maybe me.

44
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:17,645
OK, gotta go. This dress
is making a mockery of me.

45
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:22,113
- I'm sorry, sweetie. Bye.
- Please. Bye.

46
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:25,082
Stood up at 27,
Miranda had done nothing.

47
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:30,658
At 34, she decided she wasn't going
to take this stand-up lying down.

48
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:35,854
Will gave her the cold shoulder...
and his home number.

49
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:38,693
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Will there?

50
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,428
- Who's speaking, please?
- Miranda Hobbes.

51
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:43,936
Miranda, this is Will's mother.

52
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,937
Well, Will's mother.

53
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:50,477
I don't know howyou raised your son,
but he just stood me up for a date.

54
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,773
Will died today.

55
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,846
- They're starting to die on us.
- Oh, my God.

56
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,956
- At least you weren't stood up.
- 35 and they're dying.

57
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:05,253
- We should give up now.
- It explains why they don't call back.

58
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:08,521
- How did he...
- Heart attack at the gym.

59
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:12,191
- This is why I don't work out.
- Do you wanna hear the worst part?

60
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:14,836
I felt so bad, I told his mother
I would go to the wake.

61
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,736
- You don't even know him.
- And she never will.

62
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:23,538
I'm far from being dead. I got us
reservations at Samba next week.

63
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:26,738
- Fancy.
- I could only get us a four-top.

64
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,350
Do you think
Trey would mind staying home?

65
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:32,851
No. He doesn't seem up
for much these days.

66
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,684
Charlotte, is everything OK?

67
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,624
We've been trying to...

68
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,959
Fuck?

69
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:49,161
Whatever. It's just not...

70
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:52,603
- Getting big and hard?
- Is this dirty mad libs?

71
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:56,302
I love him, and he's trying,
but this is so frustrating.

72
00:04:56,512 --> 00:05:01,575
- Of course it is.
- Last night I got so turned on, I...

73
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,347
You almost masturbated, he almost
got it up - you almost had sex.

74
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:11,926
- Next to him! I feel so ashamed.
- Everybody masturbates.

75
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:15,062
- I did it this morning.
- That's why I got your voicemail.

76
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:19,793
He masturbates and reads porn.
When it comes to me, nothing.

77
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,266
- Madonna/whore.
- You think?

78
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:26,465
Trey sees you as his virginal wife,
not as sexual plaything.

79
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:30,806
You're not going to get anywhere
until you change how he sees you.

80
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,744
- I don't know if I can do that.
- Yes, you can.

81
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,750
You're sexy. He should see you.
You're something to see.

82
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:46,956
I soon realized how many desperate
New York women there were.

83
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,999
I'm flattered that so many of you
showed up to hear me talk.

84
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:06,180
The fact is, I have had
a lot of experience with men.

85
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:09,909
Some of it good,
some of it bad, some of it very ugly.

86
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:16,750
There are
two million single men in this city.

87
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:20,417
I have dated about a million of them.

88
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:23,656
All these men
are right outside your door.

89
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:29,793
Next time you step out with
your shoes and traveling cappuccino,

90
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:34,932
take a look around.
Our metropolis is stacked with men.

91
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,272
You never knowwho you'll run into.
You can turn a corner,

92
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:41,348
and boom - bright lights, date city.

93
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,352
Could you be more specific?

94
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:50,583
Do you mean places to meet men?

95
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,718
Sure.

96
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,228
Let's see. Samba.

97
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,697
Any sporting...
Sports bars - Mickey Mantle's.

98
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,770
I've gone there.
All the men were married.

99
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:04,928
Really?

100
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:13,181
Let's see. I once met this fellow
on the Hampton Jitney.

101
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,809
It turned out he couldn't drive,
and he was on a parole program.

102
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:19,613
That's a bad example.

103
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:22,188
Suddenly, I felt like the bad example.

104
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,849
Yes, you.

105
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,655
- Are you married?
- No.

106
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:30,328
Yes, you there.

107
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:34,435
- Have you ever been married?
- No, not that I'm aware of.

108
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,366
Yes, you in the back.

109
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:39,371
How old are you?

110
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:44,603
I'm really not an expert on men.
I just write about this stuff.

111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,479
Then why are we paying
to hear you talk about it?

112
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,315
Be quiet.

113
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,956
She's older than us.
We can learn something.

114
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:02,556
The only thing I learned that night
was that I should have stayed home.

115
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,529
- Can I smoke in here?
- No.

116
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:09,967
If you stay single long enough,
you should get wiser about dating.

117
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,099
Which men, where to meet them...
But what made us experts?

118
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:18,735
Wasn't our single status a neon sign
that we couldn't get it right?

119
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,474
What if all these years in New York

120
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:24,245
have only made us older,
more confused or dead?

121
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:27,649
Are we getting wiser or just older?

122
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,786
If they'd been holding tomatoes
not Louis Vuitton bags, I'd be dead.

123
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:37,728
- Or at least gazpacho.
- Do you know there are no free men?

124
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,733
We're at my date's wake, so yes.

125
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:44,464
- They were so hostile.
- Fuck 'em.

126
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,202
What do I know about men. All I have
is a bunch of failed relationships.

127
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,938
- And one affair.
- Thanks.

128
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,379
As if being dead-person adjacent
isn't bad enough.

129
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,679
I'm supposed to teach another class.
What am I going to do?

130
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:01,118
Hire a bodyguard.

131
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,622
This is my first wake.

132
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,386
Don't expect a goodie bag.

133
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:11,230
Oh, my God, open casket.
I've never seen a dead body before.

134
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:14,834
- Let's get out of here.
- We can't. People are looking at us.

135
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,674
He's cute.

136
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:31,285
Was.

137
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:33,916
Damn.

138
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,289
This would have helped me. A place
to meet men - an after wake party.

139
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:46,662
- He had money set aside for this.
- It's nice.

140
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:50,134
- "I'm dead. Enjoy the buffet. "
- I like him even more now.

141
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53,832
- He was so organized he had a will.
- And attractive friends.

142
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,809
- This place is full of men.
- Look howfreaked out they look.

143
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,949
They know any minute
they're out of here.

144
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:02,344
Carrie?

145
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,047
It's me, Jim.

146
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,819
Oh, my God.

147
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,116
Jim.

148
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:16,127
- Your hair.
- I cut it for a real job. I'm an engineer.

149
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,789
- On the railroad?
- Civil.

150
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:23,028
- What happened to the band?
- Turns out I wasn't talented.

151
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,971
Miranda, sorry, this is Jim.

152
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:30,873
- We dated a grillion years ago.
- Or eight.

153
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,674
Miranda. Nice to meet you.

154
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,841
I'd ask if you're having fun,
but that seems inappropriate.

155
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,782
It is, and we are. Thanks.

156
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:42,185
- You were friends with Will?
- May he rest.

157
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:46,987
Roommates in college.
We were friends, but competitive.

158
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:49,630
We were always
fighting it out for everything.

159
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:53,029
He even died first,
just to beat me to the punch.

160
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,795
- Bad.
- But you laughed.

161
00:10:55,971 --> 00:11:00,169
- You were the classic frenemies.
- Frenemies. Nice word.

162
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:02,207
- I'm a writer.
- I know.

163
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:04,937
- I'm a lawyer.
- And I'm not drunk enough.

164
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:07,343
- Can I get you anything?
- Martini.

165
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:10,041
- No.
- Don't go anywhere. I'll be back.

166
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:12,118
He's kind of cute.

167
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,584
- He's kind of an asshole.
- Really?

168
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:19,625
- Yes, indeedy.
- He seems great.

169
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,059
That's what I thought
when I dated him.

170
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:26,666
When it wasn't working, and
I broke up with him, "Hello, asshole. "

171
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:30,737
Snide comments,
rumor spreading, the works.

172
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,601
But he's so cute.

173
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,667
- Incoming.
- Outgoing.

174
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,239
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

175
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:43,680
I would love to chat inappropriately,
but I'm due to give a toast.

176
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,150
So this is a working wake for you.

177
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:50,382
I'd love to get together
with you sometime.

178
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,359
Here's my card. My e-mail address
is on the back, and my cell.

179
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:00,023
Will's death had turned Miranda
into my target audience -

180
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,295
a desperate woman.

181
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,838
Downtown,
Samantha was getting wise,

182
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,943
Sebastian Wise, again.

183
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:13,547
While, uptown,
Charlotte was getting nothing at all.

184
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:17,448
- We almost broke the bed.
- You can't break a bed.

185
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:21,316
- What does this stallion do?
- I'm not sure.

186
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,618
- Does he go to Mickey Mantle's?
- You got me.

187
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,194
How can you not know?
You slept with him.

188
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:30,126
I fucked him.
He made me come six times.

189
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,129
It's good enough for me.

190
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,995
Stop it.

191
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:37,536
Why do you always
talk about sex like that?

192
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,401
Because I can.

193
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:42,008
Simmer down,
mommy hasn't had her caffeine yet.

194
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:44,168
I can't take this any more.

195
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,505
Frittata.

196
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:51,808
Sex is something special between
two people who love each other.

197
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,386
- Or two people who love sex.
- You're such a...

198
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,956
A what? What am I?

199
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,993
You can't just sleep
with everything that comes along.

200
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,597
Hey, Mrs. Softie,
at least I'm getting laid.

201
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,328
You can forget Samba.

202
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:11,699
She needs the stick out of her ass
and a dick in her coochie pronto.

203
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:15,604
- Not getting involved.
- I'm with her.

204
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:18,837
You knowwhat? I don't need this.

205
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,414
Maybe you should forget Samba too.

206
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:30,188
- We knewthis was coming.
- It's so sad and petty.

207
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:35,728
- I'm staying way out of this one.
- Way out. New Jersey out.

208
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:41,199
Speaking of petty, how upset
would you be if I went out with Jim?

209
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:44,770
- Jim, Old Boyfriend Jim?
- He called me.

210
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,071
Miranda, no.
He needs to be voted off the island.

211
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:54,511
I know how you feel,
but he was so sweet on the phone.

212
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,516
It was eight years ago.
Maybe he's learned something.

213
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:01,486
- Haven't you learned anything?
- Apparently not.

214
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:05,592
He's alive and he asked me out.
I'm fragile right now.

215
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,695
Fine, go.

216
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,229
One woman's asshole
is another woman's...

217
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:11,763
A-hole.

218
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:15,198
As long as you're OK with it.

219
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,304
Later that week,
Charlotte decided

220
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:21,772
for Trey to see the sexual part of her,
she'd have to dress the part.

221
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,707
I'm going to get him to notice me.
I have to.

222
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:28,007
That's a bottom.

223
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:30,344
If you're going to go the lingerie route,

224
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,649
why not go a little more
upscale and less flammable?

225
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,223
I don't wanna be me.
I wanna be someone else.

226
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:40,953
- That equals a healthy relationship.
- What do these say?

227
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,926
Read my lips.

228
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:46,932
I want to be call girl
meets Park Avenue.

229
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,798
Then you have to pair that
with a cardigan.

230
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,566
This is important to me.
I need him to see me sexually.

231
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:57,075
I knowyou do.
I'm just not sure I need to.

232
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,476
This is much more a Samantha job.

233
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:03,140
Please. I need a break from her.

234
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:06,845
You shouldn't be so hard on her.
She doesn't mean to be hurtful.

235
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,853
She was.

236
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,584
There were two of you
ruining my breakfast.

237
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:17,060
I have enough problems right now.
I don't need any lectures.

238
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:22,370
It was my second lecture that week
that was a failure.

239
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,769
Across town, Samantha decided
the wise thing to do was

240
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:29,001
to take a break from all of us
and go shopping.

241
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:35,547
- I'm sorry.
- Let it go, no one gets hurt.

242
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,813
- I was holding it first.
- I know Tae Kwon Do.

243
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,388
I knowthe manager.

244
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:47,795
You're spunky. I like spunky women.

245
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,624
- We're a dying breed.
- No kiddin'.

246
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,836
I'm Claire Anne.
Don't let the southern accent fool you.

247
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,803
I'm Samantha. Nothing fools me.

248
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:02,172
I'll let you have this scarf

249
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:06,940
if you show me where a girl can get
a hard drink in a dark bar around here.

250
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:09,777
Done and done.

251
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:14,719
My last date died. The fact that you're
still breathing makes this a success.

252
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,757
Low standards. I like that.

253
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,199
- This was really nice.
- Yeah, it was.

254
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,236
Carrie wasn't sure
that we would get along.

255
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:33,636
She knew me a long time ago.
I've changed.

256
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:37,869
Back then, I was in a band
called Uncle Ted's Ass.

257
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:41,743
- And I could sit on my hair.
- That's impressive.

258
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,681
You didn't hear us play.

259
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:56,296
- I'd like to see you again.
- I'd like that.

260
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:59,160
- Night.
- Night.

261
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:08,374
The next morning, Miranda called with
the post mortem on her date with Jim.

262
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,942
- Hello?
- It's me.

263
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:15,742
I thought it was the Learning Annex
bugging me about my class.

264
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,317
- When's that?
- 12th of Never Gonna Happen.

265
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:21,319
People asked for refunds
after my first class.

266
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,185
- What do they know?
- More than I do.

267
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,384
I feel like a total sham.

268
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,392
Easy. That's my friend
you're talking about.

269
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:36,236
- I went out with Jim.
- Don't make me say, "I told you so. "

270
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:39,635
It was great.
He was fun and romantic.

271
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,436
We talked till the restaurant closed.
You're wrong about him.

272
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,478
- 'This could be good. '
- Are we talking about Asshole Jim?

273
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:49,640
- He's not an asshole.
- Not till you break up with him.

274
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,946
- He says great things about you.
- He does?

275
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:56,488
- I'm going out with him on Friday.
- Go, God's speed.

276
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:01,186
I feel weird dating a guy
that you don't like.

277
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:05,663
We should all go out
have a drink sometime. One drink.

278
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,270
What do you know about this guy?
You've been on one date.

279
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:12,998
What do you know? It's been
eight years. Think about the drink.

280
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:17,874
Charlotte decided this would be
a good time to spend with old friends,

281
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:20,173
the sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

282
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:23,545
Oh, my goodness.
Has it been forever or what?

283
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:27,779
- It has.
- Charlotte, we've really missed you.

284
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:30,550
And I have missed you.
You have no idea.

285
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:35,059
Congratulations on your wedding.
Welcome to the married old girls club.

286
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,563
He is so handsome.

287
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:42,396
I would like to trade
my husband in for him, please.

288
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,404
They would understand her.
After all, they were married too.

289
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:50,544
I remember being a newly-wed.
We hardly ever got out of bed.

290
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,170
- Sydney.
- What? It's just us girls.

291
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,408
My husband can't get it up.

292
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:02,181
It would have been wiser to have
a cappuccino instead of a third drink.

293
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:05,451
- I'm so frustrated.
- Charlotte?

294
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:09,028
Don't you ever
just want to be pounded hard?

295
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:12,894
Like when the bed is moving
all around, and it's all sweaty,

296
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:18,438
your head is knocking the headboard
and you feel it might blow off?

297
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:24,545
Dammit, I just really want
to be fucked. Just really fucked.

298
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,843
The only heads blowing off
were those of Kappa Kappa Grandma.

299
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:33,546
- This is really inappropriate.
- Yeah, we're eating.

300
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:38,784
- What's wrong with you? You're a...
- What? What am I?

301
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:44,922
Charlotte realized how much
they'd all changed since college.

302
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,159
Her friends had become frenemies.

303
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:51,533
And to them,
she had become Samantha.

304
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:58,142
- Here's to newfriends.
- And gorgeous New York men.

305
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,184
Would you like to join me
at Samba on Friday night?

306
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,120
Two hot broads at a hot restaurant.
I love it.

307
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:11,487
The reservation is for four.

308
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:19,995
Done and done.

309
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,603
Samantha couldn't believe
how much fun she was having.

310
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:29,766
She had found a woman who was
as open about her sexuality as her.

311
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:31,935
I call the blondes.

312
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:35,440
You are too cute.

313
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:38,450
I could just eat you up.

314
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,952
Yes, I could.

315
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,352
I'm gonna eat you up.

316
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,359
Claire Anne?

317
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,928
- Oh, my God.
- Excellent.

318
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,971
I'm going.

319
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:03,770
Wait I'll come with you.

320
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,852
- You can forget Samba.
- Where are you going?

321
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:15,386
Samantha learned
she had a little Charlotte in her.

322
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:21,621
She had a line that could be crossed.
Hers was just more to the left.

323
00:21:21,796 --> 00:21:25,232
The next night, I agreed
to meet Jim and Miranda for drinks.

324
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,868
Jim took me to a poetry reading
last night.

325
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,163
The unpublished works
of Robert Lowell.

326
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:33,000
- He wrote his thesis on Lowell.
- I didn't knowthat.

327
00:21:33,174 --> 00:21:37,543
There's a lot you never knew.
Another Chardonnay for the lady.

328
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,111
Thank you.

329
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:43,775
I lost track of you,
but I always read your column.

330
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:46,011
- It's really good.
- Thank you.

331
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:50,920
Maybe I'd been wrong.
Jim seemed kind, funny, attentive.

332
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,587
- There's a lot of sex in there.
- It creeps in.

333
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:59,290
You didn't knowtoo much about sex
when we were dating.

334
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:00,924
And still an asshole.

335
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,264
- Good to see you.
- Don't leave.

336
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:07,101
I was joking. Stay.
I have really bad timing.

337
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,676
- Did you ever hear his band play?
- No.

338
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:15,214
- She was busy shopping for shoes.
- I do like my shoes.

339
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,417
They come in handy
when you're walking all over people.

340
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:23,113
- Come on.
- I'm reliving happy memories.

341
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,283
- Carrie doesn't walk all over people.
- She did with me.

342
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:28,895
Maybe that's because
you're an asshole.

343
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,296
She's the asshole. She never
called me once after we broke up.

344
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:36,699
- That's because you're an asshole.
- She's the asshole.

345
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:39,101
- She's not.
- Thank you.

346
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,107
You knowwhat? Never call me again.

347
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,041
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Yeah.

348
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:49,115
The fancy lawyer lady is breaking up
with me, like I give a shit.

349
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,718
Jim hadn't gotten older or wiser.

350
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:54,377
Once dumped,
he'd still dumped on everyone.

351
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:57,422
You are such assholes.

352
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:06,200
- OK, say it.
- I told you so.

353
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:09,529
- What an asshole.
- I told you so.

354
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:12,195
Is it bad that it makes me
feel good to say that?

355
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:15,638
No. I can't believe
I fell for that asshole.

356
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,971
Your date died. You panicked.

357
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,010
You know me too well.

358
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:23,378
There are plenty
of other assholes out there.

359
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:26,782
- You think?
- I know. And I'm an expert.

360
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:29,617
You're such an asshole.

361
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:36,024
Meanwhile, uptown, the Samantha
in Charlotte was ready to come out.

362
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:43,962
What in God's name are you wearing?

363
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:46,606
It's supposed to be sexy.

364
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:51,144
Come on, you're my wife.

365
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,246
That's not you.
Take it off.

366
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:55,644
Fine.

367
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,627
Look at me.

368
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,191
This is me.

369
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,866
I'm not a madonna,
and I'm not a whore.

370
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,144
I'm your wife.
I'm sexual and I love you.

371
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:37,688
What are you doing?

372
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,221
I'm touching myself.

373
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,593
I can... I can see that.

374
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,631
Good.

375
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,338
Trey?

376
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:06,982
I think we have a stiff breeze.

377
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:10,420
That night,
Trey successfully screwed his wife

378
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:14,391
for a full minute and a half
before the wind died.

379
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,264
After Charlotte's night of love,
she called the one person she knew

380
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,402
who would appreciate it the most.

381
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,400
Hello?

382
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,334
He fucked me.

383
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:28,771
Honey, that's great.
I knew you could do it.

384
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:32,434
- Thanks.
- Don't forget Samba Friday night.

385
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:33,978
I'll be there.

386
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:35,581
Did you come?

387
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,878
Having spent time
with their frenemies,

388
00:25:40,054 --> 00:25:44,286
they forgot they were enemies
and went back to being friends.

389
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,485
I realized I had become
my own worst frenemy.

390
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:51,189
I had let 300 desperate women
and one asshole convince me

391
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,130
that I didn't know anything.
I did. I was older and wiser.

392
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:58,396
I decided to keep my second date
with the Learning Annex.

393
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:01,736
Unfortunately,
my reputation had preceded me.

394
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:03,433
Is this it?

395
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:12,618
I'm carrie Bradshaw.

396
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:17,190
You've paid good money
to find out how to meet men.

397
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,155
I don't know a lot about it,

398
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,728
but you're not going to
meet them in a Learning Annex class.

399
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:24,797
So, grab your bags.

400
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:29,166
Come on,
we're not getting any younger.

401
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,803
That's right. Just trying
to give you your money's worth.

402
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:41,415
I took them to a bar,
took my $300 and bought them drinks.

403
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:44,949
Anne, the guy over there
is checking you out.

404
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,177
Twelve o'clock.

405
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,585
Not everybody, just Anne.

406
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:53,693
- Go and ask him for a light.
- I'm already lit.

407
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:58,128
Go.

408
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,330
- Hi, got a light?
- Sure.

409
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:06,803
Oh, yeah. See?

410
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:09,340
OK, one down, five to go.

411
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:13,605
- What about him?
- It's cool with me. It's fine.

412
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:18,582
Excuse me? Hi, have you met Liz?
She works in TV.

413
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:22,348
- I love TV.
- Something in common.

414
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:24,582
That night, I made three matches.

415
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,593
I didn't look for myself.
I try not to date while at work.

416
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:33,325
The old and wise adage is true -
those who can't do, teach.

417
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:35,765
Those who can't teach, do.

418
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,370
Here's a live one.
Go, get him, tiger. Go.

419
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,632
Run like the wind.



9999
