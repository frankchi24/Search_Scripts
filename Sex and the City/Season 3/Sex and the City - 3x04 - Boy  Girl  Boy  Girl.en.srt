1
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,355
It's been said that New Yorkers

2
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:55,898
are the most jaded people
in the world.

3
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:02,469
The fact is we've done and seen it all.

4
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,633
So when Charlotte
said that her new show

5
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,744
at the gallery would blow us away,

6
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:09,607
we took it with the proverbial grain
of salt.

7
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,409
Seriously, that's a woman?

8
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:15,714
It was the latest installation
from photographer Baird Johnson,

9
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:17,378
entitled "Drag Kings -

10
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:20,285
"The collision of illusion and reality".

11
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:22,859
Yep, that's a woman.

12
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:26,059
Look at that bulge, it's shocking.

13
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:29,291
Hurry up and look
before Giuliani shuts it down.

14
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:32,028
- What do you think?
- It's amazing.

15
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,603
Congratulations.

16
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:37,038
Women dressed as men are popular.

17
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,233
I thought it was "Pokemon".

18
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:43,905
All it takes is stick-on
sideburns and a sock in your pants.

19
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,914
That's some sock.

20
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,110
I've always had a thing for cowboys.

21
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:51,256
Reminder, John Wayne is a Jane.

22
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm attracted to her.
Maybe I'm a lesbian.

23
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:58,229
I dated a guy who liked to wear
my underwear.

24
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:00,388
But I've never gone the other way.

25
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,365
If you're gay you can wear
everyone's underwear.

26
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:04,728
That's hygienic?

27
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,996
Being a drag king would be fun.

28
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:11,302
I have enough trouble trying to be
a woman in a man's world,

29
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:14,843
without being a woman
pretending to be a man.

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,175
You wouldn't have to wax.

31
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,180
If you change your mind,

32
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,444
you've got cop written all over you.

33
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,751
- Am I rich yet?
- Getting there.

34
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:27,653
Everyone. This is Baird, the artist.

35
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,316
These are my friends.

36
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:31,462
What inspired you to do this?

37
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,997
I feel we have dual powers
within each of us.

38
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:39,433
Men can be very female,
and women can be very male.

39
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:44,268
Gender's an illusion.
Sometimes a very beautiful illusion.

40
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:48,908
You know,
I'm gonna go and get a canape.

41
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,948
Because, I'm starved, so...

42
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:55,814
Not that a canape is a meal.
But, you know... in a pinch.

43
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:57,819
Excuse us.

44
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:06,898
What was that about?
Nobody loves canapes that much.

45
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,694
He makes me nervous.
I think he is...

46
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:15,839
- Ask him out.
- I can never make the first move.

47
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:18,977
Sounds like someone needs
a sock in the pants.

48
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:22,170
I'll drag myself home.
You wanna share a cab?

49
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:24,178
No, I'm meeting Sean.

50
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:27,011
- The young guy?
- He's not that young.

51
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,916
He's 26. His generation
has a different letter than ours.

52
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:33,717
Who cares? Age is an illusion.

53
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:36,258
- Good night.
- Good night.

54
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:39,422
Later, Miranda found her apartment

55
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,590
had undergone
its own gender transformation.

56
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:45,134
What are you doing here?

57
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:48,932
I got a key from when I fed your cat.
I ordered us Chinese.

58
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:51,667
I didn't think
we were seeing each other tonight.

59
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:56,109
- Planning on seeing the other boy?
- Now you've ruined that...

60
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,907
This is what we're watching?

61
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:00,949
Give me that.

62
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,882
Easy, you're making my brain hurt.

63
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,085
Don't you have to work tonight?

64
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:13,595
Not until 10:00.
I've got stuff here I can change into.

65
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:15,323
Right.

66
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:20,195
But I got till 10:00.

67
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:28,505
Miranda loved the man inside of her.

68
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:33,143
She just didn't love him inside
her apartment all the time.

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,735
Come on, the ice waits for no woman.

70
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,742
I'm practicing my triple salchow
in my head.

71
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:06,913
I was dragged around by Sean,
my "generation-something-else" date.

72
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:11,215
We met at a party, celebrating a new
Internet magazine Sean was running

73
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,880
that I still couldn't find
on my computer.

74
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,757
Seriously, stop!

75
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:19,760
It's easier to balance
when you're not smoking.

76
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,900
Smoking is the only thing
that keeps me balanced.

77
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:25,994
Doesn't this place rock?

78
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:30,172
You have to give me credit
for an original date.

79
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:33,368
It's not officially a date
without cocktails.

80
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:38,041
My coach is gonna kill me.

81
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:53,061
Half a flask later, Sean and I had
broken the ice... at least my ass had.

82
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:58,168
- That last fall was at least a 9.2.
- You and the Russian judge... tough.

83
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:04,332
There was something about him.
He was sexy, charming... coordinated.

84
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,740
Nothing about him
or our third date felt typical.

85
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:11,906
When was your last
serious relationship?

86
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:16,679
Until then... there it was.
The inevitable third-date question.

87
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,948
Bad question?

88
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,553
You wanna take another spin
around the death rink?

89
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,695
No, it's fine. It's fine.

90
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:28,693
I ended something a while ago.

91
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:33,895
Two years of a lot of back and forths.
We weren't Y2K compatible.

92
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:35,504
What about you?

93
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:38,643
Before you there was Kayla.
Neurotic. Lasted a year.

94
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,247
Before her, Lesley, couldn't commit.
Before Lesley there was Mark.

95
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:48,142
Is that a problem?

96
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,855
He's a bisexual.

97
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:55,788
I could have told you that.
He took you ice-skating.

98
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:58,862
The weird thing is he was so open.

99
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,797
"Hi. I'm a bisexual. "
Like, "Hi, I'm from Colorado".

100
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:06,199
You're not allowed
to be bisexual in Colorado.

101
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:09,807
"Is that a problem?"
What kind of question is that?

102
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:12,500
- Of course!
- What did you say?

103
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:17,205
That it wasn't a problem.
He's such a good kisser.

104
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:20,874
That generation
is all about sexual experimentation.

105
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:23,179
All the kids are going bi.

106
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,550
If they all jump off a bridge,
you will too?

107
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:28,419
I'm a "try-sexual".
I'll try anything once.

108
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:32,324
When did this happen?
When did the sexes get all confused?

109
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:36,297
Somewhere between Gen X and Y,
they blended and made XY.

110
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,928
I did the "date the bisexual guy"
thing in college.

111
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:45,338
- They all ended up with men.
- So did the bisexual women.

112
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,673
Which is why there
are no men left for us.

113
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:55,116
Maybe I do have a problem
with this. I'm an old fart.

114
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:57,755
Correction: A hot old fart.

115
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:00,390
I'm not even sure bisexuality exists.

116
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:03,652
It's just a layover
on the way to Gaytown.

117
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,592
Isn't that next to Ricky Martinville?

118
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:12,201
It's great. He's open to all sexual
experiences. He's evolved. It's hot.

119
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,271
It's greedy.
He's double-dipping.

120
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:19,673
You're not marrying him, you're
making out with him. Forget the label.

121
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:21,175
You're right.

122
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:26,613
I'm very into labels. Gay. Straight.
Pick a side and stay there.

123
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:28,946
Where are you going?

124
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,283
Home. I've got a date
with my remote control.

125
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:37,861
Steve's playing basketball.
That's three hours of alone time.

126
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,591
- What about my problem?
- Stop kissing him.

127
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:45,798
Easy for her to say.

128
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:50,733
That night, I couldn't get
Samantha's words out of my head.

129
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,343
Was Sean's generation
on to something?

130
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:56,002
Was sexual flipping
the wave of the future?

131
00:08:56,181 --> 00:09:00,015
If it was, could I play that game
or was I over the hill?

132
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:03,348
If women can transform into men,
and men into women

133
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:05,513
and we can sleep with everyone,

134
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,454
then maybe gender
doesn't exist anymore.

135
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:13,222
If we can take the best
of the other sex and make it our own,

136
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:16,367
has the opposite sex
become obsolete?

137
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:21,631
Don't bust my balls. If you're a
head-hunter, get me a good assistant.

138
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:25,367
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for a Mrs. Jones.

139
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,740
- It's Miss.
- I'm here for the assistant job.

140
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:33,542
Please, come in.

141
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:36,418
Samantha hired Matt
five minutes later.

142
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:41,389
She was the man of the office,
but she could fit one more.

143
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:45,620
Meanwhile downtown, Charlotte
could have used some help herself.

144
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:48,163
Someone is being industrious.

145
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,629
Hi. I didn't hear you come in.

146
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:55,705
I thought I'd come by
and scare the shit out of you.

147
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:58,001
Pick up my cheque
for the pieces I sold.

148
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,914
- Here.
- Thanks.

149
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,177
There's something else.
I've been thinking about this.

150
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,720
I would love you to pose for me.

151
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:15,756
- As a man?
- Yeah, you'd be great.

152
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:20,456
- No, I don't think so.
- Why not?

153
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,429
- I'm not...
- A model?

154
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,399
No, butch.

155
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:29,064
You'd be surprised.
Every woman has a male inside.

156
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,071
Even you.

157
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,140
No, not me.

158
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:39,112
I'm really bad at math and I can't
change a tire to save my life.

159
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:42,185
Pose for me.
I'll get it out of you.

160
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:46,081
Come on, be a man.

161
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:57,431
The next night, Sean and I went to a
club so new, even I hadn't heard of it.

162
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:01,328
- What's the name of this place?
- "Hair".

163
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:04,940
- Like the musical.
- Like the stuff on your head.

164
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:08,044
- You're too cool for me.
- You're too cute for me.

165
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:13,879
Ten seconds of kissing and I almost
forgot his lack of sexual orientation.

166
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:16,714
Until we stopped kissing.

167
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,586
Who are you checking out,
the guy or the girl?

168
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,958
I was looking for the bathroom.

169
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,993
Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry.

170
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:38,100
Sorry, this whole bisexual thing
is throwing me for a loop.

171
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:41,209
You've been with men and women...

172
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:45,449
Were you just looking at that guy?

173
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:49,052
I'm looking at you.

174
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,916
I'm with you. I dig you.

175
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,720
- "Dig" is in again?
- So is "groovy". You're that too.

176
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,556
So, you're not gay?

177
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,758
I've been in three major relationships.
One was a guy. That's just me.

178
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,678
An hour later, Sean was in my bed.

179
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,979
That's just me.

180
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:24,182
- Nice floor.
- Thanks. It's a rental.

181
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:33,690
- What?
- Nothing.

182
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:36,834
Tell me or I'll make you
go skating again.

183
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,840
- Do I kiss better than a guy?
- Better than any I've kissed.

184
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:53,347
How about me?

185
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:05,186
- Top two per cent.
- I'll take that.

186
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:14,530
If there was this good-looking guy
walking towards you

187
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:20,269
and across the street
was a beautiful girl, which one...

188
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,413
Carrie, come on.

189
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,515
Could you stop making this
all about sex?

190
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:29,414
It's not. It's about the person... you.

191
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,555
I'm crazy about you.

192
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,748
The way you smell.

193
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,392
The way your upper lip tastes.

194
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,327
It may not have been all about sex,
but it was for the next two hours.

195
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,569
I wasn't the only one
with younger men on the brain.

196
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:54,576
Listen to me. We've called
your boss three times already.

197
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,306
Give him that message.

198
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:01,745
Hello.
What are you doing?

199
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,184
- That is not how I do business.
- She makes me crazy.

200
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:08,655
These are important clients.
Don't talk to them like that.

201
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:10,624
You want them to call you?

202
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:14,162
Let me remind you
that I am the boss here.

203
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:19,565
Fire me. I just think
you deserve some respect.

204
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:22,640
Put this file away.

205
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,710
Samantha found Matt's boyish
arrogance annoying,

206
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:33,180
unprofessional... and incredibly hot.

207
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:41,550
Miranda was having a problem
sharing a space with the other sex.

208
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:46,952
What?

209
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,596
- What's going on?
- You're on my side.

210
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,205
My pillow.
My guest pillow.

211
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:59,067
OK, I'll tell you what.

212
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:04,271
Tomorrow we'll buy some paint
and draw a line down the middle.

213
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,817
Go to sleep.

214
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,928
That pile. Your stuff.
You have to keep it neater.

215
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:26,098
Maybe if you can spare a drawer
I can keep my things out of the way.

216
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:28,204
You want a drawer?

217
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,636
Actually...

218
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:39,179
I'd like to move in.

219
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,444
Most single women
dream of this moment.

220
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,020
Most single women but Miranda.

221
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:48,491
Wow! OK.

222
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:51,859
Where did that come from?

223
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:54,190
I've been thinking about it.

224
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:58,263
We have a great time.
We're practically live together...

225
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:00,369
Yeah, but we're not.

226
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:05,737
Look.

227
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,572
We just started dating again.

228
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:13,274
There is no need to go at warp speed.
Nobody's dying.

229
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:16,477
I'm sure every book
would say we're not ready.

230
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:18,747
You're here all the time.

231
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,393
No problem. I'll get out of your hair.
I'll leave the key.

232
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:26,792
No! Don't leave the key.
Take the key.

233
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:31,298
I just... I need my space.
I feel like I'm being suffocated.

234
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:36,372
Jesus, Miranda...

235
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,109
It's like you're the guy sometimes.

236
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:47,247
Faced with relationship problems,
some women turn to fried food.

237
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:51,878
Miranda turned to the latest fitness
craze - "The Goddess Workout".

238
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:56,459
Ladies, open up your chakras.
Let the inner goddess sing.

239
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:01,990
She's in there.
All you have to do is let her out.

240
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:06,466
- This helps you to be a woman?
- I must find my inner goddess.

241
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:09,265
And pop your hip. Pop your hip.

242
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:13,170
Open yourself like a lotus flower.

243
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:16,070
Come on, pop your hip.

244
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,746
Pop your hip.

245
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:25,212
- My hips don't pop, I'm a guy.
- You're insane.

246
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:29,122
This isn't helping me find my inner
goddess, only my inner humiliation.

247
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:33,161
And reach back.
Reach for the stars.

248
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,696
We're out of here.

249
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:49,603
I'm never gonna be a girly girl.
I never will.

250
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:52,874
- I'll never be a lotus flower.
- Thank God.

251
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,484
A girly girl would want
her boyfriend to move in.

252
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,745
She also wears make-up to the gym.

253
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:00,083
And makes little hearts
above her "i's".

254
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:06,559
I do love him... I do.

255
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:09,291
- I know.
- What's my problem?

256
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,698
In any relationship
one person is the alpha dog.

257
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,239
The one in charge... that's you.
You don't like sharing your water dish.

258
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:21,435
- I'm very free with the chew toys.
- That you are.

259
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:26,277
Miranda arrived home later
to an empty apartment.

260
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:32,048
And for the first time,
she really didn't like it.

261
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,719
While Miranda and I worked out
our inner goddesses,

262
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:40,693
Baird was working the male
out of Charlotte.

263
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:43,891
You look great.

264
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:48,501
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

265
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:53,935
Just relax. Let it go.
Forget Charlotte.

266
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:59,208
You're a man now. You're a hot guy.
You can get any woman you want.

267
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:03,911
You're rich, you're powerful.
You eat guys like me for lunch.

268
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,680
How are you feeling now?

269
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,756
I think I need a bigger sock.

270
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,855
I think you do, too.

271
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:35,307
Better?

272
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,686
Much.

273
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:42,348
Who knows whether it was the sock
or the suit or Baird.

274
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:48,522
Charlotte wasn't just a chick with
a dick, she was a chick with balls.

275
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,409
The two alpha dogs at Samantha's
were not getting along as well.

276
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:04,912
These invitations need to go
to the printers ASAP.

277
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:06,879
I'll get to it.

278
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,884
Now. Drop them at 72nd Street
then pick up lunch.

279
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:12,887
They're in opposite directions.
I'll get lunch first.

280
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:17,221
- Invitations first.
- Fine, then I'll be an hour late.

281
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:19,488
Do you realize you're my assistant?

282
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:22,359
Your job is to do what I say.

283
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,832
- I know what I'm doing.
- And I know better.

284
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:28,096
- Say's who?
- Me.

285
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:31,935
- Who do you think you are?
- Your boss.

286
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:36,104
Samantha Jones' PR.

287
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,977
I don't know when she will.
She's been busy.

288
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:44,520
You have a shitty attitude too.
And your parties suck.

289
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,959
The bad news is, you're fired.

290
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:53,585
The good news is...
now I can fuck you.

291
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:57,598
The only place Samantha and Matt
worked well together was in bed.

292
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:59,599
Fuck me on the desk.

293
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,168
- On the chair.
- No, on the desk.

294
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:07,606
With Sam on top, naturally.

295
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,507
That night,
Miranda invited Steve for pasta.

296
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:17,120
- Hi. I'm late. I know I'm late.
- It's OK.

297
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,882
I was gonna make you dinner,

298
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:22,924
and then this conference call
went over two hours.

299
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:27,497
I went to the market. I needed extra
virgin olive oil. They only had virgin.

300
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:32,965
I don't know the difference.
I don't cook. So I got the stuff in a jar.

301
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:37,701
Don't move. It's glass.

302
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,375
I can't. I can't do this.

303
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:47,142
- We'll order pizza, it's no big deal.
- It's a big fucking deal.

304
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:52,381
I just spilled Marinara sauce
and you saw that. I drop things, OK?

305
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:55,525
OK. So do I.

306
00:21:57,128 --> 00:22:01,087
I do love you. But I've never
lived with anybody before.

307
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,158
And I'm stubborn.
And I like the remote.

308
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:07,327
And I can't cook.

309
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:12,767
I don't do laundry sometimes for
two weeks. And my sponges smell.

310
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:17,344
You're gonna see all that.
I'm scared.

311
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:23,513
I don't know if I can move forward,
but I don't want to lose you.

312
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:26,386
OK.

313
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:33,523
I'm not going anywhere.

314
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:44,741
I'm crying on your shoulder.
I guess I really am a woman.

315
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:48,344
A week later, Miranda's man
moved into her place.

316
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:52,039
The same day that Charlotte
moved her man into her place.

317
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:54,241
She never saw Baird again.

318
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:57,285
She was too embarrassed
at how forward she'd been.

319
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:02,755
She might have been that type
of guy but never that type of woman.

320
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:09,758
80 blocks downtown, five flights up,
Sean and I were almost at the party.

321
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:12,732
One more floor, I promise.

322
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:15,804
If there's no vodka, it's your head.

323
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,270
Take it easy, dude, we're here.

324
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,740
OK, dude.

325
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:28,276
- Who's party is this?
- Mark's.

326
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,920
Mark, ex-boyfriend Mark?

327
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:32,885
Is that a problem?

328
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:35,321
It's his boyfriend's birthday.

329
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,725
It was definitely a first.

330
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:43,128
I was attending a party
of my boyfriend's ex-boyfriend.

331
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,131
And his boyfriend.

332
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,665
Carrie, this is Mark
and his boyfriend Garth.

333
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,740
- Partner.
- This is our baby, Isabell.

334
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,273
Two "L's", no "E".

335
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,777
OK. Happy birthday.

336
00:23:57,014 --> 00:24:02,247
- This is Dawn and Grace.
- They just got married in Hawaii.

337
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:04,284
Congratulations.

338
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:09,383
- It was a spur of the moment.
- I didn't want another big wedding.

339
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,656
- It wasn't so bad.
- Being married to you sucked.

340
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:17,289
- You two were...
- Married. For a year.

341
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:21,403
We were high for most of it,
otherwise it would've been miserable.

342
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:23,369
Don't forget I gave you that egg.

343
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,509
This is our straight friend, Joel.

344
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:31,740
- Are you wearing pleather?
- Thank you for noticing.

345
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:35,373
An hour later,
I had almost got it straight.

346
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:38,680
Grace once dated Brett.

347
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:42,223
- And Brett used to live with Joel?
- Semi-platonically.

348
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:45,487
- You slept with Dawn.
- Before she was with Mark.

349
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:46,823
Naturally.

350
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:52,264
Gay, bi, straight. This party was
a platter of sexual orientation.

351
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:59,501
Time to play.

352
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:03,276
- Play what?
- Spin the bottle.

353
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,449
Seventh grade spin the bottle?

354
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:09,848
- Play. It's fun.
- Come on, it's fun.

355
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:30,467
Get a room.

356
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:34,109
Get a dental dam.

357
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,906
- It's a girl. Try again.
- It's OK.

358
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:09,842
Of course it was. I was in
Alice-In-Confused-Sexuality Land.

359
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,449
I had a choice. I could stand up,
walk out and prove I was an old fart.

360
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:21,146
Or I could fall down the rabbit hole.

361
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:53,747
So I fell. It wasn't bad.
Kind of like chicken.

362
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:03,025
- Where are you going? It's your spin.
- Just more cigarettes.

363
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:08,564
That was the last night I saw Sean.

364
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:13,767
They could do what they wanted,
but I was too old to play this game.

365
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:18,145
So I took my hot, old fart-ass home.

366
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,308
That's just me.



9999
