1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:40,229
303 - Attack Of The 5'10'' Woman

2
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,529
There are fewthings
I love as much as Sunday brunch.

3
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,223
You can sleep till noon

4
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,733
and still get eggs
anywhere in the city.

5
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:57,168
Alcohol is often included.

6
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,967
And it's the one day

7
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,406
you get the single woman's
sports' pages -

8
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:03,673
"The New York Times"
wedding section.

9
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,371
This is so depressing.

10
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,812
The oldest woman on this page is 27.

11
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,815
Now I'm depressed

12
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,783
and I haven't had coffee yet.

13
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:13,819
At least you have a boyfriend.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,288
That only means I'm getting laid.

15
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:18,086
On a regular basis.

16
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,785
I'll drink to that.

17
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:22,362
Until recently, the bride, 24,

18
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,125
worked as a supervisor

19
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,564
at Ogilvy & Mather. 24!

20
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:27,293
No more reading aloud.

21
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,904
I love how they say "until recently".

22
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,699
Meaning she quit her job

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,867
once she found her soul
mate /investment banker.

24
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:38,571
It's so retro.
I've got a rock on my finger.

25
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:41,239
Now I can stop pretending
to care about my career.

26
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:44,875
Until recently, the bride had a life
of her own.

27
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:48,421
You know who they marry?
The roman numeral guys.

28
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,719
- Charles Duffy Anderson IV.
- Ding, ding, ding.

29
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,829
The higher the number,
the worse the sex.

30
00:01:54,997 --> 00:02:00,458
- I dated a lll. He couldn't get it up.
- How bad must Henry Vlll have been!

31
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:04,003
You give him head, he cuts yours off!

32
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,004
This couple met on a bike tour.

33
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:09,406
I just make it through spinning.
All the men are gay.

34
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:13,879
It's amazing how upset women get
over the marital status of strangers.

35
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:18,382
- What was that?
- Nothing.

36
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,380
- Let me see.
- Nothing to see.

37
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,616
You're such a bad liar.

38
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:34,001
Then there's
the occasional familiar face.

39
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,301
Well, it's official. He's married.
Where are my fries?

40
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:50,817
It's fine, all right?
I was prepared for this.

41
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,922
They had an engagement party
at the Plaza.

42
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:57,992
- Sometimes they break off.
- This one didn't. Let's move on.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,962
Why is their wedding like
a short story? What's next, a movie?

44
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,068
It's fluff, it's PR.
Anybody could be this story.

45
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,363
Anybody who's getting married.

46
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:12,063
This is what I hate
about "The Sunday Times".

47
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:14,835
This and the country houses
I can't afford.

48
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:24,585
- You want to rent a movie?
- It's OK. I'm not gonna slit my wrists.

49
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:27,052
I just thought
you might want some company.

50
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,691
You know what?
I think I want to be alone.

51
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,818
- OK, I'm just gonna take the paper.
- Would you stop?

52
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:37,261
I know what you're gonna do.
You can't not read it.

53
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:43,804
You'll cry and it'll be awful.
Let's read it now and get it over with.

54
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,669
The couple met in Paris,
on the lle St-Louis.

55
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:49,538
How original, they fell in love in Paris.

56
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:54,274
"I was alone at a cafe when the waiter
brought over a bottle of Pinot Noir

57
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,387
"from a handsome man at the bar",
the bride said, her eyes sparkling.

58
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:03,449
"When we'd finished the wine,
I knew I wanted to marry him. "

59
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:08,859
You were drunk and he was
rich. This is just bad journalism.

60
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:13,024
Marry they did, in Southampton
at the bride's parents' estate.

61
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,033
There were only 50 guests.

62
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:18,002
"We wanted it intimate.
Just family and close friends. "

63
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,405
- And "The New York Times".
- How intimate is that?

64
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:24,671
I don't hear Big
anywhere in this article.

65
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,408
She's calling the shots
and he's just along for the ride.

66
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:32,018
The bride carried calla lilies,
tied with a red ribbon.

67
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,917
That's nice.

68
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,921
As she walked down the aisle

69
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:39,721
a saxophone played
"When A Man Loves A Woman".

70
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,988
Well, that's tacky.

71
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:44,462
No, that's Big.

72
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:00,578
What I wouldn't give
for a working fireplace.

73
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,381
- He wasn't the right man for you.
- I know that.

74
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:07,420
I know, it's not him.
It's the whole wedding.

75
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:10,615
And it's her... her!

76
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,996
You know, she's just...

77
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:20,625
you know, shiny hair,
style section... Vera Wang.

78
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:26,241
And I'm the sex column they run
next to ads for penile implants.

79
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:43,982
Big wasn't the only one
taking the plunge.

80
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,152
After more than a decade
of domestic independence,

81
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,923
Miranda had opened up
to a relationship...

82
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,760
Good morning.

83
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,765
...with a cleaning lady.

84
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,200
Good morning, Magda.

85
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,769
Do you know where
the coffee mugs are?

86
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,637
I moved them here.

87
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:07,875
- Now all glasses are together.
- I guess that makes more sense.

88
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,551
You know what? I always drink coffee
out of my law school class of '90 mug,

89
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:20,161
because it's bigger, and...
It's just what I always use.

90
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,426
I bring you nice herbal teas.
Tea is better for you.

91
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:28,401
Oh, thank you very much,
but I prefer coffee.

92
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,401
Thank you.

93
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:35,168
- Why do I have a rolling pin?
- It's for you to make pies.

94
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:40,006
It's good for women to make pies.

95
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:44,285
- Do you have a rolling pin?
- On me?

96
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:47,616
- In your kitchen?
- I use my oven for storage.

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,126
My cleaning lady brought me one.
She couldn't believe I didn't have one.

98
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,320
I can't believe
you have a cleaning lady.

99
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,932
Don't even start.
I feel guilty enough.

100
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,763
I hate being home when she is.
I feel like if I'm home,

101
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:06,101
I should be cleaning or making pies.
She says that's what women do.

102
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:08,800
Where did you find her,
in a time capsule?

103
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:11,538
I know. I don't need to make pies.

104
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:16,811
I'm practically a partner in a major
lawfirm. If I want pie, I can buy it.

105
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,216
I think I need this in a smaller size.

106
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:23,992
I'll get it for you, just hand it out,
there's no need...

107
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,388
Carrie?

108
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,865
And there she was,
Mrs. Big, all five foot ten of her.

109
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:36,265
Hey... Hi, Natasha.

110
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:40,270
I heard... I read...

111
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,775
Congratulations on the thing,
on the wedding.

112
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,778
This is Miranda, we're shopping.

113
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,917
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

114
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,043
That looks nice,
what you have on there.

115
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,246
You think?

116
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:58,587
I need something for this "Women In
The Arts" luncheon I helped organize.

117
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:02,788
- I'm on the steering committee.
- Really? I'm a member.

118
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:07,902
You know, I write,
so I am a woman in the arts.

119
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,561
I go to that lunch every year...

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,802
...in clothes.

121
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:17,835
- So, you're going then?
- Yeah, I'm going.

122
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:22,273
- Great, I'll see you there.
- All right.

123
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,656
Oh, my God.

124
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:32,850
- Now, I can't find the invitation.
- Why did you say you'd go?

125
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:38,796
I've talked to her twice, once in
a cowboy hat, and once in my bra.

126
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,095
Like freakin'
Annie-get-your-clothes-on.

127
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,671
I would just like her
to see me looking normal.

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,741
- Just normal?
- I would prefer to look amazing.

129
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,778
Not like I'm trying,
just effortlessly striking.

130
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,848
I see. And will Big be at this event?

131
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:59,181
It's a "Women In The Arts" luncheon.
It's not about Big, it's about Natasha.

132
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,789
It seems to be a lot of trouble
for a woman.

133
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:05,155
Can you help me find out
when and where it is?

134
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,795
I can do better than that,
I'm coming too.

135
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,227
So, you support women in the arts?

136
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,360
I support you, and these bitches need
to be put in their places.

137
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:21,575
That night I modeled my wardrobe
in my head and vetoed everything.

138
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,769
Why did I care so much?

139
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:28,383
What was it about Natasha that
made me feel like the charity case?

140
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,951
Was it just that she had Big,
or was this bigger than Big?

141
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:35,181
I started to wonder.
Are there women in New York

142
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,155
just there to make us feel bad
about ourselves?

143
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,388
For Miranda, that woman
was a certain Ukrainian housekeeper.

144
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:45,761
- You're early.
- Yes, good morning.

145
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,828
Did you bring me this?

146
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:52,496
It's gift, to make your bathroom nicer.

147
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:57,476
Thanks. Did you move my hairdryer?
It used to be under the sink.

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,774
In the middle drawer.
Last week I organize for you.

149
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,315
No, that drawer
doesn't need organizing.

150
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,420
Magda had discovered Miranda's
"goodie-drawer".

151
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:14,021
I have a boyfriend, so it's not like
I'm sleeping with lots of different men.

152
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:19,395
For a long time there was no guy
and that's why I have the other thing.

153
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:22,264
- OK.
- You like this boyfriend?

154
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:27,333
- Yes.
- You want to marry this man?

155
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,867
I don't know.

156
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:35,073
Everybody wants to get married.
I am married 28 years.

157
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,711
Well, we'll see.
I don't know if I want to get married.

158
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:45,117
God bless you.

159
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,761
I don't need you to bless me.

160
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:58,305
I don't need God to bless me.
I'm fine with my life as it is.

161
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,702
It's like I hired my mother.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,040
Manhattan has spas, where a woman
can pay to feel good about herself.

163
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,517
I can't believe she opened
your goodie-drawer.

164
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,986
Everybody knows
the night-stand is private.

165
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:19,719
- What do you have in there?
- The usual, condoms, vibrator...

166
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:22,386
- Massage oil, cigarettes.
- Nipple clamps.

167
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:25,032
- Really?
- Not for me, for them.

168
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,031
That's freakish.

169
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:30,262
What's in your goodie-drawer,
Robert's "Rules Of Order"?

170
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,464
- I don't have a goodie-drawer.
- Everybody has one.

171
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:37,237
- I've got a goodie-closet.
- I don't need to know what's in it.

172
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:40,541
Ditto. Nipple clamps
will suffice for today.

173
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,904
I'm not in the mood for steam,
it's too hot.

174
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,935
Then take off your towel, relax.

175
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:10,567
I don't feel like being relaxed in here.

176
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:15,274
There goes a woman who desperately
needs a goodie-drawer.

177
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,289
Charlotte?

178
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,957
- What's wrong?
- I was just hot.

179
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:27,618
OK, and...

180
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:34,233
And... I'm just not comfortable
being naked in public.

181
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:39,137
This isn't really public,
it's a ladies' locker-room.

182
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:43,267
- I didn't grow up in a naked house.
- I didn't either.

183
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:46,676
I bet she grew up in a naked house.

184
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,255
She might still live in a naked house.

185
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:58,393
Sweetie, who cares how you look
to other women.

186
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,791
You have a perfect body.

187
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,964
You're deluded.

188
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:07,729
Charlotte, you have a beautiful figure.

189
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,667
- Really?
- Yes!

190
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:14,605
Why was that women looking at me
like my thighs were too big?

191
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,544
Samantha always felt
good about herself.

192
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:24,311
But after her 80-minute massage,
she felt even better.

193
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:30,850
I just had the most intense massage.
Kevin goes down on you.

194
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:33,494
Samantha's was good,
but not that good.

195
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:38,861
- Are you serious?
- He's incredible. You should try him.

196
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,865
Samantha smiled,

197
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:44,301
but a woman with a goodie-closet
doesn't need to pay for head.

198
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:45,462
Celia!

199
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:51,242
- Forgot your key.
- Thanks, Kevin.

200
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:56,548
Then again, you can never have
too many massages.

201
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:59,243
Samantha immediately
got on the wait list

202
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,548
for Kevin's
next available appointment.

203
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:10,187
That night, Steve wasn't available.
Miranda chose the next best thing.

204
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,977
Magda was not only cleaning,
she was performing an exorcism.

205
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,840
Later that week, I had a religious
experience at Manolo Blahnik.

206
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,749
I need your opinion.

207
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,823
You can't afford them?

208
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,926
Can I get you something?

209
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,327
I'll have that incredibly rich-looking,
flourless chocolate thing.

210
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:47,457
- And a cafe au lait.
- I'll have a fruit cup.

211
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:52,369
- Now you're making me feel bad.
- No, get what you want.

212
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,544
This place has the best desserts.
The point of coming is to splurge.

213
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,615
That was a splurge.
Fruit has a lot of carbs.

214
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,184
Is there a new "Zone" book out?

215
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,753
I hate my thighs.

216
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:10,881
The problem is not your thighs.
The problem is your head.

217
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:14,358
Now... About the shoes.

218
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,531
Hold on...

219
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,692
I need these for the WITA luncheon.

220
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:24,670
The heels are almost high enough
to put me face to face with Natasha,

221
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:28,899
if Natasha wears flats.
But why would she wear flats?

222
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,306
Do they make the right statement?

223
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:33,641
What statement
do you want to make?

224
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:39,152
I am beautiful, powerful and don't care
you're only 25, and married my ex.

225
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,256
I thought you didn't have a complex
about your looks.

226
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:45,916
It's not a complex.
It's a Natasha specific obsession,

227
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:50,690
which will be over when she sees me,
at the benefit, looking fabulous,

228
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,962
in these shoes and a dress from
Bergdorf's that'll cost a month's rent.

229
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:59,005
Listen to you.
You don't have to prove anything.

230
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:04,737
You are stunning, intelligent
and funny. And what is she?

231
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:07,813
Married, that's all.

232
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:10,850
You could go to that luncheon,
wearing that,

233
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:13,351
and still be the most
incredible woman in the room.

234
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,788
Wow!
Why can't you do that for yourself?

235
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:22,262
That afternoon,
Charlotte faced her fear.

236
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,949
I'd kill for your breasts.

237
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:34,532
Meanwhile, Samantha had spent
the last half hour face-down,

238
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:37,035
picturing Kevin's face down on her.

239
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,840
- Is this pressure OK?
- Oh, yes. That is just fine.

240
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,479
Ready to turn over now?

241
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,242
I most certainly am.

242
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:04,024
- Is this OK?
- Yes.

243
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,898
- Is this OK?
- Yes.

244
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,931
Is this OK?

245
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,201
Yes.

246
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:27,577
Since they were running out of time,
she took the matter in her own hands.

247
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,857
Is this OK?

248
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,962
Apparently, it wasn't.

249
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,690
What kind of person
does such a thing?

250
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:43,031
To molest a trained professional
while he is trying to do his job.

251
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:49,039
Helena Rubinstein is
a civilized place, for civilized people.

252
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,476
I'm sorry, I can't allow you
to come back here.

253
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:55,013
I have to protect my staff.

254
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,515
Clearly, she meant Kevin's staff.

255
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,620
This isn't my fault.

256
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,416
I know that Kevin
went down on another customer,

257
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,821
and that's why
I booked the appointment.

258
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:14,462
The following Monday, Samantha
and I were the definition of civilized.

259
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:17,503
We officially became
ladies who luncheon.

260
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:21,507
It was entrapment, false advertising
and blatant discrimination.

261
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:24,236
You can't go down on one
and not the other.

262
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:27,813
I paid good money,
expecting to be eaten out.

263
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,518
This is not the conversation I wish
to have as my most amazing self.

264
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:34,712
- Do you see her?
- No...

265
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,415
But I do see Wendy Wasserstein
and Gloria Steinem.

266
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:43,030
- Believe me, you look stunning.
- You know what? I believe you.

267
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,563
Hello Mimi, Ms Carrie Bradshaw,
and Ms Samantha Jones.

268
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:55,039
I'm a member,
I just haven't been to an event, ever.

269
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,337
It's Bradshaw.

270
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,316
Here you are.
Wear your name tags.

271
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:06,944
Last year we had an incident
with Joyce Carol Oates.

272
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,250
I'm not sure the "Hello, my name is"
goes with the ensemble.

273
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,256
Hello, my name is Fabulous.

274
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,520
Oh, Natasha's not here yet.

275
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,666
- Natasha's not coming.
- What?

276
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,132
She's got a cold,
and didn't want to get everybody sick.

277
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,465
Here are your drink tickets.

278
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,868
I can't believe that bitch
is a no-show.

279
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:34,277
I'm the one who's sick.
Charged another outfit I can't afford.

280
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,247
Maybe bounced a cheque to charity,
just to prove I'm amazing.

281
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,718
I've never felt less so.
Let's just go.

282
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:45,121
I've paid $85, we're having our drinks.
What do you feel like?

283
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:50,697
- Loser on the rocks?
- Give me those tickets.

284
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:57,435
Who is this and what's she doing
in my bedroom?

285
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:59,300
Virgin Mary.

286
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:03,374
- And where's my other thing?
- What thing?

287
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:06,446
You know, the thing.
Don't make me say it.

288
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,548
The thing you replaced with this lady.

289
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,777
Bathroom, middle drawer.
Next to hairdryer.

290
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:17,918
No man will marry you if that is by
your bed. It says you don't need him.

291
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:22,593
What I don't need is another mother.

292
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:25,824
I have one in Philadelphia,
and that's close enough.

293
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:28,629
I need a housekeeper,
who will clean my apartment

294
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:32,796
and stop judging because I'm a 34
year old, single woman in New York.

295
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:39,538
I drink coffee, have sex, buy pies
and enjoy battery-operated devices.

296
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:44,151
If you can't deal with that,
I will find a housekeeper who can.

297
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,026
I also head the committee to match
mentors with underprivileged children.

298
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:57,631
It'd be wonderful if you'd be willing
to work with kids who want to write.

299
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,732
I write about sex.

300
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:04,531
Is that something they'd like to learn?
Writing about blow jobs?

301
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:08,698
We can always use help
in fundraising.

302
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:11,744
Carrie, this is Jenna.

303
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,438
- Hi, Jenna.
- Nice to meet you.

304
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:18,882
Jenna went to college with Natasha.
Go ahead, tell her what you told me.

305
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:24,185
OK, well, Natasha lived in my dorm,
freshmen year at Tulane.

306
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,420
Once, she showered with a guy
in the community bathroom.

307
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,229
And...

308
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:37,403
And she gained like ten pounds,
sophomore year.

309
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:39,064
Wow.

310
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,472
Ten pounds.
Thanks, Jenna.

311
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,076
Merry Christmas.

312
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,712
That's supposed
to make me feel better?

313
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:51,249
Six years ago
she had a weight problem?

314
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,046
It's something.

315
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:55,155
You had to love her for trying.

316
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:59,316
Samantha tried to make me feel good
by making Natasha sound bad,

317
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,519
but it only made me feel worse.

318
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:05,564
- Another drink?
- Another one and I'll lose my lunch.

319
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:10,136
When you get home you'll smile
because she was a porker in college.

320
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,569
Ten pounds does not a porker make.

321
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:21,649
- You're Samantha Jones.
- Yes. We met at Helena Rubinstein.

322
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,253
Katy, Leisle, look who's here.
The woman who got Kevin fired.

323
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:28,845
Thanks a lot!

324
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:31,321
- Yeah, thanks.
- Who's gonna fuck me now?

325
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,493
Kevin fucked you?

326
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:37,495
Turns out I wasn't the kind of member
those women in the arts needed.

327
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:43,129
That night, in her spotless apartment,
Miranda knew she'd been right

328
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,737
to take a stand
because of her night-stand.

329
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,634
Magda realized that single women
in New York never make pies,

330
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:53,872
but they sometimes make guys.

331
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:58,208
A few weeks later, I got something
in the mail from Women In The Arts.

332
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:02,618
It was a "Thank you for attending",
signed by Natasha.

333
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:07,523
Game over. I had to accept that in life,
some women are simply better.

334
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:12,098
No amount of shoes, or lack of pastry
or making of pies will change that.

335
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:15,134
I will never be the woman
with the perfect hair,

336
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:17,271
who can wear white and not spill on it.

337
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:20,032
And chair committees,
and write thank you notes.

338
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,176
And I can't feel bad about that.

339
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,504
"Sorry I couldn't be their. "

340
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:30,213
T-H-E-I-R.

341
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,918
But I could feel good about this.

342
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:44,691
Miranda, it's good she got married.
The woman's an idiot.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
