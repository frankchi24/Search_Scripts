1
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,192
NewYork City -

2
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,895
dreary, gray, miserable.

3
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,869
Or was that just me?

4
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:01,909
After a sordid affair
with my ex-boyfriend,

5
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:04,773
and a break-up with my current one,

6
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:07,575
it was time for a change of scenery.

7
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,218
And I wasn't alone.

8
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:12,411
You're going to LA without me!

9
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:15,056
You went on your honeymoon
without us.

10
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:17,556
I have pictures.

11
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:20,253
While we planned our escape,

12
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,556
Charlotte celebrated her return.

13
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:25,222
she and Trey had just returned
from Bermuda.

14
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,892
Here, Trey and I are playing golf.

15
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:31,334
Do you think the studio
will send a limo to pick us up?

16
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:34,567
- No, I do not.
- They're making your column a film.

17
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:39,146
It's a little company that's just
talking about optioning my columns.

18
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:42,648
I know. I was just
practicing my LA spin.

19
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:47,687
Here's one of Trey pretending to get
a hole in one. He loved that gag.

20
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,881
Who wouldn't?

21
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:53,028
Did you notice
we're both wearing Bermuda shorts?

22
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:56,494
Bermudas in Bermuda.
You kids were crazy down there!

23
00:01:56,665 --> 00:02:00,123
I'd love to stay, but I've gotta
take my cat to the kennel.

24
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:03,066
- Lovely.
- I gotta go too.

25
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:05,638
- The car's picking us up at one.
- We'll be there.

26
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:09,335
Welcome back, you old married lady.

27
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,347
- Bye. Have fun.
- All right.

28
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,609
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

29
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:20,049
Great.

30
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:24,091
I told Aidan about the affair.
He broke up with me.

31
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:27,956
- We never had sex on honeymoon.
- You win.

32
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,260
shall we get more coffee or shall we
get guns and kill ourselves?

33
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:34,868
He couldn't get it up.

34
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:39,167
We tried twice. It was so frustrating,
we started playing golf.

35
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:43,640
After many days of golf, Charlotte's
handicap had gone down twelve.

36
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:46,178
Trey's handicap had stayed the same.

37
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:51,115
- Impotence is a common problem.
- Oh, God.

38
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:54,449
Do you think he's impotent?

39
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:56,056
Well...

40
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:59,023
My husband can't be impotent.
He's gorgeous.

41
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,458
All right then. Glad you solved that.

42
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,899
He was nervous about the wedding,
the honeymoon and the golf.

43
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,666
- He played really badly one day.
- What do you want me to say?

44
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,869
- Let's change the subject.
- Right.

45
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:22,108
- What happened with Aidan?
- Nothing good.

46
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:27,220
I only agreed to this trip to get
away from Aidan and the whole mess.

47
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:33,962
Let's go to Barneys. I can't go
to Los Angeles without new shoes.

48
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:39,332
No. You go, I'm gonna stay
and have another cup.

49
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:43,096
- Just go. Have fun.
- All right.

50
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:49,907
- Call me if you need me.
- OK.

51
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:03,390
Later, three single New Yorkers
arrived in the City of Angels.

52
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:07,117
I so needed this vacation.

53
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,790
- You and me both, sister.
- Hooray for Hollywood!

54
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:19,734
That's his job? To sit
in a fake fish tank in underwear?

55
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:23,274
- What do you think he's reading?
- The want ads?

56
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:26,346
- There's a problem.
- Words I'm never fond of hearing.

57
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:29,848
I have reservations for Jones
and Bradshaw, but not Hobbes.

58
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:35,012
- That's just great.
- There should be three reservations.

59
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,751
The production company requested
two rooms, and we're booked up.

60
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,827
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

61
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,021
she's from New York.

62
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:46,929
I understand.
I'll have another room tomorrow.

63
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,731
Until then, could you stay
with one of your friends?

64
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:56,502
- I'll stay with her.
- Don't complain about my smoking.

65
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:58,942
They didn't request smoking rooms.

66
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,174
- Excuse me?
- You're on a non-smoking floor.

67
00:05:03,352 --> 00:05:06,549
Words I'm even less fond of hearing.

68
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:11,648
Later, decked out
in our "New York goes to LA" finest,

69
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:14,591
we were ready for a night on the town.

70
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:24,899
- OK, I'm ready.
- Let's go.

71
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,403
Back in the hotel bar, we realized

72
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:35,107
the three-hour time difference made
us three hours late for cocktail hour.

73
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:39,482
- Welcome to LA. I'm Garth.
- You know I'm from out of town?

74
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,317
If you lived here,
we would have met by now.

75
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:45,984
What do you do when you're not
a one-man welcome wagon?

76
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:50,224
- I'm a dildo model.
- You wouldn't tease a girl?

77
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,596
I'm the number two selling model
in the Us. Number one in Canada.

78
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,705
- My dick's bigger in Canada.
- You gotta love that metric system.

79
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,001
I gotta run.

80
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,871
Where?
A dildo emergency?

81
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:05,741
You think I'm yanking your chain,
but I'm not.

82
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:09,873
We're having a promotional party
at Hustler store,

83
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:13,351
celebrating the launch
of a new line of toys and accessories.

84
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:16,286
Here's an invitation. come.

85
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:20,495
I always do.

86
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:27,133
As samantha said goodbye
to Mr. Dildo,

87
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:30,465
Miranda said hello to Mr. Dique.
Mr. Jason Dique.

88
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,666
It's spelled D-I-Q-U-E. And yes,
I've thought about changing it.

89
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:38,279
It would be worse
if your first name was Little.

90
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:40,244
What do you do?

91
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,645
- I'm a lawyer.
- I thought I had it bad.

92
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,878
- No.
- No, it's great. You look like a lawyer.

93
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:48,454
You look like a dick.

94
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:52,424
It is so great
to talk to a smart and funny woman.

95
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:58,023
What was I saying?

96
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,466
- It's great to talk to a smart woman.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:05,038
Could you excuse me for a second?

98
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:12,507
I was having drinks with the most
feared creature in Los Angeles -

99
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:14,841
the junior development executive.

100
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,418
I love your columns.
They're so relatable.

101
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,884
- Thanks. I try.
- It's like I'm you.

102
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,115
I will be when I turn 30.

103
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:27,855
You! You are such a loser.
You're a loser.

104
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,362
You are. Loser.

105
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,625
I'm kidding.

106
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,861
What a loser. Last year,
he pitched me nothing but shit 24-7.

107
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,666
- That's a lot of shit.
- No shit.

108
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:42,442
seriously, I am you.

109
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:46,012
You've had your heart broken,
I've had my heart broken.

110
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,274
If I have,
that means other girls have.

111
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,248
If other girls have,
that means big opening weekend.

112
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,888
Not x-Men big, but chick flick big.

113
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,287
The guy who came up with that term
should have his balls cut off.

114
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:02,055
- Isn't that a little severe?
- I hope I don't sound like an asshole.

115
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:05,530
- I love your shoes.
- Oh, thanks.

116
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:10,070
Big news.
I have a star interested. Guess who.

117
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:16,200
- Drew Barrymore?
- No. Guess.

118
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,673
- I'm not good with celebrity names.
- Guess.

119
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:26,553
- That Jennifer Love something girl?
- No. Guess.

120
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,714
I'm done guessing.

121
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,087
Matthew McConaughey.

122
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:40,224
- Why would he wanna be involved?
- Because he's smart.

123
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:43,235
He's a producer as well,
and he took to the material.

124
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,873
We're meeting him tomorrow at 3:00.

125
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,635
Hot, hotty, hot.
What do you think?

126
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:58,887
In New York, Charlotte was dealing
with a bed that was cold, coldy, cold.

127
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:03,423
- Trey, come to bed. It's late.
- In a minute.

128
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:06,425
I won't sleep until I've entered
all these wedding gifts.

129
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:11,259
sleep was the last thing Charlotte
hoped Trey would do in bed.

130
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:16,871
I've listed the gifts,
who it's from, and the addresses.

131
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,734
Make it a breeze when you
send out the thank-you notes.

132
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,604
I can't wait till this wedding nonsense
is behind us.

133
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:27,715
Then we can relax
and just be a regular man and wife.

134
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,407
Wait.

135
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:35,045
Jamesons were crystal candlesticks
and sullivans were silver?

136
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,123
Hello there.

137
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:40,556
You know, since we've been home,

138
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:45,632
I've been feeling
so much more relaxed, haven't you?

139
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:51,740
You've deleted Mr. and Mrs. Handy
and their steuben glass bowl. Wait.

140
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:54,464
Trey...

141
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:58,141
We have a problem.

142
00:09:58,313 --> 00:09:59,837
I know.

143
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:04,452
We've got two serving platters.
We only registered for one.

144
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:08,581
Charlotte walked back
to her big park Avenue bed,

145
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:12,784
wishing she had remembered
to register for a sex life.

146
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:16,192
When visiting LA,
there are two things you must do -

147
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:18,490
one is rent a fabulous car,

148
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,862
two is learn how to drive it.

149
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:25,939
- You said you could drive a stick.
- I did a few times in a parking lot.

150
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,473
Why didn't you get an automatic?

151
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:31,077
I love this car.
It goes with my outfit.

152
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:35,478
I believed that cars are to Los Angeles
what handbags are to New York.

153
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:40,883
What's with this hill?
LA is supposed to be flat.

154
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:43,354
- They mean culturally.
- The hotel's there.

155
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:46,016
To get there
we have to go up this hill.

156
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,367
That's enough. stop.

157
00:10:56,671 --> 00:11:01,301
I'm not going to die in this tin can.
I have a date with a dildo.

158
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,103
- I'm sorry.
- OK. Come on, we're gonna do it.

159
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,447
Yeah, baby.

160
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:19,687
A little later,
freshly showered and freaked out,

161
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,991
I drove to the studio for my meeting
with Matthew McConaughey.

162
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,611
- Can I help you?
- Building five?

163
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:47,914
There aren't any hills in there,
are there?

164
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:51,251
- Go down there, make a left.
- Thank you.

165
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:02,126
I do. I like all of it.
Your writing is brilliant.

166
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:06,329
I really do.
It's sharp, edgy, brutal at times.

167
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:09,500
It's always a little juicy.
It's very New York.

168
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:12,908
I do like it. I really do.

169
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:18,951
My God. Thank you,
Matthew McConaughey.

170
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,111
You're welcome,
Carrie Bradshaw.

171
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:24,489
Here's what I've been thinking about -

172
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,494
how do we get your column
to translate to the silver screen?

173
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,495
I think I've got the answer.

174
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,659
What if we flush out
the central relationship?

175
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:42,505
- OK. The central relationship.
- Carrie and Mr. Big.

176
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:45,168
I don't see why
they couldn't make it work.

177
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,009
I couldn't believe it.
I flew 3,000 miles

178
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:52,347
to have Matthew McConaughey ask
what I've asked myself for years?

179
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:55,420
Look at him.
He is such a great guy.

180
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:59,115
I don't know anybody
any cooler than Mr. Big.

181
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:04,493
The only question is,
"What the fuck is Carrie's problem?"

182
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,759
What do you think?

183
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:12,032
Well...
I don't particularly think

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,868
it was just her problem.

185
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:19,979
He had some commitment issues.

186
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:23,049
That's bullshit, Carrie,
and you know it.

187
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,315
Cut.

188
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,513
Kidding. I'm acting.

189
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,522
That's what I do.
see what I mean?

190
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:36,959
That's why I wanna develop
the story with you.

191
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:38,394
I'm Mr. Big.

192
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,531
Oh, OK.
Well. Yeah. That's...

193
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:45,901
Excellent. You're in.
You know what else?

194
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,673
I really wanna fuck you, baby.

195
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:55,873
- Are you acting now?
- I'm Big, OK? You be Carrie.

196
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,143
- I am Carrie.
- We're animals.

197
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:04,280
Man, woman, walking the earth.
We're made of head, heart and loins.

198
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,757
We're talking about using them,
am I right?

199
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,524
I have...

200
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:16,363
The girl said that we would
talk about the columns today.

201
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,698
Let's get down to the underbelly
of these two characters.

202
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:23,571
Let's figure out
why they're so fucked up.

203
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:27,181
Well, I have a facial at four.

204
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:31,852
I love you. I don't understand
why we can't be together.

205
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,456
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- I don't think you should.

206
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,922
- What?
- I don't think Carrie should smoke.

207
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,359
That's all right.

208
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,658
Or in my office. OK?

209
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,462
After I left the meeting
I took a wrong turn

210
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:52,629
and somehow found myself
right back where I had started -

211
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:56,800
back in New York,
back wondering about Big.

212
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,909
I had come to LA for a vacation,

213
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:03,881
hoping to get away from Big, Aidan,
and most of all myself.

214
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:08,955
sitting on the fake set,
all my issues felt more real than ever.

215
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:14,289
I couldn't help but wonder - no matter
how far you travel or run from it,

216
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,896
can you ever really escape your past?

217
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,300
Ma'am? No smoking.

218
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:23,232
I'm outside.

219
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:26,737
And it's New York.

220
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:41,578
In New York, the release of a new
book is cause for celebration.

221
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:44,589
Here in LA, a new line
of sex toys will do the trick.

222
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,626
- Isn't this fun?
- The answer would be no.

223
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:51,424
- We want to go.
- What? We can't leave yet.

224
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:55,433
- They haven't cut the cock.
- Do you think it's cream-filled?

225
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:58,595
I am exhausted
from McConaughey mania.

226
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:02,675
I wanna get into bed, go to sleep
and pretend this day never happened.

227
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:07,611
stay! Garth is gonna autograph
some dildos. He's a big seller.

228
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:11,479
- He's the John Grisham of penises.
- I'm gonna get in line.

229
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:18,351
I can't believe how open
and "Hi, have sex" this place is.

230
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:21,359
In New York
sex is bottom shelf, paper bag.

231
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:24,030
Exactly. It's all hidden, like me.

232
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,635
- What do you mean?
- Last night I talked to this cute guy.

233
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:31,465
We were having a great time. Then
a woman in a tight dress walked by,

234
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,301
with big breasts -
just boom, here they are.

235
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:37,706
- He totally went for it.
- Right.

236
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,782
I wanted to have sex but it was hidden
in my witty banter and my little looks.

237
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:47,615
- she put it out there and got the guy.
- But how long did she have him?

238
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,723
Who cares?
I wanna get laid.

239
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,985
I admire women who can put it
out there where you can see it.

240
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:56,289
Like her.

241
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:01,399
- You want to dress like her?
- You know what I mean.

242
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,197
Do you think there's any chance
she's not up for sex?

243
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:08,240
No, because she's a hooker.

244
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:12,641
- Hi. Have we met?
- No.

245
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:16,011
I was telling my friend how much
I admire what you're wearing.

246
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:17,673
Thank you.

247
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:22,551
- Are you in the porn industry?
- God, no. I'm a lawyer for Disney.

248
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,082
see?

249
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:27,922
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you so much.

250
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:30,329
You made it.

251
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:37,234
My opinion of Canadian consumers
just went up a notch.

252
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:40,101
sign it, please.

253
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,971
- How shall I sign it?
- I don't know.

254
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:47,979
To samantha, who's staying
at the standard, room 324.

255
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:51,585
- perfect. I'll deliver it personally.
- You're too kind.

256
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:58,252
That night, samantha took home
the Deluxe Garth.

257
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:03,222
Next door, I learned that not only
could I not escape my past,

258
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:06,026
I couldn't escape my present.

259
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:13,699
What is it about California air?
It makes me sleep so well.

260
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:18,337
It's not the air. Your headboard
knocked you unconscious.

261
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:20,413
- You heard us?
- I didn't.

262
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:23,243
- No, Ms snore, you wouldn't.
- Are you OK?

263
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:28,117
I'm cranky. I have another meeting
with McConaughey and his partners

264
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,316
to brainstorm what goes wrong
with "Carrie" and her relationships.

265
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,960
Don't go.

266
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:36,722
I have to.
I'm their little writer monkey.

267
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:41,335
I've got something
to make you feel better.

268
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:45,338
Dildos before 10:00am.
I'm all perked up.

269
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,838
They're autographed.
One for each.

270
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:51,273
My friend went to California,
and all I got was this lousy dildo.

271
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:54,506
Could you put these back?
people are staring.

272
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:58,618
In LA no one cares if your egg whites
have a side of cock.

273
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,288
Wow! Nobody needs this much.

274
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:04,186
The average woman
is only five inches deep.

275
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,520
Is that written on your placemat?

276
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:10,528
- The mark of a fine penis is width.
- Couldn't agree more.

277
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:12,825
That's why you'll enjoy your presents.

278
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,130
Are you saying
that Garth has the perfect girth?

279
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,669
Exactly.

280
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,506
As much as I enjoy
the fine life-like craftsmanship,

281
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,204
I'm going to leave mine with you.

282
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:33,014
I'm holding on to mine. LA isn't
working out the way I had hoped.

283
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:37,123
Meanwhile, back in New York and
still no closer to being in-put by Trey,

284
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,454
Charlotte addressed thank you notes.

285
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:46,362
Every time she licked a love stamp,
it made a mockery of her marriage.

286
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:57,044
It's me. It's been days and nothing.
What if he really is impotent?

287
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,941
What kind of impotence
do you think it is?

288
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:04,517
- The kind that makes it soft.
- No, no. physical or emotional?

289
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:08,177
- I don't know.
- Have you asked him about it?

290
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:11,086
He's embarrassed.
He doesn't want to talk about it.

291
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:17,061
Here's what to do - put a ring of paper
around his penis while he's asleep.

292
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:20,598
- I sound like a perverted Nancy Drew.
- What does that do?

293
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:26,263
If it rips overnight, he is capable of an
erection. The problem is not physical.

294
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:30,138
- This floor is non-smoking.
- I have an addiction, sir.

295
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:34,304
- A ring of paper.
- Yup.

296
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:41,818
That night, samantha invited Mr.
Dildo out for dim sum, and then some.

297
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:46,722
Tell me more about yourself.
What are your interests?

298
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:49,886
- That's pretty obvious.
- I'm serious.

299
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:54,501
Don't you wanna know
more about me, my interests?

300
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:58,730
- OK.
- I'm a poet.

301
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,135
I've been published in journals...

302
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:05,374
Garth wanted samantha to know
that he was more than just a sex toy.

303
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,514
He had a soft side.

304
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,344
Do you want to hear one?

305
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:14,318
Far away, Charlotte was dealing
with Trey's soft side as well.

306
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:17,185
she was going to get some answers.

307
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:20,885
she came to bed armed with love.

308
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,166
she went to sleep hoping her male
had sufficient postage

309
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:37,209
to deliver his package into her box.

310
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:42,577
Back at the hotel, samantha
was waiting for a delivery of her own.

311
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,547
Once again, the leaves bloomed forth

312
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:48,485
some headed south,
some headed north

313
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,327
That's beautiful.
Come here.

314
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,930
Blue as a baby bird

315
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:04,672
Winged and aloft
My eyes search your eyes

316
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,330
For something I've lost

317
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:11,670
samantha, I was thinking.

318
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:16,073
- You were?
- We have this great connection.

319
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,686
And I've done LA.
How about I move to New York?

320
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:22,948
I could pursue my two passions,
poetry and porn.

321
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,922
- I...
- Wouldn't it be great?

322
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:28,288
We could keep seeing each other.

323
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:30,521
Having a fling in LA is one thing,

324
00:22:30,698 --> 00:22:35,294
but introducing Mr. Dildo to everyone
at a gala at the Met was quite another.

325
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:39,405
I don't think it would work. I know me.

326
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,100
I'm much too possessive a woman
to share your penis with the world.

327
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:47,941
Just like that, samantha escaped
a life as Mrs. Dildo.

328
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:51,346
she moved Garth
out of her present and into her past.

329
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,215
But she took
the best part of him with her.

330
00:22:56,624 --> 00:23:00,025
I had finally found a place
to escape Miranda's snoring.

331
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:04,290
The ghosts of my relationships past
weren't so easy to shake.

332
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:08,629
I hadn't really moved on from Big
and Aidan. I'd just moved.

333
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:10,861
Excuse me.

334
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,029
I'll put it out, ok?

335
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:16,267
No, I was wondering
if I could bum one.

336
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:19,277
sorry, it was my last one.

337
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:24,347
Do you want some company?

338
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:32,916
- Are you sure you wanna be alone?
- I am.

339
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:36,393
As soon as I said it out loud,
I knew that that was what I wanted...

340
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,201
...and needed.

341
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:49,606
Charlotte woke up as excited
as a little girl on Christmas morning.

342
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:54,146
she couldn't wait to see
if Trey's package was unwrapped.

343
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:07,558
Morning, morning, morning.

344
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:11,556
Good morning.
What are you so excited about?

345
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:14,292
Nothing. I just love you.

346
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,536
I love you, too.

347
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:21,573
For the first time in weeks,
Charlotte felt relieved.

348
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:25,735
Trey's problem wasn't physical.
Then she realized,

349
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:30,543
if it wasn't physical, she couldn't
escape that it might be emotional.

350
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:34,586
There was no easy
love stamp solution to fix that.

351
00:24:36,824 --> 00:24:39,452
I am totally digging this scene.

352
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:42,994
It's so urban cowboy circa 1982.

353
00:24:43,164 --> 00:24:47,396
All the great places in LA and we're
at the saddle Ranch Chop House?

354
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:50,696
Don't complain, it's the closest bar
without a hill involved.

355
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,998
This is what I'm talking about.
Look at her.

356
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:56,473
she screams sex. It's so honest.

357
00:24:56,644 --> 00:25:01,672
- I wish I could be more like that.
- stop complaining. Do something.

358
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,516
OK, which lovely lady
is gonna be next?

359
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:12,318
- I will.
- Miranda, no.

360
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,358
- she will.
- No.

361
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:34,078
Hold on.

362
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:42,118
We weren't sure if it was the climate
or the five beers she drank,

363
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:47,226
but as soon as she got on that bull,
Miranda escaped Miranda.

364
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:01,873
Wow, I can see
she really did need a vacation.

365
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:10,210
The next day,
as I pulled up to the studio, I realized,

366
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:12,716
I was the one who held the key
to my escape.

367
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:17,517
I could go in and have someone tell
me the mistakes I'd made in my past,

368
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:21,752
or I could drive on
and figure them out myself.

369
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:28,895
That's what I did.

370
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:32,971
If I could master a stick shift,

371
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,076
could a successful relationship
be that far behind?
