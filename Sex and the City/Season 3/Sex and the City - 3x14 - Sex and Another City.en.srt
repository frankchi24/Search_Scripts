1
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:56,733
LA - land of perpetual sun
and sunbathing, which also makes it

2
00:00:56,905 --> 00:01:00,500
land of the perpetual bikini wax.

3
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:05,875
After a week, I made an appointment
with the city's waxer to the stars -

4
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,379
Alicia.

5
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,111
she was known for her artful work,
her lightning-quick hands...

6
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:16,115
...and her indecipherable accent.

7
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:18,419
Excuse me?

8
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:26,193
All done. Beautiful. You look.

9
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,703
I got mugged!

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,535
she took everything I've got.

11
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,371
It's called "The Brazilian Wax. "

12
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:37,341
Why didn't you tell her to stop?

13
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:40,413
I feel like one of those hairless dogs.

14
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:43,642
It's an aesthetic thing. They do it here.

15
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,185
LA men are too lazy
to search for anything.

16
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:49,449
You can't hide your light
under a bush.

17
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,219
Didn't she leave a triangle,
a landing strip?

18
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:56,491
No, I am totally bald and freezing.

19
00:01:56,665 --> 00:02:00,396
- I would have killed her.
- I'm so aware of down there now.

20
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,129
I feel like I'm nothing but walking sex.

21
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:06,468
The Brazilian makes you do
crazy things.

22
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:08,735
Be careful who you invite to Brazil.

23
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:12,347
- I'm officially Rsvp-ing - no.
- Where are you going?

24
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:15,540
- I'm meeting Lew.
- Letterman Lew?

25
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,812
He doesn't work for him any more.
He's writing that New York sitcom.

26
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:22,047
The one about the kids who live
in a loft.

27
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:26,024
- Yeah, one's a feisty waitress.
- What are you and Lew gonna do?

28
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:30,825
We'll have drinks and bitch about LA.
I can't believe he lives here now.

29
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:35,732
- Tell him to move to Brazil.
- You're on your own tonight.

30
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,566
- We'll go to that movie premiere.
- What's the movie?

31
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,677
I don't know. We'll use my press pass
and get into the after party.

32
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:47,179
- I love LA.
- You two should get out of the sun.

33
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:55,384
Lew asked Miranda
to meet him at The Flowing Tree.

34
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,890
surrounded by all these tanned,
fit, happy people,

35
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:03,225
she knew she would recognize pale,
chubby, unhappy Lew immediately.

36
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,433
Miranda.

37
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:09,728
Oh, my God!

38
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:14,740
- Do I look that different?
- Good thing you still wear that hat.

39
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,936
- If you ever see me in a Lakers hat...
-... shoot you.

40
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:21,742
- Exactly. Do you want to sit?
- You look amazing.

41
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:24,852
- Thanks. Wanna grab a drink?
- please.

42
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,387
Yes, let's go. The sight
of all these bleached teeth is blinding.

43
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:32,357
No, here. This place is known
for its green tea infusions.

44
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:35,964
please - infusions?
Could LA be any worse?

45
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:39,157
Take off that hat,
I'm gonna shoot you right now.

46
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,962
I really like it here.

47
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:47,131
Where's the guy I shared beers with
and made fun of happy people?

48
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:51,540
I know. The thing is, I think
I'm one of those happy people now.

49
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:55,672
- Good for you!
- I know it sounds crazy.

50
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,376
I was supremely unhappy
in NewYork.

51
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:02,718
I came here, and I let
a lot of that old toxic anger go.

52
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:07,954
I take things slowly, get outside...
LA agrees with me.

53
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,997
Miranda realized,
she was the one standing out.

54
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,693
she was the only angry
New Yorker for miles.

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,101
Let's go for a hike.

56
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:29,372
Later that night,
two very happy New Yorkers prepared

57
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:32,349
to hike up their first LA red carpet.

58
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:37,617
- Carrie Bradshaw, New York star.
- Are you on the list?

59
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:42,127
- I'm a columnist. That's me.
- Press room is to the left.

60
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:45,858
Crinkle-cut cheese and fat reporters,
I don't think so.

61
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:48,867
- Let me see your movie passes.
- No one goes to the movie.

62
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:53,269
Everyone goes to the movie.
Could you step off the red carpet?

63
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:56,969
- Do you know who she is?
- she's not on the list.

64
00:04:57,145 --> 00:05:00,478
OK, OK. Let's just go.

65
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:04,608
This wouldn't happen in NewYork.
People knowyou in NewYork.

66
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,414
- No one goes to the movie.
- We're out of here.

67
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,489
I'm getting the car.

68
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:16,963
There I was, a Hollywood nobody,

69
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:23,332
cast off the red carpet and standing
in my proper place on a parking lot.

70
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:27,498
We're talking in circles here.
That's right.

71
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:31,043
I understand.
I heard you. OK, sure.

72
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:40,351
Tell her that when she's ready to deal,
she can call me herself.

73
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:45,152
- please tell me you have another one.
- I thought I had a problem.

74
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:48,728
Got a light for me?
Thanks.

75
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:55,769
Full tars, very nice.
I thought they'd banned these here.

76
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,304
I taped them to my body on the plane.

77
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,202
- New Yorker?
- Yeah.

78
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,344
Keith Travers,
representing Matt Damon.

79
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,538
Carrie Bradshaw,
representing myself.

80
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:09,707
- Actress?
- No, no. Writer.

81
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,079
Too pretty to be a writer.

82
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:14,916
That's too cheesy
for you to be a writer.

83
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,187
- It will take an hour to get the car.
- samantha Jones, Keith Travers.

84
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,990
He's representing Matt Damon.

85
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,929
- You aren't going anywhere.
- If you say so.

86
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,899
Let's go inside,
just enjoy our evening.

87
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:32,734
Once we got inside,
our magic carpet ride really began.

88
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,934
I can't believe they wouldn't let you in.
That's a disconnect.

89
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:40,810
- A disconnect?
- Yeah. It's like a fuck-up.

90
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,917
A disconnect!

91
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:47,886
Yeah. You writers are word Nazis.
You're gonna ride me with that.

92
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,457
someone's ass is ringing,
and it ain't mine.

93
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,118
Yours would if it could.
It would ring.

94
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:58,926
Excuse me, I'll just be one second.
Enjoy yourself.

95
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,463
That is one tall drink ofwater.

96
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,947
she had worshipped Hugh Hefner
since she was old enough

97
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:19,554
to steal her father's playboys.
This wasn't a celebrity sighting.

98
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:22,019
This was the celebrity sighting.

99
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,282
I'll be back.

100
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:32,333
Hugh, hi. I'm samantha Jones.

101
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:35,493
- Hello.
- I'm a huge fan.

102
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:38,435
- In that case, join us for a drink.
- A drink?

103
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,007
- That would be great.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,567
seriously?

105
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:51,582
Drinking with three blondes -
I guess that's a regular day for you.

106
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,347
A slow one, yes.

107
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:59,759
I'm pretty crazed this week,
but I have an opening on Wednesday.

108
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:03,091
Can I take you out?
Linc, great table.

109
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:06,495
I had been trying
to get into Linc for a week.

110
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:11,162
He seemed smart and sexy,
and this outsider liked being inside.

111
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,001
- Yeah, OK. sure.
- Great.

112
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,474
Hey, Keith.
There's a vlp room.

113
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,474
- Do you want to go there?
- Yeah, I want to go to the vlp room.

114
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,709
- Let's go.
- All right.

115
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,789
Back home,
Charlotte had never felt more inside.

116
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:32,290
she had just attended
her first black tie doctors' benefit.

117
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:41,634
- We make a fine looking couple.
- Yes, we do.

118
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:46,732
so, how did I do?

119
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:49,536
Mrs. MacDougal, you did quite well.

120
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:52,305
Thank you, Dr MacDougal.

121
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:58,545
You know, doctor, I have an itch.
Could you help me out with it?

122
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,351
Trey?

123
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,689
Maybe it's time we thought
about some options, like viagra.

124
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,932
Are you aware that viagra is a killer
for men with heart problems?

125
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:22,907
My father died of a heart attack.
It runs in my family.

126
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:25,546
Trey wasn't the only one
with heart problems.

127
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,410
I'm just trying to help.

128
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,949
Now I'm tense.
I'm going for a run.

129
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,783
It was the fifth time he'd gone running
at bedtime in the last two weeks.

130
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:40,021
The next day, samantha decided
to get some exercise as well.

131
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,323
Her pocketbook was getting
most of the workout.

132
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,523
Fendi, 150.

133
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:52,829
she decided
to give her old pocketbook a rest.

134
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:04,713
As Charlotte picked up my mail,
she realized

135
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:10,552
she missed more than her sex life.
she missed her single life.

136
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:15,788
If Trey could run away
from their problems, so could she.

137
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:23,330
- I can't deal with Trey.
- Calling might be more economical.

138
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:27,769
And I really missed you guys.

139
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,844
We missed you too.

140
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:34,539
- Trey is...
- It's not working.

141
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:37,616
He refuses to even talk about it.

142
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:42,348
- I take it you'll be staying?
- I need a vacation.

143
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:46,550
You came to the right place.
I gotta meet this Keith guy.

144
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:49,788
Miranda and samantha
are down by the pool.

145
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,971
Charlotte glanced
at the glistening pool,

146
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,701
and just like that, her marriage
and Trey seemed far away.

147
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:12,111
Before lunch, I agreed to go with Keith
to see a house he was interested in.

148
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,590
This is not a house. This is an airport.

149
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:23,754
It's Lorenzo Lamas'.
He's asking 3.4, but it'll go for 3.2.

150
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,923
There's a bargain!

151
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:30,834
In New York,
a first date is dinner and a movie.

152
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:35,238
In LA, it's lunch
and seeing a 3.4 million dollar house.

153
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,378
What do you think?

154
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:41,538
- I should work in television.
- It's good, right?

155
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:44,276
It's really good.

156
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:47,944
But does a single guy like you
need this much space?

157
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:51,217
probably not.
But come on, it looks good.

158
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,418
so did he.

159
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:07,105
In the south American's living room,
my Brazilian made me kiss him.

160
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:11,835
Wait till you see the hot tub.

161
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,982
- We should check out the hot tub.
- Okey-dokey.

162
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:24,581
I'll have the omelet with no cheese,
but tomatoes and mushrooms.

163
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,425
Instead of the fries a side of fruit
with no grapes, and a half decaf skim.

164
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:32,964
You should get
the mushrooms steamed.

165
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,864
It lightens the calories
but retains the flavor.

166
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,800
Great, thanks.

167
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:40,567
- I really like LA.
- Who wouldn't?

168
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:43,734
Keith wants a $3 million house
and I can't afford new curtains.

169
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:47,780
That's where the guys here have
New York men beat - real estate.

170
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:50,884
- Lew may be the perfect guy.
- Letterman Lew?

171
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:54,283
Yeah. He's an ideal combination
of the two coasts.

172
00:12:54,456 --> 00:13:00,520
He's a New Yorker at heart, but he's
lost all his neuroses and 30 pounds.

173
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:04,358
We're New Yorkers. Aren't we
supposed to like neurotic guys?

174
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,830
The Woody Allen thing is so over.

175
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:10,697
He's a changed man.
He's spiritual and happy.

176
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,806
- He met the Dalai Lama.
- I met Hugh Hefner.

177
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:17,308
One woman's pornographer
is another woman's spiritual leader.

178
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:21,813
Maybe he's on to something.
Maybe it's time I stopped being angry.

179
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:26,977
- How would you spend your time?
- I'll tell you what you could do.

180
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:29,589
- shop.
- Jesus!

181
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:32,818
- No, you didn't!
- That's like $3,000.

182
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,588
Or 150. Fake.

183
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,789
- No.
- It looks so real.

184
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,025
- I know.
- Give me that.

185
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,863
You'd never know it wasn't real
unless you looked at the lining.

186
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:45,768
I don't have that luxury.
All my insides are on the outside now.

187
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,068
- I don't like fakes.
- All that matters is what it looks like.

188
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:50,506
It's good.

189
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:55,206
We could get more. I got the guy's
card. He lives in the "valley".

190
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,981
- Could you have more condoms?
- I did.

191
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:04,091
I am so happy
to be out of that condom stage of life.

192
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,386
I thought it was called "my thirties".

193
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,721
It's nice to go to bed
with the same man every night.

194
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:13,891
Tell me you didn't come to LA to
tell us how much sex you're having.

195
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:18,096
Charlotte couldn't tell them her
conjugal bliss was a conjugal miss.

196
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:21,434
What should I do first in LA?

197
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:26,808
The first thing you'll need is
a good bikini wax.

198
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,541
You should try Alicia.

199
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:44,195
That night, after hours of pool time,
I realized something startling.

200
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:47,198
I was actually starting to like LA.

201
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:51,701
New Yorkers are trained
to hate Los Angeles,

202
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:54,171
where, supposedly,
intellect is ridiculed

203
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,208
and who you date
and what you look like is revered.

204
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,744
Yet, we were
having the time of our lives.

205
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:03,213
The men were happy, the homes
were huge, the bags looked great.

206
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:07,514
Maybe that was enough.
The weather moves from west to east.

207
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:11,625
Was it a just matter of time before
the truth blew across Manhattan?

208
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:14,728
When it comes to
bags, men and cities,

209
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:17,559
is it really what's outside that counts?

210
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:21,759
The next day, samantha and I
went to the valley for Fendi bags.

211
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:24,234
This is it, 45386.

212
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,839
- Is that an address or a zip code?
- I don't know.

213
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,499
I miss Lorenzo Lamas'
neighborhood.

214
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:37,376
- My God.
- Oh, there he is.

215
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:42,345
We had found it. Fake Fendi paradise.

216
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,551
He should work on his display area.

217
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:49,754
seven for 1,000. You like?

218
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:55,665
I should have liked them. But staring
into the trunk, they didn't look elegant.

219
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:59,398
They looked cheap. Even if
everyone else thought it was real,

220
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:04,307
I'd always know, my bag came
from a trunk deep in the valley.

221
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:07,175
You know what? I don't think so.

222
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:11,546
- You don't want a bag now?
- sorry. They're very nice. It's just...

223
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,711
please, don't smoke near the bags.

224
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:19,352
We drove for two hours in the valley...

225
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:24,861
That's it. I'm going back to the hotel.

226
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:29,834
They looked so sad
staring up at me from that trunk.

227
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:32,063
They were waiting to be adopted.

228
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,767
I was almost eaten by dogs. The least
you could've done was buy a bag.

229
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:42,041
It's better to wait for the real thing.
Then at least you know it's special.

230
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:46,312
- My marriage is a fake Fendi.
- Excuse me?

231
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:50,150
Trey and I look like
the perfect couple from the outside,

232
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:54,557
but on the inside it's all fake.
It's not special.

233
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,993
- He can't get it up.
- What?

234
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:00,498
- We've never had sex.
- You've never had sex?

235
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,761
- You've been married for...
-... over a month.

236
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:06,964
- You've never had sex?
- It's not physical, it's emotional.

237
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:10,440
- You knew about this?
- she told me at the wedding.

238
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:16,973
You'd just say you'd told me so and
I shouldn't have married so quickly.

239
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:22,912
Who am I to judge you?
We all have our own paths in life.

240
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,924
Three days with Lew
had changed Miranda

241
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:29,689
from deeply sarcastic
to Deepak Chopra.

242
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:33,857
- What am I gonna do?
- You've never had sex?

243
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:37,266
- she's never had sex.
- It's only been a month.

244
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:42,171
- He hasn't seen Brazil.
- A honeymoon to south America.

245
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:45,346
- That might do the trick.
- I know how to cheer you up.

246
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,606
A trip to the playboy mansion.

247
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:51,615
Hef invited us for one of those
playmate pool parties.

248
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:53,754
Did you say, "Hef"?

249
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:57,152
Why would that cheer her up?
Does she look like a frat boy?

250
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:59,759
No, but it wouldn't hurt to meet some.

251
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:03,226
- sorry, not going.
- Come on, it would be fun.

252
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:05,332
We're in LA.

253
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,230
All right, fine,
but I better be on the guest list.

254
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:12,601
Later that night, I was a guest
at Keith's amazing house.

255
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:16,335
He made sizzling scallops, and
after dinner things got even hotter.

256
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:22,380
I like hot tubs. NewYork should have
more hot tubs like on roofs and stuff.

257
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,018
Well, if you like that...

258
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:56,877
While I was going native with Keith,
Miranda and Lew went to New York.

259
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,110
At least to the New York strip steak.

260
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:02,415
- This looks great.
- God, do I miss this smell!

261
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,150
so, you were saying?

262
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,885
Read "zen And The Art
Of Modern Living".

263
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:10,997
I'm still trying
to get used to bath beans.

264
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:14,828
- You are so New York.
- Come on, don't you miss it?

265
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:18,403
- Just a little?
- No, I write about it every day.

266
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:20,803
That's not New York,
it's a sound stage.

267
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:26,605
20-somethings with tiny salaries don't
live in soHo lofts. It's totally fake.

268
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:30,615
40 million viewers
would disagree with you on that one.

269
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:41,352
- Is something wrong with your steak?
- No, it's great.

270
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,564
- What are you doing?
- I'm tasting my food.

271
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:59,736
- Why aren't you swallowing it?
- You think I look this good by eating?

272
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:04,146
Lew hadn't found inner peace,
he'd found an eating disorder.

273
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:07,583
- Are you serious?
- Don't put your toxic shit on me.

274
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:11,282
This is LA. You have no idea
what pressure I'm under.

275
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,484
Who cares what you look like.
You're a writer.

276
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:17,427
For a hit show.
No one wants to hire a fat story editor.

277
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:20,260
Miranda wanted
to rip that Knicks hat off his head.

278
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:25,031
No self-respecting New Yorker
would spit out that good a steak.

279
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:29,165
Jesus fucking Christ.
Now I've lost my appetite.

280
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:35,880
Waking up in Keith's sun-filled
bedroom, I felt like 3.4 million myself.

281
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,314
I like what you have
going on down there.

282
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:43,185
- That would be a whole lot of nothing.
- Yeah.

283
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:46,121
- Don't you work?
- I don't have anything till eleven.

284
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:48,728
- Nice life.
- Yeah.

285
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:54,429
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

286
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:57,969
I told you, no prostitutes
when you're house-sitting.

287
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:03,033
- You're a house-sitter?
- personal assistant.

288
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:06,806
- I thought you were an agent.
- My agent won't water my plants.

289
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:11,213
The life I was coveting wasn't Keith's,
it was Carrie Fisher's.

290
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:15,788
- You're so fired. Wait till I tell penny.
- Am I going to have to return her car?

291
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,481
And penny Marshall's.

292
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,558
I'm going to...

293
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:22,389
- You might need these.
- Thank you.

294
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:27,296
Are you going to bring prostitutes
to Ben's new $3 million home?

295
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,231
And Ben Affleck's.

296
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:32,566
I'm not a prostitute.
I'm carrie Bradshaw.

297
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:38,303
I'm a writer too.
I have a column in New York.

298
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:42,108
I'm Carrie, you're Carrie.
I write, you write.

299
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:45,719
I have a child. I really can't do this.

300
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:49,017
Have you been smoking in here?

301
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:58,825
This was always on.

302
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,231
The dry-cleaning and the cat food,
that's all done.

303
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:06,169
It was the perfect ending
to my week of make-believe -

304
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,071
a visit to the playboy mansion
and the playmate pool party.

305
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:15,881
- Could our lives get any weirder?
- Nothing surprises me any more.

306
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,009
In LA, house-sitters are somebodies
and writers are prostitutes.

307
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:23,452
- You're at least a high-class escort.
- Thank you.

308
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:25,751
- Fuck Carrie Fisher!
- Now we're angry again?

309
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,088
- Yeah.
- I blame the wax.

310
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:30,560
That's it. Blame it on Rio.

311
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:37,198
After the sun went down,
the party really started heating up.

312
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:40,636
Where are the girls in the satin outfits
and the Bunny ears?

313
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:43,641
Yeah, I want to see some Bunny ears.

314
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:51,249
somewhere between
the Italian grotto and the petting zoo,

315
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,354
Charlotte found something real.
His name was Ian.

316
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:58,515
- so I started collecting Hockney.
- I love Hockney.

317
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:02,151
The colors in his pool series
are so LA.

318
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,128
The blues and those deep greens.

319
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:09,759
God, it is such a pleasure talking
to an intelligent woman for once.

320
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:12,064
I love talking to you too.

321
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:17,472
It's nice to be with a man who talks.
I love LA.

322
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:22,944
I guess that third welcome drink
has finally kicked in?

323
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:26,814
This is bad of me.
Is this bad of me? I'm drunk.

324
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,388
I'm lying here
with a man I hardly know.

325
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:32,549
It's the playboy mansion.
Things could be worse.

326
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:39,391
- You're nice, Ian. You're really nice.
- You're nice too.

327
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:46,503
- Let me buy you some boobs.
- pardon me?

328
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:50,507
- It's a gift.
- I don't need any breasts.

329
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,946
Charlotte had forgotten
how awful single life could be.

330
00:23:55,116 --> 00:23:58,950
Marriage, with all its problems,
wasn't looking so bad.

331
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,183
- someone stole my fake Fendi.
- Are you sure?

332
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,328
I put it beside me.
When I got up, it was gone.

333
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,662
Oh my God, that Bunny's got my bag.

334
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:20,936
Give me my bag.

335
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,804
- You stole my bag.
- This is my bag.

336
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:28,813
- Are we having a problem?
- Yes. This Bunny stole my bag.

337
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:32,578
- It's my bag.
- she says it's her bag.

338
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:35,813
Look on the inside.
A label that says "Made in China"

339
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,857
and there's a bunch
of condoms in there.

340
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,558
Fendi.

341
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,497
samantha was mortified. she thought
everything on the Bunny was fake.

342
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:53,162
OK then. Innocent mistake.

343
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,935
Apparently, one nod from Hef,
and the pool party was over.

344
00:24:57,111 --> 00:25:02,515
- I'm not leaving without my friends.
- I'm so sorry.

345
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:06,312
The fake Fendi ended up
costing 150 for the bag,

346
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:12,824
2,000 in stolen credit cards, and
unspecified costs to samantha's ego.

347
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:20,393
And Miranda and I took a wrong turn
on the way to the buffet.

348
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:29,242
Look at that - tit soup.

349
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,069
It's time to go home.

350
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,407
There you are.

351
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:36,607
- We have to leave.
- We are.

352
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:38,274
Right now.

353
00:25:38,452 --> 00:25:41,444
Relax. We're going, we're going.

354
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:45,388
- What did she do?
- I don't know.

355
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,724
What happened?
OK. All right.

356
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:54,766
The next day, four New Yorkers
left LA a little lighter.

357
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:58,996
some of us had lost our hair,
and all of us had lost a little dignity.

358
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:03,109
samantha couldn't wait to get back
to the crime-free streets of Manhattan.

359
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:05,643
Miranda couldn't wait
to get back to men who swallowed.

360
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:08,179
Charlotte couldn't wait
to get back to Trey.

361
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,783
And as for me, I couldn't wait.

362
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:14,512
- You can't smoke in here.
- Relax, we're going.

363
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:27,031
six hours later, I was home.

364
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:30,432
It looked even better on the inside
than I remembered it,

365
00:26:30,604 --> 00:26:35,132
because inside it was all real.

366
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,149
I was starting to feel like myself again.

367
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:47,885
The rest of me
would grow back eventually.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
