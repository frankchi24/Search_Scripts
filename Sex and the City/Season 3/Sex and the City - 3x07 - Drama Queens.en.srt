1
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,890
It happened two days ago.

2
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:54,399
Aidan and I had been seeing each other
for three weeks when...

3
00:00:55,571 --> 00:01:00,167
- What is it? Bad dream?
- I'm not sure.

4
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,778
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

5
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,375
The truth was I really didn't.

6
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:13,781
The next day
I searched for unpaid bills,

7
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:16,254
unanswered calls, unmet deadlines.

8
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,861
But I hadn't so much as missed
a teeth cleaning.

9
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:22,963
My life appeared to be in order.

10
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,392
But the next night, like clockwork...

11
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:33,138
I realized I was in an existential crisis.

12
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:36,972
one that not even the sight of this
season's Dolce & Gabbana sandals

13
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:38,807
could lift me out of.

14
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,789
Do you wanna spend the night?

15
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:53,759
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Relax. I'll get it.

16
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,636
Then I realized it.

17
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:10,040
What was wrong was,
for the first time in my life,

18
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:14,841
I was in a relationship
where absolutely nothing was wrong.

19
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,378
It's smooth sailing.

20
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:23,024
Nothing but calm seas, blue horizons.

21
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,318
See what I'm saying?

22
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,519
Absolutely. Not a cloud in sight.

23
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:29,323
We adore each other.

24
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:31,295
We have fun. We mesh.

25
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,866
And this is a problem?

26
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:39,668
It feels odd.
I'm used to the hunt.

27
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:44,835
This is... effortless.
It's freaking me out.

28
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:48,449
I totally understand.
You're not getting the stomach flip.

29
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:51,051
Which is just a fear of losing the guy.

30
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:53,278
Maybe I'm not used to
being with someone

31
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:56,754
who doesn't do the seductive
withholding dance.

32
00:02:56,925 --> 00:03:01,624
But there is an upside to being
with a guy with no surprises.

33
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:05,426
Steve is completely predictable,
but that's what I love about him.

34
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,161
He's so comfortable and safe.

35
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:10,498
Are you dating a man or a mini-van?

36
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,541
My new favorite thing to do
on a Saturday night is Steve's laundry

37
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:16,607
and I've never been happier.

38
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:19,941
Your relationship
is my greatest fear realized.

39
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:23,346
I understand your dilemma
and from my experience,

40
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:26,716
if he seems too good to be true,
he probably is.

41
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:31,018
I don't believe this. Nowwe're
dumping guys for being too available.

42
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:35,755
This is all solid proof of what
I've read in this great new book.

43
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:38,365
It says if you
really wanna get married,

44
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:42,162
you shouldn't spend so much time
around dysfunctional single women.

45
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,895
"Marriage Incorporated:

46
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:49,066
"Howto apply successful business
strategies to finding a husband".

47
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:54,079
chapter one:
"How To Get Ahead By Giving Head".

48
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:58,049
Fine! Make fun.
It's a very smart book.

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,712
It encourages professional women
to approach finding a mate

50
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,122
with the dedication and organization
they bring to their careers.

51
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,319
I'm more a student of chaos theory.

52
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:12,331
If you don't see as much of me,
I'm with my married friends.

53
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,993
And howwill this help you
meet your mate?

54
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:21,609
Bachelor friends of married men are
the city's greatest untapped resource.

55
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,268
The way to meet them
is through the husbands.

56
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:28,610
So my first assignment is to befriend
the husbands. It's my new job.

57
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:33,312
That evening, as charlotte began
her new career as a husband-hunter,

58
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:37,481
Miranda returned home to feather
her stress-free love nest.

59
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,961
- I heated up some leftover lasagne.
- Great. I'm starving.

60
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:46,794
- Wanna get some plates?
- What for? It's just us.

61
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,060
An hour later it was on to dessert.

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,269
Followed by exactly eight minutes
of no-frills sex.

63
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:59,313
And 12 minutes of "Front Line".

64
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:09,690
Theirs was the kind of closeness
that only came from true intimacy.

65
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:21,131
Samantha was experiencing intimacy
that only came from anonymity.

66
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,328
His name was Dr. Mark Raskin.

67
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:25,803
An ear, nose and throat man
that Samantha met...

68
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:29,808
actually we're not sure where.
Suffice to say it happened quickly.

69
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:32,105
Will you get me some water, please?

70
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,716
- What for?
- I want to take a hit of viagra.

71
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:41,016
Number one -
that's very presumptuous of you.

72
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:42,815
And number two -

73
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:46,688
from what I can tell, you don't need
any help in that area whatsoever.

74
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:50,354
I don't need it.
I just take it recreationally.

75
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,363
What does it do for you?

76
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,699
Sends me on a rocket trip
right through your solar system.

77
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,110
I'll be right back with that...

78
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,404
...water.

79
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,587
While Samantha enjoyed
the thrill of the new

80
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,197
and Miranda's relationship
happily floated on a placid sea

81
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:26,391
I was searching for hidden icebergs.

82
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:28,331
Why are you still single?

83
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:30,664
- Why are you still single?
- Don't do that.

84
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,603
I hate it when guys act all cute.

85
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:40,206
- What?
- Waiting for an apology.

86
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,407
oK. I'm a bitch. I'm sorry.

87
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,610
You should know I get a tad bitchy
from time to time.

88
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:49,848
I'm sure you have your bad traits.
And they would be?

89
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,050
- Alphabetically?
- Whatever you got.

90
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:55,219
It's all gonna come out eventually,
so I'd like to know now

91
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,092
and that way I can decide
if I'd like to deal with it or not.

92
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,893
This is the strangest two blocks
I ever walked.

93
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:06,507
Again I'm sorry, but this relationship
cannot just sail on like it is: perfect.

94
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,905
Frankly, I can't take the pressure.

95
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,806
oK. I'm gonna kiss you now.

96
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:21,289
Seriously. What the hell is wrong
with you that you're not married?

97
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:24,323
- Tell me.
- can't you relax and go with the flow.

98
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:28,588
Go with the flow? No, I can't do that.
It's so seventies.

99
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:31,664
How long you think
this phase is gonna last?

100
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:36,497
My folks are coming this weekend
and I want you to meet them.

101
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,808
- That's so...
- Fifties?

102
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:45,204
That is really nice.

103
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:50,746
So, these parents
that are coming to town...

104
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,252
do they know what's wrong with you?

105
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:57,152
Let's get you a doughnut.

106
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,254
Nuts.

107
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:04,659
The next evening, taking a page
from "Marriage Incorporated",

108
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,997
charlotte had dinner with her
married friends, Amy and Dennis.

109
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,604
Allow me to get right to the point.

110
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:15,607
After careful consideration,
I've decided that I'm getting married.

111
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:19,611
- charlotte, that's wonderful!
- Who's the lucky guy?

112
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:22,648
I don't know yet.
That's where you two come in.

113
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:27,277
Dennis, name one great single friend
that you have to fix me up with.

114
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:33,189
I don't know.
No one you'd like offhand.

115
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:36,524
- What about Phil?
- Phil, yeah.

116
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:41,658
If he can tear himself away from his
internet company to go on a date.

117
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,394
Yes! Phil.

118
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:45,038
Phil, Phil, Phil.

119
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:47,401
He is so nice and cute.

120
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:50,874
- You think Phil's cute?
- He's cute.

121
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:52,377
I can see that.

122
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,745
Great. Then it's all set up.
I'll call you tomorrowto follow up.

123
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,979
Look! I have tickets
to the opera on Saturday night.

124
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:04,216
- I would like to take Phil.
- Great.

125
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:11,956
The next morning before work,
while sorting Steve's laundry,

126
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:16,035
Miranda came face to face
with the true meaning of intimacy.

127
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,037
I was wrong.

128
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,272
There is a point where a couple
can get too comfortable.

129
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,475
I reached it this morning
washing Steve's underwear.

130
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,676
Why, what happened?

131
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:38,053
- I'm living with "skid marks" guy.
- oh, no! Terrible.

132
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:42,219
I don't get it.
Why do men get skid marks?

133
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,092
Is it laziness?
or are they just in a rush?

134
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,669
I don't know but it goes hand in hand
with urinating on the seat.

135
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,739
I tell you one thing. When
your boyfriend is so comfortable

136
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:57,207
he can't be bothered to wipe his ass,
that's the end of romance.

137
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,813
It's certainly the end of laundry night.

138
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:04,918
It got me thinking. Maybe I mistake
falling into a rut with intimacy.

139
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:08,078
- How often are you having sex?
- often enough.

140
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,724
But it's totally generic.
We've got every move down pat.

141
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,918
It's more like a race
to have an orgasm.

142
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:18,225
- It's nice to be a contestant, isn't it?
- Sure. I know what you mean.

143
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,530
We whine when we don't have
a boyfriend, we whine when we do.

144
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:27,334
Do you remember how Big
kept me away from his mother?

145
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:30,444
- I remember.
- And how pissed it used to make me?

146
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:34,878
Now, Aidan's offering both his parents
on a silver platter

147
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,575
and I'm not sure I want to meet them.

148
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:39,743
Maybe it's too soon.

149
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:42,947
I've never met Steve's mother
and I'm in no rush.

150
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:47,322
The irony is Aidan's acting exactly
how I wish Big would have behaved.

151
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:49,895
And I'm behaving just like Big.

152
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:54,092
Maybe you don't believe it's for real
unless somebody plays hard to get.

153
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,863
When things come too easy,
we're suspect.

154
00:10:57,038 --> 00:11:00,496
Do they have to get complicated
before we believe they're for real?

155
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:04,304
We're raised to believe that
true love never runs smoothly.

156
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,878
There always have to be
obstacles in Act Two

157
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:09,812
before you can live
happily ever after in Act Three.

158
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:12,452
But what happens when
the obstacles aren't there?

159
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,282
Does that mean
there's something missing?

160
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:18,654
Do we need drama
to make a relationship work?

161
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:22,228
A few days later, still hearing no word
from Dennis about her date

162
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:25,025
charlotte made a call to his office.

163
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,636
charlotte Yorke.
He can reach me at home or at work

164
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:33,331
and it's very important because I have
tickets to the opera on Saturday.

165
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:36,375
Never mind, just have him call me.

166
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:40,878
Her call unanswered,
charlotte followed up persistently.

167
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:44,246
can you tell Dennis
that charlotte Yorke called?

168
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:47,411
Yes, he'll knowwhat it's regarding.

169
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,183
It's regarding my future husband, Phil.

170
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,882
oK? Thank you.

171
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,188
Hi. You've reached
the office of Dennis Fincher.

172
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:57,627
I'm either out of the office
or away from my desk.

173
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,461
Please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.

174
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:06,437
Well. obviously, you have some good
reason for keeping Phil and I apart.

175
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:11,705
I can't imagine what it is
but this is Phil's loss and not mine

176
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:14,609
and don't bother
returning this call either.

177
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:22,153
While charlotte was a woman on
the verge of a nervous breakdown...

178
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:28,623
...my anxiety-free relationship
was driving me crazy.

179
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,036
Excuse me.

180
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,272
- Sorry it's taking so long.
- That's all right.

181
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:47,073
I'm gonna have to pass on dinner.
It's getting so late. I've got a deadline.

182
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,011
oK. No problem.

183
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:52,210
My parents get in tomorrow night.
They'll want to crash.

184
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:57,415
But I thought you'd meet us
for breakfast the next day.

185
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:04,388
I've been thinking
about this meeting your parents.

186
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:09,093
- I just wondered if it's a good idea.
- They gonna love you.

187
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,798
No, I'm not worried about that.
Parents always think I'm adorable.

188
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:16,739
- What's the problem?
- Well...

189
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:20,745
What if they love me...
and if we break up

190
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:25,318
you'll always have to explain to them
what happened to the adorable girl.

191
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:29,081
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No.

192
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:37,053
Where I come from,
meeting the parents... oh, so big!

193
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:40,292
- You'll meet them some other time.
- oK.

194
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:44,427
So, I guess we won't be seeing
each other this weekend.

195
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:50,101
- I'll miss you.
- Maybe that's good.

196
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,305
Maybe we should see each other less
then we can miss each other more.

197
00:13:56,451 --> 00:14:00,979
You're so available to me,
and I'm so available to you.

198
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,420
Maybe we're both too...

199
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:07,689
...available.

200
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:10,456
carrie, it's no big deal.
I have a life.

201
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,623
I'm just making room for you.

202
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,826
You always say the right things.

203
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:21,341
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

204
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:40,118
This is nuts. I'm sabotaging
the best relationship I've ever had.

205
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:45,356
It's better to have a man waiting
for you than the other way around.

206
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,798
- I guess.
- And if you hadn't been available,

207
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:52,200
I'd be here alone,
just some pathetic dateless freak.

208
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:54,500
So glad it worked out for you.

209
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:58,840
- Who are you calling?
- I'm not taking this lying down.

210
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:04,776
Hi. You've reached Amy and Dennis.
Leave it at the beep.

211
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:10,049
Well, here I am at the opera
which I planned on going to with Phil,

212
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:13,193
who I guess you've decided
I'm not good enough for.

213
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:15,829
charlotte?
It's Dennis.

214
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:18,693
I'm so sorry.
I just got back from a business trip.

215
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:21,630
My secretary gave me
all your messages.

216
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:24,670
I had no idea
you wanted to meet Phil so badly.

217
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,206
Well, he sounded nice.
It's not a big deal.

218
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:32,608
Why don't I set something up
tomorrow evening? 7.:30?

219
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,675
- You know Rudy's, Midtown?
- I love that place.

220
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,288
Phil will meet you there.
I guarantee it.

221
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:49,088
I'm so silly. I created all that drama
in my head for nothing.

222
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:51,629
- What are we seeing again?
- "Aida. "

223
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:06,670
- I guess I'm in for another wild ride.
- I'd say we both are.

224
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:12,513
What would happen
if I tried one of these?

225
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:16,282
I don't think they've established
that it works for women.

226
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:19,324
There's no harm in trying is there,
doctor?

227
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,287
Bottoms up!

228
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,701
20 minutes later,

229
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:35,036
Samantha officially became
the first woman to land on the moon.

230
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:53,956
- Isn't the opera romantic?
- Even more so with a man.

231
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:56,255
Well, I did expect to be taking Phil.

232
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:59,696
It's quite a lovely evening you planned
for a man you've never even met.

233
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,959
He sounded really nice.

234
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:04,468
- Here.
- Thanks.

235
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:47,807
You knowwhat, honey,
I'm not feeling well. I'm going home.

236
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:51,042
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, I'm fine. Stay, enjoy.

237
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:53,380
It's all right. I'll call you.

238
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,584
I'll be right back.

239
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:03,161
I knew it was rude and over-dramatic,

240
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:06,891
but I felt like I'd just seen
the phantom of the opera.

241
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:18,643
Yes, ditching charlotte
was slightly hysterical,

242
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:21,714
but the idea of sitting across
from Big and Natasha

243
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:27,080
through the second act of "Aida"
was too emotional to bear.

244
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,792
This time I knew what was wrong.

245
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,020
The shock of seeing Big again
not only made my stomach flip

246
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:39,064
it sent my spleen leaping
right into my throat.

247
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:51,044
- Hello.
- It's me. I'm really sorry.

248
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:56,842
- What's wrong?
- I saw Big tonight at the opera.

249
00:18:57,051 --> 00:19:00,578
- That's why you ditched charlotte.
- She told you. Was she pissed?

250
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:03,883
I think she's swearing
off women forever.

251
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:08,757
- Are you oK?
- Yeah. I'm great actually.

252
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,026
I'm realizing that maybe there is
something to this available man thing.

253
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:19,602
Yeah. It's kind of nice.
Just separate your whites.

254
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:24,108
Now I know I wanna be with a man
who wants to be with me.

255
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:26,872
I've had enough relationship drama
for one lifetime.

256
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:29,175
Shouldn't you be telling this to Aidan?

257
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:33,820
It's 3:00 am.
I'll wait until a more civilized hour.

258
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:37,981
The next morning I waited
until a decent hour to call Aidan

259
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:41,252
and tell him how much I missed him.

260
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,398
- Furniture company.
- Hi, it's carrie calling for Aidan.

261
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:47,432
- He's not here right now.
- He's not?

262
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:51,129
- Just tell him I called.
- I'll give him the message.

263
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,330
- Thanks.
- Bye.

264
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:01,438
When I hadn't heard from him
by that evening

265
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:04,447
I began to get butterflies
in my stomach.

266
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:09,619
Hey, I'm not in but Pete is.

267
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:13,324
Hey. It's carrie.
Remember me?

268
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:17,453
The girl you wanted to introduce
to your parents.

269
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,032
I'm just calling to say hey.

270
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:22,766
Hey.

271
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:30,337
I was getting a dreaded feeling
that I had played this all wrong.

272
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:34,948
Suddenly, the idea of losing Aidan
left me short of breath.

273
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:42,385
Meanwhile, Miranda was trying not
to breathe near Steve's shorts.

274
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:49,258
What are you doing?

275
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:53,024
I thought you might need some help
with the wash.

276
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,294
But there's nothing like a twist
in the third act

277
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,200
to spice up even
the most banal scenario.

278
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:04,472
And while Miranda and Steve
found new life in the familiar,

279
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:09,241
charlotte was blindly feeling
her way through the unfamiliar.

280
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:15,122
Excuse me.
Are you Phil?

281
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:16,722
Sorry.

282
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:24,555
- Are you Phil?
- I could be.

283
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:27,758
- Hi.
- Well, hello.

284
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:31,132
- Are you here to chaperone?
- Yes, sort of.

285
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,066
What's wrong?
You couldn't trust me alone with Phil?

286
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:39,838
charlotte, Phil's not coming...
I never called Phil.

287
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:43,882
I didn't want you to meet him. You'd
like him and that could be a problem.

288
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:48,815
- What are you talking about?
- I'm in love with you, charlotte.

289
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:52,386
You can't be in love with me -
you're married to my friend.

290
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,055
Things haven't been great with us,
and I can't stop thinking about you.

291
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:00,826
- This is nuts.
- Don't leave.

292
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:05,028
You kept your single friends
away from me so you could cheat?

293
00:22:05,372 --> 00:22:09,240
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- You're such a spark plug. I love that.

294
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,311
I'm not interested
in starting some married man's car.

295
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:15,448
Wait. Don't leave, please.
I love you!

296
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:19,512
charlotte, please. I love you. Wait.

297
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:24,886
- Taxi!
- What the hell?

298
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,128
Are you all right?

299
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,496
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, thanks.

300
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,568
- Let me help you.
- Thanks.

301
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:45,137
- I'm Trey.
- charlotte.

302
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,082
And that's how,
in the most dramatic fashion,

303
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,844
charlotte met her new leading man.

304
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:04,197
Well, time to pop
one of those baby blues.

305
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:06,390
Let's go au naturel this time.

306
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:11,233
No, I really want one.

307
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:15,172
- Don't you think it's good without it?
- No, I do not!

308
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,334
Let's save it for those special times.

309
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:20,241
Give me my pills, goddammit!

310
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:25,716
Mark realized he had brought too
much intensity to their relationship.

311
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:28,480
He wrote samantha a prescription

312
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:31,351
and she promised
never to call him again.

313
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,728
You have no messages.

314
00:23:36,697 --> 00:23:39,723
After two days
of not hearing from Aidan,

315
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,893
I realized only a dramatic gesture
could salvage things.

316
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:54,644
- You gonna...
- Hi, how are you?

317
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:56,908
You're gonna like this.

318
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:11,928
What's going on?

319
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:15,660
You asked me to be here,
and I wasn't sure if I could.

320
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:21,107
Honestly... I mean,
meeting the parents is so...

321
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:25,677
Then I realized I wanna meet them but
I didn't know if you still wanted me to.

322
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:30,510
I've called and you haven't called me,
so then I thought I'm just gonna go,

323
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:37,146
because being in a relationship
means taking a risk... a leap of faith.

324
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:42,057
No matter how many times one
might have been disappointed before.

325
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:48,031
I said to myself I'm just gonna show
up... because you're a good man.

326
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,200
A really good man.

327
00:24:54,875 --> 00:25:00,006
- Why haven't you called me back?
- I was just trying to be less available.

328
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:03,048
Really?

329
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:08,819
You don't have to do everything I say.

330
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:14,086
Well, you're here now.
can I introduce you to my parents?

331
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:17,492
- Won't they think I'm nuts?
- Probably.

332
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:20,225
They'll just have to get used to that.

333
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:22,899
come on, Nuts.

334
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,233
I realized then, that I had made
my stomach flip all on my own.

335
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:31,741
And it felt really nice.

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
