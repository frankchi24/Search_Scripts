1
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,295
You can count on one hand

2
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,524
the things a New Yorker will wait for.

3
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:55,601
My list includes:
the perfect apartment,

4
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:58,398
the chocolate souffle at Le Bernardin,

5
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,503
and the annual Manolo Blahnik sale.

6
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,312
After four dates
with the furniture designer,

7
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,606
whose kiss made my knees weak,

8
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:10,284
this New Yorker
had waited long enough.

9
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,511
so, do you wanna sleep over?

10
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,056
I have to feed Pete.

11
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,695
I have to get up early in the morning.

12
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,695
Apparently, that New Yorker had not.

13
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,275
When one door closes,
another one opens.

14
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:40,576
At 2:00am, the door that opened
was samantha's.

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,860
What's going on?

16
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:56,624
Freda in 1D was held up at gunpoint.

17
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,255
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,436
It's under control.
We have the suspect on tape.

19
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:04,470
This is supposed to be
a safe building.

20
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:08,940
It was late. Doorman was off duty.
He entered behind somebody's guest.

21
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,636
That,s awful.

22
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:15,011
The guy came in behind the guy
who came in samantha.

23
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,481
That,s terrible.

24
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:20,611
- Who has a guest at 2:00am?
- I have no idea.

25
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:25,521
- What did everybody do last night?
- Nothing.

26
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:28,061
- Nothing.
- I don't want to talk about it.

27
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:30,631
Did you sleep with someone
on the second date?

28
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,824
No. The third date.

29
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:36,335
Alexander Lemly, the investment
banker I met at an art show.

30
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:40,499
- The sex was bad?
- It was good, except...

31
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,846
I don't think I can say it.

32
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:46,947
Get over yourself.

33
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:48,913
What happened?

34
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,350
When he...

35
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,350
You know.

36
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,820
came, orgasmed, shot his wad.

37
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,352
He said:

38
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:02,055
You fucking bitch!
You fucking whore!

39
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:10,866
- Why would he say that?
- Because you were fucking him?

40
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:15,636
He didn't say it at the drycleaners,
but when he was in you.

41
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:19,178
Do you think I'm a whore?

42
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:21,839
If you're a whore,
what does that make me?

43
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:29,021
- Do you think I'm a whore?
- You have had a lot of bone in you.

44
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,184
This is bad.
Nobody wants to marry a whore.

45
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:35,130
Even charlotte
is having more sex than me.

46
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,360
What about Aidan?

47
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,626
I don't knowwhat's going on.
We're spending a lot of time together.

48
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,362
He keeps asking me out.
But he doesn,t wanna sleep with me.

49
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,532
- Gay.
- He's not gay.

50
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,610
- Mother issues?
- I don,t think so.

51
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:55,113
- Maybe his dick curves to the right.
- We'll work it out. I'll go left.

52
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,114
I may never know.

53
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:01,516
Wait too long to sleep with someone,
you become just friends.

54
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,751
As supposed to his fucking bitch,
his fucking whore.

55
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,385
come on.

56
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,533
If samantha was right,
I had little time left

57
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,898
before the relationship-window
closed.

58
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:18,837
so I wore my little dress
that left little to the imagination.

59
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,132
Do you want to take this inside?

60
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,203
I better get home. I gotta...

61
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:27,075
You gotta get up early.
Whatever.

62
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,629
- What's going on up there?
- Do you just wanna be friends?

63
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,928
I don't know.
Is that how you kiss your friends?

64
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:51,030
Why don't you wanna sleep with me?

65
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:55,006
Whatever it is
I'd rather know sooner than later.

66
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,542
I do wanna sleep with you.

67
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:01,643
I do.
Look at you.

68
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,315
I,ve been down that road before.

69
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:09,083
I've slept with women quickly
and I'm still single.

70
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:19,266
My new thing is, I want to try and
sleep with somebody I care about.

71
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,737
I really think
that I can care about you.

72
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:30,942
It's only been a week and a half.
Don't people date anymore?

73
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:35,749
Why did I expect to sleep with him
after only a week and a half?

74
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:38,009
Had I become so jaded

75
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,281
that I didn't recognize romance
when it kissed me on the lips?

76
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,189
Modern women need a cheat-sheet
to remind us romance isn't dead.

77
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,430
Romance.

78
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:55,503
I tell you, it didn't even occur to me,
which is so depressing.

79
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:58,970
Is that what 13 years of dating
in Manhattan does to a woman?

80
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:02,237
I'll tell you what it does.
It gives you chlamydia.

81
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,072
Excuse me?

82
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,271
My gynecologist called me today.

83
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:11,114
My tests, which she threw in
for good measure, were positive.

84
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:15,883
It's not terrible. There aren't any
symptoms, but it can cause infertility.

85
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,657
I guess it's good I caught it.
I mean...

86
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:21,658
Not that I caught it,
but that I found out.

87
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:24,664
- You got it from steve?
- I don't know.

88
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,925
It could be any number of guys,

89
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,265
which is what I told my gynecologist.
she seemed a little judgmental.

90
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:35,500
she told me to contact all the people
that I might have given it to,

91
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,645
so they can all be treated.

92
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:41,509
I knew what was bothering her.
The same thought had bothered me

93
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:45,210
since the guy I'd been seeing
for 10 days asked me to slow down.

94
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:50,815
If you're a 30 something woman in
Manhattan and you're sexually active,

95
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:54,154
it's inevitable that you'll rack up
a certain number of partners.

96
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:57,026
But how many is too many men?

97
00:06:57,165 --> 00:07:01,499
Are we simply romantically
challenged or are we sluts?

98
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:03,696
It was the question
on charlotte's mind.

99
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,666
- How's your swordfish?
- Fine, thanks.

100
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:12,644
- You're awfully quiet tonight.
- sorry, my mind is somewhere else.

101
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:16,978
You fucking bitch!
You fucking whore!

102
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:21,816
I hate putting people out of work,
but it happens after a merger.

103
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:25,051
Maybe I should
teach EsL on the side.

104
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,296
Are you sure you're OK?

105
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:35,628
Actually... what you said
the other night kind of bothered me.

106
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,138
What did I say?

107
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:43,677
You knowwhen we were in bed
and you...

108
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,510
You yelled out something.

109
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:53,849
- During my sleep?
- No, during sex.

110
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,655
I don't remember saying anything.

111
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:05,693
I remember it being very nice.
What did I say?

112
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:14,264
It,s not important. I,m sure
it was in the heat of the moment.

113
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:18,243
Do you want to try my swordfish?
It really is good.

114
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,008
By dessert, charlotte had decided
to forget it and call it a do-over.

115
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:28,111
- You fucking bitch! Fucking whore!
- That! That's what you said.

116
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:31,348
- What?
- Just then. You said it again.

117
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,892
What did I say?

118
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:36,761
You fucking bitch, you fucking whore.

119
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,725
My God, are you sure?

120
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,906
That's terrible. That's a horrible thing
to say. I had no idea.

121
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:52,742
I just get lost in the moment.
I don't think that about you.

122
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:59,946
Believe me, you are sweet,
smart and lovely.

123
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:03,956
You are the kind of woman
I hope to marry some day.

124
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:09,720
I promise never to say that again.

125
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,699
That,s terrible.

126
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:17,896
As charlotte started to feel better,
Miranda started to feel worse.

127
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:20,939
steve, can we not?

128
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,838
I'm just getting started.
I'm only at the neck.

129
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:28,880
Maybe you'll change your mind
when I'm down around your elbows.

130
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:31,450
I can't tonight, I have chlamydia.

131
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:38,751
I don't even knowwhat that is,
but it sounds like a problem.

132
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:47,592
It's not a big deal. It's just
a sexually transmitted disease.

133
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:51,465
I might have given it to you
or you to me.

134
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:55,601
Either way, you should get tested.

135
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,746
I,m afraid of doctors.
I don,t even have one.

136
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:02,815
Go to the free clinic. Whatever.

137
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:06,384
What's gonna happen,
does it hurt when you pee?

138
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:10,150
Men are just carriers,
there aren't any symptoms at all.

139
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,192
Then why do I need to know?

140
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:17,090
If you don't get treated
you can pass it on to other people.

141
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:21,532
You are my only other person,
and you already have it.

142
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,775
Yeah, but if you've got it,
we'll keep passing it back and forth.

143
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:30,302
I'd rather not sleep with you
until it's out of my body.

144
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:33,072
I've got six more days of antibiotics.

145
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:39,279
Will you please just take care of it?
Get it over with.

146
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:48,456
steve's trip to the doctor
didn't cure his fear of doctors.

147
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:54,065
- Drop your trousers.
- There's nothing wrong down there.

148
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,034
I'm here because my girlfriend
said to get the test.

149
00:10:57,172 --> 00:11:00,039
I need a sample
from the inside of your penis.

150
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,800
As steve faced something
every man dreads,

151
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:06,412
Miranda faced something
every woman dreads.

152
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:10,181
she was making a list
of all the men she'd slept with.

153
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:12,579
At least all the ones
she could remember.

154
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,118
she wondered
how she did all these men

155
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,856
and did her law degree
and became a successful lawyer.

156
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:25,359
samantha knew
her number was up there.

157
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,394
But she didn't know
everybody else knew.

158
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:33,330
We know it was you
who buzzed in the gunman.

159
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,736
- Excuse me?
- You always have guests.

160
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:40,609
Every time I'm in this elevator
you're with a different man.

161
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,544
That,s ridiculous.

162
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,901
This is your floor.

163
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,748
Excuse me.

164
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,546
The next day, Miranda's sex life
was flashing before her as well.

165
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,989
Thanks. OK.
sorry to bother you.

166
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,523
congratulations.

167
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:30,629
Nowyou're married, you don't
have to worry about stuff like this.

168
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,060
Bye-bye.

169
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,661
Miss Hobbes, line two is still holding.

170
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:42,940
- Miranda Hobbes.
- Hi, it's David, returning a call.

171
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:48,013
- How have you been?
- Lousy, I'm partner. All work, no play.

172
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:51,480
- What do you want?
- It's kind of awkward.

173
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:53,881
I'm busy, spit it out.
What is it?

174
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:57,156
OK. I've got this...

175
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:01,586
- It's chlamydia. Which is...
- I know what chlamydia is.

176
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:07,427
- Perhaps you should get tested.
- I,ve been tested.

177
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:11,196
- Recently?
- Yes. Is that it?

178
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:14,500
Yes. No... Did you have it?

179
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,770
Is that your business? You call me
after months to discuss my health?

180
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:24,509
- Yes, I had it. so, what?
- Perhaps you gave it to me.

181
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:28,519
- What are you gonna do, sue me?
- You could have called.

182
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:32,922
- You told me never to call you.
- Now I remember why. Bye!

183
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:37,087
Meanwhile, I was still waiting
for the diagnosis on my relationship.

184
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:40,290
Would Aidan become
friend or boyfriend?

185
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:42,493
Delivery for Miss Bradshaw.

186
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:45,605
It's about time.
I ordered this years ago.

187
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,137
He certainly kissed like a boyfriend.

188
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:56,877
Don't you have two matching plates?

189
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,052
No.

190
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:01,814
What do you use for wine,
promotional coffee mugs?

191
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,882
But he teased me like a friend.

192
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,087
come here. Let me get this.

193
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:11,063
Boyfriend.

194
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,030
I don't care what anybody says.
I think catherine zeta-Jones is hot.

195
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:16,363
Friend.

196
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,570
Not as hot as you, but she's hot.

197
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,505
Boyfriend. And liar.

198
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,783
- I think samantha was right.
- About what?

199
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:34,355
Me and Aidan. I think we're
just friends who kiss occasionally.

200
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,754
- Why are you whispering?
- cos he's still here.

201
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,449
That,s promising.

202
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:42,296
He's been in the bathroom
for half an hour.

203
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:46,031
All we did was eat chinese
and watch "zorro".

204
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:49,203
Now I'm working and he's
reading the paper on the john.

205
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,428
This isn't romance, this is bullshit.

206
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,664
- carrie!
- Yeah?

207
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,036
come here a second.

208
00:14:56,244 --> 00:15:00,112
I have to go, my friend
wants to see me in the bathroom.

209
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,315
What did you want, because...

210
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:10,449
Wow.

211
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,559
It,s like a Danielle steele novel
in here.

212
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:17,925
From a writer,
I'm pretty sure that's an insult.

213
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:21,865
No, this is... Wow.

214
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:27,571
I thought a bath would help you relax.
You seemed kind of tense.

215
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:31,175
Are you sure this isn't
just a cheap ploy to see me naked?

216
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,676
Will you be naked?

217
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:37,316
That's the thing about baths.

218
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,550
This is about you, so enjoy.

219
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,616
I'm gonna get going.

220
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:50,025
But that doesn't make us friends
cos I'll be thinking about you naked.

221
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:02,067
Big tub, little person.

222
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:09,073
You talked me into it.

223
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:22,028
so nowwhat?

224
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,722
Nowwhat, what?
We're just taking a bath.

225
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,865
Fuck it, let's just do it.

226
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,234
This isn't how it should happen.
You said this was just a bath.

227
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:37,777
- come on, who cares?
- You do. And I do too now.

228
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:41,741
OK.
Out of the tub.

229
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,682
The next night,
samantha was feeling exposed.

230
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,587
Here she comes.

231
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,727
- Good evening.
- Hello.

232
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:20,215
If you wanna say something
about me, say it to my face.

233
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,616
You're bad for the building.

234
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,355
- What?
- You have too many visitors.

235
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,519
- There are always men in the hall.
- I got robbed because of you.

236
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:32,359
I can't close my left eye.

237
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:37,637
They practically chased me
like I was Fuckenstein.

238
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:40,536
They can't evict you for having sex.

239
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:44,873
They're jealous, dried up old farts who
haven't had sex since Eisenhower.

240
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,642
I remind them of what they can't have.
It might be time to move.

241
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:54,243
You can't. You have a rent-controlled
apartment on the Upper East side.

242
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,549
This isn't rent control, it's life control.

243
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,783
I have to go, I have a date with Aidan.

244
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:01,257
Don't tell me
you're not having sex yet.

245
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:04,456
- We're not having sex yet.
- What are you doing?

246
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,432
Tonight, we're going to a blues club.

247
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:11,937
- Who's singing, you?
- We'll have sex eventually.

248
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,633
By the way, I got a little preview.

249
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:18,313
I assure you,
there is no curving in any direction.

250
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:22,079
It is straight. very straight.

251
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,441
That night,
charlotte had a date as well.

252
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:29,784
And he was doing his best
to be the strong, silent type.

253
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:38,055
- What's the matter?
- I'm afraid to come.

254
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,767
What are you talking about?
I'm close.

255
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,365
Go ahead.

256
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:52,741
You fucking bitch, you fucking whore!
I hate myself, what's wrong with me?

257
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,408
That night, Alexander decided
to stop seeing charlotte

258
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,046
and start seeing a therapist.

259
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:02,382
And steve got his test back.

260
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,559
It was negative,
like the rest of the experience.

261
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,595
That doctor with the swab... Ouch!
I don't even want to swab my ears.

262
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:14,666
It's my fault.
I'm the one with the disease.

263
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:18,167
I'm a big, dirty, diseased whore.

264
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,234
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

265
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:26,936
You knowwhat? I had to make a list
of all the guys I've slept with

266
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,615
and it's not short.

267
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:31,648
How, not short?

268
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:38,656
It's... No, I can't tell you.
I've never told anybody my number.

269
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:41,486
I'm just curious.

270
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,594
You won't judge me?

271
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,231
I spent a day at the free clinic.

272
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:51,830
OK. It's like, about... 42.

273
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:57,570
- 42? That's not so bad.
- That's too many.

274
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,440
It,s fine.

275
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:05,812
- What's your number?
- I'm not telling you.

276
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:07,816
come on.

277
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:12,616
It's embarrassing. I've had enough
embarrassment for one week.

278
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,885
What is it?

279
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:15,894
Ten?

280
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:18,956
Higher.

281
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,158
60?

282
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:23,636
Higher.

283
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,806
Higher than 60?

284
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:28,771
A lot higher?

285
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,439
I,m a bartender and I,m cute.

286
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:39,242
Note, men who have had a lot of
sexual partners are not called sluts.

287
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:42,480
They are called very good kissers.

288
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,648
A few are even called romantics.

289
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:47,861
I can't believe you've never been
to the Blue Note.

290
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:51,658
- call yourself a New Yorker.
- I've never done a lot of things.

291
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,494
I can think of one thing in particular.

292
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:01,139
- That I've done.
- I can think of one other thing.

293
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:06,676
What do you think
about me staying the night?

294
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:11,282
I don't know.
What about Pete?

295
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:16,822
I arranged for the super's kid
to walk Pete and feed him.

296
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,756
And you knewthis all night?

297
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,335
And then something weird happened.

298
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:40,445
For the first time in a long time,
I was nervous.

299
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:44,779
We were going to sleep together
and it was going to mean something.

300
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,821
I was no virgin,
but this was definitely virgin territory.

301
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:02,397
Good morning.

302
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:05,371
Good morning.

303
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:08,706
OK, that's what I wanted. Bye.

304
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:15,815
The nice thing about
a new relationship, it's a clean slate.

305
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:20,177
And speaking of clean slates,

306
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:23,357
samantha moved
to the trendy Meatpacking District.

307
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:25,116
Good morning, ladies.
