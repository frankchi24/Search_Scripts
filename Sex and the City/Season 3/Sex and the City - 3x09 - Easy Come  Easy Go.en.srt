1
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,389
oK, I gotta go.

2
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:53,399
Have a good day. Give me a kiss.

3
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:55,196
Bye-bye.

4
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:57,134
one unfortunate thing

5
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,241
about ending a relationship

6
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,138
in a city like New York

7
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:04,110
is while you can emotionally
move away from each other,

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,248
you physically can't.

9
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:17,992
Going to work?

10
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:19,626
Yeah, work.

11
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:22,730
- Sorry about waking you.
- What time is it?

12
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:26,732
- 6:30.
- Jesus. Why so early?

13
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,199
I got a brief due, so...

14
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:31,306
There was nothing brief about it.

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,409
Steve and Miranda had been doing
the polite avoid-each-other

16
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:36,340
break-up-dance for three weeks.

17
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,748
I'm sorry it's taking me so long

18
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:41,509
to find a place.

19
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,618
I got a lead on one, though.

20
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,447
oK.

21
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:49,284
Hey, do you... Never mind.

22
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,823
What?

23
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,587
I was gonna ask if you'd look at it
with me,

24
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,163
but that's weird, right?

25
00:01:56,332 --> 00:02:00,268
- I don't know. We could do that.
- Yeah?

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,206
When you find that place to move,

27
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,344
you need to fill it with furniture.

28
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,809
That's why smart New Yorkers

29
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,575
frequent the opening day
of the New Designer showcase.

30
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,083
I'm like your roady.

31
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:22,155
I don't have a road.
I just have this booth.

32
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:27,159
- At best, you're my booth-bitch.
- Yeah, I'm your booth-bitch.

33
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,194
I wax your wood.

34
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:32,162
You wax it real good.

35
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,360
That's because I'm your booth-bitch.

36
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,902
You watch the booth.
I'm going to get us some coffee.

37
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:45,569
Whatever you say.
I'm your booth-bitch.

38
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,978
That's sexy. I like it.

39
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,750
I didn't need
a blue-ribbon panel to decide -

40
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:57,051
he was the finest new designer
in the whole place.

41
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,934
I'd often fantasized
about running into my ex and his wife,

42
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:11,971
but in those fantasies
I was running into them with a truck.

43
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:16,578
I don't know howyou could like
this clunky wood. It's oppressive.

44
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,941
- What the fuck?
- Hi.

45
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,347
Hi. I'm working here.

46
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:33,291
I mean, I'm not working.
This is my boyfriend's booth.

47
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,191
I'm his booth-bitch.

48
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:40,563
- That's a joke. Guess it's an in-joke.
- I get it.

49
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,436
So. can I showyou something
in a hutch?

50
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:49,043
His pieces are fantastic.
It's just not really our style.

51
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:53,770
No. We only like teeny-tiny furniture.

52
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,157
This is the designer.
This is Aidan Shaw.

53
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:07,522
Great stuff.

54
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,357
Thanks, man.

55
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,260
- oak?
- It's mostly maple.

56
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:17,201
There we were. Mostly maple
and incredibly uncomfortable.

57
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:20,569
- Sorry, I didn't get your names.
- oh, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:23,404
These are my friends.

59
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,207
This is Natasha, and this is...

60
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,211
Shit. Sorry, is that hot?

61
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:31,852
It ain't cold.

62
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,646
- Here.
- No, I'll...

63
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:38,486
- We should put cold water on this.
- oK.

64
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,992
It was nice meeting you.

65
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,688
Thanks for the coffee.

66
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:47,535
- They seem nice.
- Yeah, don't they?

67
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:51,605
- Where do you knowthem from?
- From around.

68
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:55,507
Like 100 years ago.

69
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:57,702
It's a past life.

70
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:04,979
Two hours later,
it was time for the opening-day party.

71
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:10,022
It was lovely. caviar, silent auctions,
and landmines.

72
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:12,786
Where's Paul Bunyan?

73
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,829
If you're referring to my boyfriend -
he's doing business.

74
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:21,265
ooh, he's a big 'un!
Where did he learn to whittle like that?

75
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,370
How many drinks
have you had?

76
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,734
Not nearly enough.

77
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,045
So... How are you?

78
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,585
I'm great.

79
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:42,883
And Daniel Boone, is he a nice guy?

80
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,390
His name is Aidan.

81
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:50,626
- Where is your sense of humor?
- Where is your wife?

82
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:55,236
Guarding her bid on the silent auction.
She's got her eye on a beige chair.

83
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:58,100
Everything in my apartment
is now beige.

84
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:00,741
Beige is bullshit.

85
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,934
I thought you wanted beige.

86
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:07,775
Yeah, well... It doesn't quite fit.

87
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,612
- Have you got a smoke?
- I quit.

88
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:13,016
We always used to share
a cigarette together.

89
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:16,624
We did a lot of things
that were bad for me together.

90
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,953
I have a secret
to tell you.

91
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:27,434
It's not working.
I'm getting out.

92
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,767
If you know anyone
who's interested...

93
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:37,572
You should keep that to yourself.
No one wants that information.

94
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:46,946
- Big's leaving his wife.
- No!

95
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:50,353
- He told me at the furniture show.
- What was he doing there?

96
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,755
- Drinking and leaving his wife.
- oh, my God.

97
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:55,590
- Let's just say it. You won.
- Was there a contest?

98
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:59,598
There's always a contest with an ex.
It's called "Who'll Die Miserable?".

99
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:02,965
- What did he say?
- He said, "It's not working out. "

100
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:07,734
Then he leaned in and said, "If you
know anyone who's interested... "

101
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:12,710
You don't know anyone
who is interested. He's married.

102
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,406
- I'm aware of that.
- Why is he telling you?

103
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:18,142
To save postage on his newsletter?

104
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,015
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

105
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:23,521
- She's not gonna do anything.
- You're starting to bug me.

106
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,752
How dare he say that to you?
Married men never leave their wives.

107
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:30,125
Even if he did, I have no intention
of doing anything for two reasons -

108
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:33,460
I have a great boyfriend,
and I'm not insane.

109
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:37,332
Let's order. What do winners order?

110
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:42,205
- Didn't you feel like punching him?
- No. It was too sad or something.

111
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:45,710
- I would have punched him.
- No, it is sad.

112
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:48,474
How long has he been married?
Seven months?

113
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,413
The seven-month itch.

114
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:54,885
That's what happens when people
jump into relationships too quickly.

115
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,187
I resent that. Trey and I
are nothing like Big and Natasha.

116
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,625
Don't listen to her.
She's mid-break-up.

117
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,324
- Thanks for the update.
- Trey and I really love each other.

118
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,161
Who wants to split a Rubin?

119
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:12,363
I'm meeting his mother this week,
and if all goes well...

120
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,372
If all goes well what?

121
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:17,512
Trey is this close to proposing.
I can feel it.

122
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,408
oh, my God. Really?

123
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:22,015
You've just met.
I've had pairs of pantyhose longer.

124
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:25,210
It's not logical. This is love.

125
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:28,720
It's not logical.
It's right, in my heart. I feel it's right.

126
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:31,825
oK, whatever.

127
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,398
So, how did he look?

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,408
oK. I'll take it.

129
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:53,306
As Miranda looked around,
she realized the contest was over.

130
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:55,973
Steve was the ex that was
going to die alone and miserable.

131
00:08:56,184 --> 00:09:00,917
- You can't live here.
- It's not that bad.

132
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,217
It's not that bad?
It's the doorway to hell.

133
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:07,384
There's gotta be a better place.
I'll help you look.

134
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:10,759
- Guilt?
- Probably.

135
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:16,427
I broke up with him, and he's got
no money, no savings, no nothing.

136
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:21,199
There should be a city-funded
break-up housing for those in need.

137
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,638
Really?

138
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:28,147
A big orphanage where old boyfriends
could think about what they did wrong

139
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:33,310
and cry themselves to sleep
in a clean, safe environment.

140
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,820
You think you don't really
want him to move away?

141
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:37,822
It's not that simple.

142
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:41,326
My head tells me it's time
for him to leave, but the idea of him

143
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:46,934
moving into a basement apartment
in West Shit Street breaks my heart.

144
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:51,971
It's a common belief that women use
the left, emotional side of their brain

145
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,973
and men the right, more logical side.

146
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,236
But is it really that cut and dry?

147
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:59,676
When it comes to affairs of the heart,

148
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:02,817
there's a battle between
what we know and what we feel.

149
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:05,282
What do you do in a situation

150
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,422
that leaps back and forth
between the left and right side?

151
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,823
In relationships, is it smarter
to follow your heart or your head?

152
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:16,896
This is Trey when he graduated
from medical school.

153
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,364
Later that week, charlotte met
the head and heart of Trey's family -

154
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,025
his mother,
Bunny MacDougal.

155
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:26,071
Trey, you look so cute
in a cap and gown!

156
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:31,042
That was before we jumped
in the fountain and hell broke loose.

157
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,578
What's next -
boy scout snaps?

158
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,682
count your blessings I didn't bring
the one on the bearskin rug.

159
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:39,718
You'll have to excuse her.
She's a bit of a camera nazi.

160
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,789
If you insist on dragging us
down memory lane,

161
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,951
I'm getting a real drink.
Excuse me, a Glenlivet rocks, please.

162
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:50,996
Maybe you should have a red wine
instead. Better for the heart.

163
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,395
- All righty.
- Red wine.

164
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:58,005
Thomas, we'd love some more
nibbly cheese things.

165
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,403
- very good, ma'am.
- Thank you.

166
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:04,568
He's older than water,
but never forgets a martini.

167
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,550
- Do you play tennis?
- Mm-hm.

168
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,743
I like her.

169
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:13,853
Join the club.

170
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:18,891
- What are you two doing tonight?
- We've got reservations at cloche.

171
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,862
I was there last week. Disappointing
crab and the host was rude.

172
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,767
Maybe you should go
to cote Basque instead.

173
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:31,405
All righty.

174
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:33,870
charlotte was impressed
with Bunny's technique.

175
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,636
Trey had been looking forward
to cloche all week.

176
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:42,374
Meanwhile, downtown, Samantha was
entertaining Adam Ball, a film editor

177
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,351
who made a living cutting coming
attractions for film companies.

178
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:48,546
coming.

179
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:50,190
I'm coming.

180
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:56,357
oh, man!

181
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:57,998
You give good head.

182
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:07,263
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest tasting spunk.

183
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:16,012
And she's never coming back.

184
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:18,675
Sorry, but who else
can I talk to about this?

185
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:22,084
- Might I suggest, no one?
- You're my girlfriends. Help me.

186
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,054
- Have you ever had this problem?
- Not really.

187
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,162
But I have to admit it's never been
a trip to Baskin-Robins.

188
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:33,199
This guy is very sour. Like asparagus
gone bad or something.

189
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:35,359
can I cancel my rice pudding?

190
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:38,404
Beautiful guy, great in bed,
it's so disappointing.

191
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:42,600
It's like a bad bottle of Beaujolais
Nouveau the first day of season.

192
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:46,747
It's to do with nutrition. I once dated
a smoker. It affected how his tasted.

193
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:49,782
They should put that
on the pack to cut back sales.

194
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:52,317
Maybe there's something he could eat
to make it sweeter.

195
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,650
- You should write to Martha Stewart.
- Dear Martha, funky spunk, help!

196
00:12:56,825 --> 00:13:00,556
Dear funky spunk, try a hint of mint.

197
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:04,324
It's not just asparagus.
It's asparagus and something else.

198
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,626
I know: clorox.

199
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:10,202
- At least it'll get your whites whiter.
- This is serious. I almost gagged.

200
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,169
- That is serious.
- What am I gonna do?

201
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,276
- Just don't give him head again.
- I never even thought of that.

202
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:18,571
casual head is back now?

203
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:21,409
It's fine. He's healthy,
and I don't swallow.

204
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,417
As long as you and the center
for disease control are fine with it.

205
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,215
He loves getting head,
but what man doesn't?

206
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,293
If the come-situation were reversed,
do you think men would go near it?

207
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:35,656
Maybe.
If it tasted like beer.

208
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:41,900
Miranda came home to something
that was even harder to swallow.

209
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,096
You have one new message.

210
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,541
Hi. If this is steve's number...

211
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,773
This is Barbara. We met last night.
I'm the advertising exec.

212
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:59,909
Steve, if this is you, call me.
I'd love to go to a movie sometime.

213
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:03,353
Today, 12:22 pm.

214
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:07,817
And on an answering machine
across town...

215
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,065
You have one new message.

216
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,932
Hi, it's me. I need to talk to you
about what I said the other day.

217
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,869
It's important.
You know my cell number.

218
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,135
The right side of my brain
told me to delete it.

219
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,142
But I left it.

220
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,405
It's important.
You know my cell number.

221
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:30,551
Seven playbacks later,
I invited an impartial judge.

222
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:32,447
- Well?
- You should have punched him.

223
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,817
He wants to get back together, right?
That's the tone.

224
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,788
The "Hi" and the "It's important".
Is that what it means?

225
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:43,453
We will never know. They still
don't know who killed Kennedy.

226
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,927
- What should I do?
- It's obvious what you want to do

227
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:53,166
or you wouldn't listen to it and what
happened to the sane part of you?

228
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:56,902
I don't know. After the fifth playback
he got in a little.

229
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,312
- I hate my machine.
- Yeah.

230
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,710
I hate mine too.

231
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:07,116
Steve got a message from a girl
desperate for him to go to a movie.

232
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:11,156
- Already? He's still on your couch.
- I know. It's amazing.

233
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:14,352
A 34-year-old guy
with no money and no place to live

234
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,656
because he's single,
he's a catch.

235
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:19,425
But a 34-year-old woman
with a job and a great home

236
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,728
because she's single,
is considered tragic.

237
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,927
Depressing.

238
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:26,801
Let's listen to that message again.

239
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,636
I'm deleting it.

240
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,674
But it wasn't that simple.

241
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:35,214
As soon as Miranda left, my emotions
overruled both sides of my brain.

242
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:39,480
- Hello?
- It's carrie.

243
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:43,351
oh, hey. Thanks for calling.

244
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,958
It's about getting out of my marriage.

245
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:49,154
I didn't knowwhy I called
or what I wanted,

246
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:51,265
but suddenly my heart was racing.

247
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:56,365
I thought about it,
and it's going to cost me a lot.

248
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:59,871
You should forget about what I said.

249
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:04,204
I made my bed, I should lie in it.

250
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:07,647
You do that.

251
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:12,548
It was what I needed. A shock
treatment to jolt me back to sanity.

252
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,550
- You have cracks.
- Excuse me?

253
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,753
The ceiling.

254
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,625
How long have they been there?

255
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:30,202
- Just three years.
- oh, just three years?

256
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:36,776
Don't take this the wrong way,
but this place could use a little work.

257
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,572
I can't afford it.

258
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:43,046
- You got 8,000 bucks worth of shoes.
- I needed those.

259
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:47,812
You could do little things -
plaster, strip the floors...

260
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:52,722
You have no idea how beautiful
it would be if we took it down a level.

261
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,163
I don't know how to do that stuff.

262
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,196
I do.

263
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,597
- Let me strip your floors.
- Isn't that a lot of work?

264
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,738
No. It'll just take a day.
You won't know I'm here.

265
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:07,136
Sure? Really?

266
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:09,799
A special lady needs a special home.

267
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:18,350
Here am I with a guy
who wanted to make my home better.

268
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,955
Somewhere out there was a guy
who wanted to pull it apart.

269
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:25,091
It wasn't a left or right-brainer,
it was a no-brainer.

270
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,592
- Tell me why we're here again.
- I'm making an effort to eat better.

271
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:33,564
After a browse
on the healthysperm. com web page,

272
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:36,636
Samantha invited Adam Ball to dinner.

273
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:40,968
oK, here are your wheat grass shots.

274
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:44,703
I'll be right back with the menus.

275
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:54,783
- I can't drink that.
- Try it. It's very good for you.

276
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:56,981
Bottoms up.

277
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,040
That shit is funky!

278
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:18,975
Samantha fought the urge not to tell
Adam Ball he didn't knowfrom funky.

279
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:25,017
How long does it take for wheat grass
to work into your system?

280
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:27,654
- Hard to say.
- Ballpark.

281
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,984
An hour and a half.

282
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,854
We should order.

283
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:34,995
An hour and a half,
two wheat grass shots

284
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:37,154
and a ginger-melon smoothie later,

285
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,559
I'm coming.

286
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,633
I'm coming.

287
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:46,838
Man, man, man, you give good head.

288
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:52,979
oh, babe.

289
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,445
What? You don't like your salad?

290
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,817
No. The dressing's a tad... something.

291
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,756
Excuse me, I'd like to change this
for the rucola and endive.

292
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:11,560
You should try the tomato basil.
It's sweeter.

293
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,257
All righty.

294
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,601
- Mom was quite taken with you.
- She is?

295
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,676
Why wouldn't she be?
You're exquisite.

296
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:27,781
You are a dream come true.

297
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:30,281
charlotte knewthis was the moment,

298
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:35,479
that magic moment where Trey
was going to ask her to be his wife.

299
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:37,783
- charlotte.
- Yes?

300
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,757
- Tomato and basil?
- Yes.

301
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,260
Enjoy.

302
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:51,599
Doesn't this look
like a little plate of heaven?

303
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,298
This basil is perfection.

304
00:19:54,542 --> 00:20:00,606
What is it about you charlotte?
You always know just what I want.

305
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,982
- Maybe we should get married.
- All righty.

306
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,328
- I'm engaged.
- oh, my God. Really?

307
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:21,434
- That's wonderful, sweetie.
- I proposed to myself.

308
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:23,399
- What?
- Yes.

309
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:27,837
I suggested he have a tomato salad,
then I suggested we get married.

310
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,476
What did he say?

311
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:31,668
"All righty. "

312
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,741
"All righty"?
He said, "All righty"?

313
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:40,354
The upsetting thing is proposing
to a guy who says "all righty".

314
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:41,852
Stop.

315
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:45,481
- All righty.
- I was the one supposed to say yes.

316
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,993
- Who cares about those stupid rules?
- I do.

317
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:52,223
You're overreacting.
You love Trey, right?

318
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,665
And you want to marry him, right?

319
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,432
Yes, but there was no kneeling.

320
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:02,440
There was no ring, no nothing.

321
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,842
This is an awful engagement story.
What am I supposed to tell my kids?

322
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:12,179
Mommy really wanted to get married,
so Daddy said, "All righty".

323
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,981
So unromantic.

324
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:31,335
Steve? The dog!

325
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,013
Steve. It's 4.:00 am.

326
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:49,851
Miranda realized
he was with the girl executive.

327
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:55,155
It was officially over.
She finally got it into her head.

328
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:09,700
- Morning.
- Morning.

329
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:13,472
- I took the dog out already.
- Thanks. I was...

330
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:18,779
There's coffee, and I circled a bunch
of apartments that sound good.

331
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:24,118
I'll get out of here today. Thanks for
letting me sleep on your couch.

332
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,623
You're welcome.

333
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:40,265
I think we did pretty good.

334
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,505
We did us proud.

335
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,737
Steve...

336
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:49,576
- Never mind.
- What?

337
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,449
I was gonna say, "Keep in touch",
but that would be weird.

338
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:58,616
I guess we could do that.

339
00:23:25,286 --> 00:23:27,220
Aidan.

340
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:38,092
You said I wouldn't be bothered.
I'm bothered.

341
00:23:38,265 --> 00:23:42,031
- It's too loud?
- Yeah. I've got a deadline.

342
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:45,104
- Go to my house.
- No, I can't write there.

343
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:49,208
Pete's jumping all over me.
He's deleting things.

344
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:52,346
I'm leaving.
I'll be at the Stanhope Hotel.

345
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:56,449
- At least let me pay for it.
- No, I got it.

346
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:00,985
This is why I don't do home repairs.
Unforeseen costs.

347
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:02,486
You'll love these floors.

348
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:07,185
Mom was beside herself.
She demanded your address...

349
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,420
-... so she could send flowers.
- That's nice.

350
00:24:09,597 --> 00:24:11,690
charlotte had done the impossible
in New York.

351
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:14,357
She was engaged
to her heart's desire.

352
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:17,436
Unfortunately, she couldn't get
the way it happened out of her head.

353
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:18,765
Wait.

354
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,770
I think we should
stop here for a minute.

355
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:30,313
Maybe we should go in and find you
the most beautiful ring they have.

356
00:24:30,484 --> 00:24:32,714
All righty.

357
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:36,254
From that moment on,
charlotte would tell everyone

358
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:40,827
that in front of Tiffany's, out of
nowhere, Trey popped the question.

359
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:44,863
And she said, "All righty".

360
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:00,637
I'm not really in the mood
for that tonight.

361
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:04,444
come on, baby,
you give the greatest head. Please.

362
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:08,281
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why? What's the problem?

363
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:13,416
Well, Adam...

364
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:17,052
- You've got funky tasting spunk.
- What?

365
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,222
You heard me.
Your spunk is funky.

366
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:25,170
- My spunk?
- come, spooge, jiz, joy juice. Funky.

367
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:28,831
I've heard bad excuses for not giving
head, but this one takes the cake.

368
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:33,070
- Excuse me?
- You're a two blow job chick.

369
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:36,683
They're in the coming attractions
but I'll never see them in the movie.

370
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:39,843
I resent that. I love giving head.

371
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,320
Then give me a little BJ. Up and down
a couple of times, it's easy.

372
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:48,428
You men have no idea
what we're dealing with down there.

373
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:52,191
Teeth placement, jaw stress,
suction, and gag reflex,

374
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:56,860
all the while bobbing up and down,
moaning and trying to breathe. Easy?

375
00:25:57,037 --> 00:26:00,165
Honey, they don't call it
a job for nothin'.

376
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,939
Now, having said all that,

377
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:08,445
with the right man it can be fabulous.

378
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,352
That is, unless the man has spunk
that's like the rotten egg buffet.

379
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:18,754
come on, it can't be that bad.

380
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:23,828
I'll make a deal with you.

381
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:26,057
You try it.

382
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:30,602
If you're fine with it, I'll be fine with it.

383
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:33,763
I can't do that. It's gay.

384
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:36,306
It's not gay, if it's you.

385
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:39,173
Take it or leave it.

386
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:45,046
Ten minutes later, Samantha learnt
how far men would go for a blow job.

387
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,387
I'm fine with it.

388
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,920
Samantha kept her word.

389
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:58,394
She gave him head,
but her heart wasn't in it.

390
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,766
- Hello?
- It's me.

391
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:11,673
- I'm in the lobby.
- How did you know I was here?

392
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:15,338
- That guy at your place...
- You called my house again?

393
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:19,680
- I have to talk to you.
- I have to talk to you too. Stay there.

394
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:21,849
Shit.

395
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:38,870
- This is not the lobby.
- Have a drink.

396
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,236
What are you doing, calling my house,
following me to hotels?

397
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:45,970
could you sit down for one minute
and listen to me?

398
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,909
Please. one minute.

399
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:53,712
I don't have time.
I have a boyfriend and a deadline,

400
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,185
and you have a wife
and a drinking problem.

401
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:58,222
- I'm not drunk.
- Then what is your excuse?

402
00:27:58,392 --> 00:28:01,384
Slow down, I can't think.

403
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,933
- I was an asshole the other day.
- Yes.

404
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:13,868
When I said I was leaving, you didn't
say anything. I got nervous, so...

405
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,941
So, what?

406
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:18,942
I don't know.

407
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:24,642
This has to stop - flirting, jerking me
around, calling my boyfriend.

408
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:27,753
He doesn't know about you,
and I don't want him to.

409
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:29,287
Why?

410
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:32,448
Go, lie in your beige bed.

411
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,060
carrie, wait, wait.

412
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:47,230
I haven't explained this very well.
Wait a minute. Listen.

413
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:49,933
The thing is, fuck, I miss you.

414
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,044
Too bad.

415
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:56,205
- Do not come in here.
- I have to talk to you.

416
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:59,215
What? What is it you have to say?

417
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,945
I made a mistake.

418
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:04,522
Fuck you.

419
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,392
I love you.

420
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,792
Fuck you.

421
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:20,974
My mind was yelling how angry I was,
but my heart...

422
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,939
Fuck me.

423
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:46,458
And just like that I lost my head.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
