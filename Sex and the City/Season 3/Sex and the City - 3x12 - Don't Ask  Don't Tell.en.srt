1
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:49,157
For Miranda, the only thing worse

2
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,323
than being charlotte's
34-year-old bridesmaid

3
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,628
was being a 34-year-old
bridesmaid without a date.

4
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:56,634
With the wedding approaching,

5
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:59,603
Miranda fell prey to the siren song
of a singles event.

6
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:02,941
Multi-dating.

7
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:06,205
$20 bought you seven mini-dates,
each eight minutes long

8
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:09,043
which is as long
as blind dates should be.

9
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:10,708
Hi. I'm Miranda Hobbes.

10
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,218
Dwight owens.

11
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:15,323
Private wealth group at Morgan
Stanley Investment Management

12
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,947
for high net-worth individuals

13
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,423
and pension plans.

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,188
Like my job, been there five years,

15
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,696
divorced, no kids, not religious.

16
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,356
I live in New Jersey,

17
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,230
speak French and Portuguese.

18
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:29,166
Any of this appealing?

19
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:32,669
Sure. Portuguese, that's impressive.

20
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:36,106
Obrigado- What about you, Mandy?

21
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,109
Miranda.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,340
I'm a lawyer at a mid-sized firm.

23
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,714
I was recently made partner.

24
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:48,814
I'm a lawyer.

25
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:53,791
I'm a lawyer.
I went to Harvard Law School.

26
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:58,092
- I'm a stewardess.
- Really?

27
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:04,631
But before the wedding bells,
there's the rehearsal dinner.

28
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:08,037
- You said you were a stewardess.
- I was testing a theory.

29
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,475
- The theory being...
- Men are threatened by good jobs.

30
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,480
- They don't want a lawyer. They...
- Want a liar.

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,949
I was the liar.
I'd finally ended my affair with Big,

32
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:21,417
but the guilt of lying to Aidan was
like a hangover I couldn't sleep off.

33
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,027
I'm just saying, as a lawyer -
a partner, no less - I got zero dates.

34
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:28,685
As a stewardess,
I got one for tomorrow.

35
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:32,424
- The correct term is "flight attendant".
- Not if you wanna get laid.

36
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:38,369
It's how you say what you do that
matters. For example, "I'm in PR".

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,737
Translation - "I give great head".

38
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:45,706
- What?
- He's actually an oK guy.

39
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,782
Harris Bragan,
emergency room doctor.

40
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,512
Yeah, but you can't date the guy now
because you lied.

41
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:57,318
I'd tell him eventually. If he got upset
he'd look completely shallow.

42
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:59,892
And it would make you look schizo.

43
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:05,465
Excuse me. I...

44
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:07,625
We...

45
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:12,035
See, mother, I told you
I'd become a "we" sooner or later.

46
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,335
This is a "wee" toast.

47
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,107
I'd like to thank everyone for coming,
especially the out-of-towners.

48
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:25,014
My cousin caleb, who's in the
wedding party, came from Edinburgh.

49
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:27,747
Someone had to bring
the real Scotch, like.

50
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,119
I knowwhat I'll be having later.

51
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:38,527
But the person I'd really like to thank
for showing up is this woman here.

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,032
I love you more than words can say.

53
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:46,902
Those who know me know I'm a man
of many words. God knows I've tried.

54
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:51,603
All righty, then.
Let's eat, drink, and be married.

55
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:02,514
- She's so happy.
- She doesn't have to be a bridesmaid.

56
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:06,058
We got off easy.
The groomsmen have to wear kilts.

57
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,822
I like the idea of men in skirts -
easy access.

58
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:11,056
Is it true that
they wear nothing underneath?

59
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:14,100
I'll find out and get back to you.

60
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:18,798
His name was caleb, right?

61
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:27,406
Hi there. I'm samantha Jones.

62
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:30,142
caleb MacDougal, Samantha.
Pleasure.

63
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:34,846
- First time in New York city?
- Aye, and it's brilliant, like.

64
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:40,051
The architecture, the energy.
It is, you know.

65
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,526
Samantha could
barely understand him.

66
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:46,098
But if his tongue could do that,
she wondered what it could do to her.

67
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:48,759
I'd be happy
to showyou around town.

68
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,666
That would be great.

69
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,903
Trey got lost bringing me back
from the Stanhope Hotel, like.

70
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:01,408
Samantha wasn't the only one
feeling lost.

71
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,450
- I'm thinking I have to tell him.
- Tell who?

72
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,782
Aidan.
I might have to tell him about Big.

73
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:11,084
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.

74
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,194
Relationships are supposed
to be built on trust.

75
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:16,694
No offence, but that ship has sailed.

76
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:21,062
You're right. You have to tell him, but
not before the wedding. It's my week.

77
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:25,195
It's your day.
You get a day, not a week.

78
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:28,706
There's no reason to tell him.
Men lie about this all the time.

79
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:32,540
- And women find out.
- What if he finds out?

80
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:37,083
You fucked Big all over Manhattan.
Why should he find out now?

81
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:40,244
could you not use
the f-word in vera Wang?

82
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:47,225
If my boyfriend was sleeping
with somebody else for three weeks,

83
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:50,523
I'd wanna know about it.
I'd wanna have all the information.

84
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:54,066
That might mean more coming from
someone not posing as a stewardess.

85
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:55,328
What?

86
00:05:55,504 --> 00:06:00,032
Nothing, but at your wedding we have
to pretend Miranda's a stewardess.

87
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:05,441
I don't wanna pretend anything. And
I don't want you and Aidan fighting.

88
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:08,343
Don't you think
this could be a little shorter?

89
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:12,817
- The skirts must the same length.
- Really?

90
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:17,254
- What about Trey's skirt?
- It's a kilt, and it's tradition.

91
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,953
can't I ask you not to wear your dress
round your see-you-next-Tuesday?

92
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,291
My what?

93
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:29,631
- c-U-Next...
- Tuesday?

94
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:32,865
oh, my God. Was that
a Schoolhouse Rock I missed?

95
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:37,268
If I have to be a bridesmaid,
I'd at least like to look good.

96
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:40,881
- You don't have to be a bridesmaid.
- Then why am I here?

97
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,483
Frankly, I didn't want you
to feel left out.

98
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:48,180
I would love to be left out. I could be
in bed with a hot Scot right now.

99
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:49,618
Fine.

100
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:55,129
- Don't do this.
- What? We're just being honest.

101
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:58,130
Honestly, I hate this color.

102
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:04,230
I started thinking about honesty.
Maybe the idea was overrated.

103
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:08,035
Maybe coming clean is the ultimate
selfish act, a way to absolve yourself

104
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:11,110
by hurting someone
who doesn't deserve to be hurt.

105
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,839
I cheated on a test
in the fifth grade with two friends.

106
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,813
They confessed and failed the class.

107
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:20,249
I never told anyone,
and it never mattered.

108
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:24,882
In a relationship,
is honesty really the best policy?

109
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:29,361
Evidently, dishonesty was
the best policy for Miranda.

110
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:32,364
As a stewardess,
she was a charming date.

111
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:35,832
once you work first class,
you can't go back to coach.

112
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:38,336
- I imagine.
- oh, yeah.

113
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,442
- No warm cookies in coach.
- You get to eat the cookies?

114
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:46,274
There's always some actress
who doesn't want her cookie.

115
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:51,682
Free travel, cookies -
this sounds like a great job.

116
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:55,619
You've got the great job -
a New York ER. I'm not saving lives.

117
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,452
You are, in the event
of an emergency.

118
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:04,429
Inflatable slide - I'm in charge of that.

119
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,660
But once we open the slide,
it's every man for himself.

120
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:19,843
That night, Harris got to make love
to a stewardess.

121
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:23,473
Miranda didn't have to fake anything.

122
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:26,849
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

123
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:36,095
I'd love to ask you to spend the night,
but I've got an early flight to Dc.

124
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:38,459
The 5:00am-er.

125
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,965
I should get some rest too.

126
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:47,405
Saturdays at the hospital are non-stop
since roller blades were invented.

127
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:05,925
- Do you have a boy in every port?
- Every airport.

128
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:09,063
Seriously. I bet you're a heartbreaker.

129
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:12,631
In truth, it's a lonely life.

130
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:18,095
There's a wedding I'm in on Sunday.

131
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:20,935
Days later, the four of us celebrated

132
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:23,271
charlotte's last night
as a single woman.

133
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,073
I can't believe you're getting married.

134
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,272
Is this the beginning?
Are you next?

135
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,351
oh, yeah.
I'm headed for a storybook ending.

136
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,616
The little girl had an affair, lied to her
boyfriend, and lived happily ever after.

137
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,555
Marriage doesn't guarantee
a happy ending, just an ending.

138
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:42,526
- The end of dating.
- All right then.

139
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:45,257
It's also the end of the possibility

140
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,233
that your next great fuck
is around the corner.

141
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:50,734
My next great...

142
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:52,532
- Yes?
- Say it.

143
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:56,768
...fuck is just around the corner.

144
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:59,880
I finally get to sleep with Trey.

145
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:04,318
- Excuse me?
- You haven't slept with him yet?

146
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:07,853
Before you buy the car,
you take it for a test drive.

147
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,892
I wanted to save myself
until we got married.

148
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,363
- Sweetie, you're not a virgin.
- I am with him, and it's romantic.

149
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,526
It's romantic until he can't figure out
where to put it in.

150
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:25,673
- No.
- What if he's terrible?

151
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,401
He won't be terrible. No.

152
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:32,478
He is an amazing kisser.

153
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:38,142
- Really?
- He's so sexy, and he loves me.

154
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:43,213
I want to do things to him
that I have never done to anybody.

155
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:47,987
The other night, I was thinking
of putting whipped cream

156
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,097
all over my body.

157
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:54,895
Low fat cool Whip is the best.
It's less sticky than other brands.

158
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,938
- Low fat cool Whip.
- You haven't slept with him!

159
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,439
It's been...

160
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:06,046
Too long! I am so horny.

161
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:08,148
Horny.

162
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,317
Those of us not getting married
celebrated with a booty call.

163
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm so glad you called.

164
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:18,288
As soon as I landed.

165
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,920
Samantha's vertical Scotch tasting
that turned into a horizontal one.

166
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,691
I had no idea you Yanks
were so bloody friendly.

167
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:31,100
She couldn't understand him,
but understood he was hard.

168
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:36,266
I decided to crawl into bed with Aidan,
but he wasn't in his bed.

169
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:39,379
Hey, beautiful.
What brings you down here?

170
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,879
I was trying to surprise you.

171
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,814
You can't surprise a man with a dog.

172
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:47,045
I see that.

173
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:51,158
What are you working on?

174
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:55,624
- The wedding gift.
- This is for charlotte and Trey?

175
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:58,061
You wanted to give them
a piece of my furniture.

176
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:02,362
You didn't have to make something.
We could have picked a piece.

177
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:04,937
I make all that stuff too.

178
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,702
I know, but this is too nice.

179
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,375
I wanted it to mean something.

180
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:19,113
God, I was about to get them
steak knives.

181
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,991
What does it mean?

182
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:29,522
- It's a love seat.
- That I get.

183
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:35,727
It's two different types of wood
from two different trees.

184
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:41,201
They blend together
and make it stronger, just like...

185
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,537
A mixed drink.

186
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,310
- Kind of like two people in love.
- Right, that too.

187
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:51,111
Are you gonna make fun of this?

188
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:58,855
It's really...
nicer than anyone deserves.

189
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:04,365
You see this piece?

190
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,969
This big old flaw right here?

191
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:12,072
It's not a flaw, really.

192
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,109
It's just the way the wood is.
It's interesting. Beautiful.

193
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,454
Flaws can be good?

194
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:32,048
Flaws are the best part.

195
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:37,995
This was the time to tell him.
I could feel the words inside me.

196
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,761
But if I told him,
could he still love me?

197
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,564
I wasn't ready to find out.

198
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:01,488
There was another
booty call that night.

199
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:06,758
Hi, sweetiekins.

200
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,260
charlotte Yorke, are you drunk?

201
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,667
Yes. Yes, I am, Trey MacDougal.

202
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:27,111
And today is
officially our wedding day.

203
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:32,047
And I can't wait any longer.

204
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:37,388
could we please make love
right now?

205
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:41,085
- Are you sure?
- oh, yes, I am.

206
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:44,720
Take me to your bedroom now.

207
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,129
All righty then.

208
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:57,503
That was unfortunate.

209
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,843
Has this...
ever happened to you before?

210
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:05,318
Every now and then.

211
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:13,216
I just didn't think
it would happen with you.

212
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:19,300
It's no big deal.

213
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,960
Sometimes intercourse
just doesn't do it for me.

214
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,168
I can get the sails up,
just can't bring it into the harbor.

215
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,915
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, there is.

216
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:42,113
What?

217
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,123
You can marry me.

218
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:49,423
- I'm already doing that.
- I love you, charlotte.

219
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:53,691
Sex is such a small part of it for us.

220
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:58,703
That's what I love about you.
It's not just about the sex.

221
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,341
charlotte couldn't sleep at all
that night.

222
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,138
Neither could I.

223
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:12,248
All I could think about was
that I was a cheater.

224
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,516
I cheated and lied in fifth grade,
and I was still doing it.

225
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:26,090
- This isn't gonna work.
- What do you mean? Us?

226
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:30,931
I can't have you sneaking out at 3:00
in the morning for a cigarette.

227
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,908
I tried to quit. I just couldn't.

228
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:38,043
Well...

229
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:43,107
I'll just have to learn to live with it.

230
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:47,914
- You said you can't date a smoker.
- You're not just a smoker.

231
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,683
You're a lot of things.

232
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:55,522
- I'm not perfect.
- oh, yeah? What's your flaw?

233
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,330
You tell me.

234
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,469
I don't know.

235
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,434
That was another lie.

236
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:08,063
I knewwhat his flawwas.
It was trusting me with his heart.

237
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:12,474
- Aidan, I need to tell you something.
- What?

238
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,978
But suddenly I couldn't tell him.

239
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:18,779
I was afraid he'd never
look at me that way again.

240
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:21,012
So I didn't.

241
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,747
I love you.

242
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:25,290
I love you, too.

243
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:35,031
- Let's go back and go to bed.
- No, I should get home.

244
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:39,871
My stuff's at home,
the stuff for the wedding.

245
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,272
I'm the maid of honor.
I need to be presentable.

246
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,503
I'll come with you.

247
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,118
No, stay here.
Just pick me up in the morning.

248
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:54,220
I'll get my stuff. I have to go.

249
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:03,221
Is this wedding black tie?
I don't have a tux.

250
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:06,833
The groom is in a kilt,
so pretty...

251
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:11,229
- What happened?
- I cut my finger.

252
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,031
Jesus.

253
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:15,437
It's oK. It happens.

254
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,441
You haven't made breakfast

255
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:20,410
till you've made it at 10,000 feet
in turbulence.

256
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:23,175
- It's really bleeding. Look.
- I saw it.

257
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,478
- What should I do?
- I don't know.

258
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:29,589
- It's deep. Do I need stitches?
- Stop putting it in my face.

259
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:35,059
- I think it's really bad, look.
- Stop it. Blood makes me queasy.

260
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,494
But you're a doctor. Aren't you?

261
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,860
- Not really.
- What are you then?

262
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:46,404
Assistant Manager of Athlete's Foot
at 81st and Broadway.

263
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:50,407
- You lied?
- I'm sorry.

264
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:53,604
I always wanted
to sleep with a stewardess.

265
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:56,716
For a moment,
Miranda considered coming clean.

266
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:58,715
But then they'd both be liars,

267
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:01,719
and he wouldn't have slept
with a stewardess.

268
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:06,758
You should go. I hope I never
have you on one of my flights.

269
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,988
- I wouldn't be on first class.
- No, you wouldn't.

270
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:24,139
I'm running late. charlotte will never
forgive me. I need to...

271
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:26,337
What's that?

272
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:29,677
- It's the wedding gift.
- That love seat packs up nice.

273
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,045
It's a Polaroid.

274
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:34,983
You look too hot to be a bridesmaid.

275
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:41,254
I thought the whole point was to wear
a bad dress and be humiliated.

276
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,260
It's not that kind of wedding.

277
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:48,061
I thought maybe one day
I'd build us a love seat.

278
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:51,432
We're gonna be late.
I'm just gonna grab my...

279
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:56,004
I was supposed to be
at the church ten minutes ago.

280
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:58,805
You never let me hold you anymore.

281
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:03,144
- Why do you keep running away?
- I'm not running away.

282
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:05,684
What are you afraid of?

283
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:12,715
Aidan, I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

284
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:16,829
You met him at the furniture show.
Then we slept together.

285
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,660
I didn't tell you, and I'm sorry.

286
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:25,629
You slept with that guy?

287
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:29,572
When we were going out?

288
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:32,372
- once?
- No, more than once.

289
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:34,639
He was married. It was a mess.

290
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,875
I don't knowwhat I was thinking.
I wasn't thinking.

291
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:41,078
It's so over. And it was wrong.

292
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:45,851
I just hope you can...

293
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,621
Here. I want to be alone.

294
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:03,042
What about the wedding?

295
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:05,872
Just go without me.

296
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,346
- I'm gonna take a walk.
- Will you meet me there later?

297
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:19,283
- Please don't bleed on my dress.
- I'm trying not to.

298
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,950
- Here we go.
- Where is carrie?

299
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,358
She'll be here.

300
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:27,058
charlotte, my grandmother's necklace
looks beautiful on you.

301
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:32,536
- could I escort you to your seat?
- Excuse me?

302
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:36,165
He asked
if he could escort you to your seat.

303
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,536
certainly.

304
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,873
I guess it's time.

305
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:44,945
They do wear something under kilts,
but it's easy to get off.

306
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:49,054
The wedding was complete. charlotte
had something old, something new,

307
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:52,021
something borrowed,
and someone Samantha blew.

308
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:58,825
- I'm sorry I'm so late.
- It's oK. I'm glad you're here.

309
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:03,093
Jeez, you look perfect.

310
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,532
Honestly?

311
00:22:06,073 --> 00:22:07,540
Honestly.

312
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:12,869
- We should go. come on.
- oK.

313
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:44,835
Despite all her bitching, Samantha
enjoyed being a bridesmaid.

314
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:55,048
Miranda, back to being herself,
found a last-minute date.

315
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,392
carrie.

316
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:12,064
- I have to tell you something.
- Right now?

317
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,467
Yeah.

318
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:21,943
- Trey can't get it up.
- What?

319
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:26,280
- Last night he couldn't get it up.
- Was he drunk?

320
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:28,853
No. I was drunk, he was fine.

321
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:34,055
Then it must have been
wedding-night jitters.

322
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:36,287
He says it happens sometimes.

323
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:41,093
Since she was in the white dress,
I reached for a white lie.

324
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,862
Happens to everybody.

325
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:46,768
I should have slept with him
on the first date.

326
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,277
Maybe he jerked off
before you got there,

327
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:55,643
and he was
too embarrassed to tell you.

328
00:23:57,785 --> 00:24:02,085
- I do love him.
- And he loves you.

329
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:05,089
Maybe he did jerk off.

330
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:10,424
If you don't wanna go through this,
you don't have to.

331
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:13,828
We'll just get a cab, and everyone
will just have to get over it.

332
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:27,108
No. I'm getting married.

333
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,012
- oK, go.
- oK.

334
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,051
carrie!

335
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:37,247
come here.

336
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:43,922
Don't tell anyone. Go.
oK, go.

337
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:53,463
charlotte was 34, single,
and standing in a $14,000 dress.

338
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:57,166
She was getting married.
Not even a low libido could stop her.

339
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:39,084
- could you hold this for a second?
- Sure.

340
00:25:49,563 --> 00:25:51,997
Hey, you.

341
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:57,194
I walked around for about an hour.

342
00:25:57,371 --> 00:26:00,465
couldn't bring myself to go in.

343
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:03,576
I'm so sorry, Aidan.

344
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,804
I knowthat.

345
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,278
I never meant to hurt you.

346
00:26:11,452 --> 00:26:13,113
I know.

347
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:17,986
But I did. I'm sorry.

348
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:30,869
couldn't it be like the wood?
That's my flaw, and...

349
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:37,801
...and you're the other wood,
and that makes us stronger.

350
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:42,746
It's not that simple, carrie.

351
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:53,059
I wish I didn't know about this.

352
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:57,425
I just wanted to be honest with you.

353
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:02,163
People make mistakes.

354
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:16,179
I just know myself. This is not
the kind of thing I can get over.

355
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,191
I just need to be
on my own for a while.

356
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,395
Me on my own.

357
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:48,010
I really loved you.

358
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:59,149
- carrie, they need us for photos.
- oK.

359
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,835
I told him.

360
00:28:29,656 --> 00:28:34,457
It's hard to find people
who will love you no matter what.

361
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:40,431
Here we go. Smile.
Everybody looks beautiful.

362
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:44,731
I was lucky enough
to find three of them.
