1
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:52,195
NewYork city. Home to one million
exciting, eligible, single men...

2
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:56,601
and four cold and slightly cranky
single women.

3
00:00:56,772 --> 00:01:00,572
Well, this is good. We,re actually
crossing water to meet men.

4
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:03,837
Reminder, I am not going
to staten Island to meet men.

5
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,311
I am going to judge them.

6
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:09,451
A perk of being a minor celebrity

7
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:11,916
is that you get invited to major events.

8
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:14,215
Like NewYork fire department's

9
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:16,051
annual calendar competition.

10
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:18,660
This is a long way to go to watch

11
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:20,591
some firemen take their shirts off.

12
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,857
I,m on the ferry.
I better see more than pecs.

13
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,331
I,m freezing!

14
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,663
I don't understand

15
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:30,931
why they couldn,t hold the competition

16
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,540
in a bar in Manhattan.

17
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,302
They have firemen

18
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:36,411
on the Upper East side too.

19
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:39,378
And they only put out top-notch fires.

20
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:41,949
Look at how small it looks.

21
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:45,183
Who would have thought
an island that tiny

22
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:48,552
would be big enough
to hold all our old boyfriends.

23
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:02,203
He loves to cook
and can whip up a great baked ziti.

24
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:06,137
He,s from engine 275, ladder 133,

25
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,175
way out there in Queens.

26
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,720
- Is he hot?
- He's a six.

27
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,420
on a scale of how many?

28
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:32,364
His name was Bill Kelley.
He was a divorced politician,

29
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,299
campaigning for New York city
comptroller.

30
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:37,234
And the token male judge.

31
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:45,109
- Watch the firemen.
- I,m more into cops.

32
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:49,946
He,s a dancer and married.
sorry, ladies.

33
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:54,988
His wife Maria said he,s a good guy
but he works too hard.

34
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:58,093
Work that belly!

35
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,126
Ladies, over here.

36
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:10,795
oK, they don,t make cosmopolitans,
it,s a staten Island iced tea.

37
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,568
- Is that like a Long Island iced tea?
- I think so.

38
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,170
Hello, I,m drunk.

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,848
Do we have to be this close?
It,s embarrassing.

40
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:24,816
- You gotta be in it to win it.
- I,m moving back.

41
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:29,048
I can,t see the cute firemen
from back there without my glasses.

42
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:31,625
Why do you even care?
You have steve.

43
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:36,857
I do not have steve. There is no
having of the steve, we,re just friends.

44
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,433
We,re just friends.
I don,t put my dick in you.

45
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,797
Another one of these
and I might let you.

46
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,973
There are no datable men here.

47
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,043
What was your first clue? The pleather
jackets or smell of... High Karate...?

48
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:52,737
Ladies, this is Ricky Fantucchi.
He,s a capricorn.

49
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,940
His uncles are firefighters.

50
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:58,518
Yes, ladies,
that,s a cheetah on his arm.

51
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:06,689
Ricky represents engine 53
in Lower Manhattan.

52
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:11,296
I,d like to show him
my Lower Manhattan.

53
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:17,667
- Look at his arms, they,re huge.
- You knowwhat they say.

54
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:21,138
Big arms... big arms.

55
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,110
Hello, 911. I,m on fire.

56
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:43,924
After the contest,
I began to realize that staten Island

57
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,567
was like a quaint European country.

58
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:49,033
The American music
was 20 years behind

59
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:51,832
and you could smoke
wherever you wanted.

60
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:19,832
Hi. Are those shirts are for sale?
I,d like to get one for my nephew.

61
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,735
Yeah, you could buy,em.
But I don,t knowwhere.

62
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:27,069
I got this one at work, but I,m sure you
could buy,em at other places.

63
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:29,870
- I,ve seen them in those shops...
- samantha.

64
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:33,503
- Ricky, how are you doing?
- Good. How are you doing?

65
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,583
- I sawyou up there.
- I sawyou too.

66
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:39,414
- You looked fantastic.
- Yeah?

67
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,682
I never did anything like that.
My sisters said... Do it, Ricky....

68
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:45,917
And I said,
... I never did anything like that before....

69
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,926
You did it very well.

70
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:53,301
- I wonder what month you,ll be.
- Maybe october.

71
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:57,768
- My birthday is in october.
- I bet July, or any month that,s hot.

72
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:03,535
Two songs later, it was time for this
dancing queen to take a breather.

73
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:06,340
Hello. Can I bum a smoke?

74
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:08,540
- sure.
- Thanks.

75
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,742
There you go.

76
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:17,282
- That,s good. I quit three years ago.
- How's that working out for you?

77
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:22,055
- Good. I allow myself one a week.
- You live right on the edge, don,t you?

78
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,328
- can I buy you a beer?
- No, I got it.

79
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,992
It's on me.
For helping me out in there.

80
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,300
sure. And by the way,
you have the worst taste in men...

81
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,341
-... ever.
- No way.

82
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:38,069
You gave that guy from Midtown a 7.

83
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:41,614
I like a firefighter with love handles
to hold on to

84
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,377
when escaping a burning building.

85
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,716
- You got a point there.
- But you were tough.

86
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,949
And what,s with the half-points?
6.5, 8.5?

87
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:54,356
What can I say?
sometimes a girl needs a half.

88
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:59,495
so, which district do you vote in?

89
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,432
Whichever one is near Barneys.

90
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:04,765
You,ve never voted
in New York city?

91
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:07,068
correct, Mr. President.

92
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,973
What,s your address?
official government purposes.

93
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:13,581
- I can tell you your district.
- officially?

94
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,979
It's 245 East 73rd street.

95
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:20,315
District 23. Same as mine.
I'm at Madison and 82nd.

96
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:24,481
Fancy. I thought all honest politicians
lived in studios

97
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:26,253
and ate beans out of a can.

98
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,386
I'm not a fan of beans.

99
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:32,923
can I get your phone number?
Government purposes only.

100
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:35,797
I,m just here with my friends
having a good time.

101
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:39,897
- I,m not into dating right now.
- What, bad break-up?

102
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:57,152
That was a long silence.

103
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:59,487
Actually, it was a silence and a half.

104
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:01,686
HaVe dinner with me.

105
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:05,862
Would it help if I took my shirt off?

106
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,270
Time to go.
Politician,s hitting on me.

107
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,535
- And is that a bad thing?
- He,s just way too... I,m the guy....

108
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,940
Are you sure? He,s pretty cute.

109
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:21,275
I don,t want to have to tell you this.
I saw him give someone a thumbs up.

110
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,318
We,re out of here. samantha
went home with that firefighter.

111
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:29,787
- Toot toot, beep beep.
- And charlotte,s around somewhere.

112
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,860
- How many cocktails did she have?
- A couple, why?

113
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,459
And so, three girls headed home,

114
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:18,937
taking only fond memories of staten
Island and its infamous iced teas.

115
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,675
Honey, close up, it,s cold.

116
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:30,984
- Are you gonna help?
- I held her head in the taxi.

117
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:37,255
You,re so nice, carrie.

118
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:40,327
- I,m nice too, aren,t I?
- Yes, you,re nice.

119
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:43,293
I'm nice...

120
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,333
I'm pretty and I'm smart.
I'm a catch.

121
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:49,367
Yes, you,re a catch.

122
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,506
I hate you.

123
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:57,509
You knowwhat? I,m gonna meet
the perfect guy and get married.

124
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:00,113
Yes, you,re getting married.

125
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:06,718
Did you hear that New York?
I,m getting married this year.

126
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:10,551
I,m getting married and here I come!

127
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:13,422
If she falls oVer
I will neVer stop laughing.

128
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:15,790
I wasn't quite sure
if it was the iced teas

129
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:18,797
or the staten Island dating pool
that broke the camel,s back.

130
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,333
But something set charlotte on fire.

131
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:27,400
And uptown on dry land, samantha
and Mr. July had their own fire going.

132
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:31,103
You,re so big and strong.

133
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,781
I believe the official fire department
count is... a four alarmer....

134
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:42,883
The next morning at breakfast,
Miranda and I wanted poached eggs,

135
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:45,116
samantha wanted to give us
the details

136
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,229
and charlotte wanted to keep
her head from exploding

137
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,126
over her raincoat.

138
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:52,665
I,m telling you,
no guy has ever gotten me that wet.

139
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,701
- Pass the salt.
- Let me tell you about his cock.

140
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,967
Will you be quiet? The people
at the next table have a child.

141
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,701
- That,s their choice.
- Miss Hangover,s right.

142
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,370
can we spare the cock talk
till cocktail time?

143
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:11,178
I wanted you to know my fireman was
every bit the fantasy I had in mind.

144
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:12,377
New York's finest.

145
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,749
- That,s cops.
- Whatever.

146
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:18,585
I think it,s wrong to sleep with a man
just to fulfill a fantasy.

147
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,524
All the men we sleep with
fulfill a certain fantasy.

148
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,822
or nightmare.

149
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:26,399
You fantasize of a man with a fancy
apartment and a stock portfolio.

150
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,626
For me, it,s a fireman with a big hose.

151
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,795
Why are firemen so cute?

152
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:34,408
Even when they,re not that cute...
they,re still cute.

153
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:38,307
First, there,s a weight limit.
second, it,s the hero thing.

154
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,075
- You see him on that truck...
- That truck is hot.

155
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,582
...hurrying to save someone trapped.

156
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:47,883
They,ve got that
... I,m a good guy... look in their eyes.

157
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,752
It,s because women
want to be rescued.

158
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,588
The sentence independent single
women in their thirties

159
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:57,527
are never supposed to think,
let alone say out loud.

160
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:02,898
It,s true. I,ve been dating since I was
15, I,m exhausted. Where is he?

161
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,905
- Who? The white knight?
- That only happens in fairytales.

162
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:09,509
My hair hurts.

163
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:12,738
Did you ever think
that maybe we,re the white knights

164
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:15,815
and we,re the ones
that have to save ourselves?

165
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:21,311
- That is so depressing.
- Is it?

166
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:25,356
Later that day I got to thinking
about fairytales.

167
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,587
What if Prince charming
had never showed up?

168
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:31,927
Would snowWhite have slept
in that glass coffin forever?

169
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:36,127
or would she have eventually woken
up, spit out the apple, gotten a job,

170
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:40,240
a healthcare package and a baby
from her local sperm bank?

171
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:44,902
I couldn,t help but wonder. Inside
every confident, driven, single woman

172
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,642
is there a delicate, fragile princess
just waiting to be saved?

173
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:51,547
Was charlotte right?

174
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,780
Do women just wanna be rescued?

175
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:58,585
And after your laser surgery
on saturday

176
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:03,664
you,ll need a significant other
or a friend to help get you home.

177
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,391
sign here.

178
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,866
While for some women the idea
of rescue was a life raft,

179
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,767
for Miranda it was an insult.

180
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:13,932
I don,t need anybody to help me.
I,ll be fine.

181
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:16,805
You,ll be sedated
and your vision will be blurred.

182
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:20,540
You will need someone
to get you home and to bed.

183
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:23,741
Then take two sleeping pills,
sleep for 12 hours.

184
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,786
Wake up and you,ll be able
to see perfectly.

185
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:29,947
I can,t believe I,m gonna wake up
and see clearly

186
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,288
without glasses or contacts
for the first time.

187
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:35,520
BelieVe it.

188
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:39,494
They slit your eyeball open
and flip up the top.

189
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:43,502
- Gross.
- It just flips right up. Flip, my eye.

190
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:47,371
- oK, stop.
- This little blade cuts it. Just...

191
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,844
...like the top of a grape.

192
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:54,839
It sounds pretty bad.

193
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:58,509
You want me to come down
and hold your hand?

194
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:01,679
I,m fine. I do not need anyone
to hold my hand.

195
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,518
I,m not saying you need anyone.

196
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,720
I,d just like to be there.
To help you, whatever.

197
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,922
You,ll need help getting home.

198
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,262
Yeah, I,m gonna ask carrie.

199
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:18,305
Why do you have to ask carrie
when I,m offering?

200
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:21,475
Because, you know,
carrie is my friend.

201
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:26,205
- oK, and what am I?
- We haven,t established that yet.

202
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:34,145
- Are you coming up?
- We haven,t established that yet.

203
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:40,359
What are we doing here?
I mean, are we...

204
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:44,521
steve, after they flip the eye up,
these jets...

205
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:51,363
And over on the East side
at a more charlotte-friendly bar,

206
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,270
the ice tea princess began her quest
for a white knight.

207
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,975
oh, my God. He,s so cute.
cute, right?

208
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,945
very cute.
And I,m a professional.

209
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:07,449
I have to meet him.
How am I gonna meet him?

210
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:10,284
We got here ten minutes ago.
Pace yourself.

211
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,552
Hey beautiful. I,m J.J.
can I buy those sweet lips a drink?

212
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,325
I,m sorry. We were just leaving.

213
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,095
charlotte was a firm believer
in the laws of dating feng shui.

214
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,670
change location, change luck.

215
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:27,171
Why is it always a guy like that?
Is it me?

216
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:31,176
No, it,s not you.
Into every life a little J.J. must fall.

217
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:35,749
I just want a nice, sweet,
handsome, funny, great guy,

218
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,942
who doesn,t say things
like sweet lips.

219
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,144
Is that too much to ask?

220
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:43,382
Hey, you didn,t leave.
You,re just over here now.

221
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:46,322
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I,m not interested.

222
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:48,826
one drink.
I,ll even buy blondie here one.

223
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:52,899
- one little drink.
- Excuse me. she,s not interested.

224
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,866
Am I talking to you?
No. come on...

225
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:58,471
- You,re not listening. The lady said...
- Hey, fuck you.

226
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:07,510
- I,m sorry about that.
- Did you hurt your hand?

227
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:08,740
No.

228
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,714
His name was Arthur.

229
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:14,480
He was a nice, sweet, handsome,
great investment banker

230
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:17,317
who lived between Madison and Fifth.

231
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:19,653
so, maybe there
really were white knights.

232
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,400
The day after charlotte met her knight,
I met my credit card limit.

233
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,539
With no man in sight,
I decided to rescue my ankles

234
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:33,300
from a life of boredom

235
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:36,740
by purchasing too many pairs
of Jimmy choo shoes.

236
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:40,908
Hello, my name is Bill Kelley and
I,m gonna be your city comptroller.

237
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,517
- You,re not seriously here.
- I assure you I am.

238
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:48,850
I brought some voter registration
forms. I filled out your name.

239
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:53,324
Under occupation I put heartbreaker.
I really did. Look.

240
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:56,931
You,re like a Jehovah,s Witness
with a good suit.

241
00:16:57,098 --> 00:17:00,625
- How long have you been here?
- Your number is not listed.

242
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,702
- What did you buy?
- shoes.

243
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:05,863
Let me see.
sit down and show me.

244
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,374
- God, you are...
- I know.

245
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:15,643
I,m not showing you a shoe.

246
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:17,542
sexy.

247
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,145
- Hey, I need a favor.
- You do?

248
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:25,315
It,s for the city of New York.
I really am one of the good guys.

249
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:28,587
I,m carrying all the boroughs
but I need help with staten Island.

250
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:31,857
- You want one?
- No, I had one on Thursday.

251
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:35,298
Here,s the thing.
I gotta go back out there

252
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,938
to do a schmooze
at the capri restaurant

253
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:41,007
on sunday night
and I want you to go with me.

254
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:45,412
- And why is that?
- Because they have great Italian.

255
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,348
And also, for the record...
I can,t stop thinking about you.

256
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,680
I'll pick you up at 7.:00.

257
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,825
- No.
- Don't answer now. Think about it.

258
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:03,430
I,ll drive by at 7.:00. I,ll wait in the car.
If you come, you come.

259
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:06,533
If you don,t, no pressure.
Wear the shoes.

260
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,536
These. pass them.

261
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,973
That saturday, when I was unable to
take Miranda to her laser surgery

262
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:19,636
due to a looming column deadline,
she didn,t call steve.

263
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:22,715
she decided to take things
into her own hands.

264
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,944
Who needs a man to hold your hand,
when you have cab fare

265
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:29,113
and a black marker
to write down emergency numbers?

266
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,781
And while Miranda
was under the knife,

267
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,396
charlotte was having her first glass
of white wine with her white knight.

268
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:38,999
I did the Hasty Pudding show
a couple of times, to blow off steam.

269
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:41,259
My friend Tom
says that Harvard is still

270
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:44,701
the most aggressive place he,s seen.
And he,s a trader.

271
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,865
- Not Tom Kennedy?
- Yes, do you know Tom?

272
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:52,877
He,s a great guy. And his wife.
That,s my idea of a perfect marriage.

273
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,207
Totally.

274
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,783
charlotte nodded, thinking what
a nice, sweet, handsome,

275
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,716
funny, great couple they made.

276
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:02,687
Excuse me,
you just bumped into her chair.

277
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:06,520
- A little crowded.
- Yes, but you bumped her chair.

278
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,719
You should say you,re sorry.

279
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,263
- It,s oK.
- No, it,s not oK.

280
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:15,869
- That,s no way to treat a lady.
- Lighten up. It,s brunch.

281
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:26,878
charlotte realized that her date wasn,t
a man who came to women,s rescue,

282
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,845
he was a man who liked to start fights.

283
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:32,485
- Excuse me, sir...
- You want a piece of me?

284
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,182
And just like that,

285
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:38,315
charlotte,s white knight
changed into a white nightmare.

286
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:42,819
Miss Hobbes, your friend is here.

287
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,399
- carrie?
- Actually no, it,s me.

288
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:49,159
carrie thought you might need
some help. oK?

289
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:53,068
I,m on valium, everything,s oK.

290
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:57,168
- Here, give me your hand.
- I,m good.

291
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,976
Just don,t let me hit the door frame
and never mention these goggles.

292
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:10,147
one cab ride and two sleeping pills
later, steve put Miranda to bed.

293
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,759
All right. Give me your leg.

294
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,089
No, this leg. I want this leg.

295
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:19,131
stop! No rescue.

296
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,600
Fine, oK. All right!
Put your feet in, sleeping Beauty.

297
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:33,613
The next morning, after what felt like
a hundred years, Miranda awoke.

298
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:46,157
And for the first time in her life,
she sawthings clearly.

299
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:04,875
That night, Mr. July invited samantha
to come down and hang with him

300
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,071
while he worked the sunday shift.

301
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:11,941
Hello? Where is everyone?

302
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,489
The idea being in a firehouse
filled with a calendar hot firemen,

303
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:20,150
was a fantasy, samantha felt,
whose time had definitely come.

304
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:21,385
Boys!

305
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,601
This was not the firehouse fantasy
samantha had in mind.

306
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:42,048
samantha. I just put a pot of chilli on.
come on, sit down.

307
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:45,242
come on, get up.
Make a move for sam.

308
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:49,451
I,ll be right back.

309
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,559
samantha,s rescue fantasy
was suddenly something

310
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:54,924
she needed to be rescued from.

311
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:05,333
- It,s me, leave a message.
- Hey, I,m still down here in the car.

312
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:09,866
I,ll wait ten more seconds
and then I,ll go alone.

313
00:22:10,044 --> 00:22:17,177
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, poor me...

314
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:24,019
five, four, three, two...

315
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:29,755
...one. one and a half,
sometimes a girl needs a half.

316
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:34,733
oK, that was my best shot,
you,re not coming.

317
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,096
so long... vote!

318
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:56,717
- I don,t knowwhat I,m doing.
- oK.

319
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:02,454
I,m standing here, fully dressed,
watching that politician guy

320
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,326
drive off to staten Island
without me. Why?

321
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,266
- You hate staten Island?
- Don,t think so. Any other ideas?

322
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:14,401
Just say it.

323
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:18,478
Big. You,re terrified
of getting hurt again.

324
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:22,082
There it was. The phrase single,
independent women in their thirties

325
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,344
are never supposed to think.
Let alone say out loud.

326
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,750
oK, gotta go.

327
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:30,218
Miranda was right.

328
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:33,384
I was like a woman frozen
on the ledge of a building on fire.

329
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:36,394
I,d been so burned
in my last relationship,

330
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:39,728
I was afraid to leap off
into the next one.

331
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,241
Excuse me for a second.

332
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:01,246
- Hey. How did you get here?
- Ferry.

333
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:04,186
- All alone?
- I,m very independent.

334
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:08,953
- I can see that.
- And this isn,t a date.

335
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,757
I'm a concerned citizen.

336
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:13,594
A woman on my block
won,t pick up after her poodle.

337
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:17,568
I,ll see what I can do.
can I take your coat?

338
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:24,612
And, Mr. President,
it was a bad break-up.

339
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:28,112
so I need to take this slow.

340
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,348
somewhere between
the chilli and half-time,

341
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:37,822
samantha decided if she wanted
her firehouse fantasy to happen,

342
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,756
she,d have to make it happen.

343
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:41,792
Up here.

344
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:49,365
Nice pole.
Wanna see it again?

345
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:50,526
Yeah.

346
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:58,640
samantha rode the pole
a couple of times that night.

347
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:05,845
Why are these boots set up like this?

348
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:07,955
so we,ll be ready
at a moment,s notice.

349
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,289
Well, I should be a fireman,
because I am always ready to go.

350
00:25:16,964 --> 00:25:19,364
We,ve got a job.

351
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,896
Get out of my gear.
Get the fuck out of my gear!

352
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,475
Let,s go!
Move, lady, it,s a fuckin, fire!

353
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,809
I,m coming.

354
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:50,622
samantha learned there,s
quite a difference

355
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:53,959
between a rescue fantasy
and a rescue reality.

356
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:01,437
It,s getting late.
Are you sure I can,t give you a ride?

357
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:04,577
No, I,m good.

358
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:09,943
You go...
You go and do your thing.

359
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:12,142
Do I get your vote?

360
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:20,087
Too fast?

361
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,697
My God, you,re so sexy.
come home with me.

362
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:27,925
Kissing is enough.

363
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:30,127
It,s enough for tonight, really.

364
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:44,710
oh, shit. It,s almost 12:00,
I,m gonna miss the last ferry.

365
00:26:58,132 --> 00:26:59,759
Wait!

366
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:05,064
Wait!

367
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,843
I lost my choo.

368
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:29,995
Need a ride?

369
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:35,366
He didn,t have a white horse,

370
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:39,269
but he did have a BMW
with a working heater.

371
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:43,639
so I guess, sometimes a woman
absolutely has to be rescued.

372
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:49,340
- You,re taking me home and that,s it.
- That,s it... for tonight.

373
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:57,151
Now, any idea
howwe get the fuck off this island?

374
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:59,087
oK, make a right.

375
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,629
And sometimes, a woman absolutely
has to rescue a man.

376
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:08,258
At least, that,s how it ends
in this staten Island fairytale.
