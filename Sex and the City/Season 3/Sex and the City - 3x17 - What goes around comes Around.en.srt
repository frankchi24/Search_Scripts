1
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,556
Here goes, Charles.

2
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,664
Two months into her marriage,

3
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:52,426
Charlotte's life seemed
to be a bed of roses.

4
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:55,570
That's what it looked like
to an onlooker.

5
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:57,695
My boys have been
playing each other

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,172
since prep school.

7
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,367
They're still not tired of it.

8
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:04,535
Let the girls play.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,411
She's wearing pastels.
It's whites only.

10
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:12,384
We can make an exception
this one time.

11
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:15,256
Your father would roll over

12
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,723
in his grave if he heard you.

13
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:20,054
Charlotte hasn't been issued

14
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,254
a copy of the MacDougal house rules.

15
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:24,490
No, but it's time I got one.

16
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,293
It's next to the Bible,

17
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:27,993
on your bed stand.

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,398
Funny.

19
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:32,039
Tradition is a very undervalued virtue.

20
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,802
Marrying a MacDougal

21
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:36,501
is marrying history.

22
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:39,841
Yes. I guess I better go change.

23
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:44,076
Charlotte had no interest in hearing
any more about the family history.

24
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:46,847
Her history with Trey
was depressing enough.

25
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:51,982
After a few half-baked attempts at
a sex life, Trey seemed to give up.

26
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:55,858
The only place he even tried to score
was on the tennis court.

27
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:03,967
- Good morning.
- Morning.

28
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:08,032
Beautiful roses.

29
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,111
Thank you.

30
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:28,760
I don't knowwhat it is.
I'm strangely drawn to him.

31
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:33,196
- You knowthe man can plough.
- He had the most intoxicating scent.

32
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:38,772
Like sweat mixed with something,
something sweet yet pungent.

33
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,672
- Manure?
- And these full, sensuous lips.

34
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:46,941
- Does he water plants in Manhattan?
- I can't be looking at gardeners.

35
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:51,314
Why be in the suburbs,
if you're not gonna fuck a gardener?

36
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:54,320
He was so tanned and muscular.

37
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,826
The sweat ran down from his chest
onto his perfectly defined stomach.

38
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:05,366
You read Harlequin Romances
in school, haunts you forever.

39
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,893
Whatever you do, don't look up.

40
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:27,486
Oh, my God, did you see
the way she looked at me?

41
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:29,886
Did you see the look
her friend shot us?

42
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:33,654
- Contempt, like I was Pol Pot.
- He's dead.

43
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:37,492
- She wishes I was.
- Who does she think she is?

44
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,065
Big's wife.

45
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:43,563
That was awful. I can't believe
that there is a person in New York

46
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,207
who could hate me that much.

47
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,969
Oh, God.

48
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:52,739
I was so devastated
by Natasha's withering look

49
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:56,440
that I decided
my only recourse was to go shopping.

50
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:59,348
I took a wrong turn
looking for the right shoes,

51
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:03,981
and south of Houston Street
I literally lost my direction.

52
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:09,358
Excuse me,
I knowthis sounds ridiculous.

53
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,295
Can you tell me
which way is West Broadway?

54
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,525
- Give me your bag.
- What?

55
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,001
Your bag.

56
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:20,231
- It's a baguette.
- Let me have it.

57
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,071
I couldn't believe it.
15 years in New York,

58
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:25,940
and when the city was getting safe,
I got mugged.

59
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,413
- Is this for real?
- Your watch and your ring.

60
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,415
Jesus.

61
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:33,020
- This won't...
- Come on.

62
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:37,648
- And your Manolo Blahniks.
- What?

63
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,187
- No.
- Give me your Blahniks.

64
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:45,390
They weren't just after money.
They were after fashion.

65
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,092
Please, sir, they're my favorite pair.

66
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:52,832
I got them half price at a sample sale.

67
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,202
Thanks.

68
00:04:56,645 --> 00:05:01,605
Somebody stop him,
he took my strappy sandals.

69
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:03,580
Somebody...

70
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:05,719
Gross!

71
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:10,280
I've been robbed!

72
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,060
I've been robbed.

73
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,696
He said, "Give me your Blahniks",
which I thought was a joke.

74
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:31,301
Then I'm barefoot on a sidewalk
in the middle of summer.

75
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:35,348
Anything other than the watch,
the bag, the ring, and the shoes?

76
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,313
My dignity.

77
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:43,655
- God, are you all right?
- I'm fine. Thanks for coming.

78
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:46,259
- I can't believe he took your shoes.
- I know.

79
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,454
- Probably got trichinosis.
- You only get that from pork.

80
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:53,056
I'm sure I stepped
on a piece of it somewhere.

81
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,473
Detective Stevens, this is my friend,
my lawyer, Miranda Hobbes.

82
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:02,474
Nice to meet you.
Any chance of catching this guy?

83
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,043
We hope so.

84
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:08,876
Maybe you can come with me
and read him his Miranda rights.

85
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,851
- Sorry, that was lame.
- It was funny. A little cop humor.

86
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:16,617
- Are you Irish?
- No. Why?

87
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,987
You have beautiful red hair.

88
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:23,593
Anybody can be Irish
with the right colorist.

89
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:28,464
Very funny. A sense of humor,
I like that in a lawyer. It's very rare.

90
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:34,272
I'll get back to you
as soon as I have something.

91
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:37,276
- Can I have your card?
- Sure.

92
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:39,914
- Just in case.
- Sure.

93
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,216
Thanks.

94
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,516
I can't wear these.

95
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,245
I'll call you.

96
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:55,724
I don't understand.
I get mugged, and you get him?

97
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,922
I guess that's my karma.

98
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,001
He said he'll call.
It doesn't mean he will.

99
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,661
What are you talking about?
The man was smitten with you.

100
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,335
He probably wants free legal advice.
That's generally my karma.

101
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:14,881
Samantha discovered that her number
had been passed around as well.

102
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:18,245
This is a message for Sam Jones.
If you're getting this, it's Brian.

103
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,618
I'll see you tomorrow around 10:00.
Can't wait. Later.

104
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:27,694
Sam, are you there?
This is Rob, Mike's friend.

105
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:33,199
You don't know me, but I'll be there
tomorrowwith some party favorites.

106
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,312
- Hello, Sam?
- Yes, this is Sam.

107
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,540
- Sam Jones?
- Yes. Who is this?

108
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:52,619
The Sam Jones who's having
the big party tomorrow night?

109
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:55,621
Exactly who is this Sam Jones?

110
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,226
And where is this fabulous party?

111
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:03,024
The next evening,
Miranda had a date with my detective.

112
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:15,601
I'm having an anxiety attack.

113
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:19,042
The most gorgeous man I've met
is in my living room.

114
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:21,978
- I can't figure out what to wear.
- Breathe.

115
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,641
Shut your eyes,
and go with your first instinct.

116
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,224
I've been in here for 20 minutes.
By now he thinks I'm a freak.

117
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:37,229
I'll be right there.

118
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,965
What are you so worked up about?

119
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:45,368
He's too good-looking for me.
I don't have outfits that go with Hunk.

120
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,804
Wait. Maybe this is karma.

121
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:51,776
- You're getting what you deserve.
- Right.

122
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,883
Maybe after years of odd men,
the universe is throwing me a bone.

123
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,110
If you're lucky, a boner as well.

124
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:03,316
- OK, I can do this.
- Now go and have fun.

125
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,586
Tell Detective Stevens,
if he sees a woman

126
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:12,360
wearing pink suede Blahnik sandals,
bring her in for questioning.

127
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:23,701
While I ascribed thoughts of karma
to fortune cookie psychology,

128
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,714
I wondered, does a string of bad dates
equal one good one?

129
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,249
And will treating someone badly
in one relationship ensure

130
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,116
that you'll be treated badly
in the next?

131
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,986
Does everything that goes around
come around?

132
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,027
If so, will it come around
to bite you in the ass?

133
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:45,928
Is there such a thing as
relationship karma?

134
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:53,473
Later, I accompanied Samantha
to a party thrown by Sam Jones.

135
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:56,304
I can't believe we're going
to the party of a total stranger.

136
00:09:56,478 --> 00:09:59,345
It's not a total stranger,
we do share the same name.

137
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:01,641
Why are you walking so slow?

138
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:04,944
I keep waiting for someone
to jump out and steal my bra.

139
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,454
If the guy's a loser, I'll tell him
to stop having his friends call me,

140
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:13,424
and we'll go for dinner. If not,
who knows? His friend sounded cute.

141
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:16,120
- How can you tell over the phone?
- I can.

142
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:19,927
Besides, Washington Square -
very money address.

143
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,969
I feel like there's
some cosmic purpose to all this.

144
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,937
It's too much of a coincidence.

145
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:31,568
What was the cosmic purpose
of my getting snubbed by Natasha?

146
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:36,376
If I told you I had information
about Big and Natasha,

147
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:40,180
would you consider it cosmic
or a random act of gossip?

148
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,289
I'd have to hear it first.

149
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:49,529
Natasha left Big. It's over.
She's back working for Ralph Lauren.

150
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:53,395
Oh, my God. Who told you that?

151
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:58,301
- A little bird I fucked at Ralph Lauren.
- You waited 15 blocks to tell me that?

152
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,236
I wanted you to have fun.

153
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:03,673
I can't believe I'm responsible
for breaking up their marriage.

154
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:07,906
You're not. It probably wouldn't
have worked anyway.

155
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:12,247
- I don't think I could feel any worse.
- Here we are.

156
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,954
- It's a dorm.
- Look at that, I feel worse.

157
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,467
Do you think
these cute boys are still in college?

158
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,160
Yes.

159
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:35,970
I'm going to find Sam Jones,
and then we're outta here.

160
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:41,279
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I can find Sam Jones?

161
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,626
- Sam Jones?
- Yeah. Who are you?

162
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:57,060
- Sam Jones.
- Excuse me?

163
00:11:57,232 --> 00:12:00,292
It appears that we have
a problem here.

164
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:05,963
We have the same name,
and I'm getting all your fucking calls.

165
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:10,635
If you're getting all my "fucking" calls,
that explains why I'm still a virgin.

166
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:15,844
Samantha wondered what message
the universe was sending her,

167
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:17,985
but Miranda had no doubt.

168
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,451
This was fun,
and I would invite you in,

169
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:23,489
but you've been in,
and I have a huge day tomorrow,

170
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:29,459
which isn't to say I wouldn't like to
see you again. I would, if you'd like...

171
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:39,106
I'll call you.

172
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:52,580
She felt like she had
just hit the cosmic jackpot.

173
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,017
Please don't tell anyone
we were here.

174
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,218
Some of those boys were cute.

175
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,762
- Some of them were young enough...
- Don't you dare say it.

176
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:07,060
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Excuse me, Mom.

177
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,940
Cab!

178
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,377
Natasha fell down the stairs,
now I fall down the stairs.

179
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:21,674
This is an open and shut case
of karmic retribution.

180
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,047
- It was an accident.
- This was not an accident.

181
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,279
Yesterday, I get mugged,

182
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:31,755
now I can't even get a taxi - and I can
always get a taxi. My karma is shot.

183
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:35,659
If everything happens for a reason,
why am I getting calls for Sam Jones?

184
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,630
- What's the karmic connection?
- I only know about my own karma.

185
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:42,099
Maybe I should fuck that virgin

186
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,671
and give him the great first-time
experience that I never had.

187
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,071
That's not karma,
that's statutory rape.

188
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,772
Here, here.

189
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:54,471
Come on.

190
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,014
What's up?

191
00:13:56,184 --> 00:14:01,588
Across town, Charlotte was getting
a message of her own.

192
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,456
Wake up.

193
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:45,626
You had a nightmare.

194
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:54,806
You're all wet.

195
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:02,044
Later that week, my knee still hurting
from my trip down the stairs,

196
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,879
I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

197
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:09,649
- Ralph Lauren, Natasha's desk.
- I'd like to speak to Natasha, please.

198
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:13,624
- It's Carrie Bradshaw calling.
- What's this regarding?

199
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:16,764
- It's personal.
- Hold.

200
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:20,697
I didn't know howto tell an assistant
it was of cosmic significance.

201
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:23,063
- She's in a meeting.
- I'll hold.

202
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:26,833
I don't mean to be rude,
but you'll be holding forever.

203
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,977
OK then, I'll hold forever.

204
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:33,671
This wasn't gonna be easy.
I had tough karma to overcome.

205
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:41,585
The next week,
Charlotte flirted with her own karma.

206
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:46,056
Where did you get
such a green thumb?

207
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:50,664
Runs in the family. We're gardeners
for three generations.

208
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:53,733
What a wonderful tradition.

209
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,034
I'm Charlotte, by the way. Trey's wife.

210
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:01,072
I know. I'm Burt.

211
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,879
These roses are so beautiful.
What kind are they?

212
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,280
A special hybrid of American Beauty.

213
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,682
They're very fragrant.

214
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:20,786
Charlotte's karma flirted back
in a most unexpected way.

215
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:40,547
Samantha was working out
some karmic issues of her own.

216
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:43,650
I came over to apologize
for all those calls.

217
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,682
Thank you.
Anything else?

218
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:51,950
I've been waiting
for a woman like you my whole life.

219
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,890
You are the hottest thing
I've ever seen.

220
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,742
Slow down.

221
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,616
Oh, Lord. Oh, my Lord!

222
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:27,124
Here we go.

223
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,174
That was awesome.

224
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,249
Yes, it was.

225
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,251
Sam?

226
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:58,188
- Yes, Sam?
- I think I love you.

227
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:03,455
Honey, that wasn't love.

228
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,861
That was sex.

229
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:09,169
No, ma'am. I...

230
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,361
I love you.

231
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,807
Time to move.

232
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,515
- Do I have to?
- Oh, yes. I've got stuff to do.

233
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:30,718
Goodbye to the sweetest lips
I've ever kissed.

234
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,326
Bye-bye.

235
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:40,393
Later, the MacDougals
were enjoying their cocktail hour,

236
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:43,799
which generally lasted
from 5:00pm to last man standing.

237
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:47,737
- I beat you three sets in a row.
- We didn't finish.

238
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:51,140
- It was getting dark as you recall.
- Stop bickering.

239
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:53,336
- Sandwiches, ma'am?
- No.

240
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:55,004
No, thank you.

241
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:58,542
I certainly had an interesting day.

242
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:03,588
I went riding. In the afternoon,
I took a walk around the property

243
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,784
and saw Charlotte
kissing the gardener.

244
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:13,663
Charlotte, you're a MacDougal now.

245
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:26,041
Samantha found that the universe
had sent her many messages.

246
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:29,206
You have 35 new messages.

247
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:33,444
It's Sam Jones. call me.
I can't stop thinking about you.

248
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:40,221
I have to see you tonight.
It's really important.

249
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:46,491
Sam, it's Sam. I don't think
I can live without you, OK?

250
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:55,109
Are you there, babe? I have to see
you tonight. It's really important.

251
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,869
OK, Sam. It's Sam.

252
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:04,313
Across town, Miranda met
her karmic treasure for dinner.

253
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:07,045
After ten years,
I made partner two months ago.

254
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,951
Or was it three? I'm losing track.

255
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,887
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

256
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,359
- Can I get you another drink?
- Double vodka martini, please.

257
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:20,433
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine.

258
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:24,736
- Would you care to order?
- Could we have a minute?

259
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:28,104
Take your time.

260
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:32,940
I thought about law school.
I loved Columbo so much as a kid...

261
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:37,676
Miranda realized that every woman
was staring at her date.

262
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:41,184
Your friend is the typical case
that I see on the job.

263
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:44,950
It's not as exciting as you might think.
It's not homicide...

264
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:51,622
She knewwhat they were thinking -
why is that attractive man with her?

265
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,859
If your friend hadn't lost her shoes,
I wouldn't be here.

266
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:58,199
There you go.

267
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:00,203
Thank you.

268
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:04,901
She drank to feel better about herself.

269
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:17,151
Six vodka martinis later,
she was feeling pretty damn good.

270
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:20,317
- You're hot.
- And you're a little drunk.

271
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:23,327
I'm fine. I'm great.

272
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,063
Hot, hot, hot.

273
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:30,726
You may be the most beautiful man
that I've ever been with.

274
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,930
You're not bad yourself.

275
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:37,737
I'm no Mena Suvari,
but I'm great in bed.

276
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:48,018
When Trey didn't come to bed,
Charlotte went looking for him.

277
00:21:57,064 --> 00:22:01,296
- What are you doing out here?
- Improving my serve.

278
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:07,063
Stop. You're upset,
and what I did was so wrong.

279
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:09,641
- I'm sorry.
- What can I say?

280
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,711
I'm unable to meet your needs,
so from time to time,

281
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,011
as much as I detest it,
I'll have to look the other way.

282
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,653
I don't want a husband
who looks the other way.

283
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:24,518
I want a husband who makes me
not want to kiss the gardener.

284
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,631
No marriage is perfect.

285
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:43,133
So much of what we have
is wonderful.

286
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,713
We can have separate lives
and still be together.

287
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:50,612
It's totally acceptable.

288
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:53,754
As Charlotte looked at
her perfect husband

289
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:57,085
at their family's
perfect country house,

290
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:59,522
she realized
the one thing that was missing

291
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:03,596
was that perfect connection
with an imperfect person.

292
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:11,135
When we get back to the city,
I think we should separate for a while.

293
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,106
All righty.

294
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:27,115
Seven unreturned phone calls,
and still no response from Natasha.

295
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:31,156
Buddhists believe you pay for what
you do wrong in this life in the next.

296
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:35,455
I knewwhat I'd done. I just didn't think
I could wait a lifetime to be forgiven.

297
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:48,500
The next morning, Miranda woke up
with the worst hangover of her life.

298
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,441
Detective Stevens?

299
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:06,621
On her hall table, she discovered that
Detective Stevens had left a number...

300
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:10,192
...for her local AA chapter.

301
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:14,059
Samantha got her karmic retribution.

302
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:17,136
I love you, Sam Jones.

303
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:21,001
In screwing Sam Jones,
she wound up screwing herself.

304
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,439
I love you, Sam Jones.

305
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:31,715
A few days later, Charlotte came
home to her old apartment.

306
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:37,290
It was good fortune that she had only
sublet it, not to mention good sense.

307
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:43,697
Not wanting to come back
in my next life as a dung beetle,

308
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:46,890
I asked Samantha's assistant
to pump Natasha's assistant

309
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:50,036
to find out
where she was having lunch.

310
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:03,309
I need to talk to you.

311
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:06,577
- I'm gonna scream.
- I'm only gonna stay a minute.

312
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:08,881
I tried to call you at work, but...

313
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,421
Anyway, it's not important.

314
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:17,120
Can I have a sip of this?

315
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:28,269
Thanks.

316
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:36,511
I heard about your marriage.

317
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:42,322
It's just so terrible.

318
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:45,982
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

319
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:50,495
If there was something
I could do to take it away, I would.

320
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:51,961
But I can't.

321
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:58,270
I came here today because
I needed to say how sorry I am.

322
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:02,968
I am deeply sorry
for what I did to you.

323
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:05,604
It was wrong.

324
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,472
I'm sorry.

325
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,217
Are you through?

326
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:19,291
Yes. Thank you for listening.

327
00:26:23,063 --> 00:26:25,054
Wait.

328
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,063
I'm sorry, too.

329
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:31,337
You are?

330
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:35,498
Yes. I'm sorry about it all.

331
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:41,908
I'm sorry he moved to Paris
and fell in love with me.

332
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:44,812
I'm sorry that we ever got married.

333
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:49,282
I'm sorry he cheated on me with you,

334
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:53,620
and I'm sorry that I pretended
to ignore it for as long as I did.

335
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:57,987
I'm sorry I found you in my apartment,

336
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,895
fell down the stairs
and broke my tooth.

337
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,001
I'm very sorry
that after much painful dental surgery

338
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:09,631
this tooth is still
a different color than this tooth.

339
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:16,116
Finally, I'm sorry that you felt
the need to come down here.

340
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,616
Not only have you
ruined my marriage,

341
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:23,586
you've ruined my lunch.

342
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:30,393
That's just what I had to say.

343
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,697
I was just leaving.

344
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:43,603
My actions had set into motion
a karmic chain of events

345
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:46,678
that put Natasha
back on the singles market.

346
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:49,645
As if single women
didn't have it hard enough.

347
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:04,795
Somewhere out there,
Big was alone again.

348
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:07,433
The universe may not
always play fair,

349
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:11,093
but at least it's got
a hell of a sense of humor.
