1
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:03,141
-Yes?
- Room service.

2
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:10,412
We've got to stop meeting like this.

3
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,952
You've been waiting
your whole life to say that.

4
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,554
I have to be some place
in three hours.

5
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:24,491
Why is your skin so soft?

6
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,930
When Dickens wrote, "It was the best

7
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:29,570
"of times, it was the worst of times",

8
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:31,763
he must have been having an affair

9
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,771
with his married ex-boyfriend.

10
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:42,710
Yeah?

11
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:44,044
It's me.

12
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:49,317
You can't keep changing the time.
I have a schedule too.

13
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,049
Fine. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,787
- Let's get those panties off.
- I have to put my diaphragm in.

15
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,931
I have to be at work in 40 minutes.

16
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:58,623
I know.

17
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:02,425
our affair like our hotels
had gone from elegant with crystal

18
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:05,437
to seedy with plastic cups.

19
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:09,400
cracker?

20
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:20,445
God, it's hot in here,
and the windows don't even open.

21
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:25,082
I hate those sliding air strip things.

22
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:27,418
I need air.

23
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:29,530
You picked the hotel.

24
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:34,065
Because it's on 56th and 8th,
where nobody knows us.

25
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:37,433
- 56th and 8th is safe.
- I don't give a fuck who sees us.

26
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,938
Yes, you do. I do, too.
You want people to get hurt?

27
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:44,574
This room smells like take-out curry.

28
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,786
It's too hot, I can't do this.

29
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:01,588
Are you saving it for your boyfriend?

30
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:03,889
carrie.

31
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:07,660
No. You don't talk to me that way.

32
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,333
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:16,275
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:18,071
Jesus.

35
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:23,215
How did we get here?

36
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:28,213
Who are we?

37
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,834
- There you go.
- Thanks.

38
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,007
I have to tell you something.

39
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:50,270
You won't like it. I'd rather tell anyone
but you, but I have to.

40
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:51,845
oK.

41
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,914
- Because I need your help.
- oK.

42
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,745
I'm having an affair with Big.

43
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,251
I think my heart just stopped.

44
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:04,620
Also, I'm smoking again.
I'm smoking and sleeping with Big.

45
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,818
Feel free to delete me
out of your Palm Pilot.

46
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,555
- Give me one.
- Really?

47
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:14,031
- I think I need it.
- You are such a good friend.

48
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,760
Don't inhale.

49
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,039
Say you don't hate me.

50
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,942
- I don't.
- Thank you. If only I didn't hate me.

51
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:29,639
- How long has it been going on?
- Forever.

52
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:32,013
Actual time - three weeks.

53
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,384
I'm in the middle of this,
and I can't see.

54
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:39,459
I need you to yank me out of it.
Say stuff to yank me out of it.

55
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:43,996
- What about Aidan?
- Exactly. What about Aidan?

56
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:47,498
What about him?
I would die if he found out.

57
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:52,368
Big's acting jealous. I'm afraid
he'll call him or do something stupid.

58
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,805
- He's threatened to tell Natasha.
- What did you think would happen?

59
00:04:55,977 --> 00:05:00,311
I didn't think. I just did.
I'm terrified we've messed it up

60
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:02,643
and it can never be
what it was supposed to be.

61
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:07,720
- It's a big mess.
- Take it easy, oK?

62
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:12,256
I'm confused. Does he only want me
because he can't have me?

63
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,520
- Yes.
- How do you really feel?

64
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:17,563
Forget about him.
What do you want?

65
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:20,758
I want everyone
to get out of this without getting hurt.

66
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:24,063
- That's realistic.
- Why not?

67
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:28,335
You've heard stories about affairs
where people realise

68
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,341
how great their other relationship is

69
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,740
and end it without
anyone being the wiser.

70
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,280
I don't watch
"Lifetime Television For Women".

71
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:40,454
You have to just stop. oK?
Just stop.

72
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:42,954
I am. I'm stopping.

73
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:45,991
- I am.
- Good.

74
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,389
- Who else knows about this?
- Samantha.

75
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,588
- And God.
- Not charlotte?

76
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:54,428
If the-world-according-to-bride knew,
she'd kill me.

77
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:58,231
At least you wouldn't
have to be a bridesmaid.

78
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:02,035
While Miranda was trying not
to judge me on the Upper East Side,

79
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,613
Samantha was judging the crowd
at a hot spot on the Lower West Side.

80
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:12,310
It was a typical mix - ten per cent
Wall Street, ten per cent real estate,

81
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,252
ten per cent she'd slept with.

82
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,783
His name was Tom Reymi.

83
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,326
Excuse me.

84
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:27,992
A Manhattan legend - straight, single,
and sexually very active.

85
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:29,932
The male samantha.

86
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:33,767
- Hi. I'm Tom Reymi.
- I knowwho you are. I'm...

87
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:36,308
- I knowwho you are.
- It's about time we met.

88
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,744
We knowthe same people,
we should go to dinner, blah blah.

89
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,974
- Wanna fuck?
- Under a minute.

90
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:47,713
- You could qualify for the olympics.
- My place is...

91
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:55,854
- Do you swing?
- Swing?

92
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,056
You mean with other couples?

93
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,859
No.

94
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,532
Swing.

95
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:08,472
oh my, so cirque du Soleil.

96
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:10,736
You haven't fucked
till you've fucked in the swing.

97
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,211
I've always wanted to run off
and join the circus.

98
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:18,881
So, Samantha...

99
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,544
when was your last AIDS test?

100
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,485
So much for foreplay.

101
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:28,822
Anyone who has as much sex as us
has to ask, right?

102
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:31,625
I was tested again three weeks ago.

103
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,063
I'm good to go. How about you?

104
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:37,068
Samantha didn't know
howto tell Tom Reymi

105
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,968
that the only sex test she'd ever
taken was the cosmo Quiz.

106
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:43,008
You have been tested, right?

107
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:45,942
No, but I'm very healthy.

108
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,880
- You haven't been tested. Why?
- I'm a busy girl.

109
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:54,182
I got hard in that club
just from looking at you.

110
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:59,452
We both know what's gonna happen
when we get in that swing.

111
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:04,428
I can't fuck you or eat you how I want,
unless I know it's safe.

112
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,900
Samantha, you should do me.

113
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,096
I am as good as they say.

114
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:18,269
Samantha had to figure out just
how much she wanted to do Reymi.

115
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:23,409
The pink Post-its
are for the gowns I like.

116
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:26,213
Green is for the gowns I really like.

117
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:28,685
Yellow is for the gowns
I don't know if I like.

118
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:33,623
Kill me, please.
Drag a sharp object across my throat.

119
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:38,323
Stop. You take "Modern Bride".
Samantha, "New York Bride".

120
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:42,401
- And I'll take "Annoying Bride"?
- Page 211. Tell me what you think.

121
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,471
- okey-dokey.
- cute purse.

122
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,167
There's no time for purses.
This is gown specific.

123
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,677
- Is your theme a Nazi wedding?
- Page 211.

124
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:57,614
- It's pretty. I like the flowers.
- Me, too. And I like that satin bow.

125
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,982
Have you all had an AIDS test?

126
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:03,947
Good morning.
Where did that come from?

127
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:09,062
I met this very hot guy. He won't
sleep with me unless I have a test.

128
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:14,497
We're looking at wedding gowns.
could you not talk about AIDS now?

129
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:18,230
- You've never had an Hlv test?
- No. Have you?

130
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:22,103
- Two.
- Three.

131
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:27,510
- How about upper length gloves?
- How can you not have had a test?

132
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:31,082
She doesn't mean that
the way it sounds. It's just...

133
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,685
Why not?

134
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:36,847
I always practise safe sex.

135
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:39,084
All right, I'm terrified.

136
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,855
- What if I have it?
- You don't have it.

137
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:45,499
Sometimes it takes me
a long time to get over a cold.

138
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,602
That's air conditioning.
Just get it over with.

139
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,262
The test is nothing. The worst part
is waiting for the results.

140
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,345
They take some people to this room,
and you knowthe news ain't good.

141
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:02,279
I sat there praying,
"Please don't take me in that room".

142
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,578
There are 1400 gowns
in this magazine.

143
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:08,745
I have only seen 600 of them.
I need help.

144
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:12,791
- You need to chill out. Hire a stylist.
- A stylist?

145
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,520
Some mignon
to do your dress bidding.

146
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,789
I can hire someone to do that?

147
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,298
This is New York.
You can hire someone to do anything.

148
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:25,131
- I'll fax you some names.
- Thank you, thank you.

149
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:28,332
If only I could hire someone
to take that test.

150
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:32,512
Later, I got thinking about safe sex.

151
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,243
odd how only when our physical life
is at risk, do we protect ourselves.

152
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,047
What about our emotional lives?

153
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,747
Wouldn't it be nice
if there was a pamphlet to warn us

154
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:48,328
what behaviour might be high risk
to ourselves or our relationships?

155
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:53,297
Even if you take precautions and
emotionally try to protect yourself,

156
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:57,871
when you crawl in bed with someone,
is sex ever safe?

157
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,940
Yeah, I know,
but that's not my problem.

158
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:06,807
The next day, Miranda experienced
a different type of high risk behaviour.

159
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:10,109
- Eat me.
- Excuse me?

160
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:11,683
Eat me.

161
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,926
Miranda was furious. It was
bad enough she had just lost a case,

162
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:23,154
but now she was being harassed
by a sandwich.

163
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:28,765
You want pasta, you go to Little Italy.
You want wedding, you go Wang.

164
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,929
You want the perfect wedding dress,
go to Anthony Marantino, stylist.

165
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:35,132
Where is that sales girl?

166
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:39,575
For these prices, we should be
pulling her nose out of our asses.

167
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,011
Hello, someone. Let's go.

168
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:47,712
charlotte was thrilled. Anthony was
like the pushy mother she never had.

169
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,154
Go, go, go...

170
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,727
I love them all.

171
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:04,361
Duchess satin with the lace applique.

172
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:10,141
- The white is too white.
- No, with your skin tone...

173
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,973
Hates it. Move on.

174
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:18,552
The sharmoose, strapless,
with the net overlay.

175
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,381
Hates it.

176
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:26,685
Good bead work, though.

177
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,329
None of these are right at all.

178
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:35,998
- You're dragging!
- I hope she doesn't think I'm a bitch.

179
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,764
She's not paid to think,
but to make you happy.

180
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,104
I've been imagining my wedding dress
ever since I was a little girl.

181
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,404
I want it to be perfect.

182
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:48,242
Not for nothing.
I've done this a million times.

183
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,045
Don't worry. You'll know
the right dress when you see it.

184
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,520
Anthony.

185
00:12:57,425 --> 00:12:58,858
char.

186
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:01,352
That's it.

187
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:08,235
Across town, Samantha felt
as though she might cry as well.

188
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:12,065
- Have you had an Hlv test before?
- No.

189
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,538
Why are you taking this test?

190
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,872
I... feel...

191
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:19,875
You know, it's...

192
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:23,915
- Are you feeling all right?
- Sorry, I'm really nervous.

193
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:27,747
Relax. Just routine questions.
Nothing to be alarmed about.

194
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:31,116
oK. Thanks.

195
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,319
- Do you have sex?
- Yes.

196
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:40,092
- oral sex - give, receive?
- Yes. Yes, yes.

197
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:44,170
- Do you have anal sex?
- Yes.

198
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:47,330
- Do you swallow?
- only when surprised.

199
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:51,237
- Do you use condoms?
- Yes.

200
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:56,849
- What kind of condoms?
- Lifestyles, chic, Wet & Wild...

201
00:13:57,018 --> 00:14:01,887
- No, I meant, latex, lambskin?
- Yes. Yes.

202
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:04,752
How many sexual partners
have you had?

203
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,131
I'm counting.

204
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,366
This year?

205
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,975
While Samantha
tried to remember her sexual past,

206
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:27,638
I came face to face
with my sexual present.

207
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,781
- Stop.
- Stop what?

208
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:36,583
You're making that sound. That...

209
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:40,352
...kissing sound. It's annoying.

210
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:44,695
It's just a sound I make, I guess.

211
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:49,730
come here.
I'll try not to do it anymore.

212
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:56,737
Look, Ma, no sound.

213
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:10,817
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

214
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:17,659
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

215
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:26,101
Don't go.

216
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:29,731
I don't get it.
You used to like that sound I make.

217
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,105
I love that sound.

218
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:40,548
- Where are you going?
- Home. I need time.

219
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:46,887
I'm in a weird place right now,
but I'll be out of it soon. I promise.

220
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,725
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,862
Say it's oK.

222
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,404
It's oK.

223
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:06,002
- What can I do?
- Nothing, it's me. It's all me.

224
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:10,912
- I just need time to figure it out.
- I'll give you room to do that.

225
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:14,451
You're not saying that
in a bad way, right?

226
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,690
No.

227
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,451
I'll be right downtown.

228
00:16:24,298 --> 00:16:27,893
Hey, buddy. call me later?

229
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:31,903
It's 1:00 in the morning.
I'll call you tomorrow.

230
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,534
Make the noise.
Please make the noise.

231
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:50,822
Good night.

232
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,721
Sorry.

233
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,587
I didn't knowwhat I was doing,

234
00:16:56,764 --> 00:17:03,033
but I was sure I had just entered
high-risk relationship behaviour.

235
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:05,432
Eat me.

236
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,939
Three days later, Miranda had
got her fill of the sandwich.

237
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,011
That's it. You're not allowed
to harass women like that.

238
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,703
Eat me.

239
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,939
We'll see about that.

240
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:24,153
- I'd like to speak to the manager.
- That's me.

241
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:30,023
That sandwich says sexually explicit
things to women as they walk by.

242
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,131
- What did he say?
- "Eat me. "

243
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,496
- Yeah, he's a sandwich.
- He didn't say it in the sandwich way.

244
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:38,103
He said it
in the sexual harassing way.

245
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,331
He's a sandwich.

246
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,374
- Eat me.
- You're brave inside your sandwich.

247
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:55,714
Then Miranda glimpsed just enough
of his full lips and shiny white teeth

248
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,552
to stop thinking about the sandwich

249
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:02,287
and start wondering
about the man inside.

250
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:04,521
I can't stop thinking about him.

251
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,825
You're turned on by a sandwich?

252
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:12,439
It's the fact that I can't see him.
It's dangerous or something.

253
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:16,406
- That is one fresh sandwich.
- His voice is so sexy.

254
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,408
He's probably a troll.

255
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:23,539
Any man who propositions a woman
from a sandwich must be a troll.

256
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:27,949
I don't know.
You think he's white meat?

257
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:34,159
That's the first laugh
I've had in weeks.

258
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:36,523
Thank the sandwich
when you have sex.

259
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,861
I can't have sex with a sandwich.
can I?

260
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,527
I never thought I'd have sex
with a married ex.

261
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:47,299
can a hoagy be that far behind?

262
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:51,501
Miranda, what the hell am I gonna do?

263
00:18:56,483 --> 00:19:01,682
As Samantha waited for her results,
she had one thought over and over.

264
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:04,416
"Don't let them take me
into that little room. "

265
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:09,086
Ms Jones, I've got your results.
Please come with me.

266
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:19,094
Samantha began to realise she was
being taken into that little room.

267
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:25,903
She was healthy.
The nurse just wanted a quiet place

268
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,049
to lecture her on safe sex practises.

269
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:35,212
Days later, somehow I found myself
back at the corner of 56th and Safeth.

270
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,450
- How much?
- Excuse me?

271
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:44,462
I've seen you here before.

272
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:47,260
For sex - how much?

273
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:53,872
I'm out of here. That Japanese
businessman thinks I'm a hooker.

274
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,338
Wait. carrie!

275
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:06,152
carrie? What are you
doing in this neighbourhood?

276
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,084
carrie, can we...

277
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:14,583
Hey.

278
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:20,727
I was doing business in the area.
We bumped into each other.

279
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:21,959
How are you?

280
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:25,900
I just checked on my wedding dress,
it's at the tailor and...

281
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:28,939
- charlotte.
- I'd better go.

282
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,508
charlotte.

283
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,111
That was that.
Now nowhere was safe.

284
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:39,013
Not even 56th and 8th.

285
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:45,981
It was a force bigger than me,
like Niagara Falls, you know?

286
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,321
No, I don't know. He's married.

287
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:53,091
- I know he's married.
- You're the other woman.

288
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:57,465
I'm not the other woman.
I'm not. I mean...

289
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:01,472
I know I am,
but I am not that woman.

290
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:04,167
Please, I feel bad enough already.

291
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:08,543
Good. Do you ever think about
how she'd feel if she found out?

292
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:11,913
- I think about it all the time.
- No, you don't.

293
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:15,317
You think about what would
happen to you, not about her.

294
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:18,686
She's just the idiot wife.
You don't know anything about her.

295
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:23,421
- I'll suffocate myself in this.
- This isn't a joke.

296
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,996
They took vows. vows he broke.

297
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:31,433
I'm getting married. Howwould
you feel if someone did this to me?

298
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:33,903
I would kill them.

299
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,613
How could you do this?
You're my maid of honour.

300
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:46,511
I'm getting out.
can I please help you pack now?

301
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:48,882
So we stood and bubble-wrapped,

302
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:52,959
the bride to be
and her maid of dishonour.

303
00:21:54,161 --> 00:22:00,361
A week of fantasising sex with the
sandwich man had gotten to Miranda.

304
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:03,697
Safe or not, she needed to see
who she was dealing with.

305
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,806
Hi. Look, this is so silly.

306
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:07,963
Eat me.

307
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:11,001
Let me see your face.

308
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:21,718
Even though he was cute,
Miranda walked away.

309
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:23,914
What did they have in common?

310
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:27,424
She was a lawyer.
He was a sandwich.

311
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:32,795
Later, at Tom Reymi's,
after a week of sheer anxiety,

312
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,336
Samantha enjoyed
the benefits of totally safe sex.

313
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:52,445
Take your time. There's stuff
in the kitchen if you're hungry...

314
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:56,350
It was the lowest of the low. I had
made love to my married ex-boyfriend

315
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,650
on his lunch hour at his apartment,

316
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:02,387
while his 25-year-old wife
was sunning herself at the Hamptons.

317
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:05,498
- Jesus.
- What?

318
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,659
could I feel any more like a hooker?

319
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:18,074
Why do you keep
doing that to yourself?

320
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:20,611
We should stop seeing each other.

321
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,707
Why?

322
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:30,089
You're married.

323
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:34,216
Hand me the phone.
I'm gonna call her right now.

324
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:37,227
Don't be ridiculous.
What are you gonna do -

325
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:41,833
call her at the beach and say
you love me and want a divorce?

326
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:45,369
You don't want me to call her
because you love that other guy.

327
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,838
- This is about that other guy.
- He has a name. It's Aidan.

328
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,773
- You have a wife, Natasha.
- Give me the phone.

329
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:54,379
You could have told her by now.

330
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:57,346
You told me not to tell her.

331
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,748
Here. call her.

332
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:08,858
If I make that call,
are you gonna be there for me?

333
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,055
Are we gonna do this, really?

334
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:18,467
I mean, out in the daylight,
no cocktails, no hotel rooms, real life?

335
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:21,369
carrie, in or out?

336
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:27,204
I need more time.

337
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:33,615
I'm calling her Monday.

338
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:37,222
I have to go.
You know howto let yourself out.

339
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:43,494
I couldn't help but wonder if I really
did knowthe way to let myself out.

340
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:52,498
charlotte was right. What did I
really know about Natasha?

341
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,040
Natasha is a woman
who likes tea roses.

342
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:04,683
Natasha collects antique sugar bowls.

343
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,046
Honey?

344
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:10,348
Natasha comes home
from the Hamptons early.

345
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:14,483
Honey, are you here?
I took the Jitney home.

346
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,855
Sweetheart?

347
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,868
Honey?

348
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:29,731
carrie. I see you.

349
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,347
Wait! I knew you were
having an affair, but not in my house.

350
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:36,709
Stop, I'm talking to you.

351
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:47,883
oh my God!

352
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:51,622
I had assumed, the one
who would be hurt would be me.

353
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:54,266
Taxi!

354
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,698
Nearest hospital.

355
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,968
Shit!

356
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:31,965
Is she all right?

357
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,267
She lost a tooth
and needed a stitch in her lip.

358
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:41,472
They had a plastic surgeon, and it
won't scar. She's scared and swollen.

359
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:44,947
Her parents are on the way.
I have to go.

360
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:50,413
Thanks for being here.

361
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,722
I'll call you.

362
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,424
For what?

363
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:02,463
We're so over.

364
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:05,537
We need a newword for "over".

365
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:09,705
carrie.

366
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,959
Surprise.
Where have you been all day?

367
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:39,468
I went to a museum.
Just walking around.

368
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:44,201
- oh, yeah? Howwas it?
- It was good.

369
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:47,643
- I'll just wash my face. I'll be right in.
- oK.

370
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,057
Somehow, I had found a way
to let myself out of the mess.

371
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:06,063
I'd made it home.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
