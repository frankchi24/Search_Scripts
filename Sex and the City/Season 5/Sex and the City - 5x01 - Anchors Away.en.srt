1
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,796
When you are single in New York,

2
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,793
there is no end to ways to fill your days.

3
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,428
Museums, parks, theatres, concert halls,

4
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,512
nightclubs and countless restaurants.

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,875
But one of the most amazing things

6
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,395
about living in New York

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,438
is that any night, you can go...

8
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,192
to Paris.

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,879
''Joy For Two'' for one.

10
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,679
Enjoy the show.

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,193
Thank you.

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,475
lt was one of those
perfect New York nights.

13
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,037
That fucking Richard.

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,952
A less than perfect day.

15
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,680
He left an ''l'm sorry'' message.

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,516
Like that makes up for eating
another woman's pussy.

17
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,557
Samantha!

18
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,670
lt's OK. Nothing has to change.

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,112
- Think of this as a big purse.
- Your purse just spit up.

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,794
You'd think after three weeks
he'd get the message.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,554
Not OK to eat
another woman's pussy.

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,109
- Samantha, Brady!
- l'm pissed off.

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,558
- What am l supposed to say?
- Call it another woman's sushi.

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,109
Fine. Richard ate her sushi.

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,397
Fish and chips would have been
an unfortunate order.

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,630
- What did you do last night?
- A movie.

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,711
- With who?
- Myself.

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,555
- On date night?
- Will we call it that in our 50s?

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,349
People would be thinking,
''That poor, pathetic girl.''

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,954
- Like how l'm looking at you now?
- What?

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,588
- You don't go out alone?
- On date night?

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,116
New York is the perfect place
to be single. The city is your date.

33
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,510
- You're dating the city?
- About 18 years.

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,638
lt's getting serious.
l think l'm in love.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,633
- Do not check your messages.
- l'm not.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,473
l wanted you to hear
his tone on my machine.

37
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,108
lf you keep participating,
you might as well call him.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,477
- l'm not participating.
- This has to stop.

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,438
lt's tragic you were in love
and it didn't work.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,913
You have to emotionally cut him
out and the sooner, the better.

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,799
Everyone knows
you only get two great loves.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,475
- Where did you get that?
- ln a magazine.

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,029
''Convenient Theories
For You Monthly''?

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,158
- What does that mean?
- When you were married,

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,313
- you believed in one great love.
- What does ''great love'' mean?

46
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,393
A love that changes you,
that shakes you to your core,

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,994
after which you're never the same.
Seriously.

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,789
There is not unlimited love
in the world. lt's rare.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,916
Way to take the edge off
a club sandwich.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,753
So far l've had one...Trey.
How many have you had?

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,514
- Zero.
- Really? What about Steve?

52
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,750
Steve's a friend,
not a core shaker.

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,275
l'm done with great love.
l'm back to great lovers.

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,750
- You?
- l refuse to define love in those terms.

55
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,629
- l had to.
- Come on, Carrie. Aidan and Big.

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,913
One, two. According to you, l'm done.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,469
No, it was a stupid article.
lt was at the dentist.

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,871
No, it's too late for that.
You said it. lt's over for me.

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,476
Here lies Carrie.
She had two loves and lots of shoes.

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,993
Fuck love.

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,310
l gave you ''sushi'', l need ''fuck''.

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,913
After a light lunch,

63
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,799
Miranda stopped
to set down a heavy load.

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,032
- You want me to carry him?
- l've just got to switch.

65
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,750
Ladies, seamen, 12 o'clock.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,798
l pray when l turn around
there are sailors.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,758
With her, you never know.

68
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,592
Oh, wow!

69
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,992
We have just spotted our first sailors.
Fleet Week has begun.

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,276
Fleet Week is that one week a year

71
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,193
when the US Naval ships dock,

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,272
and our fair city is made even fairer

73
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,989
with cute, sweet, American sailors
looking for fun.

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,119
l've been so distracted by Richard.
l almost forgot my favourite holiday.

75
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,236
- lt isn't a holiday.
- lt should be.

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,152
The antidote to Valentine's Day.

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,278
Just what l need.
l'm gonna find out about the big party.

78
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,194
- Hold on, Pearl Harbor. Not interested.
- We always have fun.

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,831
Running through Times Square
in heels, to find a sailor to kiss.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,231
That ship has sailed,
pun intended.

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,234
We have to. lt's our patriotic duty
as women of New York.

82
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,551
lf you want to do your patriotic duty
as New York women,

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,872
you will come shopping and throw
some much needed money downtown.

84
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,995
- l'm in.
- l'm in.

85
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,912
l...forgot the Snuggly.

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,594
Well, let's get you a cab home.
There's one. Taxi.

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,558
Oh, OK.

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,709
- l'll call you later?
- Overspend for me.

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,394
- OK.
- l'm OK. l've got it.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,437
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

91
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,195
l'll call you later.

92
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,239
Miranda suddenly found herself
moving slowly away from her old life.

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,394
And quickly into her new one.

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,034
Oh, baby boy. Big baby.

95
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,316
Look at that big face.

96
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,073
Here, let Magda...

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,199
l'm good. l've got it.
You keep doing the thing, the mirror.

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,318
- The nurse will put him down for a nap.
- On floor?

99
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,311
- Lina?
- ls that my big boy?

100
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,515
Hi, what are you doing here?

101
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,229
l came over to hang with B boy.
Magda let me in.

102
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,029
- Hey, champ! Want half a sandwich?
- Where'd you get...?

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,156
OK, Steve?

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,118
l can't have you hang.
l've got a schedule.

105
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,511
l've gotta get Brady down
for a nap or he won't sleep tonight.

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,830
- Lina!
- How's your nipples?

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,595
- Excuse me?
- Lina said they get sore.

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,149
Lina, would you get Brady
ready for his nap?

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,312
And don't talk to Steve
about my nipples. Thanks.

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,790
- Don't blame her. l asked.
- You asked about my nipples?

111
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,269
l talk about your nipples
to strangers all the time.

112
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,512
- Ha ha, ho ho. Bye!
- Hey, hey.

113
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,557
l came over to help.

114
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,280
l appreciate that but l've hired help.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,238
- Everything's under control.
- Thanks for the eats.

116
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,592
Have a good evening,
Mrs MacDougal.

117
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,070
Charlotte realised she may have put
great love number one behind her,

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,118
but his name was still in front of her.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,834
Break-ups. Bad for the heart,
good for the economy.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,391
lt's the bad guy again.
l'll keep calling till you agree to talk.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,916
Unless you want 20 messages
every day, meet me tonight.

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,435
l miss you.
l'll be waiting, gorgeous.

123
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,033
Right sentiment.

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,553
Sushi Samba.

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,233
Wrong restaurant.

126
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,073
Richard Wright? Right this way.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,433
Hello, gorgeous.

128
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,478
ln a wildly optimistic gesture,
l ordered you a dirty martini.

129
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,473
Dirty martini?

130
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,312
Dirty bastard.

131
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,719
l have always wanted to do that,
but l don't think l could.

132
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,156
- How did it feel?
- Fabulous.

133
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,629
But l woke up
this morning even angrier.

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,998
l need to hurt him more.
l can't be around that man. He's toxic.

135
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,675
- So, he's ''manthrax''?
- Arrogant prick!

136
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,791
l wonder what he was gonna say.

137
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,235
That he loves me,
we belong together,

138
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,356
he didn't mean to hurt me.

139
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,875
People make mistakes.
l cheated on Aidan.

140
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,996
He gave me a second chance.

141
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,071
Look how that turned out.

142
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,878
That was different.

143
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,192
- True. lt wasn't a sushi situation.
- That's another thing.

144
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,669
l'm not doing the baby talk at breakfast.

145
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,391
l signed up for friendship,
not bullshit baby brunches.

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,791
You're overreacting.
Brady won't happen every day.

147
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,315
- He'd better not.
- Miranda's still Miranda.

148
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,439
She had a baby, not a lobotomy.
She knows you're not child-friendly.

149
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,876
Don't kid yourself.
Days of ''pussy'' and ''fuck'' are gone.

150
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,871
Later that night,
l got to thinking about days gone by.

151
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,999
That carefree time when our schedules
were as open as our hearts.

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,075
The time before the baggage
and babies began to weigh us down.

153
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,310
l couldn't help wonder,

154
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,040
does that sense of adventure
still flicker inside us?

155
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,760
Or when it comes to being
carefree single girls,

156
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,480
have we missed the boat?

157
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,714
Surprise! Pain au chocolat.

158
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,157
Oh, l'm sorry.
l don't know you.

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,799
l'm Carrie. l'm a friend of...

160
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,350
Hi, this is Lina. Come in.

161
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,476
- Does she speak?
- No, l love her.

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,315
Were we supposed to do something
and l forgot it?

163
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,438
No, l had the day free
and thought l'd stop by for a chatty.

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,670
- Fatty, come on. l've gotta sit.
- Are you hungry?

165
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,592
l brought some pain au chocolat.

166
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,877
Thanks, but the only eating
l'm concerned with now is Brady.

167
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,474
- He doesn't want to eat.
- Perhaps he's anorexic.

168
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,313
- Sorry, what?
- lt's a dumb joke.

169
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,391
- What was it?
- Anorexic.

170
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,835
Oh, yeah...no.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,959
l've been trying to feed him for an hour
and he won't latch on...

172
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,588
Stop. Boring. What's up with you?

173
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,751
Well, l've been thinking about that thing

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,434
that Charlotte said in the coffee shop.

175
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,830
About the great loves?

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,070
Here we go.

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,315
So...maybe Aidan and Big
are my two great loves, now.

178
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,959
But...

179
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,590
that doesn't mean that...
that l'm always gonna feel

180
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,513
- that way about them.
- Come on, Brady. lt's right here.

181
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,990
OK, you don't want it?
Fine. Here we go.

182
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,993
There, in the middle
of my two great loves,

183
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,958
were Miranda's two great breasts.

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,519
l'm sorry. What?

185
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,398
Your breasts are huge!

186
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,516
No, what were you saying?

187
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,990
l can't even remember.
This is so frustrating.

188
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,390
- He'll eat eventually.
- No, not that.

189
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,552
This is frustrating.
l can't follow your thoughts.

190
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,597
lt's all nursing and nipples.

191
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,512
Sweetie, they're looking right at me.

192
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,319
l am not gonna become
one of those mothers

193
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,869
who cannot carry on
an adult conversation.

194
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,632
l am not.

195
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,469
Three weeks ago, l would've been
listening and saying funny things.

196
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,108
Now l'm going, ''What?''
l didn't get the anorexic joke.

197
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,637
- How easy was that?
- l'm just talking. lt's just words.

198
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,792
They're your words.
lt's not just now.

199
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,112
Could Samantha have gotten me
into that cab faster?

200
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,748
Carrie, my friendships are...

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,150
important to me.

202
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,237
We're not going anywhere.
Things will have to change a little.

203
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,356
- Fuck.
- l know.

204
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,470
But you're still one of us.

205
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,916
Only now, you're the one
with the biggest boobs.

206
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,640
Can you believe the size of my nipples?

207
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,631
l was not at all prepared.

208
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,917
l'm gonna have to find
some trauma counselling.

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,959
There. We have contact.

210
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,194
OK. l'm gonna go.
Let you concentrate on Mr Hobbes.

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,432
You don't have to go.
l can listen now. l can do it.

212
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,114
Miranda, you're a mother.

213
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,192
- But it's OK. l won't tell anyone.
- Don't.

214
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,715
What are you going to do all day?

215
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,396
First a trip to the Guggenheim
and then lunch and then...

216
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,479
- Who knows? lt's New York.
- Hot date with your city?

217
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,634
Exactly. See that? You listened
and we had the witty repartee. Bye.

218
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,758
That same afternoon,
Charlotte felt like going to a movie.

219
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,275
She called her afternoon
movie friend, Anthony.

220
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,874
Carrie says the French film
at The Paris is amazing.

221
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,271
Fuck the French. Like l need to spend
an afternoon looking at that shit.

222
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,318
- Good hat.
- Thanks. What do you want to see?

223
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,994
- Anything with Josh Hartnett.
- l don't know him.

224
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,594
He's cute, with a capital 'U'...

225
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,030
He totally checked you out.
Get his number.

226
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,353
- He's a sailor.
- l know! Hurry! He's getting away.

227
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,193
- l can't do that.
- You are so not gay.

228
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,079
- What am l going to do with him?
- Fuck him!

229
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,232
Put an end to that Park Avenue,
pink shirt, flaccid mojo

230
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,109
- you've been dragging around.
- l'm not dragging anything around.

231
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,475
l changed my name
back to York on my mailbox.

232
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,269
Good for you. Maybe you should
be thinking about a different box.

233
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,317
When did you last have sex?

234
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,516
lf you have to think, it's been too long.

235
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,911
- When was the last time...?
- 10:30 today at the gym.

236
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,072
l'm not looking for just sex.
l can have just sex.

237
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,470
l'm looking for my next great love.

238
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,676
Don't let it hit that six month mark.

239
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,070
After that, it's a sleigh ride
into menopause.

240
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,437
lf you don't put something
in there soon, it will grow over.

241
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,955
What is it with this friggin' wind?

242
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,076
As Charlotte and Anthony made a left,

243
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,392
Samantha found herself in the right
neighbourhood, Richard Wright's.

244
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,189
Here you go. Thank you. One for you.

245
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,236
Ma'am. lt's against city law
to deface public property.

246
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,277
This man said he loved me,

247
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,749
and l caught him eating
another woman's pussy.

248
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,990
Carry on, ma'am.

249
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,756
New York weather, like a man,
can be unpredictable.

250
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,154
But that's part of the fun.

251
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,392
And a New York museum, like a man,
can sometimes be closed

252
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,915
when you wish they were open.

253
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,396
That's another reason
l love New York. Just like that,

254
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,472
it can go from bad to cute.

255
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,029
Well, l guess we're not going
anywhere for a while.

256
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,153
l love the way the rain smells.

257
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,074
lf this were a French movie,
we'd fall in love and get married.

258
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,990
No, l was just pointing out
how romantic this would be in a movie.

259
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,878
l don't want to marry you.

260
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,874
OK, l do!

261
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,198
Come on. l'm kidding. We just met.
Let's wait five minutes.

262
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,275
l don't want to get married.
l was engaged last year,

263
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,192
and if l didn't want to marry him...

264
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,832
- Singles at the counter.
- l was hoping to get a table...

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,230
Singles, counter. Two! Two!

266
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,630
- OK, thank you.
- Two!

267
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,119
Who's next?

268
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,991
Several blocks later, l decided to warm
up with a bowl of matzo ball soup.

269
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,873
Come on, come on! Let's go!

270
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,235
That manager's really a prick.

271
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,472
l put up with it
because l come here all the time.

272
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,438
They know me.
l live in the neighbourhood.

273
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,956
We single gals got to have
a port in a storm. Am l right?

274
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,190
Lithium. l like to sprinkle it
on my ice cream.

275
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,558
- Ever try it?
- No, can't say that l have.

276
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,029
What kind of mood elevator
are you on?

277
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,998
l'm not on one.

278
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,631
Yeah? l used to be like you.
Then l broke up with this guy.

279
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,519
This was '82. Morty.

280
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,240
Thought somebody better
would come along.

281
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,231
Never happened.

282
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,437
Oh, l love this!

283
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,876
lf Charlotte was right,
this woman's two great loves

284
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,998
were a man named Morty
and lithium-laced ice cream.

285
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,829
After 20 minutes squatting
under the coffee shop hand dryer,

286
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,797
l realised l'd been kidding myself.

287
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,871
New York and l
didn't have the perfect relationship.

288
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,952
All right!

289
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,199
lt was dismissive, abusive,
and it made me feel desperate.

290
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,353
l was now fresh out of great loves.

291
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,031
Hey, sir!

292
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,438
Thank you.

293
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,719
Should l?

294
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,638
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Louis Laroy.

295
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,276
This is Bill Hope and Paul Watkins.

296
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,590
We'd like to invite you
to a navy party tonight.

297
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,309
- Feel free to bring some girlfriends.
- Feel very free.

298
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,038
l don't know why l was fighting it.
This will be fun!

299
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,158
Exactly what we needed.
Three single gals back on the town.

300
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,515
What's the longest
you've gone without sex?

301
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,830
You don't get that info
without dinner and a drink.

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,991
Next week will be six months.

303
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,232
Thanks. She threw me
and l lost my concentration.

304
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,153
l am gonna have sex
with a sailor tonight.

305
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,278
- She almost got me on that one.
- l have to have sex

306
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,115
to put Mrs Trey MacDougal
behind me. l'm a new Charlotte York.

307
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,670
- What about the great loves?
- Maybe that was bullshit.

308
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,478
Gotcha.

309
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,596
- How are we gonna find your sailor?
- We'll find him.

310
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,276
God bless America.

311
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,399
The important thing is
to stick together or we'll get lost.

312
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,193
Samantha! Charlotte!

313
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,114
Yeah. Oh, yeah. There.

314
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,478
And uptown, another woman found
herself in a confusing navel situation.

315
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,350
Look, Brady.
There's your belly-button.

316
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,558
Help me!

317
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,628
20 freaked out minutes later...

318
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,758
l can't do this.
l'm prepared for the expected,

319
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,071
but not the unexpected.
l can't schedule shit like this.

320
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,550
And the people you hire
won't help you!

321
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,438
Where's the cat?

322
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,117
Oh God. Steve, it's gross.

323
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,114
- Help me. lt's gross.
- Relax. l'll give you a hand.

324
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,071
He may not be a core shaker,

325
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,630
but Steve was there
when she was shaken to the core.

326
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,111
You looking for someone?

327
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,671
My girlfriends. This party's
like the Bermuda Triangle for women.

328
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,552
- That's a little sailor joke.
- You're funny.

329
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,515
- You remind me of my mom.
- Bye-bye.

330
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,877
- Evening, Miss.
- Ahoy, matey! Nice dicky.

331
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,154
Meanwhile, l had not found Charlotte,

332
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,596
but Charlotte had found an officer
who wasn't a gentleman.

333
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,392
- Show me your tits?
- l can't do that. l barely know you.

334
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,509
OK. Just show me one.
lt's an order.

335
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,719
The old Charlotte would've had him
court-martialled, but the new one...

336
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,155
- Well, officer.
- ...had a deadline.

337
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,276
lf it's an order.

338
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,232
- Jesus!
- Carrie!

339
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,356
l was just looking for you. l didn't...

340
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,195
- This is Officer Matt Cook.
- l'll see you later.

341
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,954
l can't do this. Let's just talk.

342
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,677
lt's your call, Ma'am.

343
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,799
Charlotte was caught somewhere
between the old and new York.

344
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,520
She figured showing her boob
to a stranger

345
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,432
bought her three months.

346
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,989
Carrie! There you are.
Where's Charlotte?

347
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,675
Believe it or not, she's involved
in a peep show upstairs.

348
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,991
l'm starting to have
a new-found respect for that girl.

349
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,199
What is it about today? l've seen
Miranda's boobs, Charlotte's boob.

350
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,351
Why not show me yours
and get it over with?

351
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,677
l was kidding.

352
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,831
l wasn't.
That ought to hook me a sailor.

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,468
Yeah, Tailhook you one. l'm going.

354
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,871
- No!
- Yes. l was right.

355
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,318
This ship has sailed
and tragically, l'm still on it.

356
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,234
Good night. Hey, keep an eye
on Boom Boom up there.

357
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,316
Hey, there. You came.

358
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,519
- Yes. l came, l saw, l'm leaving.
- Come on.

359
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,117
l've come all the way from Louisiana
to dance with a New York city girl.

360
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,669
l'm a good dancer.

361
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,112
Even though she was floating
in a sea of dickies...

362
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,397
One new message
and 12 saved messages.

363
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,516
...Samantha could
only think about Richard.

364
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,638
You threw a drink in my face
and papered my neighbourhood.

365
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,360
Would l still call
if l didn't really love you?

366
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,830
l love you, gorgeous.
Give me another chance.

367
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,678
You threw a drink in my face
and papered my neighbourhood.

368
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,400
Would l still be calling
if l didn't really love you?

369
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,838
Say, Louis from Louisiana,

370
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,310
how many great loves
do you think you get in a lifetime?

371
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,277
Great loves?

372
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,829
That is the question on deck.

373
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,756
Maybe one, if you're lucky.

374
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,636
Well, l'm glad l stayed.

375
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,475
After this city kicked
my ass today, l needed that dance.

376
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,996
l have to say,
this is my first trip to New York.

377
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,752
Not for me.

378
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,990
The garbage, the noise.
l don't know how you put up with it.

379
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,916
Thanks. Goodnight.

380
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,553
Wait.

381
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,191
Going home all alone?

382
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,909
- lt's rough out there.
- lt isn't so bad.

383
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,112
lf Louis was right,
and you only get one great love,

384
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,635
New York may just be mine.

385
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,316
l can't have nobody
talking shit about my boyfriend.

386
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,789
A short while later, l had a thought.

387
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,112
Maybe the past is like
an anchor holding us back.

388
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,114
Maybe you have to let go
of who you were...

389
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,114
to become who you will be.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
