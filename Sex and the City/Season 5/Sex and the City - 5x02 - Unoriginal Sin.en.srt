1
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,477
The worst thing about
not being in a relationship...

2
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
is when your job is to write about

3
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,916
being in a relationship.

4
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,350
Remember that guy who wore sandals,

5
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,273
Randal the sandal guy?
We had a couple of dates.

6
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,510
Six years ago?

7
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,238
ls that anything?

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,277
His name was Randal?

9
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,396
l'm scraping the bottom of the barrel.

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,790
Last week l wrote about my search

11
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,030
for the perfect French fry.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,236
lt was cute.

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,390
French fries.

14
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,028
You didn't read it, did you?

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,634
l don't always have time to read it.

16
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,753
OK, then.
Wow! Even my friends

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
- find me irrelevant.
- l read it every week.

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,995
You have a little man
hanging from your breast.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,151
- What else are you gonna do?
- Eat.

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,551
l'm in a dating desert.
They'll have to change my column

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,678
to ''...And The City''.
Or they'll cancel it.

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,796
You're on the side of a bus.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,916
Why did my editor call?
He never calls.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,958
l'm not getting laid.
l'm getting laid off.

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,951
You're not getting laid off.

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,190
l don't know if you read
the rest of the paper,

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,511
but people with real jobs
are getting laid off.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,070
This is not a good economy
in which to be whipped cream.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,598
Last night l started writing about
my sock drawer. Men as socks.

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,274
''Socks And The City''.

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,398
- You and l need to find some men.
- There are no men.

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,199
You have to know where to look.
When are you free?

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,999
l'm not trawling for men
to have something to write.

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,037
Go have sex. Report back.

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,953
l can only help with baby-proofing.

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,031
Use a condom.

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,838
What can l get you?

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,036
The veggie scramble
and wheat toast.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,033
l'll have fries.
Maybe l'll make it a two-parter.

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,475
Denver omelette and hash browns.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,757
The fruit plate.
And l'm back with Richard.

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,716
Richard, whose death
we've been plotting?

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,950
Maybe there are no men.

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,509
l listened
to what he had to say...

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,035
l've never known anyone like you.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,714
l was in over my head. l got scared.

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,711
He got scared?

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,189
That doesn't excuse the...

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,639
That coming from you is almost
as disturbing as the news itself.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,110
l hide under the covers,
not between somebody's legs.

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,430
- You had to be there.
- You'll have to be there

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,034
so he doesn't get scared again.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,839
Being scared is not easy
for a man to admit.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,958
They get a medal
for identifying a feeling?

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,032
We do that all day long.
l feel pissed off.

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,954
- Do not resuscitate.
- l'm not an idiot.

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,319
l understand that Richard
is a charismatic and successful man.

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,632
An interesting pussy
might cross his path and he might fall...

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,238
lt's just sex. That might be a flaw,
but nobody's perfect.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,279
Some women can't get their husbands
to pick up the dry cleaning.

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,750
You're comparing not picking up
the dry cleaning with...

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,638
Do the thing.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,439
l know he loves me.
l believe he's sorry.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,431
l believe he'll try his best.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,751
That's your choice
and we should all respect it.

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,480
How about this for a column?

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,996
''Desperate Women
Who Will Believe Anything''.

68
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,433
The next day,
two parents covered outlets

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,558
to prevent their baby
from getting shocked.

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,436
l was thinking...

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,353
Maybe we want to get
Brady baptised.

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,876
For grown-ups,
there is no such safeguard.

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,755
- Neither of us goes to church.
- l know, but it's tradition.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,388
l was baptised, my father,
my father's father.

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,312
Everybody in my family.

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,233
- lt would mean a lot to my ma.
- Your ma?

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,910
You never had a mother
when we were going out.

78
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,036
This is the first l've heard of her.

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,509
You are just
making a case for religion.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,636
lt's not about religion or God.

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,112
lt's something you do in case...
So baby don't end up in limbo.

82
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,273
- You don't know what that means.
- l do so.

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,716
- What is it?
- A place where babies fly around

84
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,519
without bodies,
just wings under their neck.

85
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,035
That sounds like something
we should worry about.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,954
Brady isn't crawling, and you've
got us baby-proofing this apartment.

87
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,954
But you won't let someone sprinkle
water on him so he doesn't go to hell?

88
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,476
Miranda didn't believe in hell,
except the hell she was in right now.

89
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,552
This is why l was worried
about involving you.

90
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,269
Why should l go through some
ceremony to make your ma happy?

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,193
lt's nice. Everybody sees the baby.

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,749
You have cake.
Some people give money.

93
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,878
- What's wrong with a party?
- l don't believe in it.

94
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,431
lf you don't believe...
lt's just water on the kid's head.

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,709
Downtown,
Samantha's faith was faltering.

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,952
- My friends don't believe you.
- Am l dating your friends?

97
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,510
- l wouldn't put it past you.
- What's their problem?

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,240
This...is their problem.

99
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,188
- We talked about that.
- Miranda thinks it's bullshit.

100
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,558
What's to stop you getting scared
every time a hot woman walks by?

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,793
- She wanted to know.
- l don't give a shit what they think.

102
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,396
l love you,
and l've got something for you.

103
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,953
Unless Miranda wouldn't approve.

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,034
Now it was Samantha's turn
to be scared.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,630
Don't worry.
lt's not for that finger, it's for this one.

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,156
When you flip me off,
l'll have something shiny to look at.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,878
There it was.

108
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,875
A canary diamond, ''l'll try not to cheat
and eat when l'm scared'' ring.

109
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,429
Samantha wasn't sure
if she was in heaven...

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,311
or limbo.

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,033
Meanwhile, l was clearly in hell.

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,078
That afternoon,
Charlotte and l went trawling for men.

113
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,913
- He's kind of cute.
- We were playing 1/100.

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,469
lt's like a road trip game
for urban singles.

115
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,029
Watch the men coming
your direction,

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,795
and see how many out of 100
you'd sleep with.

117
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,275
8 out of 46. Where are you?

118
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,318
- Zero, 32.
- What about the guy with the dog?

119
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,438
l don't like dachshunds for men.
Can't handle a real dog,

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,160
- can't handle a real woman.
- He was gorgeous.

121
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,880
Men who are too good-looking
are never good in bed,

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,110
because they never had to be.

123
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,470
- Zero, 35.
- None of them?

124
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,552
- They were gay.
- lt's imaginary.

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,998
There must be someone you'd have
imaginary sex with. You're being picky.

126
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,152
- You're an imaginary whore.
- l am not.

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,835
You have slept with eight men
and we have only had appetizers.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,515
You should come with me
to Dr Cheryl Grayson's seminar.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,229
lt's really inspiring. There's time
for questions and answers.

130
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,278
She has a new haircut
and l hear it's cute.

131
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,797
- Why would l go to that?
- Because you're becoming cynical.

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,317
That's why l wouldn't go.
lt's kind of a catch-22, isn't it?

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,392
- You might get a column out of it.
- Sign me up.

134
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,869
Yeah! l think you'll really enjoy it.

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,116
Her philosophy of written affirmations

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,989
has helped me let go
of negative thoughts.

137
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,994
No, not this guy. He's balding.

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,835
- He's got a big head.
- You have some negative thoughts.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,834
Oh, my God.
He's coming over here. Don't look up.

140
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,149
Aren't you Carrie Bradshaw
from ''The New York Star''?

141
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,436
- Gabe. Hey!
- You know each other?

142
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,591
This is my editor.

143
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,718
- This is Gabe Manning.
- Hi, l'm Charlotte.

144
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,589
l'm glad l ran into you
since you don't return your calls.

145
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,799
l know. But l am just now
researching my next column.

146
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,316
l think it's going to be
super fun and sexy.

147
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,439
We sit here and pick
how many men out of 100

148
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,989
we would sleep with.

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,357
No one's asking to fuck every guy.
We're a weekly paper.

150
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,354
- No, we don't actually...
- l've been trying to get in touch...

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,670
An editor from Clearwater Press called.

152
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,991
They're interested in turning
your columns into a book.

153
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,119
l'm having a Cosmopolitan
with the woman who wrote about them.

154
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,236
lf only l could find a man.

155
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,551
Trouble finding a man. Have you
considered writing about that?

156
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,676
Great idea. Let me get a pen.

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,990
The next night,
l met publishing powerhouses

158
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,116
Lily Martin and Courtney Masterson.

159
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,559
This is a thrill. All of us at Clearwater
Press read your column religiously.

160
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,676
l don't even do that.

161
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,559
l have ''Ten Men To Avoid''
on my refrigerator.

162
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,995
But not in that icky ''Cathy'' comic way.

163
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,513
- l hate that shit.
- Me too.

164
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,514
- l predict this book will be huge.
- Huge.

165
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,558
And that's... Why?

166
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,792
There are so many single women
desperate for something like this.

167
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,269
You're looking at two.
One. Two.

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,874
You already have an inventory
of columns to choose from.

169
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,996
Some we don't have to include.

170
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,038
That one on French fries
didn't make the fridge, did it?

171
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,273
We want to fast track it, get it
on the shelves by Christmas/Hanukkah.

172
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,557
You can pick the columns,
about 25 or 30.

173
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,235
Write an introduction
and dedication to clarify the tone.

174
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,594
So you mean...

175
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,558
What do you mean?

176
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,188
You know, what's the message?

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,273
Just...here are my favourite columns?

178
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,954
Yes, but also, is it hopeful?

179
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,873
ls Carrie Bradshaw
an optimist or pessimist?

180
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,679
What's your point of view?

181
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,469
After the break-ups
and disappointments and train wrecks.

182
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,234
You still believe he's out there, right?

183
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,675
Or should we shoot ourselves now?

184
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,193
No...

185
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,549
Yes, hopeful.

186
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,189
To be honest,
l wasn't sure what l believed.

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,956
But my cynical side suspected
optimism would sell more books.

188
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,516
My best friend
is going to be a published author.

189
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,717
lt's so fabulous,
it makes me more fabulous.

190
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,032
l enjoy being under the radar.
l take comfort in the fact that

191
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,795
many people, present company
included, don't see my column.

192
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,236
l'm waiting till it's in hardback.
l hope it's big and glossy.

193
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,790
Like my mistakes.
ls this something you encourage?

194
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,873
Do it! Newspaper is out.
lt's all about books.

195
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,315
Everyone who's anyone has a book.

196
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,630
l'm not sure what you just said

197
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,633
because l was blinded
by a piece of jewellery.

198
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,791
Let me see that!

199
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,673
lt's from Richard.
l think it's his way of saying, ''l'm sorry.''

200
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,991
What do you get if it happens again,
the Hope diamond?

201
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,631
That's what this is. The ''hope that fucker
doesn't break my heart again'' diamond.

202
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,553
We were both turning our pain into gold.

203
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,110
That night,
l started to think about belief.

204
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,400
Maybe it's not advisable to be
an optimist after the age of 30.

205
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,918
Maybe pessimism is something
we have to apply daily, like moisturiser.

206
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,676
Otherwise, how do you bounce back
when reality batters your belief system

207
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,594
and love does not,
as promised, conquer all.

208
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,550
ls hope a drug we need to go off of,
or is it keeping us alive?

209
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,995
What's the harm in believing?

210
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,109
Repeat your affirmations daily
if you want to let love into your life.

211
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,032
Open yourself.

212
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,555
Breathe in the possibility of love.

213
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,473
What is not love is fear.

214
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,031
Let go of your fears
and embrace your dreams.

215
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,478
Miranda wasn't a believer,
but her faith was renewed

216
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,438
when she found a church
that seemed to suit her

217
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,670
and a suit that seemed to fit her.

218
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,071
- l'm waiting in the rain.
- l know. You said 10:45.

219
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,630
- Yeah!
- lt's my fault. l'm sorry.

220
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,791
He's not with her.

221
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,713
l told you she'd probably
leave him with the nurse.

222
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,000
- This is my ma. Ma, Miranda.
- Mrs Brady, so nice to meet you.

223
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,234
No, Mary, please. You're so fancy.
l wanted to wear my nice dress.

224
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,709
But the dry cleaners
doesn't open until 10:00.

225
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,079
l was hoping that you'd bring Brady,
since l haven't seen him yet.

226
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,712
Well, Stevie gave me a picture
l've been carrying around in my wallet.

227
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,077
lt's a little creased.
l should've put it in a frame.

228
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,630
l Xeroxed it at the phone company,
and everyone in my division

229
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,870
said he looks like me.

230
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,156
l'll see him at the ceremony.

231
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,996
l'm grateful to be included,
especially since you aren't Catholic

232
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,310
and didn't want to have a christening.

233
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,436
But the idea
of this baby burning in hell...

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,909
- Ma!
- All right.

235
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,838
l'm just saying...my oldest son, Jackie,

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,151
had a baby who died, two weeks old.

237
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,677
We're still reeling. His wife
is black. She's not very friendly.

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,798
Thinks l have a problem with her,
but l don't.

239
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,951
l don't. Maybe the priest doesn't need
to know you aren't getting married.

240
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,352
- We're not lying to the priest.
- Now you're religious.

241
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,509
Hello.

242
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,240
- Are you the Hobbes party?
- Yes, we spoke on the phone.

243
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,960
- l'm Father Andrew. Come in.
- Sorry we're late.

244
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,432
Hello, Father. l'm Mary Brady.
l go to Saint Agnes in Queens.

245
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,797
They're not getting married.

246
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,589
- ls she drunk?
- No, just a couple of beers.

247
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,230
l don't want the baby
referred to as Catholic.

248
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,832
No original sin.
No renouncing of Satan.

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,279
lt's not that she's a fan of Satan.
She doesn't want to...talk about him.

250
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,910
ln fact no mention of Satan, the devil...

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,756
Miranda was surprised the priest
was so flexible, but in troubled times,

252
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,913
the Catholic Church is like a desperate,
36-year-old single woman,

253
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,277
willing to settle for anything it can get.

254
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,956
This is not what l had in mind
when you asked to go dress shopping.

255
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,830
l'm less thrilled than you. He has to get
baptised and wear a dress.

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,560
Baby's first drag show.

257
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,076
- lt's a very odd tradition.
- Don't get me started.

258
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,471
lt's about cleansing
this little baby of his sins.

259
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,189
Babies come into this world
with a clean slate. We fuck them up.

260
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,035
- You're a pessimist, right?
- Have we met?

261
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,990
lt's for my book. l have to figure out
if l'm an optimist or a pessimist.

262
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,516
l don't know any more.
l don't know what l believe.

263
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,036
- Neither do l. l'm having a baptism.
- How do you rationalise that?

264
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,751
One less bath to give him. l'm doing
it for Steve. He's been good to me.

265
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,993
l've known him three years.
l didn't meet his mother till yesterday.

266
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,789
- What's she like?
- lmagine Steve, in a wig, drunk.

267
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,633
- Yikes!
- Yeah.

268
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,873
How would you feel
about being Brady's godmother?

269
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,508
Really? What would l need to do?

270
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,717
Officially, you provide
the baby with spiritual guidance.

271
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,634
Unofficially, you stand with me
so l have somebody to roll my eyes at.

272
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,109
l don't know...spiritual guidance?

273
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,033
There's cake
from some bakery in Queens.

274
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,718
- The sugary kind with the thick icing?
- Maybe even a buttercream cross.

275
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,839
Oh, now you're talking.
Spirituality and cake.

276
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,789
That night, Charlotte dragged me
to the fountain of belief.

277
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,919
lt was mostly women. Apparently,
women are the main market for hope.

278
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,435
Would you like an affirmation?

279
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,479
Saying no would get us off
on the wrong foot.

280
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,359
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

281
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,877
''l believe in the good in people.''
That's nice. What does yours say?

282
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,600
''l believe this is hooey.''

283
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,354
Are you going to make fun
of everything?

284
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,238
l'm not that quick.

285
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,755
- What did you do today?
- Oh, the usual.

286
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,196
Helped pick a christening gown
for my friend's illegitimate baby.

287
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,319
Oh, l'm so happy
she decided to do a baptism.

288
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,438
- She asked me to be the godmother.
- What?

289
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,149
- lt's not a big deal.
- lt is. lt's a huge responsibility.

290
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,276
l know friendships that ended

291
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,034
because someone
was a disappointing godparent.

292
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,713
Why are you so...?

293
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,319
- Did you want to be the godmother?
- No!

294
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,916
lt wouldn't kill you to acknowledge
that some things are sacred.

295
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,957
- l do...
- We're not talking.

296
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,839
- We're not?
- No.

297
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,910
Are we talking yet?

298
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,033
Let me know when we're talking.

299
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,392
l believe this is going to be
a very long evening.

300
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,669
l believe we are
the only normal people here.

301
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,829
l believe in the good in Charlotte,
who dragged me here against my will

302
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,595
when l wanted to stay home
and just be negative.

303
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,913
What does the gown look like?

304
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,272
Table for two.

305
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,517
You're trying to make me feel bad,
but that turns me on.

306
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,716
Right this way.

307
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,198
Thank you.

308
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,150
- Are we OK?
- We're fine.

309
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,598
l almost forgot. You're going to
Miranda's baptism with me Sunday.

310
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,274
lt'll be all day, it'll be boring,
it'll be mandatory.

311
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,829
- What time?
- 2:00.

312
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,075
- Are you going to do the thing again?
- No. Are you?

313
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,548
Samantha, l love you.

314
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,873
Although he appeared
to have reformed,

315
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,600
Samantha wasn't ready
to forgive his sin.

316
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,390
Love will come to you only
when you truly believe you deserve it.

317
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,996
Meanwhile, an hour
and 20 affirmations later...

318
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,190
Love will raise you up. Fear will pull
you under. Only love is real.

319
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,191
Yes, stand up.

320
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,037
l wanted to thank you. The affirmations
have really worked for me.

321
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,591
l prayed for love, l believed in love,
and last week l fell in love.

322
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,311
He's perfect and kind and giving,
and l now know

323
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,516
that l deserve that. Thank you.

324
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,878
Thank yourself. You did it.
lsn't that inspiring? Yeah.

325
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,276
Anyone else?

326
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,152
- Did you want to say something?
- Oh, no...

327
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,278
Yes. Hi. l was wondering...

328
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,351
Hi... l'm wondering how long
that woman was doing her affirmations.

329
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,829
l've been doing mine every day.

330
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,754
l want to believe,
but nothing is happening.

331
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,036
l just don't think it's working.
l don't think it will work for me.

332
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,033
l hear fear. l hear doubt.

333
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,152
You have to believe love
to receive love.

334
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,359
Keep repeating your affirmations.
Your heart will catch up with your head.

335
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,190
That's the thing, though.

336
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,316
l did find love.

337
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,199
l believed there was someone out
there for me and l met him finally.

338
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,399
We had a beautiful wedding,
and then everything just fell apart.

339
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,714
l'm worried. l'm afraid
that he took away my ability to believe.

340
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,839
l hate him for that
because l always believed before.

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,037
And now l just feel...lost.

342
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,352
And l am, l'm trying to put myself
out there but...l feel hopeless.

343
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,999
Perhaps you're not
really putting yourself out there.

344
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,071
Oh...

345
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,476
No, she's out there.

346
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,631
l mean emotionally and physically.

347
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,952
Maybe you're not looking for love
in a real way.

348
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,715
Maybe you're not really trying.
Maybe you're not really out there.

349
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,838
Believe me. She's out there.

350
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,718
Sunday afternoon, we gathered for a
baptism in the little church that would.

351
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,550
Hey, you, with the flower thing.

352
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,995
Steve tells me you're the godmother.

353
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,915
l'm the godfather,
Steve's second cousin, Patrick.

354
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,514
Make a good story?

355
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,797
- Little Brady brought us together.
- Oh...

356
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,633
Someone who isn't related
to Steve, no offence.

357
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,633
- None taken.
- Hey.

358
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,758
- l'll check you later, 'gator.
- OK.

359
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,109
- lt's a nice dress.
- l didn't want Brady to show me up.

360
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,638
l think your baby's godfather baptised
himself with some bad cologne.

361
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,952
Brady's grandmother
invited the folks from Molly McGuire's.

362
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,476
l know your hands are full
with the drunk and the skunk.

363
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,394
- l have to tell you something.
- l'm too fat to be wearing this?

364
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,519
No, oh no, you look beautiful. lt's me.

365
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,677
Are you sure
that l am godmother material?

366
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,958
Shouldn't you pick someone
a bit more maternal?

367
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,839
No, l like that you're not.

368
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,712
Well, here's the thing.
This is an awesome responsibility.

369
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,916
l don't know my own view of the future.

370
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,992
l'm possibly
one bad date away from bitter.

371
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,789
Don't you think
l'm getting a little cynical?

372
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,474
Not compared to me.

373
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,710
You're my best friend.

374
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,272
Charlotte's dying for the job,
and l think she'd be better at it.

375
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,752
l don't know if l believe in any of this,
but l believe in you.

376
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,037
l want you to be my baby's godmother.

377
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,116
Well, l did spring for the hat.

378
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,354
Who presents this child to receive
the sacrament of Baptism?

379
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,272
We do.

380
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,630
''Give him an enquiring
and discerning heart,

381
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,429
''the courage to will and to persevere,
a spirit to love,

382
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,990
''and the gift of joy and wonder.
ln the Lord's name, we pray.''

383
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,038
Lord, hear our prayer.

384
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,997
''ln baptism we use your gift of water,

385
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,116
''which you have made a rich symbol

386
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,840
''of the grace you give us
in this sacrament.

387
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,197
''Through it, you led the children of lsrael
out of their bondage.

388
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,874
''Through it, we are reborn.''

389
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,756
There isn't enough holy water
in the world to cleanse you.

390
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,268
Brady, l baptise you
in the name of the Father,

391
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,396
and of the Son,

392
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,990
and of the Holy Spirit.

393
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,951
Amen.

394
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,274
l hoped the water would wash away
some of my original cynicism.

395
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,315
lsn't this the most beautiful
goddamn Catholic you've ever seen?

396
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,678
Sorry, Father.
But he's a cute fucking kid.

397
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,230
- Honey, congratulations.
- l didn't do anything.

398
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,392
You got me to a church.

399
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,518
- Beautiful baby.
- Thank you.

400
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,638
Just for the record, l did get scared.

401
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,509
OK, whatever. Thanks for coming.

402
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,190
- He's such a player.
- l don't know.

403
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,557
Maybe things will work out
between them.

404
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,998
That night,
l dedicated my baby - my book -

405
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,188
to hopeful single women everywhere,
and one in particular...

406
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,430
my good friend Charlotte,

407
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,511
the eternal optimist,

408
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,989
who always believes in love.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
