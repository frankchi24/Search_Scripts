1
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,916
One night, four ladies in the east

2
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,230
met at Compass to discuss going west.

3
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,755
l have to go to San Francisco

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,558
on a book tour.

5
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,676
You wouldn't go to the Upper West side.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,637
You're going to San Francisco?

7
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,429
Apparently l'm big in San Francisco.

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,832
- You mean Big is in San Francisco.
- Perhaps l'll see Big.

9
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,359
l need to have sex. lt's been too long.

10
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,715
l've been having dreams

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,350
where l run up to complete strangers

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,317
and start kissing them.

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,836
lf you want sex, you don't have to go
across the country.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,355
Those guys have been checking us out.

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,796
Oh, cute. Cute...

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,518
...cute.

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,150
Boring and boring. Like these scallops.

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,914
- l love the food here.
- Same old.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,833
- Same old just opened last week.
- Scallops are scallops.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,831
Bachelors are bachelors.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,754
Sounds like you're experiencing
a ''been there, done them'' crisis.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,957
lt's not me. lt's New York.
Nothing is really new.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,315
They should change the name
to ''Same York''.

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,790
These scallops are fantastic,
and those guys are cute.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,192
- You should go say hi. May l?
- l don't want to say hi.

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,874
l want to say,
''Could one of you lie on me?''

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,077
l need to feel the weight of a man.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,629
l wish women could go
to male prostitutes.

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,598
- Women do.
- Only in bad screenplays

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,196
- and first novels.
- That is an incredible investment idea.

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,309
Open a brothel with cute men
and 500-count Egyptian cotton sheets.

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,677
- Samantha, you can be the madam.
- At least it's new.

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,035
We could put one
in every neighbourhood, like Starbucks.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,158
- Starfucks.
- Such places don't exist in reality.

35
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,278
Women don't think about sex
like it's an animal urge.

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,637
We need a connection. Right, Carrie?

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,191
No, Big is my male prostitute.
l am mixing business with pleasure.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,353
- My relief is a train ride away.
- Train? Why don't you fly?

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,476
Flying makes me nervous,

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,438
seeing the National Guard
go through my make-up.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,276
Besides, it'll be fun.
Especially if Samantha goes with me.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,149
Please, it'll be hilarious. Two gals
on a train. Very ''Some Like lt Hot''.

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,791
And the whole trip ends
with a luxury suite

44
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,590
in a fabulous four star
San Francisco hotel.

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,151
- Why didn't you invite me?
- Samantha's bored enough to do it.

46
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,595
What time do we leave ''Same York''?

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,796
l'm gonna get laid.

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,473
More single women of a certain age
are looking for a certain thing.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,078
That certain thing does not
necessarily involve a certain ring.

50
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,357
We may have traded
the black book for a black dress,

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,798
and replaced the Ferrari with a Fendi,
but in view of certain evidence,

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,839
l had to wonder...
Are we the new bachelors?

53
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,595
What did Big say when you told him?

54
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,392
l'm gonna wait till l get there.
''Guess where l am?'' Very casual.

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,839
l would've called and said, ''l'm coming,
and l won't be the only one.''

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,118
l think l'm getting a pimple. Can you
see anything, above my freckle?

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,236
All clear.

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,995
The last thing l need is a big zit
when l meet my prostitute.

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,199
This may be what l needed,
if l can stand the train for three days.

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,909
lt's an adventure.
lt's not the destination. lt's the journey.

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,870
A journey in adjoining,
first-class, deluxe sleeper berths.

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,430
l've always wanted to take a train.
lt's so sexy.

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,354
You never know who's getting on
and getting me off.

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,478
- All aboard!
- Hello, sir.

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,028
We were supposed to have
the first-class sleeper.

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,115
- This is the first-class sleeper.
- Regular class sleeps in a tuna can?

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,238
Here is your door to the restroom.

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,160
You shower over the toilet?

69
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,755
l understand why there was
a murder on the Orient Express.

70
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,354
ln a far less crowded space...

71
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,035
- Delivery from Bloom & Goldenblatt.
- l thought they'd send a messenger.

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,317
Do you know what we would
charge you for a 12 block drop?

73
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,589
- A partner delivers my divorce papers?
- Why not? l needed the walk.

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,833
OK. l was just going to work out,
but come in.

75
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,592
- Hot.
- Excuse me?

76
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,230
Outside. l'm schvitzing
like a pudding at a picnic.

77
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,919
So, this is the pagoda
we've been fighting over?

78
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,868
lmpressive. l can see why
you'd never want to give it up.

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,430
- l'm thinking of selling.
- After everything we went through?

80
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,477
lt's too big for one.

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,632
l'm putting the word out,
if anyone hears of any apartments.

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,519
My buddy is selling his.
lt may be too bachelor.

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,151
l can change that. This place
was where plaid furniture came to die.

84
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,709
l could set it up so you get a first look.

85
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,836
- OK.
- Done, so...

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,595
Let's get you divorced. Sit and sign.

87
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,955
Do you have a handkerchief?
You're still sweating.

88
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,680
Oh, sorry. This never happens.

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,874
Oh, thanks.

90
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,791
That's it?

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,157
You are no longer
Mrs Trey MacDougal.

92
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,758
How do you like that?

93
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,672
l like it.

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,155
- You have tissue stuck to...
- l'm a fucking mess today.

95
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,550
Somewhere outside of Pittsburgh,

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,192
we decided to get out of our twin cans
and go for a train dinner in the club car.

97
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,678
This is it?

98
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,595
l thought there'd be white linen
tablecloths and Bing Crosby at a piano.

99
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,395
- Table for two.
- Sit anywhere that's open.

100
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,198
Sorry. The train zigged...

101
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,270
OK. Excuse me. Sorry.

102
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,993
Really?

103
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,433
Hello.

104
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,679
Thank you.

105
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,876
l'm eating with the Amish?

106
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,836
Every time we stop, good-looking
people get off and ugly people get on.

107
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,953
This is the train to ugly. There isn't
one man l'd fuck. What about you?

108
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,033
l'm horny. Nine hours of train rocking
hasn't helped.

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,599
Sorry.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,152
lf she has a problem,
next time she can take a buggy.

111
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,672
How would ''Zagat'' rate a place
that lists potato chips as an appetizer?

112
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,796
Don't say potato chip.

113
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,872
This zit is getting bigger. Can you see it?

114
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,637
You're starting to look like
you belong on a train.

115
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,677
Oh, really?

116
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,912
- What can l get you?
- A martini and an aeroplane.

117
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,959
- What's safe to order?
- The club sandwich.

118
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,156
And a martini.

119
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,279
God, l need a big drink.

120
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,116
Again, sorry.

121
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,191
Speaking of martinis...

122
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,796
- A zebra-skin rug...
- l told you he was a bachelor.

123
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,999
- A bar in the bedroom?
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

124
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,631
- You seem to know your way.
- l sub-let while l was getting divorced.

125
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,711
Wait...

126
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,676
Surround sound.

127
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,153
l can't believe men think it takes
all of this to get a woman into bed.

128
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,633
What does it take?

129
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,749
- Charlotte...
- What?

130
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,309
You are the sexiest woman l ever met.

131
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,268
Harry, don't be ridiculous.
l'm wearing my glasses.

132
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,035
- l go crazy when you say my name.
- l'll stop saying it.

133
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,873
- What a putz your ex-husband is.
- Trey was not.

134
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,079
lf l had you in my bed, l would never
be able to take my hands off you.

135
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,196
Stop, Harry.

136
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,194
Ever since l first saw you,
l can't think about anything else.

137
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,878
- l'm like fucking Romeo.
- lt's hot. Can you open a window?

138
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,830
l fantasise about your lips,
your perfect pink lips.

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,158
Two days, two toilet showers
and too many club sandwiches later...

140
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,278
- Hello?
- lt's me and it's still bad.

141
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,476
- The trip or the pimple?
- Both.

142
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,871
l tried to squeeze it
somewhere outside Oklahoma.

143
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,510
A helpful hint -
never give yourself a train facial.

144
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,113
Got it.

145
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,636
lf it hasn't started to deflate by
Colorado, l'm not calling Big.

146
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,313
Someone who used to be
Samantha just came in.

147
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,359
A group of guys not resembling
the Elephant Man got on.

148
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,353
They are having a bachelor party
in the bar car. Get dressed.

149
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,593
- l can't go with this pimple.
- l got on a train for you.

150
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,955
You are going to the bar car with me.

151
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,078
l have to go to a bachelor party.

152
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,268
Back in New York, Charlotte was
between some confirmed bachelors.

153
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,639
How can a person have really hot s-e-x
with someone they don't like?

154
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,349
You're spelling ''sex'' in a place
with a go-go boy on the bar?

155
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,318
- l'm serious.
- Why?

156
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,471
Oh, my God. You?

157
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,269
He's my divorce lawyer
and l don't even like him.

158
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,752
Some of the best sex l've had
is with people l can't stand. Details!

159
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,549
He was showing me a bachelor
apartment. All the leather and music...

160
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,472
Leather, l get it.

161
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,760
- Suddenly we were kissing and then...
- Fucking? This is so exciting!

162
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,354
- How was it?
- Unbelievable.

163
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,715
Cosmos for everyone!

164
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,714
lt's not good. l don't want to date him.
He's not attractive.

165
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,393
Ugly sex is hot.

166
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,076
No. He's sweaty and pushy
and no, l could never date him.

167
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,995
Maybe just for the sex.
How does that work exactly?

168
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,073
Listen up. You have to be
very clear about the rules.

169
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,553
lt's just sex. You can't act romantic.
Talk just sex talk. Fuck me and get out.

170
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,757
- lsn't that rude?
- No, it's hot.

171
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,480
Hello! Where's my drink?

172
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,673
Things are looking up. They are cute.

173
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,196
This blusher makes it look like
l'm in a high school play.

174
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,918
Follow my lead.

175
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,713
Hello.

176
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,153
Hi.

177
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,990
Well. Aren't you boys
a sight for sore eyes?

178
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,630
- So, what are we drinking?
- Beer.

179
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,555
We can do better than that.
Sir, a bottle of champagne, please.

180
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,395
l'm sure one of you gentlemen
will help me pop my cork.

181
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,397
Just like that, we went from
''Some Like lt Hot'' to some like us not.

182
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,518
- l thought l was looking pretty hot.
- You are.

183
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,398
Not according to them.

184
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,313
Hi.

185
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,198
Excuse me,
but what kind of bachelor party is this?

186
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,794
We're not bachelors. We're all married.

187
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,599
Except Ry. He's the last one.

188
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,719
We're taking him
to the Giants game in San Francisco.

189
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,268
My friend has come on
this very long trip as a favour to me.

190
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,719
Could one of you fellas oblige her
in a little harmless male flirtation?

191
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,678
We're trying to be good.
Promised our wives.

192
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,277
As far as a pimp,
l was a total train wreck.

193
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,429
They love their wives.

194
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,435
You were right. lt's not New York
that's the problem. lt's me.

195
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,153
l am having an exist...

196
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,353
A mid-life thing, you know.

197
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,317
This has roots.

198
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,554
l don't know what to do. l fuck
younger guys. l don't want a sports car.

199
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Parking in New York is a bitch.

200
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,750
l'm sorry about the train.
This was a terrible idea.

201
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,435
lt's all my fault.
All because l had to get laid.

202
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,710
There! Popped it.

203
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,632
All right!

204
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,473
Let's get another bottle to celebrate.

205
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,555
One very long trip later,
Samantha and l dragged our cabooses

206
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,790
into a bookstore near the Golden Gate.

207
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,351
- lmpressive turnout. You are big here.
- Oh, my publisher.

208
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,193
Carrie, you made it in one piece.

209
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,113
Well, that's debatable.

210
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,398
l can't believe it.
All these people came to hear me read?

211
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,754
- Carrie?
- Yes.

212
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,878
They're not all just for you.
Mr Winkle's here.

213
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,474
Who's Mr Winkle?

214
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,315
He's making an appearance after you.

215
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,910
- You're opening for a dog?
- l know.

216
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,437
They had a chance to get him and
jumped at it. He's huge on the lnternet.

217
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,594
l can't be the opening act for a dog.

218
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,832
The West Coast sales rep
totally fucked me on this.

219
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,150
- Lily, hi!
- One sec'.

220
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,873
- You know...
- Thanks, but don't waste your energy.

221
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,871
Go to the hotel.

222
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,157
Get in that giant tub and relax.
l'll see you later.

223
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,595
Later? Aren't you gonna call Big?

224
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,479
- With the pimple and the puppy, no.
- Sure?

225
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,236
- Go. Take a long bath.
- l may never get out.

226
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,391
Bye.

227
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,514
This book tour stuff is rough.

228
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,278
Cute top.

229
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,637
''As l walked home,
l couldn't help but wonder.

230
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,430
''Was it Mr Big, was it New York
or was it me?''

231
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,038
Any questions?

232
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,075
Yes.

233
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,678
- When is Mr Winkle coming out?
- Oh...in a mere moment.

234
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,389
No other questions about my book?

235
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,593
l see a hand, but l can't see a man.
Could you shift?

236
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,594
l have a question.

237
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,275
This Mr Big.
Does he have a real name?

238
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,556
Yes, but l can't reveal it.
l have to protect his privacy.

239
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,999
l no longer cared about Mr Winkle.
l had Mr Big.

240
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,153
Samantha!

241
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,394
Samantha!

242
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,270
- l'm taking a bubble bath.
- You have to get out. Big's here.

243
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,079
- l need to have sex.
- l'm taking a bath.

244
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,391
l got you a smaller room
all to yourself downstairs.

245
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,680
- l can't get in another small room.
- Please. l have to get laid.

246
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,914
Well...

247
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,514
You'd better fuck him good. l'm not
going through this again in six months.

248
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,639
Hurry. l told him to come up
in half an hour. Snap it up.

249
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,870
Go faster. Thank you.

250
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,959
Hey, you.

251
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,873
- Did you hide the body?
- What body?

252
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,079
Whatever it was that kept me
wandering around for half an hour.

253
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,316
l got you some gum.

254
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,155
- Big Red. The clerk recommended it.
- Aren't you something?

255
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,874
- Want some?
- Sure.

256
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,032
Nice digs.

257
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,834
- This'll set your publisher back?
- Yeah.

258
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,111
- You look good.
- So do you, kid.

259
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,558
- What?
- My gum.

260
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,676
You surprised me.

261
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,669
- l swallowed it.
- Sorry.

262
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,515
Let me kiss it and make it all better.

263
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,074
How's that?

264
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,949
- We'd better go. Dinner reservations.
- l'm not hungry.

265
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,830
l promised my partners l'd make a
vineyard connection with the restaurant.

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,037
Let's go. We'll have
a nice meal...and catch up.

267
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,351
OK.

268
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,069
l'm walking through the mall
and l see your book.

269
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,071
You were in a mall?

270
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,199
l live in America now. You've got to go
through them to get to the outside.

271
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,515
l pass a bookstore and there you are,
in the window next to the real books.

272
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,955
- You are too kind.
- Good cover.

273
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,635
- Cute...sexy.
- Sexy?

274
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,590
So l go in, l bought it, drove right home,

275
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,515
sat on my porch, lit up a cigar
and l read it cover to cover.

276
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,274
- Porch?
- Screen doors and everything.

277
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,238
Well...what do you think?

278
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,754
l had no idea that l hurt you so much.

279
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,710
- lt was tough to see it in print.
- You've read my columns.

280
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,795
Not all in one sitting. One reading.
One after the other. Bam. Bam.

281
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,236
- l got how much l hurt you.
- Come on. That's fiction.

282
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,119
Fiction. l embellished.

283
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,238
Some of that really happened,
word for word.

284
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,710
lt's just writing. lt's all in the past.

285
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,429
Let's forget all that
and talk about something else.

286
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,279
- How's the wine business?
- Great.

287
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,837
That chapter about my apartment key,
was l that big of an asshole?

288
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,231
He was like the city itself...
cold, infuriating and exhausting.

289
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,075
lt became clear this was not
my best-laid plan.

290
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,677
That's what l'm talking about.
When have l been cold? Am l cold?

291
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,795
No.

292
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,193
You're hot.

293
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,918
Very hot.

294
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,039
- What about chapter three?
- That was years ago.

295
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,158
Can...we please stop talking?

296
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,035
- Wait, wait.
- What, what?

297
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,711
- l don't want you to get hurt again.
- l won't. lt's just sex.

298
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,872
According to this book, it is not just sex.

299
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,635
What happened was my fault.
l didn't read the signs.

300
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,951
You were unavailable
and very clear about that.

301
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,236
lt was all me.

302
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,235
Now please, kiss me.
Or at least lie on top of me.

303
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,916
l think it's very clear from this book
that when it comes to me,

304
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,958
you do not have good judgment.
Look at chapter three.

305
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,591
- That's fiction, not even a bestseller.
- Here, page 39...

306
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,116
l can't believe this.
Are you involved with someone?

307
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,158
- No.
- lt's the pimple, isn't it?

308
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,359
l don't want to do something here
that l'll be sorry for later.

309
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,750
l'm fine. Look at me. Put...

310
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,758
Put the book down and look at me.

311
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,949
l'm fine.

312
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,872
Just fine.

313
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,672
Don't l look fine?

314
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,589
So...

315
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,438
Let's talk just a little more.

316
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,955
Page 39. This part...

317
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,638
l love making love to you.

318
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,429
No, that was not love.
That was just sex.

319
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,152
Charlotte...

320
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,792
...you are so beautiful.
Your skin is so soft, so smooth.

321
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,193
And you...

322
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,992
...have a hard dick.

323
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,436
Now...put your pants on and go.

324
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,431
- ls that OK?
- Whatever you say.

325
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,278
There they were...

326
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,159
...the bachelorette and the beast.

327
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,471
What about dinner Saturday night?

328
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,950
This is just sex. We are not a couple.

329
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,634
You're just a great fuck.

330
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,557
- ls that clear?
- Clear.

331
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,594
- Hello?
- lt's your wake-up call.

332
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,990
- What time is it?
- 7:30.

333
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,311
- What time did l say?
- 7:30.

334
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,948
Oh, OK. Thank you.

335
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,634
After my wake-up call,
l got my real wake-up call.

336
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,998
Thanks to my book, nothing
was ever going to happen with Big.

337
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,035
Hey...

338
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,714
Where are you going?

339
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,395
l have two book readings
before l head back to New York.

340
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,796
- Not so fast. Come here.
- Now?

341
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,794
What about last night,
all that talk, all those concerns?

342
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,794
Fuck it.
You'll need material for the sequel.

343
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,356
''Like that freckle on my face he loved,

344
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,080
''l could do my best
to cover it during the day.

345
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,159
''But at night,
after l washed the city off my face,

346
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,472
''there it was: a tiny brown dot
near the tip of my lip.

347
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,913
''l wondered how something so small
could suddenly seem so big.''

348
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,635
- There you go.
- Thank you.

349
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,356
Luggage in the car. Car at the kerb.

350
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,877
- Thanks for doing all that.
- So, how'd it go with Big?

351
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,350
- We had sex.
- Hallelujah.

352
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,069
- But it was not simple.
- What does that mean?

353
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,597
The question-and-answer section
of this reading is over.

354
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,911
- l'll tell you on the train.
- Train? Get real.

355
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,551
American Airlines, first class...
and some valium.

356
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,629
l cannot wait to get to New York.

357
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,475
- What about the mid-life crisis?
- Who's mid-life?

358
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,879
And sometimes, it's not the journey,
it's the destination.
