1
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,432
When venturing out

2
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,556
on your first blind date in a decade,

3
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,632
it's crucial to have the right attitude.

4
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,392
Hope for the best.

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,788
Ted?

6
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,552
Sorry.

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,154
Prepare for the worst...

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,272
...and who knows,

9
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,034
you might be pleasantly surprised.

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,993
Or not.

11
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,712
l got stood up.

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,836
l deigned to go on a blind date

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,195
against my better judgment.

14
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,557
l was willing to lower myself
into the gutter.

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,109
- l miss dating.
- He doesn't show.

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,679
Are you sure?

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,037
Either he didn't show
or took one look at me and ran.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,191
Which is worse? l can't decide.

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,954
l'm sure we'll get to the bottom of this.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,510
A stranger hurt my feelings.
That's scraping bottom.

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,672
You shouldn't be going
on blind dates. lt's beneath you.

22
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,674
That's not true. l know great couples
that met on blind dates.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,230
- Eric and Marcy...
- Stop. Even if he had shown,

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,393
first dates are like interviews
with cocktails. l'm done.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,677
l said that yesterday about bread.
l ordered pancakes.

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,389
Why should l risk
having a god-awful evening,

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,870
when l am guaranteed
to have fun with you guys?

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,032
Honey, you're cute,
but l'm never gonna fuck you.

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,876
l'm sorry this happened
on your first date back. Keep trying.

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,272
l came out, l saw my shadow.
l'm going back in. See you next winter.

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,194
You have to take risks
so you don't wind up an old maid.

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,433
Oh! That's right.
Must not wind up old maid.

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,751
How will l remember that?
Does anybody have a pen?

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,150
Why do we get
''old maid'' and ''spinster''

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,550
and men are
''bachelors'' and ''playboys''?

36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,598
No matter how shrivelled
their dicks are.

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,638
The end. New topic.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,554
Charlotte's 36th birthday
is Saturday night.

39
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,234
l say we spinsters
take back Manhattan.

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,359
l've thought about it
and l've decided l'm sticking at 35.

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,913
- lt was such a good year?
- l'm not where l thought l'd be at 36.

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,311
- l don't feel 36. l don't look 36, right?
- No.

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,109
Men are more interested in meeting
35-year-olds. So l'm sticking.

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,989
We all turned 36 like big girls.
Now it's your turn.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,039
Lying about her age is
the smartest thing she's done in years.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,034
Where are we celebrating
Charlotte's 35th birthday, the sequel?

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,475
Today is the baby nurse's last day.

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,835
Now, you have to book me in advance.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,399
You're like Nobu.

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,030
l can't go either.
Richard's taking me to Atlantic City.

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,794
- What'd you do wrong?
- He loves to gamble.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,713
There's a heavyweight fight
he wants to see.

53
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,916
We are going on his private jet.

54
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,355
No celebration is fine with me.

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,071
The four of us can't get together
for Charlotte's 30-faux birthday?

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,037
This is bullshit!

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,192
Two nights later,
with no friends, no dates,

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,715
not even any good bad TV to watch...

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,350
This is bullshit.

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,274
OK, this is my third and final phone call.

61
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,830
Miranda thinks she can get
Steve to watch the baby.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,518
Charlotte agreed as long
as we don't mention her birthday or 36.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,231
l'm still a little fuzzy on the rules.
Can't you get out of Atlantic City?

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,358
- l'll have to ask Richard.
- Please do.

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,036
l am looking at the last picture
taken of us and it is mouldy.

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,158
Miranda is wearing
a blouse with shoulder pads.

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,279
Carrie's hell-bent on getting
the four of us together Saturday.

68
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,477
Would you be terribly disappointed
if l didn't come?

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,518
Why not bring them?
l'll raise two suites.

70
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,989
- There's room on the jet.
- Yes!

71
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,597
That Friday, l picked up my fellow
jet-setter on the way to the airport.

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,515
<i>Under the boardwaIk</i>
<i>We'II be having...</i>

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,999
What?

74
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,597
l can't go. l'm not ready
to be separated from the baby.

75
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,478
- What?
- l'm kidding!

76
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,235
Steve took him two hours ago.
l'm free! l'm leaving the compound!

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,551
Don't do that to me!
l'm a 36-year-old woman!

78
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,790
Come on in. l need two seconds.

79
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,918
- Two seconds.
- OK. Oh, man...

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,877
Hi, Magda. How are you?

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,191
You want to see something beautiful?
l show you.

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,239
Look at him.
You ever see such beautiful face?

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,358
Look here. So smiley.

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,359
And here, after bath.
With his little poopick.

85
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,475
OK.

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,157
As l live and breathe, Ms Hobbes,

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,993
l never thought l'd see the day.

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,391
That's not me, that's her.
l didn't take most of those.

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,597
This is my only sweater
that covers my ass.

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,752
Can l get away with this
and stretchy pants?

91
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,311
Atlantic City is the capital
of stretchy pants. They're mandatory.

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,994
Let's go. Let's go.

93
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,230
Hi. How you doing?

94
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,436
What's wrong?
Why are you back?

95
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,151
l thought l forgot the Wipies,
but turns out actually...

96
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,472
- l don't think l can do this.
- Excuse me?

97
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,995
l'm afraid that l might break him.

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,597
l accidentally scratched his face
with my dirty fingernail. Look...

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,958
lt's nothing. You've taken care
of him before. lt's been fine.

100
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,910
Yeah, but...for two hours l'm great.
After two hours, l might...

101
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,556
...accidentally kill him.

102
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,269
We're both afraid
we're going to kill the baby.

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,476
We made an agreement this week.

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,710
Monday to Friday,
l try not to kill him.

105
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,917
Saturday and Sunday,
you try not to.

106
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,879
l'm sorry.

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,591
l can't do it.

108
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,551
You should go.
You're gonna miss the plane.

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,713
The four of us are going to Atlantic City.
We will figure something out.

110
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,596
- Hello! Sorry l'm so late.
- Hi.

111
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,115
- Welcome aboard.
- Where is everybody?

112
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,398
- l thought l was late.
- Some problem with the baby.

113
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,757
- They're meeting us there.
- They are?

114
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,992
So, it's just going to be
the three of us for the whole flight?

115
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,357
Yeah, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,434
Oh, Samantha, you shouldn't have.

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,236
Ooh, it's pretty...

118
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,551
But what is it?

119
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,076
l'm sorry.
That was actually meant for Samantha.

120
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,710
- A pearl thong.
- For me? You naughty boy.

121
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,595
Did l tell you l've taken up knitting?
lt calms my nerves.

122
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,912
Practical and stimulating.
What will they think of next?

123
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,038
Knitting is the new yoga,
according to ''New York Magazine''.

124
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,997
l'm making these for Brady.

125
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,391
Maybe later, l'll give you
a pearl necklace to match.

126
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,597
My father gave me a beautiful
pearl necklace for my sweet sixteen.

127
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,355
We're talking about
the other kind of pearl necklace.

128
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,830
You know,
when a guy decorates your neck?

129
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,631
You're sure that Carrie said
they were coming down tonight?

130
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,237
''Knit one, purl two'' would never sound
the same to Charlotte again.

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,997
l need to go somewhere
that l've been looking forward to...

132
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,310
- Excuse me.
- No, no...

133
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,198
Time out, guys.

134
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,559
- Magda has offered to help Steve.
- That's not her job.

135
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,190
Throw some money
at the problem. Let's hit the road.

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,432
We've missed the jet.
How will we get there?

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,637
This is the final call for Atlantic City.

138
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,473
Passengers should board
for immediate departure.

139
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,509
This is pleasant.
l think we're on the old lady express.

140
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,877
- Right there.
- Where are all the old men?

141
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,838
Dead or married to 20-year-olds.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,710
l am so excited. l have been dreaming
about being alone with these.

143
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,474
l love that ''The New Yorker''
is your porn.

144
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,313
Will we still be friends
when we're this old?

145
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
- Sure.
- What do you mean, ''sure''?

146
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,149
l could barely get us together
for the weekend and we're all mobile.

147
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,756
Hey ''New Yorker'', l'm talking to you.

148
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,913
How are we gonna make it
to 70 if you've already zoned me out?

149
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,672
l'm listening. Talk fast.

150
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,311
Friendships don't magically last
40 years. You have to invest in them.

151
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,995
lt's like savings. You don't expect
to wake up when you're old

152
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,196
and find a big bucket of money.

153
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,557
- Did you finally open that lRA?
- No.

154
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,589
My point is, we need
an emotional retirement plan.

155
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,118
This is important, making time
for each other and taking trips like this.

156
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,229
As we can see, at the end of the line,
it's gonna be us ladies riding a bus.

157
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,670
l'm so happy right now.

158
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,593
Atlantic City boarding at gate 104.

159
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,910
Two ''New Yorker'' magazines
and two knit booties later,

160
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,039
we all arrived at
the understated Taj Mahal casino.

161
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,308
Here it is, ladies. Atlantic City.

162
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,677
Breathe deep and take it all in.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,231
Oh, God. l've missed this.

164
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,429
Oh, yeah.

165
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,149
- l thought you've never been here.
- l'm referring to the smoke.

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
- Look at the old ladies.
- This is nothing.

167
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,713
- You should've been on the bus.
- l wish l had.

168
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,836
A little harmless over-the-bra action

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,309
and Miss Prissy here
is running for a parachute.

170
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,313
Have you heard of a pearl necklace?

171
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,631
- l'm hitting the slots.
- l told Richard l'd stop by.

172
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,758
Not so fast. We'll take care of that later.

173
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,040
Right now, l'm taking my ladies
to dinner. That's right, it's on me.

174
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,589
Steak, you got it.
Lobster, coming right up.

175
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,709
Nothing is too fancy
for my Atlantic City ladies.

176
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,516
We have got to get a picture here.
This place is fantastic!

177
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,990
- ls that a euphemism for tacky?
- lt's so delirious.

178
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,755
- ls it bad to order more sour cream?
- No. You're on vacation.

179
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,151
l almost forgot about
Charlotte's present.

180
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,030
- lt's tomorrow, and l said l didn't...
- Relax. lt was in the gift shop for $3.99.

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,070
Old maid?
ls this supposed to be funny?

182
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,949
Of course. You couldn't be
farther from an old maid.

183
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,317
l remember her looking a lot older.
She looks about our age now.

184
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,471
Oh, she's had work done.

185
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,235
So here's where
the bathing beauties are hiding.

186
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,879
You flatterer.

187
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,952
My poker game's starting.
Would you like to join me?

188
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,351
- l think l'll stay with the girls.
- All right.

189
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,318
Richard, welcome back
to the Taj Mahal. How are you?

190
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,950
- l'm very well, Denise.
- Oh. Hello, Denise.

191
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,918
l'm Samantha. Pleasure to meet you.

192
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,551
lf you'll excuse me. Five gentlemen
are waiting to take my money.

193
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,631
- l'll walk you out.
- Thank you.

194
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,749
- That reminds me. l have to pump.
- Who picked this ''breastaurant''?

195
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,276
Cleavage is big here.
lt's part of the regional charm.

196
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,590
l propose a toast.

197
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,116
To the four of us. May we always...

198
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,352
l think l will join Richard. Goodnight.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,673
Ladies, would you like
the souvenir photograph?

200
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,989
- Oh!
- No.

201
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,312
lt was supposed to be the four of us.
Now one of us has a puss on.

202
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,072
Thanks.

203
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,311
When are we gonna gamble?

204
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,040
Baby needs new shoes.

205
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,439
OK, you won. Let's go find Samantha.

206
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,273
- l'm winning.
- That's why you should leave now.

207
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,714
l don't want to.

208
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,030
No one's offered us drinks yet.

209
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,668
- They're free.
- Hey, blondie.

210
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,109
- Blow my dice for luck.
- l don't know how to play. Let her do it.

211
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,239
- No, get the hot one.
- l want you, my lucky blonde. Blow.

212
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,877
- Five to stay alive!
- Come on.

213
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,234
- Fuck, l lost.
- Oh.

214
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,994
You just won me 12 grand, blondie.

215
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,479
Here.

216
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,079
Oh, my God.

217
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,710
- l can't accept this.
- lt's yours, blondie.

218
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,190
Get in the game. Have some fun.

219
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,517
- Are you going to gamble it?
- lt's $1,000.

220
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,355
- Did you hear that?
- lt could be a lot more.

221
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,829
''Lucky blonde.'' So sexist!

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,753
- What have you got to lose?
- $1,000.

223
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,911
That would not make me happy.

224
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,791
What would make us happy is to see
ZZ Top in the Magic Carpet Room.

225
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,239
l'm gonna pass. l've got pay-per-view
and a frozen Milky Way in my room.

226
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,631
What? A minute ago
you were bouncing off the walls.

227
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,031
l'm like this now.
l stop for a minute, l have to lie down.

228
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,317
- Goodnight.
- What? You...

229
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,553
You can't go to sleep.
ln five minutes Charlotte turns 35 again.

230
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,352
Goodnight.

231
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,599
Charlotte went to sleep that night
with a $1,000 chip on her shoulder.

232
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,719
The easier a game is to understand,
the greater the house edge.

233
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,950
Roulette is no exception.

234
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,511
The house edge on all bets
is 119, for 5 points...

235
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,433
Except for zero, double zero,
1, 2, 3 combination,

236
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,556
which carries a house edge of...

237
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,474
People go to casinos for the
same reason they go on blind dates...

238
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,316
...hoping to hit the jackpot. But mostly,
you wind up broke or alone in a bar.

239
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,268
lf we know the house always wins,

240
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,749
why gamble?

241
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,031
Next morning, Richard and Samantha
awoke in the Kublai Khan suite.

242
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,839
How long will you be with the girls?

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,436
All day, probably.
What are your plans?

244
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,989
l haven't decided yet.

245
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,519
- l'm sorry to interrupt, Richard.
- Not a problem, Terry.

246
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,389
Apparently, there were no old maids
at the Taj Mahal.

247
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,237
Terry, was it? Easy to remember.
Terry with her terry cloth towels.

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,473
Samantha had the distinct feeling
she was being Kublai conned.

249
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,392
Thank you.

250
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,713
You're not jealous
of a casino cleaning lady, are you?

251
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,637
lt's impressive you know the name
of every woman who works here.

252
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,112
l know the male employee's names.
Doesn't mean l'll sleep with them.

253
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,794
Aren't you keeping the girls?

254
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,394
Hi. l'm Samantha.

255
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,237
Can l get you some towels,
a chocolate for your pillow?

256
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,319
- A blow job.
- Yes, but not necessarily in that order.

257
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,831
Meanwhile, Charlotte's encore
35th birthday was off to a running start.

258
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,795
There she was, an old maid.

259
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,191
And it wasn't funny.

260
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,869
Three hours later, l was waiting
for our foursome to come together.

261
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,032
- Here's the spin.
- You're quite the spinster.

262
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,397
Sorry l'm late. l've been fucking
Richard for three hours.

263
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,915
- He's all fucked out.
- ls he breathing?

264
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,913
lt was defensive fucking.
l had no choice.

265
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,358
There are cheap-looking whores
flying at him from every direction.

266
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,119
There she was.

267
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,838
Miss Atlantic Slutty.

268
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,232
- Charlotte, are you in there?
- No, but l think ''Harlot'' is.

269
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,231
l didn't like what l packed,

270
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,630
so l picked something
at the casino shop.

271
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,759
Those are for women who have lost
their money and have to turn tricks.

272
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,593
- Does this gal gamble?
- Yeah!

273
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,639
No wonder the house always wins.
These guys are smothered in breasts.

274
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,997
What was l thinking bringing
a cheating man to Atlantic Titty.

275
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,111
- What you doing down there?
- lt's the pearl thong.

276
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,477
lt's good for foreplay.
Not good for post-play.

277
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,428
- You bet it all?
- You've gotta play big to win big.

278
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,750
Ma'am, would you like a hit?

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,514
- Over.
- Well, we just lost big.

280
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,399
lt's all part of the fun.
We need your chip.

281
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,553
- Who, me?
- You're sitting on $1,000.

282
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,678
- Don't make me hit the ATM again.
- Haven't we lost enough?

283
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,752
- We're just starting.
- Are you playing?

284
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,469
lf you're not playing,
you'll have to give up your seats.

285
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,039
lt's OK, we're leaving.

286
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,636
Would you mind taking our picture first?

287
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,270
- l'm not allowed to do that.
- lt's not Disneyland.

288
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,874
Hey, Red, move your fat ass!

289
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,033
- What did you just say to her?
- Who the hell do you think you are?

290
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,873
- Fuck you!
- Get in the game or get out.

291
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,235
Guys, let's go. lt's OK.

292
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,756
No! lt is most certainly not OK!

293
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,311
Listen, you big jerk!
Her ass isn't normally this big.

294
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,358
Thank you, l almost forgot.

295
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,035
My ass is fat because l just
had a baby, you asshole.

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,909
- What's your excuse?
- You having triplets?

297
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,558
Come on, let's go.

298
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,993
The Lennox Lewis match
sold out that night,

299
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,799
but our heavyweight fight
caused a bigger stir.

300
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,951
l think l'm gonna go upstairs.

301
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,429
They're just idiots. Don't go.

302
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,160
l'm tired. l'm sorry, Charlotte.
Happy birthday.

303
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,392
Stay. You can have my chip.

304
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,916
lt's Richard. Hello. Really?

305
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,075
- Should l talk to her?
- She'll be all right.

306
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,595
Sure. l'll go with one of the girls. Ciao.

307
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,832
He had a sudden conference call
and he can't go to the fight.

308
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,232
''Go with the girls.'' Right. So he
can get serviced by room service.

309
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,356
We'll see about that.

310
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,317
Shit!

311
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,916
Under other circumstances,
running stairs in a pearl thong

312
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,231
would have been Samantha's idea
of a good time.

313
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,871
By the eighth floor, somewhere
between pissed off and getting off,

314
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,600
she had to take it off.

315
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,430
Yes, thank you. l will.

316
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,431
No one's here.

317
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,869
- No one's here.
- What's going on?

318
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,998
l can't do this any more.
That's what's going on.

319
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,276
l ran up 11 flights of stairs

320
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
because l was sure
you were fucking someone.

321
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,355
- As you can see, l'm not.
- Right now.

322
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,035
Right now you're not.
But you were and you will again.

323
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,910
l can't spend my life running
up and down stairs wondering when.

324
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,110
l thought l could handle this, but l can't.
l'm too old. l'm 37, after all.

325
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,033
l told you l'd do my best
never to hurt you again, and l meant it.

326
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,399
- Right, your best.
- Samantha...l love you.

327
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,838
l love you too, Richard,
but l love me more.

328
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,071
And there, high above the casino,
Samantha pulled her highest bet,

329
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,073
her heart, off the table.

330
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,949
Just when Samantha thought
she might have folded too soon...

331
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,072
One drink here, then we should see
the boardwalk before it's dark.

332
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,676
- Hey, can we buy you a drink?
- Like to sit down?

333
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,196
- No, we're fine.
- That would be lovely.

334
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,557
- You having a good time?
- Yes, today's my birthday.

335
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,315
- Oh, now it's your birthday.
- Happy birthday.

336
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,074
- Yeah.
- What are your names?

337
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,959
Can you just...wait one second?

338
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,998
- What is the point of this?
- You wanted a drink.

339
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,391
Can l have a word with you, alone?

340
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,870
Sure. We'll be right back.

341
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,193
lt's Charlotte.

342
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,078
- The one in the black's cute.
- l didn't leave Manhattan

343
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,515
to double-date two guys
we'll never see again.

344
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,955
You didn't even talk to them.

345
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,079
l don't want to. l would rather have
a real conversation with you.

346
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,073
Can't we have one drink?
lt might be fun.

347
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,356
- Let's go.
- They're gone.

348
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,193
Well, problem solved.

349
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,673
20 minutes later, we were
out of the dark and into the light.

350
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,435
lsn't this amazing?
lt's like a postcard from the '20s.

351
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,077
- What's the harm in one drink?
- l can't believe you're still upset.

352
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,073
What role did you think
they were going to play in our lives?

353
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,754
- We might have hit it off.
- Come on.

354
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,152
Look at the odds. How many guys
do we ever hit it off with?

355
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,995
Very few, and even if we do,
those relationships don't last.

356
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,277
Even if they did, men die first.
We're back where we started.

357
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,673
l say we skip all the drama
and enjoy each other's company...now.

358
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,317
But l don't want to skip
all the drama. That's life.

359
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,632
That's everything. That's relationships
and anniversaries and kids.

360
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,950
l want all that, in addition to my friends.

361
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,999
That sounds wonderful,
but don't bank on it happening.

362
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,074
You must be getting cold.
l'll meet you back at the hotel.

363
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,435
l'm going to get some saltwater taffy.

364
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,639
- Are you sure?
- l'm dying for it.

365
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,595
Watch the tramcar, please.

366
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,031
By my fifth piece
of peppermint taffy, l realised...

367
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,318
maybe l wasn't banking on my friends.
l was hiding in them.

368
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,756
Ready for a swim?
Got your bathing suit on under there.

369
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,230
Oh yeah, it's a bikini. You'll love it.

370
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,709
l was hoping for a skinny dip.

371
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,670
There is nothing skinny about
either of us. Should we go back?

372
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,676
- ln a minute. lt's almost sunset.
- You and your pink sky.

373
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,519
Then again, maybe there are
some things worth gambling on.

374
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,919
Back inside, l had a thought.
To hit the jackpot in the future,

375
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,311
you might have to bet on
where you are in the present.

376
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,517
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.

377
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,875
What happens after 36?

378
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,998
l don't know.
l guess you fall off the table.

379
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,360
All right, no more bets. Here we go.

380
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,235
29.

381
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,115
The winner is...number 29.

382
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,193
Well...

383
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,392
l can't believe you gambled
all that money. We could be in a limo.

384
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,109
You told me to.
l thought we were taking the jet.

385
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,509
You couldn't have broken up tomorrow?

386
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,875
And lose my dignity?

387
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,673
Don't let me have any more of these.

388
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,876
Anyone up for playing Old Maid?

389
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,871
Aren't we?

390
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,398
- l'm in.
- l'm in. Oh, wait!

391
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,876
- Oh, my God!
- No.

392
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,112
Excuse me.
Would you mind taking our picture?

393
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,430
This is the moment
we'll want to remember.

394
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,156
Turns out, it was.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
