1
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,196
ln the life of a New Yorker,

2
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,191
there are unpleasant things

3
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,112
one has to face.

4
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,236
Having your purse stolen,

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,356
random public urination...

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,713
...and seeing a gay friend's boyfriend
in a Broadway revue.

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,077
- l understand the three drink minimum.
- You're not enjoying the revue?

8
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,274
l'm more concerned about
my review in ''The Times''.

9
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,955
Your book's reviewed this week.
You must be so excited.

10
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,997
More like terrified.

11
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,153
Michiko Kakutani.
She's ''The Times'' book critic.

12
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,550
l thought you were suggesting
an appetizer.

13
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,917
- She's brilliant and tough.
- And impossible to pronounce.

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,595
l think they're bringing us home.

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,115
How could you not love this?
My boyfriend is gorgeous.

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,794
He can kick.

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,399
Bravo!

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,076
lsn't he great?

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,196
l have to go to the ladies' room.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,316
They're doing an encore.

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,277
l have to go.

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,591
Broadway's best, Debbie Cass.

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,035
Who would have thought the phrase

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,156
''See your cousin Debbie's club act''

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,117
could contain such horror?

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,078
l thought there'd be one straight guy.

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,357
lf not in the audience, behind the bar.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,877
Hold on. Tomorrow we're gonna cruise

29
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,998
the cute pretzel guys at Village Square.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,436
ls that as sad as that just sounded?

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,879
l used to have a thing for the
Amish guys who make hairbrushes.

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,553
Yeah.

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,912
- You're Carrie Bradshaw.
- Yeah. Have we met?

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,913
- l recognise you from your column.
- Oh.

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,992
And l went out with Aidan after you.

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,750
There l was worried about ''The Times'',
when l'd already been reviewed.

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,391
l'm telling you it was a hit-and-run.
No, a face-and-run.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,630
Make it again.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,509
- That ain't good.
- You're being over-sensitive.

40
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,912
lt was a facial spasm. A lot of people
have them, like Bell's palsy.

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,234
lt was not Bell's palsy.
lt was a full frontal attack of the face.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,269
Like, ''Wow, was he messed up.
You really screwed him up good.''

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,353
- What did you say to her?
- l didn't have time. She ran out.

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,957
- Fuck that fucking face girl.
- When you put it like that...

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,873
l haven't slept for days.
Brady's been crying non-stop.

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,079
- Poor thing. Can l do anything?
- Put me out of my misery.

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,719
ls he sick?

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,557
He's not sick. He's not hungry.
He's not teething. He wants to scream.

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,838
l can't please him. lf he was 35,
this is when we would break up.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,991
He has issues.

51
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,119
This 13-pound meatloaf is pushing
me over the edge. l feel disgusting.

52
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,236
My clothes smell like barf.

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,278
l don't have time for a shower,
much less a haircut.

54
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,798
That reminds me. l have to confirm my
appointment at the John Mandy Salon.

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,589
You have no idea how hard it was
to get this appointment.

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,675
Samantha Jones. l'm calling
to confirm my appointment Saturday

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,594
for a cut and colour with John. Thanks.

58
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,398
Crisis averted.

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,277
Magda's waiting for me.
Time to go back to prison.

60
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,318
- Let me come. l can help.
- You don't have to.

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,996
l have a few questions. l'm meeting
the divorce lawyer on Monday.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,072
Ask him if l could get
an injunction to stop a face.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,673
Who'd you get?

64
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,513
Matthew Bloom
of Bloom & Goldenblatt.

65
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,638
- What's he like?
- He's smart, tough.

66
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,951
ls he tough enough
to beat Bunny to a pulp?

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,076
- Yeah.
- Good.

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,835
OK. Bye, guys. Have a nice day.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,072
Miranda, call me if you need anything.

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,312
Damn. Why is that girl
still bothering me?

71
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,439
Let it go. lf l worried
what every bitch says about me,

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,239
l'd never leave the house.

73
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,960
Monday morning,
Charlotte met her lawyer.

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,078
He was smart, tough...
and gorgeous.

75
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,196
You said you had bad feelings

76
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,510
about your mother-in-law,
Bunny MacDougal.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,272
Did l?

78
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,398
l get a sense from her lawyer
this is gonna be a battle.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,633
lt was a battle all right.
The battle of the Charlottes.

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,554
Charlotte who wanted to seem
attractive to her adorable lawyer.

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,269
And Charlotte who wanted to kick
Bunny MacDougal's ass.

82
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,193
Mrs MacDougal's been hiding assets

83
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,956
to make sure
you don't get...anything.

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,636
l just really want what was promised.
My apartment.

85
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,872
Technically it's not yours.
Trey's family owns it.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,794
She was careful to make sure
your name wasn't on the deed.

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,076
Trey gave me that apartment.

88
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,708
Sorry. Usually l'm very refined.

89
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,350
With your husband out of the country,
you need to be more specific.

90
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,274
Charlotte realised she could never be
as ugly as she needed to be

91
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,273
in front of a man
she considered so handsome.

92
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,477
Sorry to bust in.
There's a bagel with my name on it.

93
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,474
Harry Goldenblatt. Charlotte York.
l'm handling her divorce.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,871
How you doing?
You're in the right hands.

95
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,553
He's a killer.

96
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,716
Who the hell ordered blueberry?
l'm talking to Thelma about this.

97
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,836
Good luck to you.

98
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,990
ls he a killer too?

99
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,232
Just like that,
Charlotte changed lawyers.

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,671
After a gruelling day, including
leg, eyebrow and bikini waxes,

101
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,469
Samantha decided to reward herself
with a night of R and R.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,959
Unfortunately, her favourite vibrator
needed a little CPR.

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,869
Brady, please. What?
l cannot read your mind.

104
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,713
- Who is it?
- 4D.

105
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,796
lt's 2:30 in the morning.

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,669
- l know. l'm sorry.
- You've got to stop that baby.

107
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,756
l said l was sorry, but l have a baby.
Sometimes babies make noise.

108
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,876
l know. l have a baby too.

109
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,635
lf you bothered to say hello,
you would know that.

110
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,349
l'm Kendall. My baby is Alika.
Have a nice night.

111
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,071
Evidently, Miranda had been getting
bad reviews from her own building.

112
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,789
As for my review, l was pretty nervous.

113
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,712
- ''Times''.
- Thank you.

114
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,839
l hadn't been up this early
since Princess Diana's wedding.

115
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,591
Good morning.

116
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,750
''All in all, l enjoyed Ms Bradshaw's
sharp, funny, finely drawn world,

117
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,277
''where single women rule
and the men are disposable.''

118
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,793
Ouch.

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,199
l believe what you have is a rave review
from ''The New York Times''.

120
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,478
''The men are disposable''?
l don't dispose of men, do l?

121
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,313
- No.
- Michiko Kakutani thinks so.

122
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,278
- l always agree with her.
- Fuck her.

123
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,193
- No sleep again?
- lt was a good night.

124
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,474
l got a whole hour.

125
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,076
l can't believe
l have to pretend to be a lawyer now.

126
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,676
- Can l wear a baseball cap to work?
- With what shoes?

127
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,599
l'm going on about Michiko Kakutani

128
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,751
when you have real problems.

129
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,196
- Can l obsess for another minute?
- Don't say her name.

130
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,475
lt'll push me over the edge.

131
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,031
Some of the men in the book
are maybe a little disposable.

132
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,159
This makes it sound like
l think men are disposable in life.

133
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,440
- What? What's with the pause?
- l'm sorry. l fell asleep for a second.

134
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,114
That's a terrible thing to think.

135
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,953
That's what the face meant.

136
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,795
Do you think that Aidan thinks
l think he was disposable?

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,269
You did not throw Aidan away.

138
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,396
Good morning.

139
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,950
That girl thinks l did.
He must have said something to her.

140
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,917
Where else would she get it?

141
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,392
Steve and Aidan are close. Has Steve
said anything? Does Steve hate me?

142
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,836
You're spinning. He doesn't hate you.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,639
How come l never see him?

144
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,758
Because l have to keep him away.

145
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,630
lf l see him, l'll ask him to marry me
to give me some help.

146
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,759
l worked hard taking care of Aidan's
feelings. Mention that to Steve.

147
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,309
- lf Aidan told Steve...
- You know what?

148
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,313
Maybe you should call Samantha.

149
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,393
She has all kinds of time
to talk about this stuff.

150
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,996
l know it's me
and l'm jealous of her free time.

151
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,312
lf she could just once acknowledge
that l've had a baby.

152
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,920
lt's not enough
l've alienated my neighbour.

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,436
- l'm alienating my friends.
- You're not alienating anyone.

154
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,273
Tell that to 4D.
She's pissed off l don't know her name.

155
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,908
- Do you know your neighbours?
- Please.

156
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,358
- l'm a bad neighbour and mother.
- Not true. You're doing great.

157
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,195
- Yeah, right.
- You're having a bad week.

158
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,751
- Can l do anything to help?
- That helps. Just asking.

159
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,879
l'm late. l gotta go.
Congratulations on the review!

160
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,917
Yeah.

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,315
Why is it that we only believe the
negative things people say about us?

162
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,358
No matter
how much evidence to the contrary.

163
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,273
A neighbour, a face, an ex-boyfriend

164
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,432
can cancel out
everything we thought was true.

165
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,630
When it comes to life and love,
why do we believe our worst reviews?

166
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,398
After a long day in court,
Miranda faced another jury.

167
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,917
Don't cry.

168
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,989
At City Bakery, Samantha and l
were reviewing the desserts.

169
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,676
Delish... l'll buy you dessert
if you do something for me.

170
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,674
- l'm not eating desserts this week.
- Best brownies in New York.

171
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,319
Bastard.

172
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,596
l'll take a brownie.

173
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,514
- What do you need?
- lt's about Miranda and the baby.

174
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,717
- Forget the brownie.
- No, she'll take it.

175
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,950
Babies are not my scene.

176
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,755
This one sounds like an asshole.

177
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,480
You can't call a baby an asshole.

178
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,993
She called it a meatloaf.

179
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,197
l don't think it would kill us
to be more supportive.

180
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,069
All right. When he's in college,
l'll take him for a drink

181
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,071
and flirt with his friends.

182
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,959
You could stop by tomorrow and say,

183
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,076
''l hear you had a baby.
How's it going?''

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,879
l have no time. l'm booked all day.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,595
l have my hair appointment
and l'm returning a vibrator.

186
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,318
Hair and a vibrator.

187
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,359
Yes. That is my life
and l don't have to justify it.

188
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,476
l hate it when people have babies

189
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,393
and expect you to turn into
a Norman Rockwell painting.

190
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,869
We're not talking about people.

191
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,555
We're talking about our friend,
and she's sinking.

192
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,954
So Miranda's like Venice?

193
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,475
That'll be $14.20.

194
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,073
She's paying for the brownie.

195
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,389
Carrie?

196
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,189
Hey, Julia. Hi.

197
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,990
This is Samantha. This is Julia Afton.
We work at ''Vogue''.

198
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,473
She gets to run in once a month
while l'm chained to Anna Wintour.

199
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,916
- Oh, there's my friend. Nina!
- l'm here.

200
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,353
- About time.
- Sorry, l'm late.

201
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,792
Carrie. Hi.

202
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,793
There l was,
face to face with the face girl.

203
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,918
- How do you know each other?
- l'll tell you over lunch.

204
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,198
- Nina Katz? Samantha Jones.
- Nice to see you again.

205
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,636
Can we eat? l am starvation central.

206
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,268
- See ya.
- Bye, Carrie.

207
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,639
- How do you know Nina Katz?
- How do you know her?

208
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,475
Everybody knows her. She's
the booker for ''Saturday Night Live''.

209
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,111
- She's also the face girl.
- No. Nina Katz is the...

210
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,159
Exactly. Great, that face
will be all over ''Vogue''.

211
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,630
Not to mention ''SNL''.
Nina Katz loves to talk.

212
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,759
- $15.30.
- l'm going to need a brownie as well.

213
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,039
The next day,
Samantha did some personal shopping.

214
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,077
Very personal.

215
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,910
- May l help you?
- Yes.

216
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,071
l'd like to return this vibrator.

217
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,755
- We don't sell vibrators.
- l bought it here six months ago.

218
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,832
That's not a vibrator.
lt's a neck massager.

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,831
No, it's a vibrator.

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,391
Sharper lmage doesn't sell vibrators.
lt's a neck massager.

221
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,109
Women buy these
to help their sore necks?

222
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,555
lt's a neck massager.

223
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,359
Fine. l'd like to return
this neck massager.

224
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,712
- What's wrong with it?
- lt failed to get me off.

225
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,192
lt has a warranty and it stopped.
lt made the saddest little sound.

226
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,875
- Perhaps you wore it out.
- lt wouldn't be the first.

227
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,716
Fine. Just find another
and go to the cashier.

228
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,157
l know a man in desperate need
of a neck massage.

229
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,469
You don't want that one.
Too many bells and whistles.

230
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,316
That one works against you.

231
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,552
lf we wanted to work that hard,
we'd get a man.

232
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,874
Samantha instantly established herself
as the Michiko Kakutani of vibrators.

233
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,239
- That one actually is a back massager.
- Not if you mount it.

234
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,073
Absolutely not.
That will burn your clit.

235
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,755
- Even with underwear?
- Even with ski pants.

236
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,837
l brought you something.

237
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,879
lt belongs to Alika.
An oscillating chair.

238
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,990
- lt helps.
- Come on in.

239
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,355
Hey there, Mr Mouth.

240
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,956
What have you got to say
that is so important?

241
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,918
l'm sorry. lt's been non-stop.

242
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,595
This chair is a little controversial.

243
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,878
But l don't give a shit.
lt stopped my baby from crying.

244
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,874
l was about ready to throw myself
off the fire escape.

245
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,315
Sounds good.

246
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,788
Oh, my God. The chair is a genius.

247
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,080
l don't know. Something about
the vibration. They love it.

248
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,879
Alika could sit in it for hours.

249
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,634
How come you haven't heard of this?

250
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,075
Don't your girlfriends have babies?

251
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,630
- No, l'm the only one.
- Then you're screwed.

252
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,439
They've been very helpful.

253
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,512
lf they don't have kids,
they don't have a clue.

254
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,949
Miranda, you're not a bad mother.
You just didn't have the chair.

255
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,878
Thank you...

256
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,678
...Kendall.

257
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,278
Three blissful baby hours later...

258
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,910
- Samantha, what are you doing here?
- l'm not Samantha. You are.

259
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,596
You have a 5:30 appointment
at the John Mandy Salon. Go.

260
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,638
What? l can't take your...

261
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,395
l'm counting to five
then changing my mind.

262
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,869
- You want to babysit?
- Five, four...

263
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,715
l don't know what to say.
l can't believe it.

264
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,316
Neither can l but here l am.
Mary fuckin' Poppins.

265
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,152
Thank you.

266
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,639
The numbers are on the fridge.
Don't take him out of that chair.

267
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,360
lt's the only thing that keeps him quiet.

268
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,074
And don't call boys.

269
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,118
Well...you don't look so bad.

270
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,834
Meanwhile, in a chair across town,

271
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,356
l was enjoying an afternoon
of absolutely nothing.

272
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,999
Do you think Nina Katz
is telling random celebrity hosts

273
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,913
that l'm the bad break-up girlfriend?

274
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,230
- What?
- You said she loved to talk.

275
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,996
Do you think she's trashing me
to Gwyneth Paltrow or lan McKellen?

276
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,355
You can't be serious.

277
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,830
l don't flatter myself
that Gwyneth Paltrow or lan McKellen

278
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,390
would be interested in my love life,
but... Are you at a zoo?

279
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,676
No. Thanks to you, l'm at Miranda's.

280
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,355
Brady won't stop screaming
and l don't know what to do.

281
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,478
- You're at Miranda's?
- l sent her to get my haircut.

282
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,349
- That was nice.
- Yes. Now l'm being punished.

283
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,556
- He's not hurt?
- No.

284
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,631
- Wet?
- No.

285
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,351
- l don't know what his problem is.
- He's an asshole.

286
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,557
- Maybe you should call Miranda.
- l will not.

287
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,837
lt took me months to get that
appointment. Someone should benefit.

288
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,197
l'll find some way
to keep this kid quiet. Goodbye.

289
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,797
- What about Nina?
- Maybe Charlotte has time to talk.

290
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,190
l have a screaming baby on my hands.

291
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,553
What? What do you need?

292
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,070
Well...that's better.

293
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,595
- ls everything OK?
- Absolutely.

294
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,718
- The chair broke, but shit happens.
- The chair broke?

295
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,832
But what did you...? l mean, did he...?

296
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,070
That better be brand new.

297
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,273
Monday morning,
Harry Goldenblatt did his best

298
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,398
to make sure Bunny
didn't hop all over Charlotte.

299
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,916
Mrs MacDougal is willing to offer
her son's collection

300
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,275
of mint condition, silver buffalo coins.

301
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,398
She's not going to settle
for a coin collection.

302
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,710
According to the pre-nup...

303
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,111
This is ridiculous.
Trey gave me that apartment.

304
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,593
She gave him her word.
Till death do them part.

305
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,558
- lf you have something to say...
- l shall.

306
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,030
- l strongly recommend...
- Allan, hush.

307
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,910
You took a vow. When things
didn't go your way, you broke it.

308
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,436
l come from a generation of women
that valued marriage.

309
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,795
We believed in for better or worse,

310
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,191
not for better
or until the road gets rocky.

311
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,352
When l think of the heartache

312
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,478
and shame you caused my dear boy,

313
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,394
l'm amazed you could
even look me in the face.

314
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,630
Charlotte couldn't fight any more.

315
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,758
lt seemed she'd been fighting
for this marriage forever.

316
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,879
Be advised, young lady.
l'm prepared to go to court.

317
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,434
lt's the coin collection.
Take it or leave it.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,354
Our office just received a telegram
from Scotland

319
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,511
from Dr MacDougal.
Shall l read it?

320
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,148
By all means.

321
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
Charlotte York was
a wonderful wife. Stop.

322
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,830
She did nothing wrong. Stop.

323
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,151
Give her everything she wants. Stop.

324
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,630
Seriously, Mother. Stop.

325
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,516
That's the thing about reviews.

326
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,878
When you least expect it,
you get a rave.

327
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,718
- Just the apartment.
- l'll have papers drawn up

328
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,155
so Mrs MacDougal
can transfer the deed.

329
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,595
Even though things were ugly,

330
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,194
Charlotte didn't want them
to end that way.

331
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,796
l'm sorry things didn't work out better
for all of us.

332
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,678
Allan.

333
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,874
Charlotte realised there was
no fairy-tale divorce, either.

334
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,998
Ding dong, the witch is dead.

335
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,030
Farther uptown,
still unable to let it go,

336
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,398
Nina Katz and that face
had driven me to face my worst fear.

337
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,835
l know l was vague on the phone.

338
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,993
Miranda, right? She doesn't want me
calling so much. lt's fine.

339
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,878
lt's not about Miranda.

340
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,036
How does Aidan feel about me?

341
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,079
You're not going to try
to get back together, are you?

342
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,756
No, but that answers any question
l had about how you feel.

343
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,113
- Does he hate me?
- No, but come on. lt was pretty bad.

344
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,430
How bad, Steve?

345
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,672
- Steve, the ball.
- Sorry.

346
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,709
- How is he now?
- Great. He's great.

347
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,713
- Good.
- He's great...now.

348
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,317
But back then
he couldn't get out of bed for...

349
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,592
- Days, weeks?
- A month. l brought him chicken wings.

350
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,116
- Oh, Christ.
- l don't mean to make you feel bad.

351
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,353
- Well...a month?
- Yeah, he was devastated.

352
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,069
He lost his ability
to open up and trust women.

353
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,674
He lost his ability to open up
and trust women. Did he tell you that?

354
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,230
Guys don't talk about
shit like that. We ate wings.

355
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,277
Nina, who he was dating, told me.

356
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,318
We're looking for
the cute pretzel guys.

357
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,755
You never wanted to cruise guys
when l was available.

358
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,357
This is about clarity. That Nina Katz
face chick is hitting too close to home.

359
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,159
l want to tell her my side
of the break-up story.

360
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,232
- You know what you and Aidan had.
- l do, but she doesn't.

361
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,960
She's yip-yapping her version
all over town.

362
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,829
lt takes one bad review to cancel
all the good word of mouth.

363
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,912
- What do you think of Marcus?
- Nice.

364
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,277
Relationships are complicated.
You can't reduce them to a face.

365
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,149
- l know Aidan has feelings...
- OK, stop.

366
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,276
l am done.

367
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,468
l've listened to you talk about Aidan
for ten blocks and two years.

368
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,790
l've been a wonderful audience.

369
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,033
l ask you about my Marcus,
and all l get is ''nice''.

370
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,313
l'm sorry.

371
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,519
How many relationships have l been in
since you've known me?

372
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,353
Real or imaginary?

373
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,833
Your opinion means a lot to me.
You're my <i>machico caca matza.</i>

374
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,753
You want me to review
your relationship?

375
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,675
- lmmediately, if not sooner.
- l like that he makes you happy.

376
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,353
Oh, my God.

377
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,669
Carrie.

378
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,360
One more time,
you are officially stalking me.

379
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,799
Hi, l'm Heather.

380
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,509
Heather Graham, l know.
l love you. l'm Stanford Blatch.

381
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,310
- Heather, this is Carrie Bradshaw.
- Carrie Bradshaw. Really?

382
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,634
OK, Nina...

383
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,509
l need to talk to you for a second,
alone, if l can.

384
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,116
- Ms Graham, may l buy you a pretzel?
- OK.

385
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,396
- Get me one.
- A man or a pretzel.

386
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,518
- Whatever has less carbs.
- Right.

387
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,116
l get the sense that you have a feeling

388
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,430
about what happened with Aidan.

389
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,875
l want to clear something up.

390
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,430
Break-ups are awful,
and they are private.

391
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,550
They are not necessarily symptomatic
of what two people had.

392
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,669
l loved Aidan very much.

393
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,515
l would never have done anything
to deliberately hurt him.

394
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,795
OK.

395
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,476
Suddenly, l realised the critic
l was most afraid of wasn't Nina Katz.

396
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,278
lt was me.

397
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,395
So...

398
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,959
...bye.

399
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,032
The truth is at any moment,

400
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,239
someone somewhere
could be making a face about you.

401
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,471
lt's the reviews you give yourself
that matter.

402
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,189
l'm with Heather and l'm like,
''What do we talk about?''

403
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,158
- She's pretty.
- But we had nothing to talk about

404
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,232
but pretzels, so l said...

405
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,470
Sorry. Come on.

406
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,599
l said, ''Have you been to Bavaria?
They make the best pretzels.''



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
