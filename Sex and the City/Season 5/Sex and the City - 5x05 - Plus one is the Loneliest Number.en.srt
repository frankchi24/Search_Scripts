1
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,396
There is one day even the most cynical
New York woman

2
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,755
dreams of all her life.

3
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,914
lt'll be fabulous. White flowers,
tablecloths, food. W-H-l-T-E.

4
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,036
She imagines what she'll wear,

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,156
the photographers, the toasts.

6
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,276
Everybody's celebrating the fact

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,795
that she found...a publisher.

8
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,916
lt's her book release party.

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,277
This is a sexy event.
Don't be afraid to use colour.

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,955
l'm not afraid of anything.
How about pink?

11
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,348
Hot pink.

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,873
Pink!

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,550
lsn't it perfect?

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,110
- lt's huge.
- Huge space, huge book.

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,350
- Who's coming?
- Everyone.

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,114
- This is cuckoo.
- Guest list.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,115
When your career is better than ever,
it's hard not to get a big head.

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,000
Miranda was back at the office.

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,310
She was politically incorrectly

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,277
happy to be there.

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,000
l have Walker Lewis calling.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,912
l'll take that.

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,790
Miranda and Walker had shared one
night of great sex BC - before child.

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,996
l'm glad l wasn't waiting for your call.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,551
- l'm glad you remember me.
- Oh, l remember you.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,917
l remember you too.
l remember you naked.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,275
So, how you been?

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,479
- What's new with you?
- Nothing much. How about you?

29
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,757
l was hoping to take you
on a belated second date.

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,478
How about Thursday?

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,598
She invited him to be
her plus one at the book party.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,309
She knew she'd be minus one.
Magda had agreed to baby-sit.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,952
Charlotte was working on her perfect
plus one. Justin Anderson lll.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,068
Thanks for another lovely lunch
and for walking me home.

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,992
My pleasure.

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,917
Justin was just in time.

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,232
Charlotte was finally ready
for a new relationship.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,916
- Good afternoon, Mrs Collier.
- Yes, it certainly was.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,675
She's one of the friendly ones.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,796
l'd better get back to work.

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,633
OK, bye.

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,349
l was in a new relationship too...
with my publisher.

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,999
OK. Bye-bye.

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,234
l am so excited about this party.
Seriously, we are so golden.

45
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,356
People want to come to this book party.

46
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,355
All of Condé Nast, including ''GQ'',
which has actual straight men.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,476
Someone better kiss me at this thing.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,315
lt's not about selling books.
lt's about finding you a boyfriend.

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,553
Hey, Courtney. l didn't know
you had somebody in here. Sorry.

50
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,439
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Using the Xerox machine.

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,239
- Finished your second book?
- No, my suicide note.

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,358
- Would you like a ''save the day'' card?
- Please.

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,192
- You know each other?
- No.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,114
Carrie Bradshaw. Her book of essays
comes out this week.

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,474
Very exciting.

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,438
Jack Berger.
We published his first book last year.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,591
Your name is Berger?

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,799
Never heard of me. What did l say
about your publicity department?

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,476
- Not your primary market.
- Because she's not immediate family.

60
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,790
Jack wrote a comic novel
that speaks to men

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,235
the way your column
speaks to women.

62
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,755
Men don't buy comic novels.
That's the flaw.

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,038
- What's your book?
- Half off. That's what it's called now.

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,237
Sometimes it's 75 cents
on a card table on 6th Avenue.

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,834
- Next to the incense.
- Exactly.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,514
You should talk.
He knows the whole deal.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,274
The party, the signings, the tour.

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,678
Minutes later, Jack Berger and l
slowed down for a little fast food.

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
l'm not so much feeding them
as hitting them.

70
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,868
l see.

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,592
Did the man have repressed anger or
dislike pigeons, the woman wondered.

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,912
The woman is tripping over
the term ''repressed''.

73
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,799
l'm not bitter.
l'm trying it on for size.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,157
- l think it fits.
- Yeah? A little tight in the crotch.

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,034
You're saying crotch to me?
We just met.

76
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,031
Along the sleeve?

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,877
- Not as funny.
- See, it had to be crotch.

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,953
- How's that strawberry shake?
- Very tasty, thank you.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,270
l can't believe you ordered strawberry.

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,749
Who orders strawberry
after the age of 11?

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,593
You have so much to learn
about women.

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,830
That's what a few reviewers said.

83
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,195
What's next?
How long do l have you for?

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,352
What else is on your agenda?

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,512
l've gotta pick up dry cleaning.
Would it be weird for you to come?

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,433
lt would be weird for you to send me.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,116
Nice place, around the corner.
Family joint. They have an abacus.

88
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,877
We were having
one of those great first dates

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,635
you can only have
when it's not an actual date.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,877
Thank you.

91
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,352
What's that?

92
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,637
lt's stupid. l collect playing cards.
They're all over the city.

93
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,510
- Really? l never noticed.
- You will now. That's how it works.

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,393
l'm hoping to get a full deck.
lnsert the obvious joke here.

95
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,279
l didn't have a two of hearts.

96
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,955
- lt's a good day.
- Yes, it is.

97
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,719
Hey, Berger.

98
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,190
- We're on a last name basis now?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,797
Berger. Would you, by any chance,

100
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,157
want to be my plus one on Thursday?

101
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,437
lt's my book party
and l don't have a date.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,558
You'll have the clean shirt and all...

103
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,832
l would love that...

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,959
but my girlfriend's parents
are visiting and staying with us.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,068
lt was like a bomb that kept exploding.

106
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,279
l have a girlfriend.
We live together.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,671
This whole flirtation's
in your head.

108
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,231
- He should've mentioned her earlier.
- But not too early. l hate that.

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,154
''l have a girlfriend.''
l just asked if that seat was taken.

110
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,517
- That guy's a jerk.
- l don't think he is.

111
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,832
l sparked with this person.
l never spark.

112
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,916
l wonder how happy they are.

113
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,192
This is not a good side of me.

114
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,874
What's the point if they're not available?

115
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,349
lt's the universe telling you
they're out there.

116
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,636
lt's telling you
the good ones are taken.

117
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,429
All the good ones
are coming to the party.

118
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,511
What did he look like?

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,992
l can't remember. That happens
when l really like someone.

120
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,833
l just remember a feeling.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,390
Or l was so hungry for a spark,
l hallucinated a man.

122
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,596
Stop! You're the toast of the town.

123
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,673
Finish your salad
and l'll treat you to a little Botox.

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,513
- You say that like everybody does it.
- They will.

125
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,150
- l'd rather crawl into bed.
- A little perspective.

126
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,029
You have a fun, exciting,
intellectually stimulating career.

127
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,873
There's about to be
a huge soiree in your honour.

128
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,510
- l'll be without a plus one.
- l'll be your plus one.

129
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,912
He should've said ''we'' something.
We go to this dry cleaners.

130
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,119
- We might be breaking up soon.
- l didn't tell Walker l had a baby.

131
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,999
- How could you not mention it?
- lt didn't come up.

132
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,038
lf he'd asked,
''Have you given birth recently?'',

133
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,509
l would have said, ''Define recently.''

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,671
- You have to tell him.
- l will.

135
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,910
l don't want it to change everything.

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,355
lf l didn't have a baby,
we'd be dating.

137
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,115
lf Carrie's guy didn't have a girlfriend,
she'd be dating him.

138
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,068
- But he does.
- Thanks for bringing that up again.

139
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,155
ln New York, you're always looking for
a job, a boyfriend or an apartment.

140
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,676
Let's say you have two out of three
and they're fabulous.

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,990
Why do we let the thing we don't have

142
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,152
affect how we feel about
all the things we do have?

143
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,472
Why does one minus a plus one
feel like it adds up to zero?

144
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,749
Samantha didn't need a man
to make her feel positive.

145
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,117
She did need a man
to inject her forehead every so often.

146
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,193
We warn our patients
that some people find it difficult

147
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,148
to register emotion on their faces
after the injections.

148
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,551
You might have to say,
''l am so angry.''

149
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,156
Ms Jones is familiar with the procedure.

150
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,355
New ones?

151
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,277
Samantha could handle the stress
of her job, but not stress lines.

152
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,433
Before the Botox, have you thought
about a freshening chemical peel?

153
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,071
lt takes 15 minutes and can make
you look 10 to 20 years younger.

154
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,109
15 minutes later,
Samantha seemed to have it all...

155
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,113
...peeled off.

156
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,588
There are times
when a woman relishes being alone.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,718
Oh, my God.

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,429
Usually when you run into
someone you don't want to see.

159
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,674
ln my case it was Enid,
my editor at ''Vogue'', also alone.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,991
- Carrie.
- Oh...

161
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,918
Enid, hi.

162
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,556
- How are you?
- Good.

163
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,475
- Are you meeting someone?
- l'm grabbing a bite.

164
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,315
- Would you like to...?
- No, not if you're working.

165
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,153
- l was just reading.
- Hello.

166
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,069
- Hi.
- ''Hello'' is what you're...

167
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,792
- Oh...reading. Yes.
- Do you really want company?

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,478
Sure. l just ordered.

169
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,270
This way l can expense it.

170
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,709
Right.

171
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,799
We ran out of ''Vogue'' stuff to talk
about midway through our salads.

172
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,838
- Do you live in the neighbourhood?
- No.

173
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,714
- But the man l'm seeing does.
- Oh, so there's a man.

174
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,156
- Yes, there is a man.
- That's great.

175
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,278
You have a successful career
and a relationship.

176
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,991
l was worried women only get
one or the other,

177
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,833
but you have it all.

178
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,116
Give me something here.
l'm working my ass off.

179
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,435
To speak in magazine copy,
l have it all. On the East side.

180
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,355
He has someone else on the West side.
The park provides a buffer.

181
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,153
So...you're OK with that?

182
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,797
Yes. l don't have time
for a full-time man. l have a full-time job.

183
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,159
That's the key. Stop expecting
it to look like what you thought.

184
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,313
That's true of the fall lines
and true of relationships.

185
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,035
Her little tip earned Enid
one invitation to my party.

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,830
That night, Charlotte let
her perfect plus one have it all.

187
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,919
She even let him stay the night
in her perfect pre-war apartment.

188
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,196
- l ordered breakfast.
- You're too good to be true.

189
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,479
Unfortunately, Charlotte was about
to get much more than she ordered.

190
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,949
- ls anybody home?
- Yes, l am.

191
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,954
- Hello, Charlotte.
- Bunny, what are you doing here?

192
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,079
The question is, what are you doing?
l'm hearing things from the board.

193
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,356
They're spying on me?

194
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,832
Mrs Collier saw you kissing
a male caller in the middle of the day.

195
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,594
l believe that kissing is allowed.

196
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,320
Mrs Pierce said a gentleman,

197
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,789
we assume the same one
but who knows,

198
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,838
came home with you last night.

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,709
According to the doorman,
he hasn't left yet.

200
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,474
What l do with my life
in my apartment...

201
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,359
That's the thing. lt's not your apartment.

202
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,557
- Trey gave me this apartment.
- lt's not his to give.

203
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,952
This apartment remains in the
MacDougal name, whereas you,

204
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,759
Charlotte York, do not.

205
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,552
lt's a sticky subject, made stickier
by the fact that you're still married.

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,595
- You're married?
- l'm not married. l'm separated.

207
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,910
Aren't you missing a pair of trousers?

208
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,790
- You have to go.
- Don't you hustle me. This is Chanel.

209
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,152
Charlotte discovered that a plus one
plus one ex-mother-in-law

210
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,039
equals disaster.

211
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,476
Meanwhile,
l was manning party central.

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,275
- Hello.
- Anthony is going to be my date.

213
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,034
What happened
to this perfect plus one?

214
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,350
l don't want to talk about it.

215
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,829
That's my call waiting.
Can you hang on?

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,470
l can't. That's the locksmith.
Bunny's back.

217
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,949
Ooh. Hello.

218
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,795
- l'm definitely on the list, correct?
- Of course.

219
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,270
- Good. l'm bringing my boyfriend.
- l've heard.

220
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,273
l don't want to be a nobody
now that l have a somebody.

221
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,829
lt's OK to be a nobody
when you have nobody?

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,116
You're nobody
till somebody loves you.

223
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,034
l used to like that song.
lt's the co-dependent national anthem.

224
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,077
Someone's a little jelly.

225
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,439
l miss you as my plus one. The gay guy
is the single gal's safety net.

226
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,876
Even Charlotte has a gay plus one.
This is my big night.

227
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,158
- Her boy bitch Anthony is coming?
- Yes. He styled the event.

228
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,235
l'm glad he'll be there.
He's bringing a woman and l have it all.

229
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,119
- l have a call. See you tonight.
- Ciao.

230
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,239
- Hello.
- l've had a little something done.

231
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,756
lt's not as bad as yesterday but...

232
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,116
...l've looked better.

233
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,759
- l'm not sure l should go to the party.
- You have to. You're my publicist.

234
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,755
Thanks to you, there's going to be
8,000 people. l'd like one familiar face.

235
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,276
- Well...
- l need you. l can't talk to the press.

236
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,070
l can't keep everyone straight.
You said you would be my plus one.

237
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,678
Oh, all right.
Don't worry about a thing. l'll be there.

238
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,149
OK. Thank you.

239
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,040
The party was one of those amazing
events that would end up on page six.

240
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,193
The fact it was my party
was icing on the beautiful little cakes

241
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,557
being passed around
by beautiful waiters.

242
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,518
Carrie Bradshaw, right here! One more!

243
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,353
That's great. Right here.

244
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,876
Oh, my God, Carrie!

245
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,273
One more.

246
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,590
- Can you believe this?
- ls it a bad thing

247
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,751
if the party is better than the book?

248
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,832
l've been turning people away.
Not straight men.

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,117
Have you seen Samantha?
''Vanity Fair'' doesn't have a table.

250
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,875
Not your problem. Enjoy.
Ooh, cute guy...

251
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,193
Hey.

252
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,750
Hello, Carrie. l'm Harold Keenan
of ''The New Yorker''.

253
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,230
l've been following your career.
Let me say congratulations.

254
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,437
Carrie! l'm here.

255
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,831
You look amazing.

256
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,396
Harold Keenan from ''The New Yorker'',
this is Samantha Jones, beekeeper.

257
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,678
What are you doing?
Talk to him. Let him see your face.

258
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,871
There she was,
my plus one minus one layer of skin.

259
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,077
Hi. l've had a chemical peel.
l'm Carrie's publicist.

260
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,515
Could you separate the two:
chemical peel, Carrie's publicist?

261
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,717
- Why did you do this?
- An impulse purchase.

262
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,111
Gum is an impulse purchase.
This is more than gum.

263
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,999
l wanted to be super fresh
for the party.

264
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,355
You look like beef carpaccio.
Veil down.

265
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,876
lf you knew how many dinner parties
l've sat through

266
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,237
- across from one of these.
- You were able to eat?

267
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,076
- l'm entitled to a chemical peel.
- Wait. The hat was good.

268
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,071
Women shouldn't have to hide

269
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,471
because they've had cosmetic surgery
which society demands.

270
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,679
Make that statement elsewhere.
This is my party. You're scaring people.

271
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,319
- Carrie.
- Hi.

272
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,396
- l've had a chemical peel.
- She's not afraid to say it.

273
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,348
When l had my nose job,
l stayed in for a month.

274
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,950
Excuse us. We have to go find
Charlotte and her tiny little friend.

275
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,237
We were getting to know each other.
l was going to tell him.

276
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,713
Wrap it up in a Tiffany bow all you like.
You wanted to get laid first.

277
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,316
- Charlotte, hello.
- Hi, Stanford. You remember Anthony?

278
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,233
Anthony...oh, of course.

279
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,359
You tried to fix us up at the fashion
show. l didn't know you'd be here.

280
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,475
- This is Marcus, my boyfriend.
- How long you been going together?

281
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,517
Four months.

282
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,312
- Four whole months. Good luck to you.
- We don't need luck. We're in love.

283
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,232
Shrimp!

284
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,032
For some, having it all is not enough.
They need someone to be jealous.

285
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,236
We're getting a house in the Hamptons.

286
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,630
Friggin' shrimp.
What do you do with the tails?

287
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,634
- Mr Shrimpy...
- He has a large penis.

288
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,151
Where in the Hamptons?

289
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,835
From a pair of queens
to a hand still not shown...

290
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,833
Maybe you and l should go
somewhere less crowded, like...

291
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,719
Anywhere in Manhattan.

292
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,599
- Your apartment?
- Yes...

293
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,677
But...first
l have to tell you something.

294
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,678
- There's someone else.
- Sort of.

295
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,956
l had a baby.

296
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,638
But l'm still allowed to have sex.

297
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,389
ls it...

298
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,429
...mine?

299
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,470
No, no. The guy's a friend
who l accidentally slept with.

300
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,474
- l'm not good with kids.
- Neither am l.

301
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,199
Months from now,
if we're together, we'll figure this out.

302
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,718
For now, it's just us.
l'm still the same person, so...

303
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,996
...let's go screw our brains out.

304
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,916
That feels amazing.

305
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,278
- You sure we won't wake him?
- He's fine. Forget about him.

306
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,278
Miranda was trying to prove
she could still do it all.

307
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,389
Bring home the bacon, bring home
the baby, and bring home an orgasm.

308
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,996
Don't stop.

309
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,511
Mommy's coming.

310
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,836
l don't think l can do this.
l told you. l'm not a baby guy.

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,389
Couldn't l just please come first?

312
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,750
Oh, so now you stop crying.

313
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,031
So...here we are.

314
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,350
The night of my big party,

315
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,637
Miranda finally gave in to her little party.

316
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,030
She wasn't the same person.

317
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,031
She was plus one.

318
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,796
A book?
Does anybody read books any more?

319
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,669
Books are coming back.
You can quote me on the side of a bus.

320
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,990
''Books are back.'' lsaac Mizrahi.

321
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,798
- l'll remember.
- Meet me.

322
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,635
- Perfect party. Congratulations.
- Worth coming downtown?

323
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,876
Was that an answer?

324
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,518
Oh, last one. Thank you.

325
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,912
As l looked around l thought,
who needs a date?

326
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,389
l can have my cake and eat it too.

327
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,669
Suddenly...

328
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,550
There he was, cuter than l remembered
and minus one girlfriend.

329
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,788
Hey, lady of the hour.

330
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,509
- You're hard to get to.
- So is the dessert tray.

331
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,151
As a point of reference, my book party
could fit in the coat check of yours.

332
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,311
400 of my closest acquaintances.

333
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,072
You look great.

334
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,798
- l thought you couldn't make it.
- l had to say congratulations.

335
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,710
Well...thanks for coming, Berger.

336
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,233
Yeah...

337
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,673
...all right.

338
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,798
Good luck with the book
and...everything.

339
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,193
You too.

340
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
Hey. Was that the spark guy?

341
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,510
- Jack Berger. All by his lonesome.
- Well, he is awfully cute.

342
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,870
ls he? l forgot again.

343
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,112
He's obviously here
because he felt something.

344
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,073
Can you call me from a cab
and tell me that?

345
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,913
l love you, but your face...

346
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,790
The caterer shooed me away from
the buffet. Do you mind if l go home?

347
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,190
l thought you'd never ask.

348
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,590
Thank you for being here.

349
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,038
l wouldn't have gone out in public
like this for anyone but you.

350
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,915
l know. And l have to live with that.

351
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,596
- Bye.
- Bye.

352
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,196
l might go too. My plus one
dumped me for a shrimp waiter.

353
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,396
l'd love to leave but l have to stay.

354
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,111
l'm like the ice sculpture
the party's supposed to happen around.

355
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,551
l had to let him go, correct?

356
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,109
l wish he'd told me right up front.

357
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,236
The thing is...there are some things
people don't admit because

358
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,678
they don't like the way it sounds.
Like, ''l'm getting divorced.''

359
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,796
l'm lonely.

360
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,989
l am.

361
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,236
The loneliness is palpable.

362
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,478
- You didn't tell me you invited Cliff.
- Cliff who?

363
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,156
- Cliff Cliff. My Cliff. He's with her.
- That's him?

364
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,393
- Cliff Bregan from Prime Time Sports?
- Don't make a scene.

365
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,438
- ls this her side of town?
- We're below Houston.

366
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,277
East side, West side.
Who knows down here? l am so angry.

367
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,319
Even the most together woman
can't keep it together

368
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,436
when it comes to love.

369
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,830
- Who was that?
- My role model.

370
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,959
Just below the surface,
we are all raw and exposed.

371
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,076
- OK.
- Bye.

372
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,513
So...what was the party for?

373
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,273
Me. l have a book coming out.

374
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,513
- You wrote a book?
- lt's just a collection of my...

375
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,157
- Yes, l wrote a book.
- That's amazing. Congratulations.

376
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,588
Thank you.

377
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,788
lt was kind of amazing. Why did l need
a stranger to remind me?

378
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,589
- Where can l take you?
- Home, 73rd and...

379
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,320
No. We have to celebrate this.

380
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,678
- l want to tell him.
- Oh no, l don't...

381
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,798
- She wrote a book.
- No kidding? Congratulations.

382
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,916
- Gonna be in bookstores?
- Yeah.

383
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,514
lf that's the case,
the hot dogs are on me.

384
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,195
- No, you don't have to...
- l insist.

385
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,591
- Thanks.
- Have a nice weekend.

386
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,718
All l could think was,
who needs a Berger

387
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,237
when you can get a fabulous hot dog
for 75 cents, or free?

388
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,634
Then again, maybe there is something
to knowing they're out there.
