1
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,076
lt is said that it takes a lifetime

2
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,071
to figure out who you are.

3
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,390
This book cover is so you.

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,677
People in publishing move a tad faster.

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,796
lt's a mock-up. Don't be thrown.

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,190
We put your head on another body.

7
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,750
The cover of ''Sex And The City''.

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,071
The bestselling ''Sex And The City''.

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,715
No!

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,229
l'm sorry. That just came out.

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,039
That's good. You had a strong reaction.

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,350
That's what we want.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,954
We don't want the reaction to be ''no''.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,031
Let me talk you through it.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,272
Blurred background. A fast-paced city.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,352
You naked with nothing but your ideas.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,272
l get it.

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,149
But no matter how fast-paced the city,

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,914
l always manage to get my clothes on

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,799
before l leave the apartment.

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,397
Courtney, here's what concerns me.
That cover is all about sex.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,279
- Well, sex sells.
- Yes...

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,238
My columns are about relationships.

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,834
When l write about sex, it's just words.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,673
Reading about sex is different than

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,876
seeing it in front of you

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,510
naked on 6th Avenue hailing a cab.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,877
- l totally understand, Carrie.
- OK.

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,838
We're fucked.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,390
No. OK... Let me see it again.

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,596
Absolutely not. l would sooner die.

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,275
The next day, our talk
turned from bachelors, baby bottles

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,715
and Balenciaga blouses to books.

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,836
Bad, worse,

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,514
loser...disaster.

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,639
And you know the scary thing?
l'm being kind.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,634
Relax. What could anyone say
about you? You're fabulous.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,749
But if l get the wrong book cover,
l'm a fabulous target. People are mean.

39
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,675
People are not that mean.
She looks like shit. ls her stylist blind?

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,868
- l have officially entered panic.
- Oh, stop. Talk to me.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,079
This is what l do.
How do you see yourself on the cover?

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,916
Like a writer who happened
to have wound up on her book cover

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,958
looking smart, sexy
and properly airbrushed.

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,908
l can help you. l'll talk to the publishers.
When's the photo shoot?

45
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,393
- Next Thursday, but l can't afford you.
- True, my PR services are pricey.

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,030
lt'll cost you two martinis and a lunch.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,112
OK, l'll talk to my people.

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,352
What kind of a diet book
are you looking for?

49
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,469
Something like ''How To Lose
That Baby Fat By Sitting On Your Ass''.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,518
- How about ''The Zone''?
- How about no?

51
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,989
- l thought you were serious.
- l am.

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,391
As soon as l finish
this nougat, caramel, pretzel thing.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,472
l'm gonna go look
for this book l read about.

54
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,712
- What's it called?
- ''Starting Over Yet Again''.

55
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,199
See ya.

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,431
There it was.

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,239
The self hell aisle.

58
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,277
As Charlotte looked at the titles:
''The Women's Comfort Book'',

59
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,228
''The Path To Love'',
''Excuse Me, Your Life ls Waiting'',

60
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,356
''Please Understand Me ll'',

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,512
she couldn't bear the thought
that she belonged there.

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,911
That really helped me.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,079
Travel?

64
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,319
Travel?

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,799
Travel?

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,792
This is adorable.

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,432
This is psychotic.

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,956
lt's none of my business,
but don't do that. l did.

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,590
- l lost 24, gained 46.
- ''The New York Times'' said...

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,753
Can ''The New York Times'' pry
the cookie dough out of your hands?

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,593
Weight Watchers.
lt's the only sane way.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,115
You can even have dessert.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,396
Where's ''Starting Over Yet Again''?

74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,516
Here you go.

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,638
- Good luck with Weight Watchers.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,351
- Did you find your book?
- No, it wasn't for me.

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,510
- Yeah. Like l need his advice.
- l'm a dead woman.

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,750
Who needs the self help aisle

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,275
when you can self help yourself
to amazon.com

80
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,396
and get exactly what you need,

81
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,949
overnight express and shame free.

82
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,837
- That's quite a package.
- Excuse me?

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,798
That's quite a package.

84
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,554
Want to sign right here, please?

85
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,275
There. How's that?

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,793
Pretty damn good.

87
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,110
l just got my nails done.

88
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,556
Would you mind...
opening my package?

89
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,748
Ooh, thank you.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,516
Now, maybe l can help you
with your package.

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,715
Fucking 'A'.

92
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,471
At exactly 12:15,
l stopped by to pick up Samantha

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,349
for our business lunch
to decide what we thought was sexy.

94
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,916
Oh, l'm sorry.

95
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,039
- Wanna keep going?
- No, l've had enough.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,595
Some women, like Samantha,
know when to stop putting things

97
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,151
in their mouths, while others,
like Miranda, need a little help.

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,755
l'm much lighter metric.

99
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,480
Excuse me. Hi.

100
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,790
There's been a mistake on my weight.

101
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,758
- The scales don't lie.
- This isn't a vanity thing.

102
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,480
The other woman
inverted the numbers.

103
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,835
lf l'm gonna do this,
l want to do it right.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,639
You've got the right attitude.
Come on.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,439
Can l scooch in a minute?
Thanks.

106
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,999
- Elaine.
- Yeah?

107
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,473
You wrote down this woman weighs
158.2, but she weighs 152.8.

108
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,438
- Sorry.
- Could you not yell out my weight?

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,558
Hey, l weigh 240. Goal weight 77.

110
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,474
- Here you go and here's a name tag.
- A name tag?

111
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,110
Oh, yeah. We've all got to wear these.

112
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,432
- Tom. Big boned.
- Miranda. Baby weight.

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,352
- Hi.
- Hi.

114
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,792
Later that same day, Stanford
came over for a fag and some flipping.

115
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,918
Finish that and get over here
and start on ''Vogue''.

116
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,310
Tear out any outfit that
might work for me.

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,234
Something that won't be too pathetic
if l wind up in the half-off bin.

118
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,749
Well, you look very...something.

119
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,959
- l am very something.
- What's going on, Ms Blatch?

120
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,395
- l met someone.
- Oh, my God. Really?

121
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,437
That's fantastic!

122
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,830
His name is Marcus.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,275
- ls he a Roman?
- No, he is not.

124
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,956
Too bad. l adore a metal breastplate
on a man. What does he do?

125
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,636
OK. Before l tell you,
you have to promise not to judge.

126
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,836
- Do l judge?
- We all judge.

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,992
That's our hobby. Some people
do arts and crafts. We judge.

128
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,118
- l'll be kind.
- He's a dancer.

129
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,191
Radio City Music Hall.

130
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,079
l feel as though my hands are tied.

131
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,198
He's a Broadway calibre dancer,
working in the male chorus.

132
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,592
Last Christmas, he danced the part
of Arabian Coffee in ''The Nutcracker''.

133
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,912
- Where did you meet?
- Standing in line at Starbucks.

134
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,878
You met a man who played coffee
waiting to get coffee?

135
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,197
- We're both <i>grande</i> house blends.
- What is that, a new zodiac sign?

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,439
- Hello.
- How funny was that in my office?

137
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,353
Hilarious. l'm sending you
the X-ray bill for my elbow.

138
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,195
- Could you have gotten out any faster?
- No.

139
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,918
Lighten up.

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,276
- l am lightened up.
- Good news.

141
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,274
l got my favourite stylist
to pull some looks for the cover.

142
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,193
Did you tell them
what we're looking for?

143
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,716
- Sexy chic, like you said.
- When are you meeting them?

144
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,998
- Maybe l should join you.
- Don't worry. l'll handle it.

145
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,390
But...l have some ideas.

146
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,156
- You still want me to do this, right?
- Yeah, why wouldn't l?

147
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,073
l'll have them pull some stuff.
How's Saturday?

148
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,030
- lt's great. l'll ask Stanford to come.
- ls Stanford suddenly a stylist?

149
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,431
No, but he's gay and bitchy.
My target test audience.

150
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,670
- You OK?
- l'm fabulous.

151
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,230
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- OK.

152
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,159
- Ask Stanford to come where?
- Look at some outfits for the cover.

153
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,710
- Saturday.
- l'll have to check with Marcus.

154
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,836
We may have plans.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,072
You're not gonna turn into
one of those couples, are you?

156
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,073
Judgey wudgey was a bear...

157
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,312
l think it's pretty much agreed
that it goes...

158
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,118
open-minded: good,

159
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,111
judgmental: bad.

160
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,716
But are we being too quick
to judge judgment?

161
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,395
Perhaps judgment
is not so much a snap decision

162
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,314
as an early warning
and detection device.

163
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,632
lf it is instantly clear that a person,
place or profession is not for you,

164
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,839
is it better to ignore your better
judgment and read between the lines

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,958
or should you judge a book
by its cover?

166
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,958
You've got mail.

167
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,150
''Based on your recent book purchase,

168
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,278
''here's a list of books
you might be interested in.''

169
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,113
The selected list included...

170
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,430
''Lonely Women No Men'',

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,909
''Love Hurts. You Don't Have To'',

172
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,150
''l'm Fine Now''

173
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,880
and ''Reservations for One''.

174
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,794
Charlotte refused to see herself
as one of those women.

175
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,508
lt fell eight flights and landed at the feet
of a woman contemplating divorce.

176
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,956
She considered it a sign from God.

177
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,076
After three Weight Watchers meetings,

178
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,959
where they did nothing
but talk about eating,

179
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,955
Miranda Baby Weight and Tom
Big Boned went someplace to eat.

180
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,237
Then l did the one where you only
have water, eggs and grapefruit.

181
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,994
- Cos they're so good together.
- Yes.

182
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,835
lt worked out well until l fainted
on an lndian woman in the subway.

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,151
What about the one with
the pre-packaged, chemicalised food?

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,676
How do they get all
of those artificial ingredients

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,796
into such tiny packages?

186
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,078
Although they did have
this itty-bitty thing of tuna that l loved.

187
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,199
l cut my tongue licking it out of the can
and knew it was time to stop.

188
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,035
- Ever try the cabbage soup diet?
- No, l heard it gives you bad...

189
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,192
Gas? lt's true.
That was the end of my fiancée.

190
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,715
She sounds mean.

191
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,112
There was more to it. We weren't
good together. She was very critical.

192
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,239
The more she put me down,
the more l ate.

193
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,836
Whenever somebody criticises me,
l go right for those.

194
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,117
- Glazed. They're my favourite.
- The best Weight Watchers meeting

195
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,990
is on 23rd Street. Can't go near it
cos there's a Krispy Kreme next door.

196
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,119
How many Weight Watchers points
do you think is in one of those?

197
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,999
Two...hundred...thousand.

198
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,914
Would it be terrible if we split one?

199
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,076
We're consenting adults.

200
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,277
Sir? Can l get a Krispy Kreme
and...a knife?

201
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,236
Here you go.

202
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,552
Whoever invented glaze is a genius.

203
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,552
See, that is worth being fat for.
l'm sorry, it's worth it.

204
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,392
- l know how we can burn this off.
- Really?

205
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,276
Activity points.

206
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,998
Weight Watchers turned out
to be a lot more enjoyable

207
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,116
than Miranda expected.

208
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,279
- No.
- Yes.

209
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,238
- Yes. l was all over his face.
- No.

210
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,756
- Talk about loving yourself.
- l'd rather be good friends with myself.

211
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,832
- When l was a lesbian...
- l saw that coming.

212
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,070
l could get out with nothing more
than a fine lip gloss.

213
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,073
- You're awfully quiet.
- What is there to say?

214
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,392
The man has bad manners. You keep
a box of tissues on the nightstand.

215
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,475
While he's stroking you with one hand,
he grabs a tissue and dabs his face.

216
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,872
Emily Post's Polite Pussy.
Why didn't you just say something?

217
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,319
lt's hard to criticise if you're with
someone who overeats when criticised.

218
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,916
Miranda went out with an overeater
and he overate her.

219
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,189
When he popped his head up,
he had such a proud look on his face.

220
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,432
They always look proud,
like they just came back from war.

221
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,513
- They want that ''you're my hero'' kiss.
- Not without a tissue and an Altoid.

222
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,636
lt's a double standard.

223
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,951
l'd feel insulted if l'd gone down
on a guy and he wouldn't kiss me.

224
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,078
Samantha,
do you kiss after a blow job?

225
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,391
No, she signs the delivery slip
and sends him on his way.

226
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,078
What's going on?

227
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,075
Carrie has a problem that she saw me
blowing the Worldwide Express guy.

228
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,072
- Oh.
- That was her and not me.

229
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,279
- When did l say l had a problem?
- You walked in, caught us and ran.

230
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,159
What was l supposed to do?
Flip through ''Marie Claire''?

231
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,551
Where did you see her blowing him?
Not on the street...

232
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,429
Of course not.
lt was in the privacy of my office.

233
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,958
lt wasn't a Worldwide Express guy.
lt was my Worldwide Express guy.

234
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,793
- Your Worldwide Express guy?
- Yes.

235
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,555
- What's his name?
- Joe. Tuesdays and Thursdays.

236
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,110
What's the big deal? We laugh about
this kind of stuff all the time.

237
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,953
- Fine.
- Samantha...

238
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,511
lt's fine. We'd better go, Carrie.
We'll be late for the stylist.

239
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,840
- Naughty, fabulous, camp. Harlot.
- No.

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,436
l think it's a fantastic approach,
and the publishers love the idea.

241
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,558
They wanted me buck-naked
waiting for the M11 bus.

242
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,759
We said sexy chic. Who is this stylist,
Frederick's of Hollywood?

243
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,876
Just go try at least one on.

244
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,033
l can't wear this. l'm gonna look like
an extra from ''Moulin Rouge''.

245
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,478
You will not.
The shoes are lined up in there. Scoot.

246
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,596
Don't say scoot.

247
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,153
Knock knock. Nothing in here l haven't
seen and ruled out in junior high.

248
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,630
- Hello, doll. Carrie's changing.
- Samantha...

249
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,951
This is my boyfriend, Marcus.

250
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,475
Papa's got himself a brand new bag.

251
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,310
Come out. l want to introduce you.

252
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,231
Marcus Adent, Lady Marmalade.

253
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,676
Nice to meet you. l don't usually dress
like a high-class hooker.

254
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,197
- That is not a hooker look.
- Please, this screams hooker.

255
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,319
What respectable New York woman
would be caught dead wearing this?

256
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,596
l have one in red.

257
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,639
Am l a hooker?

258
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,951
Could you wait outside? We're
having trouble deciding on my outfit.

259
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,113
No, let's get a second,
and l might add gay, opinion.

260
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,909
- Doesn't she look adorable in that?
- Yes.

261
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,197
lsn't this the worst possible outfit
for my cover?

262
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,109
Yes.

263
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,358
What about you? What do you think?

264
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,069
- lt's not very modern.
- lsn't he great?

265
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,199
He's great.
Can you wait outside for a second?

266
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,670
- What do you think?
- Great.

267
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,069
Samantha, l really appreciate the help.

268
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,550
You and l have different ideas
about what's sexy.

269
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,234
- This is about the blow job, isn't it?
- What?

270
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,278
One blow job
and l'm a hooker with no taste.

271
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,716
This isn't about the blow job.
This is about the book cover.

272
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,839
l don't feel comfortable on a shelf next
to a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,958
- with my breasts hanging out.
- What is the problem?

274
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,839
l've seen you wearing not much else.

275
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,594
Not lately. You know why?

276
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,832
lt's time for ladies my age
to cover it up.

277
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,151
We can't get away
with what we used to.

278
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,472
- Meaning blow jobs.
- Jesus! Again with the blow jobs.

279
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,031
- What is your problem?
- l don't have a problem. You do.

280
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,351
l have marabou-covered breasts.
That is my only problem.

281
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,115
l'm not blind.
l saw that look in your eye in my office.

282
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,191
- What look?
- That judgmental look.

283
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,318
That was shock.
l thought we were having lunch.

284
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,712
Do you have no judgment about me
and the Worldwide Express guy?

285
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,872
No judgment. l do have a question.

286
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,477
Will this relationship be
priority overnight or next day delivery?

287
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,200
Oh, come on. Lighten up, remember?

288
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,309
lf l walked in on you giving a blow job
to a Worldwide Express guy...

289
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,314
You wouldn't because that is
something l would never do.

290
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,118
There.

291
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,957
l cannot believe you would judge me
after everything we've been through.

292
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,076
Where are you going?

293
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,119
l'm going to splash some water
on my face and then l'm going home.

294
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,114
l will not be judged by you or society.
l will wear whatever

295
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,831
and blow whomever l want
as long as l can breathe and kneel.

296
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,757
That night, Miranda had gone from
facing her weight at Weight Watchers

297
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,275
to waiting
for her Weight Watcher's face.

298
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,231
- Hey...give me those gorgeous lips.
- Stop! l can't do that.

299
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,392
- What did l do?
- lt's not you. lt's me.

300
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,233
Literally me. l'm all over your face.

301
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,790
- All over.
- Doesn't that happen with other guys?

302
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
Yes, but not so much.

303
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,275
So what are you saying?
l'm a big fat sloppy eater?

304
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,319
No. l'm just worried
l might be too many food points.

305
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,152
You making jokes?

306
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,073
That's what we do.
Miranda Baby Weight...

307
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,995
But not when l'm vulnerable and naked.
l'm not comfortable at this weight.

308
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,277
Never mind. You look great.

309
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,951
- Take a tissue.
- l don't want one. l want a potpie.

310
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,750
- You don't want a potpie.
- You're right. l want seven.

311
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,798
l don't think we should see
each other any more.

312
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,558
l've got to concentrate on my diet.

313
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,353
l...l was just being silly.

314
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,795
Come back to bed.

315
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,953
Do what you were doing.
You're good at it. <i>Bon appétit.</i>

316
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,511
The bad news was that from then on,
Miranda had to go downtown

317
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,468
to the notorious Weight Watchers
next to the Krispy Kreme,

318
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,234
where she wouldn't bump into Tom.

319
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,872
The good news was that she never
wanted a glazed doughnut again.

320
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,077
Samantha Jones, please hold.
Hi, Carrie.

321
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,391
- ls she in? OK.
- Hello.

322
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,471
ls she alone?

323
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,432
OK.

324
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,636
Knock knock.

325
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,434
See? Live it. Learn it.

326
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,239
That's all l get
for a tailor-made knock knock joke?

327
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,312
That's better.

328
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,833
So...

329
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,553
Two days, four calls, no answer.

330
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,076
l know. Sorry. l've been busy.

331
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,151
Do we have to do this? Can't we
pretend the whole thing didn't happen?

332
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,595
lf we don't want
to talk on the phone again.

333
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,830
ln a few days, it will blow over.

334
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,151
That's an interesting choice of words.

335
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,673
Look...

336
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,314
- l'm sorry.
- Carrie, stop.

337
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,278
l don't want to do
the ''l'm sorry'' stuff with you.

338
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,558
Anyone else but not you.
You and l are perfect.

339
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,589
Sweetie, as lovely as that idea sounds,
we're not perfect.

340
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,796
We're pretty damn close.

341
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,157
Make no mistake.
lt's not my personal style.

342
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,154
But l admire your ability
to put your sex life out there.

343
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,197
Thank you.

344
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,319
So...l brought some looks for my cover.

345
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,950
- l want your opinion.
- You do?

346
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,873
Yeah. Well, just...in there.

347
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,077
l did judge you.

348
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,949
Just a little. And l feel bad.

349
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,951
You were so good to me

350
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,554
during the whole Big married man affair.

351
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,676
lt's not just you. l judge me.

352
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,877
Ever since Richard,
l don't know who l am.

353
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,353
Just like that, l realised what was under
Samantha's fabulous cover.

354
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,476
l'm sorry about the delivery guy.

355
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
l had no idea
what that must have been like for you.

356
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,836
Until l walked in on Stanford

357
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,958
- getting a blow job from Marcus.
- Yeah. He told me.

358
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,510
This is good.
Just the jacket and legs.

359
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,636
With a sexy pair of shoes...

360
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,510
Stanford was getting a blow job?
l thought he would be...

361
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,639
- Never mind. Too judgmental.
- Oh honey, we all thought that.

362
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,756
Here at the camera.

363
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,639
Love that smile. You look great.

364
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,314
- What's this?
- For the cover...

365
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,119
Good. You look gorgeous.

366
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,508
Something...

367
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,750
- Wait, wait.
- What?

368
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,071
Sometimes it takes a friend
to make a picture perfect.

369
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,313
But a picture-perfect friendship?
That's just in books.

370
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,674
- Like it?
- Yes.

371
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,795
lsn't she fabulous?

372
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,269
Big smile, cover girl.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
