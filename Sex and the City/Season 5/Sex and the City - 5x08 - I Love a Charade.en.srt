1
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,473
ln the expanding galaxy of New York,

2
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,392
there are heavenly bodies

3
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,391
one orbits around everyday.

4
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,915
And stars whose gravitational pull

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,992
one drifts in and out of over the years.

6
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,116
Bobby Fine - satellite friend,

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,430
piano bar legend.

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,556
<i>I usuaIIy do this number at home</i>

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,676
<i>In a pink kaftan and Peggy Lee wig</i>

10
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,912
<i>You've never done the same</i>
<i>after three daiquiris?</i>

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,149
l must take a break to say hello
to a celebrity friend.

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,276
ls there any other kind?

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,034
Little Miss Carrie Bradshaw.

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,350
She writes books. Remember books?

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,909
Primitive versions of the DVD.

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,036
Please stop. OK, one more time,

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,031
for the cheap seats in the back.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,596
<i>Is that aII there is?</i>

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,596
<i>Yes, that's aII there is</i>

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,239
How long have you known each other?

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,914
''Cats'' was just kittens.

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,150
''Cats''. The musical? Hello?

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,436
- l loved ''Cats''.
- Medic!

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,750
lt hasn't been that long.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,071
When we met, you took aerobics
and Stanford had hair.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,749
- Bobby?
- Bitsy. l thought you had a dinner.

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,196
l do. The driver is circling.
l had to say hello.

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,632
Bitsy Von Muffling.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,997
Carrie, Miranda, Samantha
and the one who liked ''Cats''.

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,470
Samantha Jones.
l did PR for your museum benefit.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,757
Samantha, of course. l loved you.

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,912
l was just so thrilled
that someone liked ''Cats''.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,039
- l didn't like it that much.
- Waiter, sense of humour, table five.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,839
- Samantha, how are you?
- Fabulous. You?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,560
Delirious. l'm madly in love
and getting married.

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,633
- Big Hamptons wedding.
- Who's the lucky stud?

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,789
Me.

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,991
- You're getting married?
- Can you believe it?

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,119
Bitsy and l are <i>enfianced.</i>
l finally found the right girl.

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,831
Mr Broadway has to tinkle
before he can tinkle.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,152
l have your address. You must come.
Nice meeting you all.

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,951
l thought he was gay.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,318
''Mr Broadway has to tinkle.''
That has to be the gayest sentence.

44
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,438
- lt must be for the money.
- He doesn't need money.

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,398
He was an original investor
in ''A Chorus Line''.

46
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,518
When you thought you'd never hear
a phrase gayer than

47
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,796
''Mr Broadway has to tinkle.''

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,269
Why is he getting married?

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,830
ln 1988, Bobby Fine announced
he was selling his piano bar

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,959
and going to volunteer
with the Nicaraguan orphans.

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,195
The orphans are still waiting.
This wedding will never happen.

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,553
lt's happening.

53
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,713
Everything's booked.
The big question is where will we stay?

54
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,273
That's the big question? What about,
why are these two getting married?

55
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,398
- ls that all there is?
- Bitsy said they were in love.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,916
l find the love facade
the most offensive part.

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,036
We're adults. We can handle it.

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,158
Bitsy should say, ''l'm getting older.
l want companionship.''

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,073
Bobby should say,
''Hot men don't go for me any more.''

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,196
Don't print invitations and call it love,

61
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,989
as if it transforms people.
That's bullshit.

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,914
- You don't want to be my date?
- Not unless they have summer houses.

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,470
- We'll stay with Stanford and Marcus.
- l was a fool to break up

64
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,598
with Richard before Labor Day.
He has a fabulous house.

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,196
l wouldn't go to this charade
if you paid me.

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,399
Like there's a pink suede elephant in
the room and no one can talk about it.

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,190
- Do you think they won't have sex?
- All married couples stop having sex.

68
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,114
- You've had sex with married people.
- That's how l know.

69
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,033
OK, let's say it's companionship.

70
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,079
How do you sustain a relationship
without the <i>zsa zsa zsu?</i>

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,832
The what?

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,438
The butterflies when you not only love
the person but you've gotta have them.

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,830
Doesn't that get you through the years?

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,232
Even if it fades, you have the memory
of the <i>zsa zsa zsu.</i>

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,995
l'm fine with whatever people
want to do. Just be straight.

76
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,390
l think that's how
Bitsy proposed to Bobby.

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,109
Right then, Charlotte decided
to be straight with us.

78
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,635
l'm seeing someone...sort of.

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,995
You're in a sort of relationship?

80
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,799
lt's ridiculous. He's so not my type.

81
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,599
- ls he heterosexual?
- Yes.

82
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,755
But he's bald and short.
He talks with his mouth full.

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,434
l don't want to be seen
in public with him.

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,558
l hate his name - Harry.
He is, everywhere but his head.

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,950
Wow. ls the sex bad too?

86
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,554
lt's the best sex of my life.

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,756
l think l might really like him.

88
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,318
You want to go to a wedding
in the Hamptons?

89
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,948
- Bitsy Von Muffling's.
- You're invited?

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,749
- l handled her divorce.
- You aren't a Hamptons' type.

91
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,469
l am the Hamptons.
l own a house in Bridge.

92
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,996
l can't go.
l'm not ready for swimsuit season.

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,516
- You're a fucking knockout.
- lt's your back.

94
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,353
- What's wrong with it?
- lt's very hairy.

95
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,149
You're not supposed to be able
to grab someone's back.

96
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,595
What am l supposed to do about it?

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,478
Get it waxed.

98
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,033
You come with me to the wedding
and l will get my back waxed.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,952
Fine.

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,635
- Come here, you.
- Your hands are all greasy.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,076
That night, l thought about what it takes
to make a relationship work

102
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,992
till death do us part.

103
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,830
Most singles have
long-term success with friends.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,037
Maybe it is a better strategy
to marry a friend.

105
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,760
However, in the absence of sex -

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,879
whether that's the arrangement
or what happens after a few years -

107
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,555
what distinguishes this companion
from your many others?

108
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,633
When it comes to saying ''l do'',
is a relationship a relationship

109
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,552
without the <i>zsa zsa zsu?</i>

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,196
Or in Samantha's case...

111
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,591
...how much is a woman due
for surviving the <i>zsa zsa zsu?</i>

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,512
This is Richard.

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,433
Our pathetic relationship
is as close to marriage

114
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,196
as either of us hopes to get.
l feel l deserve a settlement.

115
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,319
Like a weekend at your house
in the Hamptons. You're not invited.

116
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,358
l'm having a party.
You're not invited to that, either.

117
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,034
lt's Samantha. Call me.

118
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,916
A couple of weeks later,
another couple of exes

119
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,230
were working out their summer share.

120
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,791
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hey. Me and Brady were napping.

121
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,118
l miss napping.
They look down on napping at work.

122
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,396
lt's so hot out.

123
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,590
l was gonna give him
one more bottle before l left.

124
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,752
- l can do it.
- l know, but l like it.

125
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,879
lt used to be breasts.
Now we've got a bottle thing.

126
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,548
- Did Magda bring those?
- No, l did.

127
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,995
Nice garden in Queens.

128
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,992
Oh, lilacs.

129
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,153
Yeah.

130
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,318
Good flowers.

131
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,190
Miranda wasn't sure if it was
the smell of the lilacs,

132
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,954
the smell of the baby
or the smell of Steve's skin.

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,874
But that afternoon,
Steve went from ex to sex.

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,518
l slept with Steve.

135
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,433
Miranda admitted they were
between friends and lovers

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,955
between Manhattan and the Hamptons.

137
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,590
That's why you're participating
in the charade. You're fleeing.

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,320
l'm a fucking fugitive...literally.

139
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,913
Was it the <i>zsa zsa zsu?</i>

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,198
No, it was an itch we shouldn't have
scratched. Now we're into a grey area.

141
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,920
Not having sex
was holding us together.

142
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,753
You're fleeing to the right wedding.
That's the theme.

143
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,354
You can't have a kid with someone

144
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,798
and get along and have great sex
without giving the wrong impression.

145
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,758
Being what, that you're happy?

146
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,918
Absolutely!

147
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,919
Bring them along.
l look forward to seeing you too.

148
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,834
This party is going to be amazing.
Strictly 'A' list.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,558
Are we still invited?

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,950
Yes, but shitty pants there is not.

151
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,917
l won't be able to find a sitter.

152
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,470
He's ruining my lunch,
not my party. No babies.

153
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,359
There's already a party pooper.

154
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,395
Ketchup.

155
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,909
Carrie?

156
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,675
Yeah. Hey, hi.

157
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,912
- Jack.
- Berger. l know. l remember.

158
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,278
You OK? Should l make a tourniquet
out of a hot dog bun and a twig?

159
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,396
- lt's just...
- Ketchup.

160
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,073
Yeah. Thanks.

161
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,273
l didn't figure you for a motorcycle guy.

162
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,477
l'm not. l bought it as a reaction
to my break-up.

163
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,273
Exactly what l wanted -
a Berger with a side of single.

164
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,713
You look good on it.

165
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,839
No, l look good next to it.
On it l look like this...

166
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,912
l'm not really hungry.
l pulled over cos a bug hit my visor.

167
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,312
- My hands are still shaking.
- So, you're ''Uneasy Rider''.

168
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,680
lf you make it to the Hamptons,

169
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,038
my friend is having a party tomorrow
at Richard Wright's house.

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,113
l heard about that. Quite a place.
l pass it on the way to mine.

171
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,715
l'm gonna get a soda. My throat's dry
from screaming inside my helmet.

172
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,989
- lt's nice to see you.
- You too, Berger.

173
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,194
- Maybe l'll see you tomorrow.
- lf you don't, call highway patrol.

174
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,676
Definitely <i>zsa zsa zsu.</i>

175
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,311
The next morning, Samantha prepared
her borrowed house for the big bash.

176
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,031
l want half the tables set up near
the house and the others near the pool.

177
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,078
Ladies?

178
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,950
- Cassandra, did you bring my tote?
- Where are my Merits?

179
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,792
Excuse me. Hi.

180
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,599
The wait staff is to change
in the guest cottage

181
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,309
near the entrance.
Aren't you here to waitress?

182
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,630
We go to restaurants.
We don't work in them.

183
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,758
- Where's Richard?
- Richard isn't here.

184
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,956
l've got the house this weekend.

185
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,469
Excuse me!
Where are you going?

186
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,598
Richard said we could hang
by the pool whenever.

187
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,230
You can't today.
l'm having a party at 3:00.

188
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,630
We'll be fried by then.

189
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,553
l have no cell reception at all.

190
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,758
Miranda brought the kid.
Don't say anything.

191
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,071
l know you didn't want babies.
He's wearing Ralph Lauren

192
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,231
and l stuck a cork up his ass.

193
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,914
This is supposed to be an 'A' list party.

194
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,799
Who's the double 'D' list by the pool?

195
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,637
They won't leave. They say Richard
lets them hang out. Freeloaders.

196
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,315
- People in glass houses...
- l am not freeloading.

197
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,439
l went through a lot. People should be
rewarded for not getting married.

198
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,556
l don't know why you broke up.

199
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,395
What's lying and cheating
compared to a pool with a cabana?

200
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,154
Did you say no babies or no boobies?

201
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,556
Lady and Brady.

202
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,395
- That is so inappropriate.
- Greetings from Silicone Valley.

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,154
People can hear you.

204
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,437
Like everyone here
can't see those tits are fake?

205
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,352
Stop saying tits.

206
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,796
Why are you wearing that shirt?
Tropical shirts are out.

207
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,428
This is not tropical. lt's Tiki.

208
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,639
- Please Tiki it off.
- l thought you would never ask.

209
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,476
Your back! You must have had
a bad reaction to the waxing.

210
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,108
l thought it felt a little itchy.

211
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,113
Suddenly a little hair isn't so bad.

212
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,229
Carrie, woman to woman,
the sex is amazing.

213
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,710
l've never had a man
make me feel this way.

214
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,031
Hush, Ms Scarlet, how you do go...

215
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,840
Well, who ordered the Adonis?

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,150
Bobby, Bitsy. My boyfriend, Marcus.

217
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,232
For God's sake, get yourself to a gym.

218
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,834
Look at that body. lt's disgusting!

219
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,513
Wow, l could grate cheese on your abs.

220
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,478
One large pizza, and hold the salami.

221
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,558
Please put a shirt on
before l marry you.

222
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,198
l haven't touched a carbohydrate
in three months.

223
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,238
- l have to fit into that dress.
- Eat something.

224
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,834
Look at her. She's itsy Bitsy.

225
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,598
l see the Talcots. We've gotta
say hello. See you all tomorrow.

226
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,677
l'm totally serious.

227
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,595
l almost fainted when he mimed
grated cheese on Marcus.

228
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,149
lt's so obvious that he wanted him.

229
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,118
Try to keep up. Bobby is straight.

230
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,951
- What is she doing?
- Maybe he just makes her laugh.

231
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,918
Can't you wait to sit down to eat?
lt's so crass.

232
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,277
ls there anything about me today
that doesn't bug you?

233
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,874
People are eating.
You should have your shirt on.

234
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,996
You have sauce on your face.

235
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,159
Now so do you.

236
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,910
Why did she need to tell me
the sex was amazing?

237
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,995
lt is amazing. She's amazed
he can get hard without another penis.

238
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,711
Speaking of dicks, do you think
Richard slept with any of those bitches?

239
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,838
No, l'm sure they're just good friends.

240
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,513
Berger.

241
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,836
- How do l look?
- Great.

242
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,956
- Where's a mirror?
- Here.

243
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,389
Great.

244
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,838
All right. Put it down.
Thanks for having a party.

245
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,830
- How long have you had a house?
- Three years.

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,276
Moments later, among the butterflies,
l felt butterflies.

247
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,271
There's a nice garden.

248
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,637
- You garden?
- No, l have been known to hoe.

249
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,639
My ex planted the garden so
we could enjoy fresh summer salads.

250
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,836
We didn't make it to summer.

251
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,357
lt's more fresh pain than vegetables.
l can't go out there.

252
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,954
l know how you feel.
When l broke up with my ex,

253
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,317
l couldn't go within six blocks
of his furniture store.

254
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,796
- When did you break up?
- Last year for the second time.

255
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,793
We broke up first the year before.

256
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,155
You broke up twice. Way to go.

257
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,235
We hadn't sufficiently
hurt each other enough the first time.

258
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,951
We definitely took care of business
this time because he moved in.

259
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,510
We had the merging of things,
the dividing of things.

260
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,389
The things left that you don't want
to give back because that's mean.

261
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,472
You don't want to throw them away.
lt's all you have left.

262
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,918
lt's harder as we get older. We're not
dating wildly inappropriate people.

263
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,310
There's no, ''Glad that's over.''

264
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,314
After every break-up,
l tell myself l'm never doing this again.

265
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,632
lt's too hard. How many
of these things can one survive?

266
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,634
They should institute
a helmet law for relationships.

267
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,349
- Right. That's excellently put.
- Thank you.

268
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,554
l should get going.

269
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,674
lt's gonna take me six hours
to drive two miles home.

270
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,036
My jacket.

271
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,237
- l hope there aren't grass stains.
- lt's old.

272
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,316
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

273
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,596
The man could not get away
fast enough.

274
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,958
Apparently it's a short road
from ''commisery'' to misery.

275
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,119
Are you OK?

276
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,278
Perfect. Everything's going out on time.

277
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,758
There's no Tab in here.

278
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,872
- What are you doing in my refrigerator?
- lt's Richard's.

279
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,473
l stocked it.

280
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,918
Did you see any rice krispie treats?
Richard usually leaves those for us.

281
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,354
No, l didn't.

282
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,433
Those lemons are for the drinks,
drinks l paid for.

283
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,194
- Whatever.
- l also paid for the food.

284
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,717
The only thing at this party you two
actually paid for are your breasts.

285
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,869
Jealous?

286
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,395
Oh, yes. l'm jealous.

287
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,159
l'm just dying to look like this.

288
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,108
Maybe if you did,
you'd be out here with Richard.

289
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,998
Snap!

290
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,715
Evidently, people who borrow glass
houses shouldn't throw cantaloupes.

291
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,838
The next morning,
while Stanford and Marcus had Brady,

292
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,956
Miranda and l had brunch.

293
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,839
- How about these muffins.
- These eggs.

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,116
- These napkins.
- These plates.

295
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,590
- How about we marry gay guys?
- Now l have no choice.

296
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,912
- Was it really that bad?
- One minute we were laughing.

297
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,710
The next he had to get away so fast,
he left skid marks. l can show you.

298
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,438
Jam, please.

299
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,512
l know what l did.

300
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,355
l revealed too much too soon.
l was emotionally slutty.

301
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,354
- That's not like you.
- The <i>zsa zsa zsu</i> makes me crazy.

302
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,239
Bitsy Von Muffling-Fine
may have the right idea.

303
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,952
Stop looking for a great relationship
and settle for a fine one.

304
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,355
l'd marry Steve if he were gay.

305
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,396
Everything would be so easy.

306
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,755
A gay area is better than a grey area?

307
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,354
Oh, yeah. More coffee. Want some?

308
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,392
- Great coffee.
- Tell me something l don't know.

309
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,792
- What?
- You did it, Stanny.

310
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,033
Great man, great house...
great relationship.

311
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,158
We've all been looking and you found it.

312
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,155
Marcus and l haven't had sex since
we bought the Cynthia Rowley china.

313
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,709
Thank God, l am so relieved.

314
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,795
Bitsy Von Muffling,
the first time l saw you, l fell in love.

315
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,838
You walked in wearing
that red vintage Dior.

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,878
Pink elephant in the room.

317
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,079
Do you mind?
l'm listening to the bride and...bride.

318
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,037
My dear Bobby Fine...

319
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,431
Something tells me Bitsy
isn't doing Fine.

320
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,957
That's the little piece of information
she's been Von Muffling.

321
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,394
You are there in the morning.

322
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,430
There for me at night.
There in the good. There in the bad.

323
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,716
There in my thoughts.

324
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,791
There in my dreams.

325
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,796
But most of all, my darling,
you are there in my heart...forever.

326
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,918
Perhaps we were all much too cynical.

327
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,835
Perhaps despite the odds, Bobby
and Bitsy had found something real.

328
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,118
l now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

329
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,875
One more time
for the cheap seats at the back.

330
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,478
Somebody over here is about to dance.

331
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,513
- l think you may have sold him short.
- Me too.

332
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,911
With a little time
and the right astringent...

333
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,790
There's nothing on my face,
in my teeth.

334
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,918
You'll hate my moves
on the dance floor,

335
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,038
but that is the risk
every man must take.

336
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,836
What a beautiful night.

337
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,714
Too bad l blew my chance
at a boyfriend this year.

338
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,235
You wanna hold my boyfriend?

339
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,359
l think l'm gonna drown my sorrows
in another piece of cake.

340
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,513
And if anybody asks,
l had two, not three.

341
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,990
Do you smell that, Brady? That's lilac.

342
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,839
Should we call Daddy
and tell him we miss him?

343
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,595
lt's Steve. l'm not here.
Leave a message.

344
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,676
Do you believe this wedding?

345
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,756
Funny where life has taken us.

346
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,832
l remember when we went to these
for the free food.

347
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,319
l have rolls in my purse.

348
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,873
There's my song.

349
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,876
And there's my girl...

350
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,992
...whom l love.

351
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,716
ln case you had any money on it.

352
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,438
Not a penny.

353
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,719
Look out. She's got a piece of fruit
and she's not afraid to throw it.

354
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,829
- Can we not talk about that?
- OK, but we'll be the only ones here.

355
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,589
l'm glad Brady wasn't
the biggest baby at the party.

356
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,718
l went a little crazy
being at Richard's house...

357
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,316
...around his party crashing
pussy posse.

358
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,472
What do you call
<i>zsa zsa zsu</i> gone bad?

359
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,596
Z<i>sa zsa...</i> eugh!

360
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,909
l fell in love with
the most wonderful boy in the world.

361
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,039
- Bitsy, honey, everything was perfect.
- lt was.

362
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,716
Except the dessert. The top layer
of the crème brûlée wasn't hard enough.

363
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,078
That's the problem with this wedding.
The crème brûlée isn't hard enough.

364
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,519
Then one day, he went away.
l thought l would die, but l didn't.

365
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,032
When l didn't, l said to myself,
''ls that all there is to love?''

366
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,668
l'm not technically crashing.

367
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,799
l was having lunch in town today
and the groom invited me.

368
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,553
Shall we?

369
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,349
- Harry?
- You want me to wax my eyebrows?

370
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,829
l think l may be falling in love with you.

371
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,753
l've been falling for you since we met.

372
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,469
- But l never thought...
- What?

373
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,473
You could have
any blue-blooded guy here. l'm...

374
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,119
You're wonderful.

375
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,157
And Jewish.

376
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,199
- So?
- So, where can this go?

377
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,318
l don't know. Let's find out.

378
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,711
l have to marry a Jew.

379
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,749
She can marry a gay guy,
and you can't marry an Episcopalian?

380
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,629
- What do we do now?
- l don't know.

381
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,874
Dance.

382
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,918
Apparently,
Charlotte had a <i>zsa zsa</i> Jew.

383
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,158
You're awful quiet.

384
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,959
- l intend to stay that way.
- No.

385
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,114
You were fine. l just wasn't sure
if l was up for all that again.

386
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,553
Then l thought...

387
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,711
Then you thought what?

388
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,156
Maybe we should go out on a date
before we break up.

389
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,830
When it comes to relationships,

390
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,959
maybe we're all in glass houses
and shouldn't throw stones.

391
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,156
You can never really know.

392
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,276
Some people are settling down.

393
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,992
Some people are settling.

394
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,392
And some people refuse
to settle for anything less...

395
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,551
...than butterflies.



9999
