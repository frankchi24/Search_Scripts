1
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:14,244
Well, hello again.
Hi!

2
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:15,946
I hope we're not too late.

3
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,148
No, no.
Perfect timing.

4
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:19,050
Okay, Stan, this is
my husband Walt.

5
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:20,517
Hi.
Good to meet you, Walt.

6
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,785
Nice to meet you.

7
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,120
Sandia Laboratories, huh?
Yeah.

8
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,856
I hear some pretty fascinating
stuff goes on out there.

9
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,792
Ah, well, you know--

10
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:30,359
Working on anything
you can talk about?

11
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:33,228
I'm picturing
giant space lasers.

12
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:34,529
Am I right?

13
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:36,364
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

14
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:38,332
Oh!
But giant space lasers?

15
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,732
Now, that sounds cool.

16
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,801
I'll have to bring it up
at our next staff meeting.

17
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,334
Well, just remember
I get a cut.

18
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,669
All right, that's a deal.

19
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:45,736
So this is it, honey.

20
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,337
What do you say?

21
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,905
Do you want to take a tour?
Sure.

22
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,039
Okay.

23
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:54,743
Look, how about I give
y'all some privacy?

24
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:57,546
I'll go out to the car
and make a few calls.

25
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,214
Take as much time as you need.

26
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,481
All right.
Good.

27
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:01,549
Okay.
Thanks.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,720
He's actually a nice guy.
He doesn't push.

29
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:07,787
Yeah.

30
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,857
So, as you can see,
there's, uh...

31
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,759
there's a kind of flow
going on here.

32
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:14,360
It's a nice big living room.
Yeah.

33
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:18,463
And this is the dining area.

34
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,765
Ah, the dining area.
Right. Yes.

35
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,066
Oh, and, uh--

36
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:26,269
It's got a pool.
Oh, pool is nice.

37
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:28,138
Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:30,339
Backyard could be
a little bigger.

39
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:33,608
Um, and-- Oh,
there's a breakfast bar

40
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:36,244
kind of dealie here which is nice.
Jesus.

41
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:39,248
And, uh, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious

42
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:42,451
and, you know,
got good appliances, and--

43
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:43,953
How many bedrooms?

44
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:45,487
Three.

45
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:46,488
Told you.

46
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:48,056
There'll all
pretty good size, and--

47
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:50,625
Oh, this is the first one here.

48
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,327
And then there's
two more at the back.

49
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:55,129
Only three bedrooms?

50
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:57,531
I think we're gonna
need at least five.

51
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,532
Don't you think?

52
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,134
Five?
Yeah.

53
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:02,936
What? Do I look like I'm
about to drop a litter?

54
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:04,504
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Dude.

55
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:08,707
No, we'll have three kids
total, eventually.

56
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:11,209
But we'll need
a spare room for a study

57
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:13,678
so that I could work at home
and you can write.

58
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:16,681
Nah, I don't--

59
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:18,650
I don't think this
is gonna be enough.

60
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,522
Okay. Um, what about
a wine cellar?

61
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:25,924
I mean, we certainly
cannot be expected

62
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,626
to live without a wine cellar.

63
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,994
Very funny.
Mmm.

64
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:31,997
I just think we need to set
our sights high is all.

65
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,665
At least higher than here.

66
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,968
Walt, this is
a good neighborhood.

67
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:38,736
It's got a good elementary

68
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,538
and supposedly
a very good high school.

69
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:41,905
And believe me--

70
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,709
'cause I have definitely
looked everywhere--

71
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,277
for our price range,

72
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,878
this is as good as it gets.

73
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:50,980
Well, then let's
stretch our price range.

74
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,314
Truly.

75
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,350
I mean, why buy a starter house

76
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:58,153
when we'll have to move out
in a year or two?

77
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,055
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

78
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,424
I'm serious.

79
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,228
Come on. Why be cautious?

80
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,063
We've got nowhere to go but up.

81
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:23,535
Yeah.

82
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,904
Walter, you see us?

83
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,339
Yeah, I see you.

84
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,942
I'd like you
to exit your vehicle

85
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:32,212
and start walking toward us.

86
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:33,947
And then what?

87
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:37,184
I'm gonna need some...

88
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:40,254
some kind of assurance.

89
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:43,290
I assure you I could kill you
from way over here,

90
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:45,259
if it makes you feel
any better.

91
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,821
Walter, you've been busy.

92
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,223
You want to put your arms out

93
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,958
to the sides for me,
if you would?

94
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:06,479
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

95
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:09,682
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

96
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:11,618
I need my sleep.

97
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:15,455
You said no half measures.

98
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:16,889
Yeah.

99
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:20,593
Funny how words can be
so open to interpretation.

100
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,864
You get your car fixed?

101
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,332
Not yet.

102
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,467
You're gonna want
to get your car fixed.

103
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:30,569
Let's see how this goes first.

104
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,341
Has your condition worsened?

105
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,542
Excuse me?

106
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,711
Your medical condition,
has it grown worse?

107
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,813
Not that I know of, no.

108
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,649
Is there a ringing in your ears?
No.

109
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,985
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

110
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:23,089
I'm quite well, thank you.

111
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,959
No. Clearly you are not.

112
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:29,496
No rational person
would do as you have done.

113
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,466
Explain yourself.

114
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:39,406
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

115
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,574
I intervened.

116
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,877
Some worthless junkie--

117
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:47,180
For him you intervene
and put us all at risk?

118
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:48,781
Some contemptible junkie

119
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:50,983
who couldn't keep
the peace for eight hours?

120
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:54,019
That's right.
He couldn't.

121
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,689
He was angry because
those two dealers of yours

122
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:59,225
had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

123
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,994
I heard about it.

124
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,763
He should have let me
take care of them.

125
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,699
Maybe.

126
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,501
Then again, maybe he thought

127
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:09,236
it was you who gave the order.

128
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,009
Are you asking me

129
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:17,812
if I ordered
the murder of a child?

130
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:22,082
I would never ask you that.

131
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:30,389
Where is Pinkman now?

132
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,925
I wouldn't know.

133
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,662
A couple of time zones
away, at least.

134
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,933
Beyond that,
I'd only be guessing.

135
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,035
He has enough money
to last forever.

136
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,537
He knows he needs
to keep moving.

137
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:48,506
You'll never find him.

138
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,374
I don't know, Walt.

139
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,876
It's what I do, after all.

140
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:58,081
He's out of the picture.

141
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,149
I saved his life.
I owed him that.

142
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:02,218
But now he and I are done,

143
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:04,553
which is exactly what
you wanted, isn't it?

144
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:13,663
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man,

145
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:17,333
so if I may, I would like
to review options with you

146
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:21,471
of which it seems
to me you have two.

147
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:23,673
Option A--

148
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,342
you kill me right here and now.

149
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:28,645
Apparently, I have made
that very easy for you.

150
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,048
You can kill me--
no witnesses--

151
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,452
and then spend the next
few weeks or months

152
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,255
tracking down Jesse Pinkman,
and you kill him too.

153
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,458
A pointless exercise,
it seems to me.

154
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,293
But that is Option A.

155
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,795
What is Option B?

156
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,263
I continue cooking.

157
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:49,466
You and I both
forget about Pinkman.

158
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,668
We forget this ever happened.

159
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,671
We consider this a lone hiccup

160
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:58,275
in an otherwise
long and fruitful

161
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,576
business arrangement.

162
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,947
I prefer Option B.

163
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,556
You'd need a new assistant.

164
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:14,992
I could get right on that.

165
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,026
No.

166
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,396
This time, I choose.

167
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:36,282
Your car.

168
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,418
Get it fixed.

169
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,886
Yeah.

170
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:20,095
Really?

171
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:50,259
It's good to see you.

172
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,129
Thanks.

173
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,299
It's good to be back.

174
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:00,069
Well, shall we?

175
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:03,206
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

176
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,644
What about that rhinoceros?

177
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,245
You think he'd make a good pet?

178
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,680
No.
No?

179
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,281
Don't you think
if you called to him,

180
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,482
he'd come running
for his supper?

181
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:20,483
I'll bet he would.

182
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:21,651
I bet he'd come running.

183
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:25,255
You're silly, Pop Pop.

184
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,624
Well, a little.

185
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,425
But he'd probably
knock everything over.

186
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,060
Plus, there's
that big nose of his.

187
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:32,596
That's not a nose.
That's a horn.

188
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:34,332
Is that so?

189
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,233
His real nose is little.

190
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:38,435
Huh.

191
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,704
I learn all kinds of
things being with you.

192
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,178
Okay, June Bug,
these are for you.

193
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:48,512
What about the rest?

194
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:49,747
The rest are for me.

195
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:50,748
No, they're not.

196
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,517
You're too old for balloons.

197
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,821
Oh, you're never
too old for balloons.

198
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,857
Give me a hug.
Oh, I see your mama.

199
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:00,226
Don't keep her waiting.

200
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,227
Bye, Pop Pop.

201
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,528
Bye, baby.

202
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:10,623
Please. Please, no.

203
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,670
Chow, do you have anything
you want to tell me?

204
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,007
Thank God you're here.

205
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,776
They keep me prisoner.

206
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,111
They keep you prisoner.

207
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:39,414
I don't do nothing
for them ever.

208
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,682
They try and make me.

209
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:42,750
I say no.

210
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,786
They steal my chemicals.

211
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,787
I can't stop them.

212
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,055
I am businessman.

213
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:49,056
You're a businessman--

214
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,091
The lady out front--

215
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,993
Hey, lady, are you still there?

216
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,627
Ask her if she's still there.

217
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,844
She says yes.

218
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,548
How's her driving?

219
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:15,917
Driving. Is she good
behind the wheel?

220
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:18,353
Good. She's good driver.

221
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:21,290
Licensed? Dependable?

222
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:22,758
She has a Camry.

223
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,126
Good.

224
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:31,865
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

225
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,367
I strongly recommend

226
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,735
that you return
our calls next time.

227
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,971
So have her drive you
to the hospital.

228
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:44,444
She's gonna need her shoe.

229
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:57,124
Where did they cross?

230
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:59,293
Laredo, looks like.

231
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:01,729
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

232
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:03,830
But like you said,
it's cartel, all right.

233
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:09,135
Probing for weakness.

234
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,669
Hmm.

235
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,194
Well, they didn't find any.

236
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,102
What about Pinkman?

237
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:21,167
I'm making inquiries.

238
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:38,396
Done. That's two?

239
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,198
All right.
Let's close it up.

240
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,108
Bring it down.

241
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:53,244
Ready?

242
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,449
Great. Okay.

243
00:20:58,484 --> 00:20:59,650
We're good.

244
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:07,091
You can take your mask off now.

245
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:19,770
Does that guy ever leave?

246
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:21,038
Nah.

247
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,877
When exactly did that start?

248
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,411
It's new.

249
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,114
We had a...

250
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:34,652
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

251
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:37,555
I'm sorry to hear that.

252
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,290
No, it'll be fine.

253
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,058
Things will continue
to smooth out,

254
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,928
and, yeah, it'll be fine.

255
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:51,068
By the way,
if you're at all worried

256
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,403
about working with me--

257
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,372
Mo, I'm not.

258
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:56,240
Because whatever
my shortcomings last time,

259
00:21:56,275 --> 00:22:00,044
I intend for things to go
perfectly from here on out.

260
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,546
So, if there is--

261
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,781
Gale, you're great.

262
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:05,049
Seriously.

263
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,384
I just--

264
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,986
However you like
things to be done

265
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:11,856
is exactly how we
are gonna do them.

266
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,157
Period.

267
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,660
From here on out.

268
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:19,397
So, uh...

269
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,098
please teach me.

270
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,906

It's good to see you.

298
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,860
Mr. Fring.

299
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,428
Wow. This is, uh--

300
00:23:57,462 --> 00:23:58,896
I should have called first.

301
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,898
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

302
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:03,367
No. No, not at all.

303
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:04,602
Please come in.

304
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:09,407
Can I offer you something?
Crème de Menthe?

305
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:12,410
Oh, no. No, thank you.

306
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:14,945
I'm sorry
for the inconvenience.

307
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,582
Oh, no, no.
It's no inconvenience.

308
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:24,055
I need to talk to you
about something...

309
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,356
something rather pressing.

310
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:32,997
If push came to shove,
I was wondering

311
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:36,967
how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

312
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:39,470
You and an assistant.

313
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:40,971
Why would--

314
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:45,910
Why would push come to shove?

315
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,478
Has Walter ever talked to you

316
00:24:47,512 --> 00:24:48,879
about why he got into

317
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:50,181
this particular line of work?

318
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,983
Uh...

319
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,685
I guess I assumed
it was because

320
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,886
it pays so well.

321
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:58,489
Oh, it is, but specifically.

322
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:01,625
Has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

323
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:06,163
Oh. I'm not surprised.

324
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:07,898
He's a very private person.

325
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:12,436
What exactly are
his health problems?

326
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,904
He's dying of cancer.

327
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:17,541
It is why he does this,

328
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:18,876
to provide for his family,

329
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,111
which he has accomplished.

330
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,279
They will never want
for anything.

331
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,748
He's seen to that.

332
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:29,053
Well...

333
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:31,889
how long does he have?

334
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:34,525
That is very much the question.

335
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,460
He does not want
to talk about it,

336
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:38,963
and every time
I bring it up with him--

337
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,132
Hmm.

338
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,201
I don't know
that he's fully accepted

339
00:25:44,236 --> 00:25:45,770
the reality of it.

340
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:49,073
And not to sound
cold-blooded,

341
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:51,475
but I am running
a business here.

342
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,043
No, I-- I understand.

343
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:54,445
I have...

344
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,213
a very large investment
in this.

345
00:25:56,248 --> 00:25:57,448
There is so much overhead

346
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:59,383
that I can't afford
to shut down,

347
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:01,185
not even for a week.

348
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:04,355
So you understand my concern

349
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:07,558
and my desire for continuity?

350
00:26:07,592 --> 00:26:09,360
I do, absolutely.

351
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:11,395
Now, I intend to keep Walter on

352
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,964
as long as he wants,

353
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:17,768
assuming he's
physically up to it.

354
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:21,138
But as he cannot or will not

355
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:24,108
tell me how long that might be,

356
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:28,813
I must prepare for
the worst-case scenario.

357
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,782
The worst-case scenario.

358
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,856
Uh...

359
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,159
I suppose if we had...

360
00:26:42,194 --> 00:26:45,162
at least a few more
cooks together...

361
00:26:45,197 --> 00:26:47,231
You don't think
you're ready now?

362
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,670
Well, he is such a...

363
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:55,606
a master.

364
00:26:56,842 --> 00:26:58,342
There's always more
for me to learn.

365
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:06,417
But I'm thinking
that if we had...

366
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:10,454
say, one or two more cooks?

367
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:18,095
One more...

368
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:19,330
I guess, would do it.

369
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:20,364
I suppose.

370
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,467
I believe in you, Gale.

371
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,438
I know that when
the time comes,

372
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:29,139
you will be ready.

373
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:44,435
What's up?

374
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:52,943
Walt?
Hmm.

375
00:27:52,978 --> 00:27:55,212
Is there, um...

376
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:00,918
any particular trick

377
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:03,287
to purging the catalyst bed?

378
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:07,858
No, it's pretty
straightforward.

379
00:28:07,892 --> 00:28:10,327
I'll show you
when we get there.

380
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:37,655
Yeah.

381
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:39,289
Tell him I'm in conference.

382
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,100
Can't you see
I'm in conference?

383
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:51,568
I'm looking to find
a client of yours.

384
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:54,271
I was hoping you could
help me out with an address.

385
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:55,739
Which client?

386
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:58,242
Jesse Pinkman.

387
00:28:58,276 --> 00:29:00,044
Jesse Pinkman in the phone
book Jesse Pinkman.

388
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:03,013
Hmm. How would one
track him down?

389
00:29:03,048 --> 00:29:04,114
I wonder.

390
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:09,319
You're still here.

391
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,888
I need your full
attention, Saul.

392
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:13,257
Jesse Pinkman
current whereabouts.

393
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:15,359
The sooner you tell me,
the sooner you can get back

394
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:17,261
to whatever the hell
this is exactly.

395
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:19,863
What am I, eight-grade hall monitor?
"Current whereabouts."

396
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:22,299
Let me tell you
something, Mike-- Whoa.

397
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,868
You are good right there.

398
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:28,806
Now, let's both
get comfortable.

399
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:35,546
Now, when I say
I'm looking for Pinkman,

400
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,848
we both know why, don't we?

401
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:39,717
And you pretending otherwise

402
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:40,918
only wastes my time

403
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:42,653
and serves to annoy me.

404
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:45,456
Mike, uh,

405
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,058
there are rules
to this lawyer thing.

406
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:49,293
Is that right?

407
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:51,195
Yeah.

408
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:53,097
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

409
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:55,299
And that's something
I provide for you.

410
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,534
So if I give up Pinkman, well,

411
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,236
then you're gonna be asking

412
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,071
"Old Saul gives 'em up
pretty easy.

413
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:02,873
What's to keep him
from giving me up?"

414
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:05,776
You see? So then
where's the trust?

415
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:10,380
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

416
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,251
Yeah, it's an argument.

417
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:17,688
So...

418
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:21,725
don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

419
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,861
Now tell me where to find him.

420
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:26,196
You know it's the right thing.

421
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,970
I can't tell you, Mike.

422
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,606
All right, I--

423
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,075
Look, if I was to tell you,

424
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:40,744
I just-- I couldn't
live with myself.

425
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,112
I'm sorry.

426
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:44,948
Hmm.

427
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:46,817
But who's to say I didn't write

428
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:49,052
the address down
in my day planner?

429
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:53,056
Or on a scratch piece
of paper somewhere?

430
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:55,592
Who's to say I didn't
write down a location

431
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:58,262
strictly for my own
professional use?

432
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:04,701
Do not touch
anything on my desk.

433
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:07,671
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

434
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:27,424
I'm just looking out
for you, that's all.

435
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,493
Like a mother hen.

436
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:31,161
Believe me,

437
00:31:31,196 --> 00:31:33,263
money laundering
ain't what it used to be.

438
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:34,832
God, do I miss the '80s.

439
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:36,700
Wasting your time.

440
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:39,303
I'm buying the car wash.
End of story.

441
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:42,306
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so--

442
00:31:58,223 --> 00:32:00,691
Huh? Was I right?

443
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:01,992
Where else are you gonna find

444
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:04,161
a cash-only business
that's this much fun?

445
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:05,729
Unless we're talking
massage parlors,

446
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:08,498
and I don't see it.

447
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:09,666
Shall we?

448
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,542
You ever actually
play laser tag?

449
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:22,446
It's good cardio.
Plus you get to shoot at kids.

450
00:32:32,423 --> 00:32:34,958
You got your bumper cars
over there down that way.

451
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:36,360
Got your arcade right here.

452
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:38,128
All the latest video games.

453
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:39,830
Snack bar is over there.

454
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:42,099
Nothing stopping you from
selling beer to the parents.

455
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,967
That's a whole new
revenue stream.

456
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:45,502
All right, enough.

457
00:32:45,536 --> 00:32:47,170
We're good.

458
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:50,140
Holy Christ.

459
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:51,608
We're good?

460
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:53,510
This constitutes good
where you're from?

461
00:32:53,544 --> 00:32:55,379
My car is bugged.

462
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:56,613
I said maybe-- maybe--

463
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:57,948
I'm being followed.

464
00:32:57,982 --> 00:33:00,050
What the hell have
you gotten me into?

465
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:01,418
My very own P.I.

466
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:02,653
is threatening
to break my legs.

467
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:04,521
That's like Thomas Magnum
threatening

468
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:07,257
that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

469
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:08,458
Over and above.

470
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:10,761
Service-wise,
is is over and above.

471
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,696
You and I survive this,

472
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,932
oh, I'm seriously
rethinking my pricing.

473
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:16,566
Yeah. And that goes

474
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:17,935
double for you, Hip-Hop.

475
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,038
My guy's no dummy.
Right?

476
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:23,307
So I give us maybe 24 hours

477
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:25,509
before he figures out
that address goes nowhere.

478
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:28,211
You guys do your thing.
Make it snappy.

479
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:31,315
I'll go see if they have
Tetris or something.

480
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:41,425
How are you holding up?

481
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:45,696
You?

482
00:33:46,998 --> 00:33:48,732
I got my old job back.

483
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:51,535
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

484
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:55,005
He's their boy, huh?

485
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,374
He's their boy.

486
00:33:57,408 --> 00:33:59,109
How long you think you've got?

487
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,347
Well, he asks
a lot of questions

488
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:04,982
about the cooking process.

489
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:07,050
I try to be
as vague as possible,

490
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:09,519
but I got that guy
Victor watching me,

491
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:11,188
listening to every word I say.

492
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:14,858
Maybe the only thing
that's saving me

493
00:34:14,892 --> 00:34:17,594
is Gale's fastidiousness.

494
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:19,563
Once he feels confident

495
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:22,032
that he knows
my entire method...

496
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:29,606
So what do we do?

497
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:35,712
You know what we do.

498
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:46,523
There's got to be
some other way.

499
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:52,696
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

500
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,364
All right?

501
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,900
I mean, I can't believe
I'm saying that at all,

502
00:34:56,934 --> 00:35:00,270
but for your family?

503
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:02,806
The DEA would love you.

504
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,508
All the shit
you could tell them?

505
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,544
Federal Witness Protection,
that's a good deal.

506
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:09,746
As for me,
I'll hit the road, yo.

507
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:11,982
I mean-- I'll make it.

508
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:16,620
We had a--
We had a good run.

509
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,690
But it's over.

510
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,095
Never the DEA.

511
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:29,966
The cook can't stop.

512
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,902
That's the one thing
I'm certain of.

513
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,704
Production cannot stop.

514
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:36,173
Gus can't afford to.

515
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:42,179
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got,

516
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,281
then I've got leverage.

517
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:45,949
And leverage keeps me alive.

518
00:35:45,983 --> 00:35:48,251
It keeps you alive, too.
I think I can see to that.

519
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:53,490
If I'm the only chemist
that he's got.

520
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,104
I-- I can't do it,
Mr. White.

521
00:36:09,574 --> 00:36:12,742
Like you said, I'm--

522
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:14,177
I'm not a...

523
00:36:16,347 --> 00:36:17,614
I can't do it.

524
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:25,422
I'll do it.

525
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:30,127
I'm gonna--

526
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:32,395
I'm gonna need your help.

527
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,463
I mean, they're watching me

528
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:34,898
day and night.

529
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:37,334
They never leave me alone
with Gale, not for a moment.

530
00:36:37,368 --> 00:36:39,836
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

531
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:42,672
He's not in the phone book.

532
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:44,007
I can't find him
on the Internet.

533
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,276
I can't do it in the lab.

534
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,811
Victor's always there.

535
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:53,083
But if I could just...

536
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:55,852
shake Victor for even
an hour one night,

537
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:58,889
I think then that...

538
00:36:58,923 --> 00:37:01,224
I may be able to...

539
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:05,896
make it look like an accident.

540
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,501
There's got to be
some other way.

541
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:14,471
I'm all ears.

542
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,775
But when it comes down
to you and me versus him--

543
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,343
I'm sorry,

544
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:22,245
I'm truly sorry--

545
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:25,448
but it's gonna be him.

546
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:31,488
You are the only edge
that I've got,

547
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:33,990
as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

548
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,892
But I need you to track him.

549
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,894
Get me his address,

550
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,496
and I'll do the rest.

551
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,839
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

552
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:56,846
Are you gonna save mine?

553
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:10,267
Yeah.

554
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:12,202
Please tell me you found him.

555
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:16,807
6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard,
Apartment 6.

556
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:21,979
You there?

557
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:24,147
Uh, yeah.

558
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:27,284
6353 Juan Tabo,
Number 6. Got it.

559
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:32,456
He's home?

560
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,857
Yep.

561
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:36,793
Anyone watching the place?

562
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:40,664
No. Looks pretty much
wide open.

563
00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:42,666
When are you gonna do it?

564
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:48,906
Tonight.

565
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,507
Once it gets dark.

566
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:57,614
Don't do this, Mr. White.

567
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:59,650
Please.

568
00:39:59,684 --> 00:40:01,184
Go to the cops.

569
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:34,952
We got a problem.

570
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:37,854
Some kind of chemical
leaking in your lab.

571
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:39,723
You gotta come with me.

572
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:45,262
I'll, uh-- I'll follow you.

573
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:46,964
They tell me to bring you,
I bring you.

574
00:40:46,998 --> 00:40:48,598
Come on, get in the car.

575
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,601
I don't know if it's
a barrel leak or what,

576
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:00,103
but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

577
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:06,710
After you.

578
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,548
Walter, the sooner you
figure out what this is,

579
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:13,350
the sooner we all go home.

580
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:20,023
Please don't do this.

581
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:22,859
Mike...

582
00:42:22,894 --> 00:42:24,895
you don't have to do this.

583
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:30,333
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do,
Walter.

584
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:32,169
Downstairs.

585
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:34,571
I'll cook--
I'll cook for free.

586
00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:35,939
And there won't be
any more trouble.

587
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:36,973
I promise you.

588
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:38,842
Okay, if I could
just talk to Gus,

589
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,210
I know I can make
him understand.

590
00:42:40,244 --> 00:42:41,778
If I can talk to Gus--
No. Walter?

591
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:43,080
...I can convince him, okay?

592
00:42:43,114 --> 00:42:44,748
Just let me, please--
Please.

593
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:46,750
Please let me talk to him!
Shut up!

594
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:47,918
Shut up.

595
00:42:50,054 --> 00:42:52,155
I can't do it.

596
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,690
I'm sorry.

597
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:58,962
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

598
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:01,698
Okay? Like you said,
he's the problem.

599
00:43:01,732 --> 00:43:04,334
He's always been the problem.
Without him, we would--

600
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,803
And he's--
he's in town, all right?

601
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,539
He's not in Virginia or wherever
the hell you're looking for him.

602
00:43:09,574 --> 00:43:11,374
He's right here in Albuquerque,

603
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:12,976
and I can take you to him.

604
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,978
I'll take you right to him.

605
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,079
Huh?

606
00:43:18,883 --> 00:43:20,350
What do you say?
Where is he?

607
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:21,885
Right now.
You give me an address.

608
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:23,820
I-- I don't--
He moves.

609
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:26,223
He moves around,
but if you let me call him--

610
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:27,557
No, no, please.

611
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:29,426
No, I just-- My phone.

612
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,895
I'll just--
It's just my phone.

613
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,431
I'll call him,
and I'll have him meet me.

614
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:35,999
All right? Okay?

615
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,101
Okay?

616
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:19,409
Did you do it?

617
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,113
Mr. White?

618
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:25,849
Did you do it?

619
00:44:27,218 --> 00:44:28,852
No, I didn't do it.

620
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:30,987
I can't now.

621
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,990
It's gonna have to be you.

622
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:36,426
What? No way, man.

623
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,662
Listen to me.
You're closer than we are.

624
00:44:38,696 --> 00:44:40,297
You'll have about
a 20-minute lead.

625
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:42,365
They've got me at the laundry,
and they're going to kill me.

626
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,801
Jesse, do it now!
Do it-- Do it fast!

627
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:46,236
Do it now! Jesse!

628
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,704
Oh, my God.

629
00:44:52,343 --> 00:44:53,643
Huh.

630
00:44:54,745 --> 00:44:57,480
Just what the hell
was that exactly?

631
00:44:57,515 --> 00:44:59,149
You might want to hold off.

632
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:01,851
Yeah? Why?

633
00:45:01,886 --> 00:45:04,821
Because your boss
is gonna need me.

634
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,860
6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.

635
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,299
Yeah.

636
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,147
Hi.

637
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:05,248
How can I help you?

638
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:13,423
Take whatever you want.

639
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:17,761
I have money.
I have--

640
00:46:17,795 --> 00:46:19,829
I got a lot of money.

641
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:23,366
I have--

642
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:25,302
Um...

643
00:46:25,336 --> 00:46:26,436
You--

644
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:33,910
Please don't do this.

645
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,180
You don't-- You--

646
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:41,117
You--

647
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,487
You don't have to do this.
