1
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,629
- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?

2
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,358
Oh, okay.

3
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,470
Down means off.

4
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,476
You know why I pulled you over
this morning?

5
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,676
Well, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't speeding.

6
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,035
I've been using the cruise control,
so I don't...

7
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,713
No, sir, your windshield.

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,834
License and registration, please.

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,758
Right.

10
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,477
This... This was from Wayfarer 515.

11
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,394
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.

12
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,909
And that's what shattered
my windshield...

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,514
...some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

14
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,750
I understand.

15
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,913
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

16
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,389
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

17
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,869
I was one of the first responders
on the scene.

18
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,396
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.

19
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,515
What? What, you don't believe me?

20
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,875
Regardless of how that windshield
was damaged...

21
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,999
...this car is unsafe to drive in
this condition. Stay in the car, please.

22
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,676
Wait. Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

23
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,877
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.

24
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,712
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.

25
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,598
It's time for you to listen to me.

26
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,354
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?

27
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,239
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights. You understand that?

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,073
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

29
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,390
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?

30
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,596
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?

31
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,990
I told you that my house
was in the debris field.

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,799
Do you have the remotest inkling
of what that means?

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,713
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house...

34
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,154
...where my children sleep!

35
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,278
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!

36
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,317
- Are you kidding me?!
- Sir, last warning.

37
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,357
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,876
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect.

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,079
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing
his opinion under the First Amendment!

40
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,437
Lastly a little something from
down El Paso way.

41
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,674
Border Patrol came across multiple
homicides just this side of the border.

42
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,754
Truck turns out to be a chicken run
out of Juarez into Laredo.

43
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,990
Border Patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek...

44
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,878
...with these <i>polleros</i> for two years.

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,157
But this time, soon as they made it
across, someone hit them.

46
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,673
Hit them hard.

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,196
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.

48
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,590
So this truck was carrying more
than just people.

49
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,716
What are we looking at,
weed, coke or meth?

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,599
No, doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,557
Why'd the Border Patrol
kick this to us?

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,597
They didn't. I pulled it.

53
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,469
You ask me, this is high-end
cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe.

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,712
Question is, why do we have
Juarez-style action...

55
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,711
...on our side of the DMZ?

56
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,155
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,997
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

58
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,869
Maybe one of those... extra-crispies
knew something he shouldn't.

59
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,151
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

60
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,231
All right, that's it. Slow news day.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,311
Add one more to the countdown.

62
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,072
Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomey?

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,470
We're waiting on that famous
blue meth of yours.

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Twenty-nine days since
we saw it last.

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,119
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.

66
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,350
Local P.D. I gotta take this.

67
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,078
Gomey, go beat your piñata.

68
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,198
Rest of you jokers,
too damn quiet in here.

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,316
Catch some bad guys.

70
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,198
Schrader.

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,316
Hey, what's up, Walt?

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,953
What?

73
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,512
Jesse?

74
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,828
Hey, Dad.

75
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,596
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.

76
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,153
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,031
You doing okay?

78
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,438
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

79
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,752
I just happened to be driving by
and saw the sign.

80
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,673
So you're selling the place.

81
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,558
In this market. Can you believe it?

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,319
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

83
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,994
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

84
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,230
We did all new stucco,
all new master suite...

85
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,437
...sandblasted,
fumigated the basement.

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,035
Right on.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,433
Yeah.

88
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,036
You know, fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,159
I read that in, I wanna say,
like <i>TIME</i> magazine.

90
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,717
So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

91
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,599
All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens...

92
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,833
...granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.

93
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,358
Damn. That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,588
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.

95
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,991
There are pictures on the website,
if you want to take a look.

96
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,034
Cool.

97
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,156
You're looking healthy.

98
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,989
I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.

99
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,838
Thanks.

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,597
You know, I could come by sometime
for dinner or something.

101
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,514
Yeah. Sometime.

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,479
Okay.

103
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,518
Later, Dad.

104
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,794
You know, look,
he's a high-school teacher.

105
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,520
He's never been in trouble
a day in his life.

106
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,557
He finds out he's got lung cancer...

107
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,429
...and now his wife kicks
the poor bastard out of his own house.

108
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,755
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates
a little slack, here's the guy.

109
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,471
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?

110
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,153
Officer, I'm very sorry that
I lost my temper.

111
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,755
There's no excuse for my behaviour.
It was disrespectful.

112
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,476
Yeah. Thanks, man.

113
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,955
She's divorcing me.

114
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,510
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

115
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,436
It is what it is.

116
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,758
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

117
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,711
She said that?

118
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,472
Yeah.

119
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,188
You don't write, you don't call.

120
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,437
God.

121
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,716
It's a disaster.

122
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,518
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.

123
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,636
It's not a disaster, all right?

124
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,917
She's not going to the cops,
she's not gonna tell a living soul.

125
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,677
You wanna know why?
One word: Blowback.

126
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,831
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster,
for her.

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,028
That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed.
You were right under his nose.

128
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,829
He'll be lucky if they let him
bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.

129
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,389
The kids? Paging Dr. Phil.

130
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,678
My daddy's a drug dealer
and my mommy turned him in.

131
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,197
And the house? Gone. Feds would RICO
her and the kids out on the street.

132
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,558
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No. It's not gonna happen.

133
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,399
She's bluffing and she knows it.

134
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,072
Her going to the police
is not the point, Saul.

135
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,198
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

136
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,070
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.

137
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,271
Hey, buddy.

138
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,552
- It's bad. It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.

139
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,792
But we live to fight another day.

140
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,919
And after a decent interval of time...

141
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,072
...well, there are other fish
in the sea.

142
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,915
You've been out of circulation
for a while.

143
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,958
You'll be just amazed at
what's out there.

144
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,475
Thailand, the Czech Republic.

145
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,760
I mean, those women are so grateful
to even be here.

146
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,831
In the meantime,
idle hands are the devil's plaything.

147
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,949
So why don't you get back on the horse
and do what you do best?

148
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,033
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.

149
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,759
I can't be the bad guy.

150
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,752
What?

151
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,873
I can't be the bad guy.

152
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,235
Okay.

153
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,637
You know, we'll revisit.

154
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,277
Just promise me
you won't hang yourself in the closet.

155
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,557
Pop-pop!

156
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,153
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!

157
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,956
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.

158
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,353
- Yeah.
- <i>It's me. We may have a wife problem.</i>

159
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,075
<i>Look, I need eyes on it.</i>

160
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,156
You got an address?

161
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,716
Hey. Dinner's gonna be late.

162
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,350
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout...

163
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,080
...but if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

164
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,029
Hey, buddy,
pass the ketchup, will you?

165
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,991
What? I've had enough trans-fat
for one lifetime.

166
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,912
Two-day drive
from the nearest ocean...

167
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,514
...and you're... eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.

168
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,312
Been awhile since that minnow's
been swimming. Right, buddy?

169
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,279
Yeah.

170
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,036
You know, Flynn here is looking
for a part-time job...

171
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,158
...so, I don't know, if you know of
anything you might want to...

172
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,470
My name's Walter Jr.

173
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,633
Like, what,
you can't even say his name?

174
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,837
If you've changed your mind
about being called Flynn...

175
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,595
...all you need to do is just tell me
that you don't want to be called Flynn.

176
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,035
Dad didn't even show up
till fourth period.

177
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,078
And his eyes were all red,
like he's been crying or something.

178
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,198
But you, you don't even care!

179
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,599
And now he won't even
drive me home.

180
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,958
He won't say why, but I know
it's because you told him not to.

181
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,315
- Honey, I...
- What?

182
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,916
I don't know what your problem is.

183
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,835
You may not love him anymore,
but I do.

184
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,637
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?!

185
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,472
- Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Oh, God.

186
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,837
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no. Hank. Hank, it's...

187
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,434
It's all right.

188
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,956
Hey, hey.

189
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,592
Skyler, I know that you must have
your reasons for all of this.

190
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,957
Sky, the...

191
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,110
I know it's none of my business...

192
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,870
...but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...

193
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,596
You're right, Hank.

194
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,429
It's none of your business.

195
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,948
Oh, my God. After all of that?

196
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,634
Please, tell me
that you are still not curious.

197
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,439
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.

198
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,319
The day I heard the words
"second cell phone". I knew.

199
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,677
- Believe me. Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay. All right.

200
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,559
So, what? Stop dancing around it.

201
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,280
What is it exactly that you have seen
a hundred times?

202
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,953
Please, pleasee... enlighten me.

203
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,555
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.

204
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,110
But, let's face it, underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

205
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,312
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.

206
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,153
He acts up. He steps out.

207
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,233
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

208
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,598
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.

209
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,834
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

210
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,070
I... I don't know.

211
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,631
I think if he cheated on her,
that she would have told me by now.

212
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,749
It just feels like something more.

213
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,632
Yes, yes, yes, 24<i>l</i>7 coverage.
Need you ask?

214
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,313
How much is this gonna run me?

215
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,315
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.

216
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,837
Yeah, I'll call you.

217
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,594
Return of the prodigal,
back to the land of the living.

218
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,239
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

219
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,870
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

220
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,397
Unencumbered young man
with stacks of cash.

221
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,793
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

222
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,476
Speaking of cash, you know
what's giving me heartburn lately?

223
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,519
Your former partner. This guy,
he works like a bastard, right?

224
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,238
Builds a business single-handed.

225
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,552
Finally the big money shows up
and what does he do? He walks out.

226
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,678
Talent like that and he flushes
it down the crapper.

227
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,957
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

228
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,430
Look, I know you're out of it
and all...

229
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,795
...but you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

230
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,757
Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

231
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,352
All right, all right, scratch that.

232
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,557
Yeah, he won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you.

233
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,356
All due respect.

234
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,233
You want a job?

235
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,358
A job?

236
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,271
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.

237
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,432
There you go.

238
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,392
- Hey.
- Hey.

239
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,913
Thought I'd...

240
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,435
...well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.

241
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,273
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.

242
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,477
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

243
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,392
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.

244
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,351
Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah.

245
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,750
She's a beauty. Look at her.

246
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,959
Hey, thanks for being so flexible
on me coming in.

247
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,999
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.

248
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,671
Listen, believe me, this is...

249
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,310
I don't want to bring this up,
but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.

250
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,517
I'm sorry, I just can't.

251
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,157
Is that right?

252
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,194
If you're gonna do this,
it can't be so glaring.

253
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,792
Glaring.

254
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,872
Okay.

255
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,912
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.

256
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,118
Keller.

257
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,238
Again. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

258
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,914
Revenue with no backup.

259
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,792
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.

260
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,998
Yeah.

261
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,590
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?

262
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,038
How about if I just push 28,800...

263
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,511
...out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?

264
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,915
I'm just saying I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

265
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,918
Fair enough.

266
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,878
I'll take care of it.

267
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,031
Thank you for the heads-up.

268
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,109
You won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.

269
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,152
What if your kids found out?

270
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,469
- Lf my kids found out?
- This. What you're doing.

271
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,997
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?

272
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,551
Well, put me on the spot,
why don't you?

273
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,355
I guess maybe I'd...

274
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,316
I'd say that I might have feet of clay...

275
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,835
...but that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

276
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,436
You know, trying to provide.

277
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,151
And I'd ask them to try
to take the time to understand...

278
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,869
You know what? Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.

279
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,077
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water, so...

280
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,110
I'd better get back to it.

281
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,551
Oh, God.

282
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,953
Hi, Walt.

283
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,635
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...

284
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,233
What?

285
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,198
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

286
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,395
No, no, no, of course.

287
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,994
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.

288
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,675
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.

289
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,911
Well, yeah. It is rush hour.

290
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,436
I mean, I could fight traffic
and bring him down to Beneke now.

291
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,830
But wouldn't it be... easier if we...?

292
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,190
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.

293
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,271
Okay, bye.

294
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,629
Why are you doing this?

295
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,828
She's just trying to keep me from
seeing you and you're helping her.

296
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,269
Well, son, I mean, your mother,
she has her reasons.

297
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,351
What reasons?

298
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,391
They're...

299
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,235
Well, they're...

300
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,918
Well, they're just a little difficult
to delineate.

301
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,030
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides
to every story, always.

302
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,351
But she...

303
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,799
Yeah.

304
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,190
This is just how it has to be
for now, okay?

305
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,956
Now, look, your home is your home
and that is where you belong, all right?

306
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,238
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.

307
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,118
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie...

308
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,034
...everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

309
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,790
Everybody is on your side.

310
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,119
Well, it's not about taking sides,
though.

311
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,829
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.

312
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,152
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?

313
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,359
No matter what, all of this has nothing
to do with how we feel about you, okay?

314
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,354
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

315
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,479
You and your sister will
come first always.

316
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,953
Come on.

317
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,953
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay? Both of us.

318
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,192
Let's just buck up.

319
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,560
And I'll take you home.

320
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,956
Let me first just
hit the old bathroom here.

321
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,038
Hello. Good afternoon.

322
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,555
- Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.

323
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,235
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

324
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,516
Better call Saul!

325
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,519
I get it all the time.

326
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,994
We're here to discuss the sale of
the property at 9809 Margo.

327
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,432
I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right?

328
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,239
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

329
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,870
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

330
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,519
However, for our purposes...

331
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,911
...you might just as well visualise
a large bag of money.

332
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,198
This individual wants
to buy your house today for cash.

333
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,033
- Cash?
- Cash. I know, in this economy.

334
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,919
The money is already burning a hole
in my client's account.

335
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,277
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

336
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,874
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

337
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,995
Fair enough. We get a few papers
signed and notarised...

338
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,912
...we can take care of this right now.

339
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,833
In fact, I could wire you your money
this very afternoon.

340
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,477
There's just one little hair
in the soup.

341
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,591
The price.

342
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,069
We feel 875 is very fair.

343
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,391
But I suppose there's always
a little wiggle room.

344
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,392
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down
to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?

345
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,197
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?

346
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,316
No, that's my offer.

347
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,630
That's less than half-price.

348
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,791
We put that much
into the renovations alone.

349
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,678
Why don't we just cut
the clown act...

350
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,798
...and you tell us what you're willing
to come up to?

351
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.

352
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,954
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.

353
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,475
How could you possibly imagine
we'd entertain this?

354
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,959
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.

355
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,317
I thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab.

356
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,959
That used to be in the basement.

357
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,078
I looked over your signed disclosure
statements...

358
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,595
...and I don't see any mention
of a meth lab. Nope.

359
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,911
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.

360
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,433
But no meth lab.

361
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,913
Now, some would call that fraud
in service of concealing a felony.

362
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,234
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.

363
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,595
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.

364
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,398
I mean, good try...

365
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,757
...at sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past a buyer.

366
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,390
I mean, could've been a good deal
for you. Too bad.

367
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,793
Now, I could file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely.

368
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,110
Or I could start some criminal
proceedings.

369
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,272
But I don't think any of us want that,
now, do we?

370
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,796
How about it, counsellor?
Do you concur?

371
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,749
There you go, son.

372
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,357
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

373
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,632
Okay.

374
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,674
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

375
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,115
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

376
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,629
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.

377
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,869
Hi, honey.

378
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,273
Sorry.

379
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,633
Skyler.

380
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,469
I mean, what kind of example do
we want to set here, right?

381
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,713
I mean, can't we at least just sit down
and eat a piece of pizza together?

382
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,633
Just hash things out like adults?

383
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,233
We have discussed everything
we need to discuss.

384
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,198
I thought I made myself very clear.

385
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,875
I got dipping sticks.

386
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,592
<i>You've reached Walt's</i>
<i>temporary number.</i>

387
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,512
<i>Please, leave a message.</i>

388
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,509
<i>When I went out this morning</i>
<i>to get the newspaper...</i>

389
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,592
<i>...I saw a pizza on our roof.</i>

390
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,320
<i>Would you know anything about that?</i>

391
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,631
<i>Listen to me, Walt.</i>
<i>You need to control yourself.</i>

392
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,396
<i>Calm down, accept the situation</i>
<i>and k eep your distance.</i>

393
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,076
<i>If you can't manage that,</i>
<i>I will get a restraining order.</i>

394
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,954
Skyler. Skyler.

395
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,868
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!

396
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,952
Breaking even is not so bad.

397
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,078
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

398
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,872
Poor Jake. He had his heart set
on going to Space Camp.

399
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,988
Oh, no.

400
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,675
Oh, God. This is all we need.

401
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,753
Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?

402
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,830
Jesse, it's really not a good time.

403
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,429
Come on.

404
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,433
Jesse, the house has been sold.

405
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,511
The new owners are... expected
at any moment.

406
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,069
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

407
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,837
I bought the place.

408
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,395
Be back by seven, okay?

409
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,318
Love you.

410
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,312
Bye.

411
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,279
No!

412
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,909
Oh, God.

413
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,909
It's me. There's something
he should know about.

414
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,518
Hold on.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
