1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,878
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,949
So, first order of business is

3
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:06,566
to find a new place to cook.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,970
Partnership.
Three ways.

5
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:09,357
No, thanks.

6
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:10,371
These men were on payroll.

7
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,464
My guys are solid.

8
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:13,288
They're paid to stand
up to the heat.

9
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:14,438
I am scared.

10
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:15,721
- Of what?
- You.

11
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:18,308
Fring had all these
secret off shore accounts.

12
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:19,598
He's not impressed, Gomie.

13
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,043
Perhaps he's picturing all
that money going bye-bye.

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,088
Can you still get your
hands on methylamine?

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,588
Maybe, why?

16
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,468
I reconsidered, I'm in.

17
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:29,627
Good.

18
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,593
- Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
- Hey, Dan.

19
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:43,594
I'm looking for something
in a Markowski.

20
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,831
That'd be, uh,
Dennis Markowski?

21
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:48,799
That's the one.

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,972
Oh, and I've got my, uh,
paralegal with me today.

23
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,441
Paralegal?
Coming up in the world.

24
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,990
You know it.

25
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,762
Hey, Dennis.

26
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,797
Have a seat.

27
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,489
<i>You hear about Chow?</i>

28
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,725
Yeah, people say
he skipped town.

29
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,561
He's dead.

30
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:56,564
It wasn't me.

31
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,666
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,068
It was a mistake
made by a third party

33
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,703
who has since been dealt with.

34
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,036
You got it?

35
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,705
- Yeah.
- The second thing...

36
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,309
The deal you had with Fring--
it's still in place.

37
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,476
Okay.

38
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,478
Don't "okay" me.

39
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:14,547
You got something to say?

40
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:19,185
Mike, I'm keeping
my mouth shut.

41
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,320
The laundry
was right above the lab.

42
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,088
There's no way I could say
I wasn't in on it.

43
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:26,325
I'm looking
at eight years minimum.

44
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,527
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

45
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,396
I'm no rat, and you know it.

46
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,398
What else is there to say?

47
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,233
All due respect,
what are we talking about here?

48
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,602
The deal is the deal.

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,807
How's the deal the deal?

50
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,809
The feds took away
my hazard pay.

51
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:48,646
My wife comes to me and asks me
where the mortgage is coming from.

52
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,047
I got nothing to tell her.

53
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,650
I knew the risks. We all did.
But that wasn't the deal.

54
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:56,553
And I know for a fact they got
Holt and Perez yesterday.

55
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,723
Now, it's not gonna be me,
but absent the hazard pay,

56
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:01,258
sooner or later,
someone's gonna flip.

57
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,926
No one's flipping.

58
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,595
Everyone gets their hazard pay,
including you.

59
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,597
I appreciate what you're
saying and all,

60
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,932
but the man is dead.

61
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,935
Okay? The lab's
a hole in the ground.

62
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,604
- I just don't see it.
- I've got something new.

63
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,941
It's just starting up.
It's gonna make you whole.

64
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:21,010
Something new?
With the feds looking at you?

65
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,179
- How?
- "How" is my business.

66
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,480
Hanging tight's your business.

67
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:27,182
Your family's gonna be fine.

68
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,885
You will be made whole.

69
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,420
Now, you got my word.

70
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,656
You need more?

71
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,194
No, Mike. I'm good.

72
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,698
Who's next?

73
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:46,500
That's your choice.

74
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:48,035
APD's got Martinez across town.

75
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,603
Up in Sandoval.

76
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:51,705
The Sandia tribal cops
are holding him for the feds.

77
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:56,542
And Holt and Perez
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

78
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,978
You don't mean
to get to them all today?

79
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,613
Yeah, I do.

80
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:03,883
Hey, let's go!
Open up!

81
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:21,416
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

82
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,229
Back here!

83
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:11,116
Oh, hi.
How was your day?

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,322
Um, are-- are you
moving back in?

85
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:17,323
Yeah.

86
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:19,558
I'll keep the condo for now,

87
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:22,527
selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

88
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,897
But, yeah, I'm home.

89
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,433
It's time.

90
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,171
Do you, uh, really think
that's-- that's a good idea?

91
00:05:34,806 --> 00:05:36,307
Yes.

92
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:09,005
So you bring him here? Come on.
The three of us? We're the three amigos!

93
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,839
All for one, one for all.

94
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:14,510
We don't need a fourth amigo.

95
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,745
Saul, Mike knows the business.
He knows distributors.

96
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,183
- Mike's okay. - He's okay? He said
he was gonna break my legs.

97
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,552
And don't tell me
he didn't mean it, okay?

98
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,622
'Cause he gave me the dead mackerel eyes.
He meant it.

99
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:30,058
Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.

100
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,994
He probably threatened someone
before breakfast this morning.

101
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,296
It's what he does.
Come on. Grow a pair.

102
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:43,003
Let it be noted
that I do this under duress.

103
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,371
Duly noted.

104
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,208
All right.
Let him in, Huell.

105
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,589
Mike,
I'm extending you the--

106
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,557
Uh-huh.

107
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,694
Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules...

108
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:13,164
Division of labor--
I handle the business.

109
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,533
Making the stuff--
that's your end.

110
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,501
I don't tell you how to mix

111
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,236
your chemicals and whatnot,

112
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,439
and you do not tell me

113
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,207
how to take care of business.

114
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,243
Is that absolutely clear?

115
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,917
Sure.

116
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,953
All right.
Let's take the tour.

117
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:43,060
Hey, you're okay with that?

118
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,160
Yes.

119
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,462
He handles the business,

120
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,564
and I handle him.

121
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,371
Clearly, we're talking
about renting, not buying.

122
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:57,974
You need
an ongoing business--

123
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,242
someplace you can slide in,
do your thing,

124
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,576
and remain anonymous.

125
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,244
I'm not gonna mince words.

126
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,246
This is your best bet.

127
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,082
Got machines running,

128
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:09,818
forklifts,
people coming and going.

129
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:12,821
You're gonna stay
way under the radar.

130
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,322
And the owner's solid.

131
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:16,690
He can't wait to throw up
a curtain wall,

132
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:19,392
stack some boxes in front of it,
give you all the space you need.

133
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:22,362
After that, he's got his
business, you've got yours,

134
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:24,064
and never the twain shall meet.

135
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,233
It's outstanding.
Am I right?

136
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,637
Machines like this--
gotta be plenty of power.

137
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,204
What about the smell?

138
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,506
Ah. More good news.

139
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,206
I've been here
when it's up and running.

140
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:36,809
This place stinks already.
You'll blend right in.

141
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,344
How many employees?

142
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:39,912
Ha. I knew you'd ask.

143
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:42,048
Sixteen illegals,

144
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:45,317
all highly motivated
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

145
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,353
You'll want to vet them,
I'm sure.

146
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,454
Yes, indeed.

147
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,389
So what do you say, maestro?

148
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,825
Huh?
Is it unanimous?

149
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,528
You know, I worked in a box factory
one summer in high school,

150
00:08:56,562 --> 00:09:00,198
I haven't seen
one of these in years.

151
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:02,467
Trip down memory lane.
That's perfect.

152
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,835
You know what this is?

153
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,870
It's a corrugator.

154
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,638
It uses steam and salt

155
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,071
to crimp kraft paper
for cardboard.

156
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:13,978
And it makes a hell of * doing it,
which is great, right?

157
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,713
No.

158
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,381
Steam and salt.

159
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:20,817
When this thing is running,
it's like a jungle in here.

160
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,954
Shit.
It'll ruin the product.

161
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:27,490
Well, you can't just
hop down to Costco

162
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,659
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

163
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,830
What-- fine. Fine.
Moving on.

164
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:41,737
Spacious, isolated location,

165
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,205
no humidity,

166
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,140
and you get all
the free tortillas you want.

167
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:48,877
That's the special feature
of this place.

168
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:50,679
Yeah... I don't know.

169
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,847
It'll make the tortillas
smell like cat piss.

170
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:55,516
Somebody's bound to notice that.

171
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,352
All right. Well, there's gotta be
some kind of workaround, right?

172
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,488
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

173
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,725
You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

174
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,659
Anything food-related

175
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:08,062
is gonna have unannounced
government inspections.

176
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:20,201
All I'm asking is that
you keep an open mind.

177
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:23,309
Dennis' already set some spaces
behind these keepball games.

178
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,277
No.

179
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:27,512
Hell, no.

180
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:37,689
I know it's a long shot.

181
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:40,825
All I can say
to recommend this one

182
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,128
is we're talking about
an owner here who is--

183
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:45,930
how should I put it--
highly amenable.

184
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:53,138
Okay. I get it. Just say no,
and we'll go get dinner.

185
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,706
All right.
So I'll start.

186
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:57,440
No way we're cooking in here.

187
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,543
No space,
nowhere for the smell to go.

188
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,112
Look at that door.

189
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:04,248
That thing rolls up,
and we're open to the world.

190
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:06,250
I don't know
if anybody noticed,

191
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,551
but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

192
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,553
The hammer comes down,

193
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,790
it's gonna be
custer's last stand.

194
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:17,894
It's perfect.

195
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,228
What?

196
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,831
How are we gonna fit
a lab in here?

197
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,734
Who said here?

198
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>A house is infested.</i>

199
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:43,552
Termites,
cockroaches, whatever.

200
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:47,290
Homeowners hire
a pest control company.

201
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:50,158
Truck rolls up,
homeowners leave.

202
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,327
The crew tents the house.

203
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:54,963
They bomb the place
with poison.

204
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:57,366
The house stays like that
for days.

205
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,534
No one looks twice
at a tented house.

206
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,170
Now, maybe there's a strange
smell coming out of it.

207
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,005
Does someone think
to investigate? No.

208
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,508
Anyone go inside?
Hell, no.

209
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,846
And that's where we'll cook.

210
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:18,585
They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?

211
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,853
So we pick the one
that's best for us--

212
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:23,156
enough floor space,
easy access.

213
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,824
Once the tent is up,

214
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,759
we go in, we cook a batch,

215
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:30,262
we bomb the place, and leave.

216
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:33,533
So we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

217
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:37,470
Set up the lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

218
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:40,606
It's challenging but doable.

219
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:43,910
Tell me about these guys.

220
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:46,812
Uh, Mr. ponytail
on the sidewalk-- that's Ira.

221
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,648
He's the owner.
On the roof is Sandor.

222
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,216
The ladder's Fernando,

223
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,884
and down below--
that's Todd.

224
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,553
The pest control operation
is legit.

225
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,322
I mean, they're licensed,
they're bonded,

226
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,623
they do as good a job
as anyone in town,

227
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:02,126
but they're also top-drawer
second-story men.

228
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:03,328
"Second-story"?

229
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:05,496
B&E artists.

230
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,498
They're burglars.

231
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:09,434
Yeah. I mean, hey,
they play it smart.

232
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,802
They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

233
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:15,139
They copy the keys, locate
the valuables and alarms,

234
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,574
and they sell that information
to other crews.

235
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,409
Or, after a decent interval,

236
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:21,711
they'll come back and live
for goods themselves.

237
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,646
And you know them how?

238
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,383
Oh, I've been pulling their
chestnuts out of the fire,

239
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,885
legally speaking,
for five years.

240
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,553
Ira and his guys are good.

241
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,754
I mean, they know how
to keep their mouths shut.

242
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:34,890
And if you buy them,
they're gonna stay bought.

243
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,426
You can check
into them yourself.

244
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:40,896
I will, if it comes to that.

245
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,732
So, do we take a vote?

246
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:48,570
Why?

247
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,940
We sound great.
Rock on, man.

248
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:28,742
Solid.

249
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:31,244
That Yamaha's got
a real nice touch.

250
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,247
You like the sound?
It's huge, huh?

251
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:37,550
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're
looking for something else today.

252
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,084
You got any roadie cases?

253
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:41,086
- For sure, what size?
- Biggest you got.

254
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,689
That'll fit through, like,
a regular-size doorway.

255
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,558
You got it.
Follow me.

256
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:50,629
Top of the line.

257
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:54,131
Recessed hardware, foam lining,
* walls,

258
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,701
three-inch casters.

259
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,970
Height is good, width is good.

260
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,471
How much weight will this hold?

261
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,139
It's rated for 900 pounds.

262
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:04,609
So unless your band plays lead
bricks, you should be okay.

263
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,013
We're gonna need, uh--

264
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:12,282
Hey, man, I'm trying
to do business over here, bitch.

265
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:16,587
Sorry. He's, like,
overly enthusiastic.

266
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,756
Anyway, um,
I'm gonna need four of them.

267
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,658
Four?
That gonna be layaway?

268
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,827
I need to see
a bunch of IDs for that.

269
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:25,494
No, man, cash.

270
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:27,630
Okay. Hey,
uh, you know what?

271
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:31,500
I'll throw in stenciling.
What's your band called?

272
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,144
Damn, brother!

273
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:46,848
Not asking no questions, but it sure
looks like you're back in business.

274
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:49,651
No joke. You way back
in business, man.

275
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:53,238
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:56,190
Oh! You're stacking
the benjies

277
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:59,159
- till the rubber band pops.
- Yeah, yeah.

278
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,428
All's we're saying is,
we know you're major league now.

279
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,464
But if there's ever anything
else you need from us...

280
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,900
Any way we can get in
on this at all.

281
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:09,336
Little stuff, big stuff...

282
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,839
We would be all over it.

283
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,408
You know, uh, maybe someday.

284
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:20,980
That's cool.

285
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,082
I guess we better...
hit it then.

286
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:25,151
Yeah. Keep on
keeping on, brother.

287
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,120
Later.

288
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,790
Okay, it is the same job as always.

289
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,459
You go out, you inspect,

290
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,994
you deal with the customers,
regular drill.

291
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,663
Everything's the same

292
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,532
except for one
important detail.

293
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,874
- No stealing.
- No stealing.

294
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,310
Not a toothpick, not the spare
change between the couch cushions,

295
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,979
not the panties
out of the hamper.

296
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,513
Nothing.
And I mean nothing.

297
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,048
And if you're out
with your buddies

298
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,751
and they ask if you got
a hot tip on a B&E,

299
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,418
you tell them you got nada.

300
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,420
You're out of the game.
The bottom line is

301
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:06,323
that these houses are out
of bounds now and forever.

302
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:08,692
Got it?

303
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,694
All right.

304
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:13,530
From time to time,
you're gonna see these two.

305
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:16,133
Now, as far as you're concerned,
they are ghosts.

306
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,234
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

307
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:19,735
You don't
say "good morning."

308
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,773
You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

309
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,809
On the other hand,

310
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,777
if they tell you to jump,

311
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,578
you don't ask what for,

312
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,080
you jump.

313
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:32,682
Now, you need a name for them?

314
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:36,585
You call them "yes, sir"
and "no, sir."

315
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:42,324
You got any problems,
you come to me.

316
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:44,359
Here's the deal...

317
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:46,394
The finishing tank's
a tight fit.

318
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,463
And with this motor
you've got here on top--

319
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,464
The agitation motor.

320
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:52,399
The agitation motor
here on top,

321
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:54,102
the tank's not gonna
fit in the box.

322
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:56,938
It's just, uh--
it's just too tall.

323
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:59,306
Now, I thought we'd
put a collar on the tank

324
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,375
and carry
the motor in separately,

325
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,077
alongside the condenser.

326
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:05,079
And on the day, we just kind of

327
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,213
twist it into place,

328
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:09,349
you know,
while we're setting up.

329
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,953
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

330
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,022
- That's good.
- Yeah.

331
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:16,957
That will work.

332
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:19,059
And Joe and his guys
can build it, right?

333
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:23,029
Yeah. You know, they're, uh--
they're up for it.

334
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,865
Joe already bought a TIG welder
for the aluminum work.

335
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,800
And, you know,

336
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,835
I figure if they
can pull off the magnet,

337
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,837
they can handle this.

338
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:34,106
Now, listen,
about the smell--

339
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:37,242
about keeping it out of people's
drapes and furniture and whatnot--

340
00:18:37,277 --> 00:18:39,343
when I was down in Mexico,
they, uh--

341
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:43,148
there was this big--
big plastic hospital tent

342
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:45,717
they set up inside of the...

343
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,019
Oh, shit. Sorry.

344
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:51,255
Oh, hi. Sorry.

345
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,357
No, no, no.
We were just, uh, wrapping up.

346
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:55,159
Um, this is my, uh...

347
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:56,960
Friend. Hi. Walt.

348
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,528
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

349
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:01,531
This is,
uh-- this is Brock.

350
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:03,333
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.

351
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,235
I've heard a lot about you.

352
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,737
- Hi.
- Hi.

353
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,572
I understand
you were in the hospital

354
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,041
and Jesse told me
that you were very brave.

355
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,544
Yeah.
A man of few words.

356
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:17,980
I'm sorry. He mostly just
wants to play his game.

357
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,782
Oh, I know that.

358
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:23,319
I have two of my own.
A boy and a girl.

359
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:26,522
Well, I should, uh--
I should go.

360
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:29,692
I was thinking I could
make us all some dinner.

361
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,427
Are you sure
you don't wanna--

362
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,962
Yeah. Won't you stay
for a beer at least?

363
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,066
Sure. Why not?
A beer sounds good.

364
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,352
Thank you.

365
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,802
<i>- How are you today, sir?
- Hello. We're good. Good. How are you?</i>

366
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,837
- Family all packed up,
ready to go? - Yeah.

367
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,542
Okay, here you're acknowledging
that you've removed all pets

368
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,177
and plants from the house
and that food has been removed

369
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:50,847
- or double-sealed in the bags we provided.
- Uh-huh.

370
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,149
And this acknowledges
that you've removed or bagged

371
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,084
any medicines, tobacco,
and pet foods.

372
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,821
Better make sure you got any medicine you
might need for the next couple of days.

373
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,488
- It's already in the car.
- Okay.

374
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:02,825
Holy crap. How much
poison are you using?

375
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,161
It's not how much, it's getting
it to where it's needed.

376
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:07,897
Those are your foggers.

377
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:10,032
They disperse the fumigate
into the structure

378
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,701
where it'll eliminate
any nymphs or larvae

379
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:17,939
as well as the full-grown blattodea.
So, we have all your keys?

380
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:20,341
Any extras on here
you might wind up needing?

381
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,176
- No. I'm good.
- Okay.

382
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,179
This last one here acknowledges
that you have been informed

383
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:27,749
that you may not
reenter the premises

384
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:30,017
until it has cleared
the post-fumigation inspection.

385
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:32,453
So you're gonna
get them all, right?

386
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,689
We'll kill 'em dead.
That's a guarantee.

387
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,727
Sir?

388
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,261
Sir?

389
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:20,263
Yes?

390
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:23,834
There's a nanny-cam
in the living room clock.

391
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:27,638
I disabled it.
I just thought you should now.

392
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:31,241
What's your name?

393
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33,477
Todd, sir.

394
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:31,411
<i>Oh!</i>

395
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,947
Cheers.

396
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:43,589
Mmm.

397
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:45,324
You know, I gotta say,

398
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:49,527
seeing you with Andrea
and that little boy...

399
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:51,863
It was nice.

400
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:55,100
- Yeah. It's good right?
- Yeah.

401
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:59,237
Yeah. And the way she looks at you?

402
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:00,672
- Oh-ho.
- You think?

403
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:03,608
Oh, definitely.

404
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:10,314
So, is it, um--
is it moving

405
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:12,850
in any particular direction?

406
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,618
Uh, I don't know.

407
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:17,254
Maybe. Yeah. You know,
sometimes I think,

408
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,756
you know,

409
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,157
if it feels right, then...

410
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:23,026
If it feels right,
it feels right.

411
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,796
Sometimes you just
gotta listen to your gut.

412
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:31,367
I mean, instant family.

413
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,803
What more can you ask, right?

414
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:35,939
Absolutely.

415
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,774
<i>Cut the cards.</i>

416
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:43,212
Have you thought about
what your plan is?

417
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:47,049
You know,
vis-a-vis honesty?

418
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,819
What do you mean?
How much she knows about this?

419
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:52,387
Mm.

420
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:54,222
Um...

421
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:57,358
She doesn't know anything.

422
00:26:57,392 --> 00:26:59,660
I mean, you know,
she's not stupid.

423
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:01,896
She knows
I'm into something, but--

424
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,365
she could make
a pretty good guess.

425
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,934
But I never told her anything.

426
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:08,935
I'm not gonna.

427
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,637
Okay.

428
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,540
I mean it.

429
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:17,310
I know you do.

430
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,813
Jesse, I can't pretend
that this doesn't affect me.

431
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:24,484
It does. But with everything
we've been through

432
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,485
the two of us...

433
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:29,454
This has to be your decision.

434
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:31,190
I mean, you've earned that.

435
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,927
Seriously?

436
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:36,561
Yeah.

437
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,334
Secrets create barriers

438
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:44,936
between people.

439
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,639
I'm speaking from experience,
believe me.

440
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,440
All that you've done,

441
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,079
it's a part of you, and...

442
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:01,018
I mean, if you choose to spend the
rest of your life with this person,

443
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:05,122
then you'll have to decide

444
00:28:05,156 --> 00:28:08,693
how much you'll share with her.

445
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:12,930
Meaning what?
Like... everything?

446
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:17,434
Like Gale?

447
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,377
I'm just trying to say
that I trust you,

448
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:31,313
and I know you'll make
the right call.

449
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:42,691
If she loves you,

450
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:44,760
she'll understand.

451
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:50,665
They're leaving streaks.

452
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:53,334
This more ethnic-looking one--
he's doing a great job.

453
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,670
But the other one
is going back and forth

454
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:57,438
like he's scrubbing a wall.

455
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:01,242
They have to go in circles,

456
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:03,677
or you're going
to leave streaks.

457
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:06,413
That's pretty basic, right?

458
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:09,649
Uh, I don't mean
to tell you your business.

459
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,017
It's just-- it's--

460
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:13,854
it's simple quality control.

461
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:20,959
So, I've got some good news.

462
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:22,495
Guess what.

463
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,497
What?

464
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:27,533
No, really.
I want you to guess.

465
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:30,403
- Really, I really...
- Okay.

466
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:31,871
Hank's back at work.

467
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:34,606
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

468
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,442
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

469
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,845
Merkert and all the rest-- they just
about laughed him out of the office

470
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,616
when he told them about
that-- that chicken man.

471
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,452
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

472
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,888
If it were me,
I'd tell them all to go to hell.

473
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,656
Do I sound bitter?

474
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,625
But it's--
it's what he wants, right?

475
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,593
Yeah, it's doing him good.

476
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,164
I mean, his PT
is going gangbusters.

477
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,099
He's hardly using
his cane at all.

478
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,269
And thank you for that, really.

479
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,738
I mean, God knows where he'd be

480
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,641
if we had to go through
his health plan.

481
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,643
I'm just glad
he's feeling better.

482
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,645
So, speaking of which,

483
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,379
we have another
big event coming up.

484
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,382
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

485
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,384
Walt's birthday.

486
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,986
Whatever you need, I'm here.

487
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,656
Mm, yeah. I, um...

488
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,058
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

489
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:30,559
What are you talking about?

490
00:30:30,593 --> 00:30:33,228
Of course we're
gonna do something.

491
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:36,832
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

492
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:38,500
I...

493
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,502
So it's been a whole year.

494
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:42,938
Listen, I've had
my problems with Walt.

495
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,373
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically beg--

496
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:47,442
Whatever.
Water under the bridge.

497
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:50,078
But at this point, every
year is precious. We are--

498
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,712
What are you doing?

499
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,549
You don't smoke.

500
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,584
You haven't smoked
since college.

501
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:58,453
You can't be serious!

502
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:01,254
With the baby and Walt?

503
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:03,290
Skyler, you're not smoking
around the baby, are you?

504
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:04,958
And you can't smoke here.

505
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,848
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

506
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:10,612
You can't force your
employees to breathe--

507
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:12,299
I know for a fact
that that is illegal.

508
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,368
Marie, shut up.

509
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:16,035
What?

510
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:18,404
I'm sorry. Please don't
speak to me like that.

511
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:20,306
- I am simply saying that you--
- Will you shut up?

512
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,975
- Hey--
- Shut the hell up.

513
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,444
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Skyler...

514
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,579
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Please stop--

515
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:30,282
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

516
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:32,417
Shut up! Shut up!

517
00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:34,585
Shut up!

518
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,442
That's a 5.23.

519
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:48,778
5.23.

520
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:51,081
Last one.

521
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,285
5.26.

522
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,387
5.26.

523
00:31:57,421 --> 00:32:02,958
That comes to 49.27.

524
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:05,060
Good yield, right?

525
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:08,330
That is an excellent yield.

526
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:14,603
All right.

527
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:50,970
Hey Marie.

528
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,441
How you doing?

529
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:00,913
Where is Skyler?

530
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:02,481
In the bedroom.
She's resting.

531
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:06,117
Is everything okay?

532
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,288
Breakdown? What does that--
what does that mean?

533
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,284
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

534
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,826
But I've never seen her
like that, ever.

535
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:18,497
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

536
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:19,565
Nothing.

537
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,301
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

538
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,170
Did you know she's smoking?

539
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,105
Occasionally, maybe.

540
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,141
It's not a regular thing.

541
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,845
Oh, I just wish
I had gotten your message.

542
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,746
"Messages," Walt.

543
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:39,048
Plural. I probably
called you five times.

544
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,155
I'm not leaving here until I
know what's got her so upset.

545
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:53,329
Are you gambling again?
Is that what this is?

546
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,731
Please, God, tell me
the cancer isn't back.

547
00:33:56,766 --> 00:34:00,569
No. It's not the cancer.

548
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:02,170
Well, something happened.

549
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:08,010
I don't mean to point the finger,
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

550
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:10,277
It's time to tell me
the truth, Walt. All of it.

551
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:13,515
I mean it.

552
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:16,684
You're right.

553
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:26,092
You heard about Ted Beneke?

554
00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:28,094
The accident?

555
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,863
What accident?

556
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:31,865
Oh...

557
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,967
Um...

558
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:36,403
A couple weeks back,

559
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:39,239
Ted took a fall--
a bad one.

560
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:41,307
He gave himself a concussion,

561
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:43,943
and, uh, fractured
a couple vertebrae.

562
00:34:43,977 --> 00:34:46,111
He's still in the hospital.

563
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:48,047
He may never walk again.

564
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,349
Oh, my God.
I-- I didn't--

565
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:52,752
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

566
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,486
Yeah.

567
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:59,323
But that couldn't explain...
Skyler's--

568
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:04,563
Uh... Yes.
Yes, it could.

569
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:12,136
You do know, right?
You...

570
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:14,504
You must know.

571
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:19,109
Oh, God.

572
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:23,814
She was having an affair...

573
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,816
with Ted Beneke?

574
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,185
Listen, listen.
It wasn't--

575
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:30,486
it-- it wasn't...

576
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,690
ongoing or anything, and...

577
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,727
Well, Skyler and I
have been trying

578
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,262
to put things back together.

579
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:46,367
And then-- then the accident
happened, and she got...

580
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,472
Marie, I'm begging you.

581
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:51,974
Please, keep this to yourself.

582
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:54,209
I don't want Hank
to think less of her...

583
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:55,911
or me.

584
00:35:58,748 --> 00:36:01,182
When did you, um...

585
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:05,620
Was she--
I'm gonna go.

586
00:36:05,654 --> 00:36:08,221
Okay. All right.

587
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:32,410
Thank you.

588
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:33,879
- I'm just...
- Yeah.

589
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:10,947
<i>Ouch! That looked nasty.</i>

590
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:32,433
Hey, you okay?

591
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,402
I'm good.

592
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:39,207
Really?

593
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,609
Yeah.

594
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:04,923
<i>Aahh!</i>

595
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:13,639
<i>Come on. You want</i>
<i>to fuck with me?</i>

596
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:15,274
<i>Okay.</i>

597
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:18,110
<i>You little cockroaches.</i>

598
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:24,182
Okay. Come on.
Wait. Wait for it.

599
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:26,517
- This is it.
- Wait. Wait for it.

600
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:28,720
Wait.

601
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:31,123
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>
<i>Okay!</i>

602
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,523
"Say hello to my little friend!"

603
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,195
Nice, just...

604
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,865
Hey, mom, uh, feeling better?

605
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:43,801
Hey. Hey, why don't you join
us, if you feel up to it?

606
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:46,737
We have popcorn.
I think there's some pizza left.

607
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:48,038
If you're up to it.

608
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,807
Yeah, mom. Join us.

609
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:56,179
- Oh, my God. Look. Look.
<i>- You whores!</i>

610
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:57,947
This... oh.

611
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:00,183
Everyone dies in
this movie, don't they?

612
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,254
Ahh!

613
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,061
Okay.

614
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:17,266
For you and you and me.
367,000 dollars each.

615
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:20,235
Ooh. Wait a minute.

616
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,771
After the dealers
got their cut,

617
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:28,710
we should be looking
at 1,379,560.

618
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:31,211
Mike, you're short.

619
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:33,648
You're almost 300,000 short.

620
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:35,317
You're forgetting
about the mules.

621
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:36,984
They get a flat 20%.

622
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:38,652
- The what?
- The drivers.

623
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:42,023
They're the ones that take the
product from us to the dealers.

624
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:47,695
And so, transportation
is worth 20%?

625
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:49,864
They are taking a risk.

626
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:55,702
$275,000 worth of risk?

627
00:39:55,736 --> 00:39:58,872
Wow.

628
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:01,141
What did Gus pay his mules?

629
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:03,977
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

630
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:05,478
He didn't need them.

631
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:08,348
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

632
00:40:08,382 --> 00:40:12,064
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

633
00:40:12,352 --> 00:40:13,937
And you know
where they are now?

634
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:16,355
Government impound.

635
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:19,358
You don't like paying 20%?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

636
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:20,592
Hey, hey, hey.

637
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,928
There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

638
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,696
That's for one cook.

639
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:27,531
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade,

640
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:29,533
my supplier and I
came to an agreement.

641
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:31,769
The methylamine
was free this time.

642
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:33,271
But brace yourself,

643
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,140
because the next barrel
is gonna cost big.

644
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,745
Can we continue, or you got
anymore burning questions?

645
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:45,749
Okay, kid.

646
00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:49,419
You fronted us 120,000
to get us going.

647
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:56,559
So that's 40,000
from him and me.

648
00:40:56,594 --> 00:40:58,827
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

649
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,096
Okay.

650
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,633
Now, Ira gets 110,000
for our piece of the business

651
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,303
and 25,000 per cook.

652
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:09,372
That is 45,000...

653
00:41:10,374 --> 00:41:12,674
from each of us.

654
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:21,449
Ira's guys get
10,000 each per cook.

655
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:31,125
Goodman's cut--
18,000 from each.

656
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,768
Legacy cost--

657
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:44,104
$351,000.

658
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:46,039
That's 117,000 each.

659
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:47,506
"Legacy cost"?

660
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,642
I got nine guys.

661
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,645
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation,

662
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,047
and they know a lot.

663
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,949
And right now,
some of them are in jail

664
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:57,817
and more will be soon.

665
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,086
The feds Rico-ed
their hazard pay,

666
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,288
so <i>we</i> are gonna make 'em whole.

667
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:06,291
<i>"We</i> are gonna make them whole"?

668
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:08,293
What is this "we"?

669
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:10,662
These were Gus's employees,
not ours.

670
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,931
They might have been
Gus's employees,

671
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,100
but they're my guys.

672
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:19,131
So what are they doing
to further our interests?

673
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,385
The cops are looking
at them very closely.

674
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,710
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

675
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:29,814
So we are paying them, why?

676
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:33,984
Because it's what you do.

677
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,853
Ohh.

678
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,288
It's what you do.

679
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:43,594
My guys are keeping
their mouths shut.

680
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:45,529
We make 'em whole.

681
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,298
One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

682
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,799
Huh.

683
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,067
It sounds like
a simple shakedown,

684
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,069
simple as that.

685
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,005
We're paying for their silence.

686
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,940
That's blackmail.

687
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:02,277
Business is my end.

688
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:04,747
This is business.
End of story.

689
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:09,083
This is your problem.

690
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:11,019
It should come out of your end.

691
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:13,622
Hey. Hey.
Just take it out of mine.

692
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:17,559
All right?
Go for it.

693
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:20,695
I don't care.
Just take it.

694
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:30,629
No...

695
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,130
Jesse, thank you,

696
00:43:32,273 --> 00:43:34,174
but... no.

697
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,876
I'll pay my share.

698
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:38,845
Go ahead.

699
00:43:44,718 --> 00:43:46,605
Let me tell you something.

700
00:43:48,455 --> 00:43:50,857
This...

701
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,892
is how it's gonna be

702
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:55,894
from here on out.

703
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:00,265
My guys are ongoing expenditure

704
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:04,402
so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

705
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:16,647
137,000.

706
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,786
That's less than with Fring.

707
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:24,254
Listen, Walter.

708
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:27,323
Just because
you shot Jesse James...

709
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:30,660
don't make you Jesse James.

710
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:39,688
Tomorrow.

711
00:44:55,452 --> 00:44:57,286
So how are you feeling?

712
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:59,154
Okay, I guess.

713
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,992
Broke it off with Andrea.

714
00:45:04,026 --> 00:45:05,827
I had to.

715
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:10,499
She's gonna tell Brock.

716
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:13,001
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

717
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:15,002
It's the right thing to do,
but, you know--

718
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:16,737
I meant this.

719
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:19,473
How are you feeling
about the money?

720
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,575
You're looking at it wrong.

721
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,244
When we worked for Gus,

722
00:45:23,278 --> 00:45:25,546
we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

723
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,081
This last batch was great,

724
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,483
but we didn't even
crack 50 pounds.

725
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:34,086
We maybe cleared less money, but
we got a bigger piece of the pie.

726
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:37,957
It's like you said,
now we're owners,

727
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:39,925
not employees.

728
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:46,231
I've been thinking
about Victor.

729
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:47,999
Yeah?

730
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:52,771
Yeah. All this time

731
00:45:52,805 --> 00:45:56,007
I was sure that
Gus did what he did

732
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:58,043
to send me a message.

733
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,314
Maybe there's another reason.

734
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:05,216
Like what?

735
00:46:07,752 --> 00:46:10,787
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

736
00:46:10,821 --> 00:46:13,623
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

737
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:19,196
Maybe he flew
too close to the sun,

738
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,364
got his throat cut.

739
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:58,562
