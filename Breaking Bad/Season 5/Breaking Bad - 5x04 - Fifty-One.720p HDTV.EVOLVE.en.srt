1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:02,843
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:03,999
Are you moving back in?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,174
Yes.

4
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:08,272
Do you really think
that's... that's a good idea?

5
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:10,287
A list of names.
They trace back to Madrigal

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,733
and they're gonna get
picked up by the police.

7
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,110
Outstanding work, Hank.
If only we had listened.

8
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:15,781
It's not right to put
this on you.

9
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,060
Shut up! Shut up!

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,889
Breakdown?
What does that mean?

11
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,940
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

12
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:23,486
You do know, right?

13
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:25,130
She was having an affair.

14
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,656
Can you still get your
hands on methylamine?

15
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:29,652
Maybe.
Why?

16
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,912
I gotta say,
when you first brought her in,

17
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,446
I had my doubts.

18
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:37,949
But your little darling's
got nine lives.

19
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:45,023
Rear-wheel assembly took the
brunt of the impact, so, uh...

20
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:46,424
Yeah.

21
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,227
CV shaft, boots,
joints, axle--

22
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,594
Replaced all of it.
No way around it.

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,497
I went after market
on most of the parts here.

24
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:57,134
You want me to swap in
factory parts, that's fine.

25
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:59,869
But using after-market's the only
way we'll keep it under blue book

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,140
and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

27
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:05,142
Nothing beats free.

28
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:07,743
Uh, swapped out
your air filter,

29
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,246
topped off your fluids.

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,699
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

31
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:14,159
I know, right?

32
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,285
Oh, and I noticed you had

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,487
some sort of gunky buildup

34
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,489
in the front end here.

35
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:23,291
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

36
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:25,093
Then I remembered
that you had me replace

37
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,177
that front fender
a few months back

38
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:29,027
when you ran over that deer.

39
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,466
We went at it
with the steam hose,

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,301
cleaned it up for you.

41
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,637
Hardest part was the paint.

42
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:39,506
Fern green.
Interesting tint.

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,241
Anything else?

44
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:44,378
That's it.
Zero balance, like I said.

45
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:47,448
Sign here, you're good to go.

46
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,517
People like to joke,

47
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:56,089
but I really, really like this car.
She's * hell.

48
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:59,492
I'm betting you get another
200,000 miles out of her.

49
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,348
Hey, Benny.

50
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,750
What would you give me for it?

51
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:28,486
What's the blue book, you mean?

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,523
No. I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

53
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,192
Well, I'm not
really looking for--

54
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:37,561
$100?

55
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,163
Fifty?

56
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:42,065
Insurance company just shelled
out 1,900 for the parts alone.

57
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,067
Then it's a bargain.

58
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,470
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

59
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,372
You sure about this?

60
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,740
Sure as shooting.

61
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,910
I'll check the register.

62
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:55,545
Dad?

63
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,048
Fifty bucks?
Are you crazy?

64
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:24,128
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

65
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:55,223
Gotta be kidding me.

66
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,780
Oh, Christ.

67
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:27,665
I'm at work right now.

68
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,355
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

69
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,457
<i>This is a heads-up.</i>
<i>You got visitors.</i>

70
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:35,060
Visitors? What--
You mean today?

71
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,729
<i>I mean 30 seconds.</i>

72
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,302
Come in.

73
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,906
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

74
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,835
Agent Hank Schrader,
Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.

75
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,533
We met briefly in Albuquerque.

76
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,282
Uh, yes, we did.

77
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,484
What can I do for you?

78
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,445
Navy plants,
powder-blue shirt.

79
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,034
Hey, buddy.

80
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:26,730
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- They got Ron.

81
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,800
- Ron's done.
<i>- Okay.</i>

82
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,869
No. No.

83
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:34,038
Not okay, Mike.

84
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:36,107
Not okay. The--

85
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:37,942
The look he just gave me

86
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:41,478
was the very antithesis
of "okay," okay?

87
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,879
<i>Breathe, Lydia.</i>

88
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,272
<i>No one's talking to the police.</i>

89
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:48,223
I just had like 14 DEA agents

90
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,988
barge into my office,
screaming and yelling at me,

91
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:54,291
and they were swarming
all over the warehouse, okay?

92
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:55,792
The warehouse!

93
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:58,194
Besides, Ron was my guy.

94
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,129
Remember?
I don't have a guy anymore.

95
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:02,588
Ron fixed security and pulled
the barrels and drove the truck.

96
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,367
You can't expect me
to do that stuff.

97
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,869
I mean, let's be realistic.

98
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:15,743
- Mike, this is crazy.
- I'll send a new guy.

99
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,937
Are you crazy?

100
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,671
My car almost has
500 horsepower.

101
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,508
- It would totally smoke.
- Horsepower isn't everything.

102
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,009
Don't you know that?

103
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:54,347
You have to factor in drag
and torque and suspension

104
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,349
and weight of the car.

105
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,784
And listen, one more factor that
you're not thinking about--

106
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,452
The experience of the driver.

107
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,254
- And I totally got you there.
- Please. Please.

108
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,722
- I got you.
- You drive like a geezer.

109
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,558
Really?
I drive like a gee--

110
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:09,294
Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?
I don't think so.

111
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,000
Bullshit you ever did donuts.

112
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:12,463
Whoa.
Watch your language.

113
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,797
- And, yes, I did.
- Seriously?

114
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,799
Yes, seriously.
And if you show me

115
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,235
just a modicum of respect,
maybe I'll teach you.

116
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,571
- Yeah? Yes?
- No.

117
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:22,639
- No, I won't. I take that back.
- Yes. Yes. No--

118
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,808
- Just a joke. I'm just--
- You're saying yes.

119
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:26,209
No! No, no.
That was kidding.

120
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:28,378
- We didn't shake on it. No.
- Yes. Yes.

121
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:29,979
- We are now.
- That doesn't count!

122
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:33,983
I know you don't approve.

123
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:41,691
But mine... we'll call it a
birthday present to myself.

124
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,725
And Junior's...

125
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,928
People will just chalk that up

126
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,498
as me being a softy.

127
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,969
And besides...

128
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,738
I didn't actually buy
either one.

129
00:09:56,772 --> 00:10:00,641
They're both leases.
So it all fits our story.

130
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:02,643
Okay?

131
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,313
Oh.

132
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:18,525
We can afford it now.
Hmm?

133
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,929
You're back at it.

134
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,165
Well, yeah.

135
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,269
We have to make up
that 600,000 we lost.

136
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,449
What do you think
about boarding school?

137
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,451
Boarding school?

138
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:48,753
For who--
For Junior?

139
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:51,356
There's this place
in northern Arizona,

140
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,358
and it's supposed to be

141
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:55,726
one of the top ten
in the country.

142
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:59,297
He's a year away from college.

143
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:02,799
Why on earth would we do that?

144
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,902
I don't know.
I just...

145
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:08,205
Just thinking about the kids.

146
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,074
Mmm. Holly, too?

147
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,710
Where are we sending
our eight-month-old?

148
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:17,414
Peace corps?

149
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,448
No. I just...

150
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,153
A new environment

151
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,422
might be good for them.

152
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,457
What does that mean?

153
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,076
What's wrong with
their environment?

154
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,165
Skyler...

155
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,204
What's wrong
with their environment?

156
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,808
Nothing.

157
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,249
Hey.

158
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,000
Listen, I know these
last few weeks

159
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,089
have been rough.

160
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,757
The threat to Hank

161
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,559
and this whole thing
with Beneke.

162
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,563
But there's absolutely nothing

163
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,266
for you to be afraid of
anymore, okay?

164
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,268
I mean, clear sailing
from here on out.

165
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,169
I promise.

166
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,507
You know, I want us to try

167
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,610
and start looking forward
to things again.

168
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,580
Speaking of which, my birthday.

169
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,115
Hmm?

170
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,617
I don't know--

171
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,619
I don't know
what you have planned,

172
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,556
and with everything
that's been going on lately,

173
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,990
I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

174
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:43,000
But I think

175
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:46,163
a little celebration
might be good.

176
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,399
For all of us.

177
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:52,770
You know, a birthday party.

178
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,172
What do you think?

179
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,976
Yeah?

180
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,578
Okay.

181
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,748
And maybe, if I may be so bold,

182
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,241
chocolate cake
with chocolate icing?

183
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:15,824
Life is good, Skyler.

184
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:19,961
Ohh...

185
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,535
Mmm. Thank you.

186
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:35,750
Hey, mom, you forgot something.

187
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:38,180
- Hmm?
- Dad's bacon.

188
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:40,082
That's okay.
I can do it.

189
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,117
No. Mom has to.

190
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:47,723
Well, it is
sort of a tradition.

191
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,395
Watch this, Holly.

192
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,830
Watch what she does with bacon.

193
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:59,300
Watch it. Watch it.

194
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:02,103
What is she doing?

195
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:05,439
What is she doing?
Hmm?

196
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:11,278
That's a pretty small "1."

197
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:13,280
Kind of is.

198
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:16,283
Just a little.

199
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,187
Ah, now you're talking.

200
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:22,655
- No. No.
- Good move.

201
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,423
- No.
- No, no, no. It's good.

202
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,425
Very good.
Family teamwork.

203
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,728
Making sacrifices.
Very important.

204
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:31,030
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Thank you, buddy.

205
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,632
You want some?

206
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,968
Guy's some piece
of work, isn't he?

207
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,802
Six feet under
and half a face--

208
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,637
he's still screwing with us.

209
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,073
So, what's next?

210
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:43,141
Oh, I don't know.

211
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,510
This Madrigal thing seems
hinky, though, you know?

212
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:49,047
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger
over here in Germany,

213
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,783
and 5,000 miles away,
you got this guy.

214
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,784
There's gotta be someone
in the middle, you know?

215
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,920
Someone we're missing.

216
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:01,825
What about that, uh,
Lydia what's-her-name?

217
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,660
You know, lady banjo eyes
at the warehouse?

218
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,029
In this world?
No way.

219
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:07,664
Too uptight.
Too together.

220
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,066
Maybe.

221
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:12,369
She was wearing
mismatched shoes.

222
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,671
How together can she be?

223
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:21,177
Gentlemen,
how goes it with Fring?

224
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,714
You know, just, uh,
working through the grief.

225
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,784
How soon before
you submit a final?

226
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,754
Well, we've been
kicking around some ideas.

227
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:32,788
Had you asked me that
a couple of weeks ago,

228
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:35,991
- I'd have said this was
just a mop-up job, but... - But?

229
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:38,661
Well, no one on Fring's crew
is talking to us.

230
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,896
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

231
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,465
Which makes it likely there's somebody
out there keeping them in line.

232
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:47,069
Our money is on this guy--
Michael Ehrmantraut.

233
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:50,171
He's Fring's head
of "corporate" security.

234
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:53,174
- He's a definite hard case.
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

235
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,677
We're putting together a
surveillance team as we speak.

236
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:57,812
Okay?
The other thing is--

237
00:15:57,846 --> 00:16:02,784
This may be unrelated, but the blue meth
is... is making a bit of a * back.

238
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:05,952
- Tell him, Gomie. - Yeah. Some small
amounts on the street-side pulls.

239
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:08,021
Lab's telling us
it's the same stuff.

240
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:10,256
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out,

241
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,794
or it could be
somebody's rebooting,

242
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:17,731
using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

243
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,432
I thought we had
Fring's cooks--

244
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,466
the unsubs in the lab fire.

245
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,469
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

246
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:27,840
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't know.

247
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:30,976
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

248
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:34,947
Agent Gomez,
could you give us a moment?

249
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,619
Hank, I gotta say,

250
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,989
your work here
has been stellar.

251
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,991
Really first rate.

252
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:48,827
Thank you, sir.

253
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:52,130
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

254
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:55,465
You know, I have to
get back to El Paso.

255
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:58,068
This office needs an ASAC,

256
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:00,503
and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

257
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:02,672
If you were to put in
an application,

258
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:06,110
and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

259
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:08,345
I have no doubt this DO
would be well served

260
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,913
with you at the helm.

261
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,783
Wow. That's, uh...

262
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,853
I'm not sure what to say.

263
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,855
It's a big step up.

264
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:20,623
It's not without its headaches.

265
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,424
Politics may take
some getting used to.

266
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,860
Plus, you'd be overseeing
every case in the office,

267
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,762
so you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days,

268
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,296
Fring included.

269
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,233
Much as I hate losing
a good field man,

270
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,802
that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

271
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:37,338
What do you say, Hank?

272
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,642
You want it?

273
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:43,811
Well,

274
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:46,213
considering my wife would
murder me if I said "no"...

275
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:51,118
Yeah. I want it.

276
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,353
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

277
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:04,430
Can you, uh,

278
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:06,833
finish up for me?

279
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:09,302
It's-- it's my birthday.

280
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:12,338
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,840
I probably have
a birthday party

282
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,342
waiting for me, you know, so...

283
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:20,745
Uh, yeah. Cool.
Yeah, no problem.

284
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,048
Hey, uh, happy birthday.

285
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,984
Thanks.

286
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,107
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

287
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,417
Where's your mom?

288
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:02,852
Uh, kitchen.

289
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,393
Hey.

290
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:12,194
Oh, hey.

291
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:18,767
So, what's the plan?

292
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,970
Um, Hank and Marie
are on their way,

293
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:25,006
roast chicken and potatoes
for dinner,

294
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,808
rocky road for desert,

295
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:32,748
and, uh, chocolate cake,
as requested.

296
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,728
What's up?

297
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:49,729
Me?

298
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:52,231
Nothing.

299
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:56,569
Thought you'd be more jazzed
about the new job.

300
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,738
No! What--
No! I am!

301
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:01,007
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay...

302
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,843
- Sorry, sorry.
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

303
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:10,616
Marie, you've been moping
around the last few days.

304
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:13,819
Marie?

305
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,590
What's up?

306
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,126
- Marie, come on.
- I'm sorry. I...

307
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,128
I made a promise to someone.

308
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:27,765
To who?

309
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:32,403
- Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

310
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:36,908
Are you gonna give me
a hint at least?

311
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:39,776
It involves infidelity.
That's all I'm gonna say.

312
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,049
Oh, shit.
I knew it.

313
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,587
Knew what? What did you--
What did you know?

314
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:54,189
Well, I mean, I didn't know it,
but I've been saying it forever.

315
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,425
Walt's second cell phone,
you know?

316
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,861
Sorry, babe, but I was way
ahead of you on this one.

317
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:03,398
Way ahead of me.
Oh.

318
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:07,770
Well, it wasn't Walt.

319
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:12,874
Skyler?

320
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,613
No way.

321
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:24,853
Hey.

322
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:27,688
- Hey! There she is!
- Hey! Hi!

323
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,623
- Hey!
- Hey!

324
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:31,992
- Hey, buddy. Yeah.
- Welcome. Welcome.

325
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,993
Happy birthday!

326
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:37,831
I'm in the center lane
going about 60,

327
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:40,801
and I had no choice but just
tear butt out of there.

328
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:43,168
Just bwaaa!
So sweet.

329
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,237
Yeah, you know, highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

330
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,172
Gonna get their ticket quota
in a month.

331
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,041
You'll help me out,
right, Uncle Hank,

332
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,043
now that you run the DEA?

333
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:54,279
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled brat
car wash millionaire nephew?

334
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,016
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

335
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,751
All right.

336
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,587
- Well, I'm outta here.
- Okay.

337
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,656
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, buddy.

338
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,927
- Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.
- Thanks.

339
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,896
- I'll see y'all later.
- All right.

340
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,531
- All right. Have fun.
- Bye, drive safe.

341
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,625
- Drive safely, okay?
- I do.

342
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,967
- Slow down.
- Never.

343
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,377
A hell of a couple cars
there, Walt.

344
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,546
Honey, for my next birthday,

345
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,347
I'm gonna take
a page here from Walt

346
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:33,650
and buy myself a jet plane.

347
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:36,352
Well, maybe
I over did it a little.

348
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:38,287
But with these
new lease rates--

349
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,924
I mean,
they're mighty attractive.

350
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,800
Great dinner, Skyler.

351
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:55,270
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I tell you.

352
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:57,739
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

353
00:22:57,774 --> 00:22:59,074
How do you do that?

354
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:03,562
- A potato ricer.
- A ricer?

355
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:06,246
You don't hand mash?

356
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:09,183
No.

357
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:20,493
- Well, uh...
- Boy, it has...

358
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:23,529
It has been quite a year, huh?

359
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:25,531
Do you know that, uh,

360
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:28,868
it's almost exactly a year ago

361
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:30,904
that I got my diagnosis?

362
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:32,839
- Jesus. Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:35,808
- Seems like longer, doesn't it?
- Yeah. No. It's, uh...

364
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:39,311
One year ago tomorrow.

365
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:42,047
Day after my 50th.

366
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,447
Honestly, I never thought
I'd make it this far.

367
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:50,822
The cancer and surgery

368
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:53,457
and Hank being shot--

369
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:55,259
It's just...

370
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,729
So many dark days.

371
00:23:57,763 --> 00:23:59,864
Well...

372
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:03,001
There's Marie's talking pillow.

373
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:05,869
Remember that?

374
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,570
It was...

375
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:10,774
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

376
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:17,447
I think I was too scared

377
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,315
or too angry or...

378
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,652
I don't know.
I just wanted to quit.

379
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:27,823
But you guys--
You got me through it somehow.

380
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:30,826
Kept me going.

381
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:35,831
And that happened again
and again and again.

382
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:38,466
I mean, there were times

383
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,970
when I was sure I was done for.

384
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:44,372
But then someone

385
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:46,574
or something

386
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:51,012
would come through for me.

387
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:53,914
God. And Skyler--
I can't--

388
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:56,684
Honey, remember that
first week of chemotherapy?

389
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:59,119
That night
on the bathroom floor?

390
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:01,453
What you said to me?

391
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:05,426
I was so sick.

392
00:25:05,492 --> 00:25:08,861
It was rough going at first.

393
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:10,963
But Skyler--

394
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:13,399
She was right there, of course,

395
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:16,368
putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

396
00:25:16,403 --> 00:25:18,469
And she's singing to me.

397
00:25:18,504 --> 00:25:21,773
And this would go on and on,

398
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:24,475
day after day.

399
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,146
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom,

400
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:32,850
because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

401
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:35,853
And my head
was in Skyler's lap,

402
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:39,090
and I was just asking her

403
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:41,792
if this could all be over.

404
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:47,497
It was too hard. It was...
I just wanted it to stop.

405
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:50,233
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

406
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,105
Whoa. Hey-o. Pool party.

407
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,374
What are you doing, Skyler?

408
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:01,010
What is she doing?
Walt?

409
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:04,047
Hey, uh, Sky,
maybe it's time to get out now.

410
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,413
What do you think?

411
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,549
Skyler, Hank asked you
a question.

412
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:11,253
You need to get out n--
Skyler!

413
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:13,588
She's gonna come up, right?

414
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,039
She has to.

415
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,599
Skyler, you need to get out.

416
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600
Oh, my God.

417
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:42,269
Wha-- Okay.

418
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:45,205
Okay. It's gotta be...

419
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:50,878
Nope.

420
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,714
Okay...

421
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:56,716
Come on!
How am I supposed to...

422
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:11,830
Hey.

423
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,398
Wait.

424
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:16,401
Wait, wait.
Who are you?

425
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:19,271
I'm the-- I'm the guy.
So where's the--

426
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,273
Hold on. Hold on.

427
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,075
Who sent you?

428
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:26,178
Who sent me?
Who do you think?

429
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:30,882
- No. I'm asking you.
- Mike...

430
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,349
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

431
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,552
And this Mike person--

432
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:36,688
What's his last name?

433
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:40,291
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico,

434
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,060
and I got
a 900-mile drive back.

435
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,461
That's 14 hours
if I don't stop.

436
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,831
So, the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

437
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,138
Uh, Ehrmantraut.

438
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,841
Okay? Satisfied?

439
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:04,880
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
apologize for being careful.

440
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:06,882
With all that's been happening
around here, for all I knew,

441
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:09,085
you were one of those undercover
people they send into high schools.

442
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,155
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day if
we're getting ganged by prison guards.

443
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:15,190
Oh, no doubt.

444
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:16,958
So, uh,
where's the--

445
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,494
Up there.
Number 22356.

446
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:21,630
That's the one I erased
from the inventory,

447
00:28:21,664 --> 00:28:23,665
so it has to be that one.

448
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:27,602
- Can you reach it?
- With a forklift.

449
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:29,303
You got one?

450
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:51,991
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Stop!

451
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:57,096
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

452
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:58,597
What?

453
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:01,701
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

454
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:22,419
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

455
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,989
No. No, of course not.

456
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:28,826
No, no.

457
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,861
I just...

458
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:41,404
She and I are
having some issues.

459
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:45,108
Yeah, yeah. I, uh--
I might've heard

460
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:47,143
a little bit about that.

461
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:50,413
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

462
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:52,414
You know, said that,

463
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:54,683
you know, you guys were...

464
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:57,619
having some issues.

465
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:04,159
So, uh, what's the next move?

466
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:07,495
It may be good to have
her talk to someone.

467
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,497
- Oh, I agree.
- Yeah.

468
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,366
Well, I'm gonna
get on that first thing.

469
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,701
Yeah.

470
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:16,237
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

471
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,406
She seems really happy
with him.

472
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:21,408
Not that Marie's
an advertisement

473
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:24,010
for advanced mental health
or anything.

474
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:26,813
You know...

475
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:31,016
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

476
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:37,489
Some birthday, huh?

477
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:49,600
She's gonna try
and get some sleep.

478
00:30:49,635 --> 00:30:51,636
Oh, okay.

479
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:58,843
What was that?

480
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:03,080
- I don't know.
- I mean, was she trying...?

481
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:05,282
No, not in
a swimming pool. No.

482
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:07,918
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

483
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:12,555
But, uh, we both, uh,

484
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,892
think that...

485
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:18,295
she should talk to someone.

486
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,664
I'm gonna get you
Dave's number.

487
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:23,266
Okay.

488
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:28,971
Listen, Walt, I--

489
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:31,573
I can't help but sense

490
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,976
that there may be some issues

491
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:35,944
between you and Skyler.

492
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,046
None of our business,
of course.

493
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,849
And, Hank, I don't know if you

494
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:43,285
- picked up on any of--
- He knows--

495
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,687
He knows I know.

496
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:56,496
These things happen
in a marriage,

497
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,112
but it isn't unfixable.

498
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:04,004
I think what would
be great is if

499
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,140
you two had some space

500
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:10,576
to work through this stuff.

501
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,111
So--

502
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:16,282
And keep an open mind here.

503
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:19,452
What if we took the kids
for a while?

504
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:22,822
- Took the kids?
- Absolutely.

505
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:26,992
We'll look after them for a
day or two, or however long,

506
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:30,362
and leave you and Skyler

507
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:32,664
to look after each other.

508
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:35,133
Uh, that's very generous
of you, Marie,

509
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:39,703
but I-- I just don't see
how that's a solution.

510
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,505
And-- I mean--

511
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:45,709
Besides, Junior and Holly--
That's a lot of work.

512
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,511
No, it isn't.

513
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,513
Junior's independent,

514
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:52,950
and my niece
is only the easiest,

515
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:56,119
most delicious baby
that was ever born.

516
00:32:56,153 --> 00:32:58,288
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah.

517
00:32:58,322 --> 00:32:59,289
Yeah.

518
00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:01,291
Absolutely. Yeah.

519
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:02,959
It's a good idea.

520
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,328
I think it's a great idea.

521
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:09,332
Just the thing for both of you.

522
00:33:14,837 --> 00:33:17,406
Marie,

523
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,882
this idea--

524
00:33:21,217 --> 00:33:22,476
was it yours?

525
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:25,347
Actually, it was Skyler's.

526
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,019
Uh-huh.

527
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,788
She really needs this, Walt.

528
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,725
Yep.

529
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:48,936
I gave Marie bottles.

530
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,539
They'll stop and pick up
diapers on their way.

531
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:55,675
I spoke with Junior
on the phone,

532
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:57,877
and after much discussion,

533
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,379
he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes.

534
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:05,151
And so, voila, the kids
are out of this environment.

535
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:08,154
What a coincidence.

536
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:10,923
I know you're awake.

537
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:18,964
What was that about?
Can you explain it?

538
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,235
I don't want the children
here anymore.

539
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,271
It isn't safe.

540
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:31,275
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

541
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:33,277
It has never been more safe.

542
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:35,212
"Never been"?

543
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:38,382
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house

544
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,851
to kill us,
to murder your entire family.

545
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:43,520
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming.

546
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:45,722
And I dealt with him.
It's over.

547
00:34:45,756 --> 00:34:47,223
It is not.

548
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:49,592
You're right back
in the meth business again.

549
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:52,996
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

550
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,931
So wait.
Now that you're in charge,

551
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:59,627
it's what, it's gonna be smooth
sailing from here on out?

552
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,038
I don't see why not.

553
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:05,007
I keep the work
at work, Skyler,

554
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:07,442
and nothing will ever impact
you or the kids.

555
00:35:07,477 --> 00:35:10,745
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

556
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:13,281
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

557
00:35:13,316 --> 00:35:15,683
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

558
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:18,320
I thought you were the danger.

559
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:28,396
Is that what
your pool stunt was about?

560
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,098
Trying to protect
my children from me?

561
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,167
Not just you...

562
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:35,368
There's blood on my hands too.

563
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:38,138
What blood? Beneke?

564
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:40,997
He's in the hospital
because of me.

565
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,282
- No.
- Because of what I did.

566
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:45,245
Skyler, you can't beat
yourself up over this thing.

567
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:48,081
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

568
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:50,583
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control,

569
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:53,285
but you did what you had to do
to protect your family.

570
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,754
And I'm sorry.
That doesn't make you a bad person,

571
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:57,456
it makes you a human being.

572
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,026
Stop it, Walt.
Just stop.

573
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:03,562
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

574
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:05,130
I'm in it now.

575
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,698
I'm compromised.
But I won't--

576
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,668
I will not have my children
living in a house

577
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,603
where dealing drugs

578
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,005
and hurting people
and killing people

579
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,675
is shrugged off
as "shit happens."

580
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,743
We're back at it?
Fine.

581
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:23,501
But the kids stay away,
and that's that.

582
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,574
That's that?
That's what?

583
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:26,983
I got them out of this house.

584
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:29,319
To a sleepover
at their aunt and uncle's?

585
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,588
They spend a day or two,

586
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,324
Junior stays up late watching
movies, and then what happens?

587
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,959
- We'll see.
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

588
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,749
They come home.
To this house.

589
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:40,896
To their parents who love them.

590
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,432
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

591
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:47,069
- How many times do I have to say
that they are not in-- - I said no.

592
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,493
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

593
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:59,747
What are you gonna do
to stop it?

594
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,125
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

595
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,894
Like what? I mean, specificly.

596
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,457
What is your next move?

597
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:11,758
My next move
is maybe I hurt myself.

598
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,893
Make it clear
we need more time.

599
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:16,463
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

600
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,098
No, more like
you're still struggling.

601
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:20,534
So maybe next time,
I have you committed.

602
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:23,170
Put you in some
inpatient facility

603
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:25,005
while I take care
of the kids myself.

604
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,007
Is that what you want?

605
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:30,576
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck,

606
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:32,578
give myself a black eye,

607
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:34,313
say that you beat me

608
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:37,150
when you found out
about my lover.

609
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:41,621
I see.

610
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:43,955
So you want to involve Ted?

611
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,457
Oh, well, that'll be fun,

612
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:47,992
bringing the police
up to speed on all of that.

613
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:50,928
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son

614
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:53,798
that his father
is a wife-beater.

615
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:56,334
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

616
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,070
I could send Junior
away to school.

617
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:01,380
Oh. Now here's
the conversation...

618
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:04,648
"So, honey, I know you've
only got one year left in high school,

619
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:07,344
but I would love it so much
if you would drop everything,

620
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:10,548
leave all your friends behind, and
go to boarding school in Arizona."

621
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:13,083
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing

622
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:15,142
a solution to your problem.

623
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:18,331
How are you going
to save our kids

624
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,089
from this terrible environment?

625
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:21,891
- I--
- What are you gonna do?

626
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,359
Are you gonna run off
to France?

627
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:25,161
Are you gonna close the
curtains, change the locks?

628
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:27,163
This is a joke.
Come on, Skyler.

629
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:30,667
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

630
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:34,803
- What's the plan?
- I don't know!

631
00:38:34,837 --> 00:38:37,439
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

632
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:40,509
I-- I will count
every minute

633
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:42,177
that the kids
are away from here,

634
00:38:42,212 --> 00:38:44,112
away from you, as a victory.

635
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:47,381
But you're right.

636
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:50,318
It's a bad plan.

637
00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:54,888
I don't have any
of your magic, Walt.

638
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:56,591
I don't know what to do.

639
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,826
I'm a coward.

640
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,061
I-- I can't go
to the police.

641
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:03,063
I can't stop
laundering your money.

642
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:04,997
I can't keep you
out of this house.

643
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:07,634
I can't even keep you
out of my bed.

644
00:39:09,136 --> 00:39:11,971
All I can do is wait.

645
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:14,341
That's it.
That's the only good option.

646
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,875
Hold on,

647
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:17,844
bide my time,

648
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:19,545
and wait.

649
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:24,816
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

650
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:29,521
For the cancer to come back.

651
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,097
Yeah?

652
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,868
Okay. Okay.

653
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,736
Just relax.
I'm coming.

654
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:40,085
Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

655
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,154
If the DEA's tracking
her barrels,

656
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:44,022
there goes
our precursor connection.

657
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:46,524
That's done.
And I'm telling you these days,

658
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,460
chances of getting a new
methylamine hook-up is rare, man.

659
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:51,529
It's like Bigfoot.
Like unicorn-rare.

660
00:40:51,564 --> 00:40:56,034
Kid, it's just--
You're giving me heartburn here.

661
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:58,635
GPS on the bottom
of the barrel.

662
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,238
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

663
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,107
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

664
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,409
They made these things
to put under cars.

665
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:07,011
They can get wet.

666
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:08,345
Huh.

667
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:11,515
Even by cop standards
this is sloppy.

668
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:13,016
And the other barrels--

669
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,484
They have trackers
on the outside too?

670
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,621
I don't know.
Probably.

671
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:21,657
- You didn't check any
of the other barrels? - No.

672
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:24,127
But that's the only one we
could've taken, according to her.

673
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:26,129
Once we spotted it,
she freaked out,

674
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:29,198
I put the barrel back,
and we FO'd.

675
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:31,166
Let me ask you something.

676
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:33,301
The person
who spotted this--

677
00:41:33,336 --> 00:41:35,337
Was it you or was it her?

678
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,906
Lydia.
She saw it first.

679
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:40,809
Okay.

680
00:41:40,844 --> 00:41:42,644
She's dead.

681
00:41:42,678 --> 00:41:44,246
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

682
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,348
Lydia planted this thing,
not the cops.

683
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,183
She's thinking
if she makes it look

684
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:51,185
like her inventory's
being watched

685
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,188
that we'll leave her alone
and take our business elsewhere.

686
00:41:54,189 --> 00:41:55,656
And she's right,

687
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,773
we will be taking
our business elsewhere,

688
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:00,929
right after I leave her
alone in a ditch.

689
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:03,329
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff,

690
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:05,431
that's a good thing, right?

691
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:07,200
I mean, all we gotta do
is tell her to,

692
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,269
you know, cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

693
00:42:09,303 --> 00:42:11,371
You don't know
this woman like I do.

694
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:14,674
I had a chance to deal with this
before, and I gave her a pass.

695
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,709
That's what I get
for being sexist.

696
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:18,377
Now, if you'll excuse me...

697
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,246
Mike, you can't just...

698
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,815
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

699
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:26,485
Kid, if we have to ramp down
for a while, so be it.

700
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:29,922
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

701
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:32,724
Look, she didn't seem crazy
to me, you know?

702
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,526
She just seemed, like, uptight.

703
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,861
And now you're being sexist.

704
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:39,464
Trust me, this woman
deserves to die

705
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:41,933
as much as any man
I've ever met.

706
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:44,002
No. Wait!

707
00:42:44,237 --> 00:42:45,837
Just wait.

708
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:48,106
What if this really was
the cops, you know?

709
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,108
- And what if you're wrong about her?
- I'm not wrong.

710
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:53,444
But what if you are?

711
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:57,315
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

712
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:00,117
Now move away from me.

713
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:02,252
No. This is
a voting thing.

714
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:06,122
- I don't think so.
- I vote it's a voting thing.

715
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:08,090
Mr. White,
weigh in here, would you?

716
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,493
What do you think?

717
00:43:10,528 --> 00:43:13,262
Mr. White?

718
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,906
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

719
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:28,076
We are not ramping down.

720
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,347
We're just getting started.

721
00:43:31,381 --> 00:43:34,683
Nothing stops this train.

722
00:43:34,718 --> 00:43:36,852
Nothing.

723
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:41,389
Hey, yo, Mr. White.
Hold up.

724
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:46,394
I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.

725
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:49,731
You know, it's pretty, uh...

726
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:52,299
I think it's the way to go.

727
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,270
Oh, hey, um,

728
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:00,807
you said it was your--
your birthday, so...

729
00:44:03,378 --> 00:44:05,345
I left the receipt in the box

730
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,814
in case you wanna exchange it.

731
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:12,718
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

732
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:29,968
Hi.

733
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:40,178
I, uh, stopped by
Hank and Marie's.

734
00:44:40,213 --> 00:44:44,415
Junior is still asking,
"what is going on?"

735
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:47,184
Nonstop, very insistently.

736
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:49,520
But everything's okay.

737
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:52,890
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

738
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:54,992
It's very sweet.

739
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:58,795
How are you?

740
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:09,072
There's gonna be some more
money coming in soon.

741
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,207
Is that okay?

742
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,410
Fine.

743
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,078
Good.

744
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:21,317
So...

745
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:24,019
Are you coming to bed?

746
00:45:48,742 --> 00:45:50,743
I wanna show you something.

747
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:55,414
See that watch?

748
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:58,584
It's a birthday present.

749
00:45:58,618 --> 00:46:01,620
The person who gave me
this present

750
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:04,290
wanted me dead too.

751
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:06,692
Not that long ago,

752
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:08,759
he pointed a gun
right between my eyes,

753
00:46:08,794 --> 00:46:10,495
right here,

754
00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:13,298
and he threatened to kill me.

755
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:18,269
He changed his mind
about me, Skyler,

756
00:46:19,271 --> 00:46:21,606
and so will you.

757
