1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,586
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,999
The hospital bill came.
$13,000 and counting.

3
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:06,551
I can create a network.

4
00:00:06,676 --> 00:00:09,113
Cut out the middle man.
Run our own game.

5
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:11,466
This is a big opportunity.

6
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:14,764
He flat-out
offered to pay for my treatment.

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,475
Have you been in touch with Elliott?
I haven't seen a check from him.

8
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,094
Is this about you and me?

9
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,229
Gretchen, I really
appreciate the offer.

10
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:22,652
I am covered.

11
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:24,941
Your guy got robbed.
It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,057
You're sweating me over a grand?

13
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,784
I want you to handle it.

14
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:11,072
What up?

15
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:12,613
Damn, bitch.

16
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:19,034
Got something for me?

17
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:20,668
Yeah, I found them.

18
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,442
Is this a 5 or an S?

19
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:29,256
5, yo.

20
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:31,546
No, wait. S.

21
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:34,218
Yeah, a 5.

22
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:40,682
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

23
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:41,961
Hey, man.

24
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:45,674
I'm slinging mad volume and fat-stacking
Benjis, you know what I'm saying?

25
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,649
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

26
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,585
So they got names?

27
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:54,300
Hers is, like, I don't know.

28
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,425
She's just this woman is all.

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,240
Him they call Spooge.

30
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:00,623
Spooge?

31
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,107
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

32
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,039
So let me get this straight.
You got jacked

33
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:07,764
by a guy named Spooge?

34
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,098
Yo, what's his name matter?

35
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:13,590
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big!

36
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:16,478
But if you're looking for
a reason not to go do this thing...

37
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,953
- Did I say that?
- 'Cause I'll go do it myself, right?

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,520
It's just I'm on probation and all.

39
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,629
So you gonna do it?

40
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,292
Good. Right on.

41
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:36,285
'Cause these two,
they need to get got.

00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:09,162
Where's my money, bitch?

45
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,107
Where's my money?

46
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,141
That's good.

47
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,865
Come on.

48
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,919
I will mess you up.

49
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,818
Is that how you want to play this?
Your call.

50
00:04:38,164 --> 00:04:39,614
Your funeral, Jack.

51
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:45,575
Do not mess with me.
I will bury you 'cause I'm crazy.

52
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,208
You know. <i>Mucho loco</i>.

53
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,168
Do not test me.

54
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,436
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

55
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,359
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

56
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:10,022
Sorry.

57
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,236
I think it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

58
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,271
Yeah, High 70s.

59
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,290
You have a great day.

60
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:20,909
Right on. You too.

61
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,895
God! Shit!

62
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,124
Anybody home?

63
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,086
<i>Tonight, you will receive</i>

64
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:23,268
<i>the ultimate fixture of cutlery.</i>

65
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,621
<i>Tonight, in this steel knockout...</i>

66
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,940
Yo, is anybody else home?

67
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:43,005
Where's your folks?
They here?

68
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,418
What's your name?

69
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:28,268
My name's...

70
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,149
Diesel.

71
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:40,619
Yo, don't you want to watch
something other than this?

72
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:43,552
Like, I don't know, <i>Mr. Rogers</i>?

73
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,879
So when your folks coming home?

74
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,345
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?

75
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:29,171
When is he getting back?

76
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,788
I'm hungry.

77
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:41,943
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

78
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:45,332
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

79
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:49,446
<i>We'll be thinkin thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences and...</i>

80
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:53,752
<i>Okay, that's officially
all I remember. Good luck.</i>

81
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,850
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

82
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:02,684
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz,</i>

83
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,717
<i>just calling to say hello.</i>

84
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:08,203
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today,
and I was just thinking about you both,</i>

85
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:09,691
<i>hoping everything's well.</i>

86
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,035
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected,</i>

87
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,962
<i>so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

88
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:18,074
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

89
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:24,290
<i>This is Skyler White.</i>

90
00:10:24,648 --> 00:10:26,793
<i>Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

91
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,872
No, not at all.

92
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:31,764
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

93
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,131
<i>Very well, thank you.</i>

94
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,927
Walt is actually at work today.

95
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,802
It's his first day back at work,

96
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:41,422
<i>and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

97
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:43,925
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

98
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:48,499
I'm just so glad to hear that
everybody's fine. That's wonderful.

99
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:52,879
I'm so very, very long overdue
in telling you this,

100
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:55,195
and I just have to take
Walt at his word

101
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:59,784
<i>that he's been passing it along for me.
I mean, he's been so adamant about</i>

102
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:02,866
wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself.

103
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,664
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just...

104
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,347
- What is it?
- <i>I can't...</i>

105
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,835
begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

106
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,428
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...</i>

107
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,491
It's saved us.

108
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:29,127
I don't know if I...

109
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:32,577
Walt keeps saying, "Don't bother them.
It's no big deal."

110
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:34,252
But it is a big deal.

111
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:35,980
To me.

112
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:37,873
And to all of us.

113
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:39,826
So I just...

114
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:43,270
finally wanted to...

115
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,845
say thank you.

116
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,128
<i>Anyway.</i>

117
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,470
End of speech.

118
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,266
So, I do hope
we get to see you soon.

119
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,667
Truly, anytime you're in town,

120
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:02,327
anytime at all is good for us.

121
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:05,094
How about this afternoon?

122
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,922
Monoalkenes,

123
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,565
diolefins,

124
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:16,249
trienes, polyenes.

125
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:20,914
The nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

126
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:24,696
But when you start to feel overwhelmed,
and you will,

127
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:28,832
just keep in mind that one element.

128
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,312
Carbon.

129
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:35,632
Carbon is at the center of it all.

130
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,327
There is no life without carbon.

131
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:42,886
Nowhere.
That we know of in the universe.

132
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,879
Everything that lives,

133
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,501
lived, will live.

134
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:49,224
Carbon.

135
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:53,330
Carmen is carbon.

136
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:56,222
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.

137
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:57,943
Did you...

138
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,424
I like to think of it...

139
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,548
I like to think that the diamond

140
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,789
and the woman
who wears it on her finger

141
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:13,164
are both formed

142
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:14,918
from the same stuff.

143
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:20,019
Or, say the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,809
That got your attention, right?

145
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,416
The man who invented the diamond.

146
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,058
All right.

147
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,134
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

148
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:37,869
Dr. Hall invented the first

149
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:41,529
reproducible process for
making synthetic diamonds.

150
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:44,906
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.
Now, today,

151
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:49,390
synthetic diamonds are used
in oil drilling,

152
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,756
electronics,
multi-billion dollar industries.

153
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,625
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

154
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,844
And he made them a fortune.

155
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,966
I mean, incalculable.

156
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:09,349
You want to know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

157
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:14,663
A $10 US Savings Bond.

158
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:28,463
Anyway.

159
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:33,501
A Savings Bond printed on
carbon-based paper

160
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:35,518
paid to a carbon-based man

161
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,743
for something he made out of...

162
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:40,159
carbon.

163
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,944
It's so nice to have
you back with us, Walt.

164
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,721
And you're looking
great, by the way.

165
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,457
A little skinnier.
Which is definitely no tragedy.

166
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,099
- And then there's the hair thing.
- I actually like that.

167
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:59,174
That's a great look for you.

168
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:02,442
But you're feeling good?

169
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:05,599
Absolutely. 100%.

170
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,470
I'm glad to be back at work.

171
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,245
I'm glad to...

172
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,939
I'm happy to be here. Really.

173
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,599
We're happy too.

174
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:20,877
And I just...

175
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
It's good.

176
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:27,667
It's great.

177
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,070
Is everything okay?

178
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:39,426
Just please feel comfortable

179
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,016
coming to me

180
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,066
with any problems,

181
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:44,757
any issues.

182
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:46,333
Anything at all.

183
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:49,181
You know, completely confidential.

184
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,619
- See you tomorrow, Flynn.
- See you, Jeffrey.

185
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:01,828
Man.

186
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:16,797
Let me see it.

187
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,850
Dad, let me see it.

188
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,336
Don't worry about it.

189
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:28,176
Let's go.

190
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:11,761
Peekaboo.

191
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,787
Peekaboo.

192
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:29,594
Ah, man.

193
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,489
You stay right here, all right?

194
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,103
I mean it.

195
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,558
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

196
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,674
You're the one who dropped it.

197
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:17,034
I didn't drop it!
I didn't drop shit!

198
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,093
- You dropped it!
- Shut the hell up about it.

199
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:21,038
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

200
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,516
Get up!

201
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:29,675
Shut up!

202
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:31,507
Both of you!

203
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,754
You know who might have done it?

204
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,422
I have an idea.

205
00:18:57,374 --> 00:18:58,874
Here's what I think.

206
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,149
You ID 'em.
And then together,

207
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:04,475
you and I put a bag
over their heads.

208
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:06,253
We tie 'em up,

209
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:08,580
drive 'em way out into the desert,

210
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,005
strip 'em naked,

211
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,024
then bury them up to their necks

212
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,453
on a huge mound of fire ants.

213
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:18,499
Saw it in that old Western.

214
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,563
You with me?

215
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:28,072
Scorpions?

216
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,415
Scorpions are good.

217
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:45,490
Very nice.

218
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,319
Damn, Dad.

219
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:02,034
Check it out.

220
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:04,880
Who is this?

221
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,083
So, this is Walter Jr. Or Flynn.

222
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,501
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

223
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:33,116
- Mom...
- What? I'm just offering the choice.

224
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,654
This is Mrs. Schwartz, whom
you've heard so much about.

225
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,791
Very nice to meet you, Flynn.

226
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,516
Nice to meet you, too.

227
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:43,429
Look who's here.

228
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,994
Always nice to see you.

229
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,533
What a nice surprise.

230
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,976
Look at you.
You're looking good.

231
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:53,512
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

232
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,187
I know it was for me.

233
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,715
You have a good shaped head.

234
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,574
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

235
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:03,699
- For good luck. Right?
- Exactly. Here's hoping.

236
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:05,567
We could use some of that, huh?

237
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:06,806
Mrs. Schwartz?

238
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:10,059
Thank you so much for
what you've done for my dad.

239
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,231
It was a really good thing.

240
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:15,599
You're very welcome.

241
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,656
We're going to find
a way to repay you.

242
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:22,085
We don't want to ever hear that.

243
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:26,401
You know what?
I hate to say it,

244
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:30,505
but I really need to get going.

245
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,552
- That's too bad.
- You can't stay for dinner?

246
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:35,920
I wish I could, but unfortunately

247
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,478
I have to try to beat the traffic.

248
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,948
Well, I hope we get a chance to...

249
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:44,260
to catch up real soon.

250
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:45,451
Hopefully.

251
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,060
Your purse.

252
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:52,705
Good to see you.

253
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:56,942
And you and Elliott
are welcome any time. Really.

254
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,565
And I, for one, am gonna be much
better about keeping in touch.

255
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,778
- It's so good to see you.
- And you.

256
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,073
Nice meeting you.

257
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:07,631
Likewise.

258
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:11,873
- Bye now.
- Drive safely.

259
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:17,682
What am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

260
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:19,257
I'll be right back.

261
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,097
What did you...

262
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,566
We need to talk.

263
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:44,451
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

264
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,369
Please.

265
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:49,575
Please.

266
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,633
Where's my money, bitch?

267
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:08,232
I ain't going to keep asking nice!

268
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,597
Yo, all right?
I want my money and my dope!

269
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:12,788
Come on!

270
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,431
- I just want to say, man...
- What? What do you want to say?

271
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:18,062
I just want to go on record.

272
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:21,542
You hit me really, really hard.
I think I'm seeing double.

273
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:23,748
Maybe I need to go see a hospital.

274
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:24,793
Shut up!

275
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:29,657
- Serious, I might have a concussion!
- Don't fall asleep, baby.

276
00:23:29,848 --> 00:23:31,784
- Subdural hematoma.
- Don't fall asleep.

277
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:32,975
Shut...

278
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:34,281
up.

279
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,951
Empty your pockets.

280
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:39,458
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

281
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:40,488
Do it!

282
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,383
All right, turn around.

283
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:48,834
Turn around!

284
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,637
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

285
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:59,369
All right. Shoes.
Give them here.

286
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:15,870
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any...

287
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:17,423
We shot it all.

288
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:20,332
Shot an ounce in a day and a half.

289
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:23,327
All right, tell you what.

290
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:27,631
Both of you pull it
out of your butts right now

291
00:24:27,823 --> 00:24:31,533
or I grab a flashlight and some pliers
and go exploring.

292
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,911
What's it going to be?
Come on!

293
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:38,504
There you go.

294
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:44,205
All right, come on.
On the table.

295
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:48,576
So what? You hold the crystal,
and she holds the H, huh?

296
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,230
Division of labor.

297
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:54,497
All right, there's
maybe an 8-ball here.

298
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:57,345
Where's the rest of my meth?

299
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:00,223
Yo, for real?
She up and lost it, yo.

300
00:25:00,348 --> 00:25:02,356
- You shut up!
- Shut up, skank.

301
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:05,234
Shut up! Stop it!

302
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:09,089
This really isn't getting any better.
It's turning cranial.

303
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:12,951
You see this gun, huh?
It's got five bullets.

304
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:16,358
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial,

305
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:18,133
for being such a pussy.

306
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:24,141
Hey, baby.

307
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:26,504
Come here, baby.

308
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:28,054
Come here, baby.

309
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,481
All right.

310
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:39,731
You two are never
getting high again.

311
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,623
I will make it my life's mission.

312
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:45,363
Not another needle,
not another ball,

313
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,180
not one toke,

314
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:49,155
not till I get what's mine.

315
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:54,009
We got you covered, man, sure.

316
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:57,482
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

317
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:59,872
You're damn right,
plus interest. Where?

318
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:01,229
Backyard.

319
00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:04,645
Right hand to the man, dog.
Backyard. Go check it out.

320
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,273
- Get...
- Hurting. Painful.

321
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:11,959
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

322
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:15,048
Don't move.

323
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:19,399
Come on!

324
00:26:22,638 --> 00:26:23,443
See?

325
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,008
Me and the slit just boosted it.

326
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,440
She's like ant, man.

327
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:30,497
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

328
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,411
What the hell am I supposed
to do with this?

329
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:35,551
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

330
00:26:36,102 --> 00:26:37,052
Get high.

331
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:43,961
That's my bank.

332
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:46,353
So?
It's FIDC insured.

333
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:48,464
It's a victimless crime.

334
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:52,943
- Where the hell did you get this?
- Bodega. Way across town.

335
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:56,030
In, out, like bam.
It was smooth as silk.

336
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:59,556
What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumb ass?

337
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:02,024
We roll like the breeze, for real.

338
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:04,654
All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.

339
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:06,957
- Nobody even noticed.
- Nobody noticed?

340
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,751
- For real?
- I'm telling you.

341
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:11,108
A victimless crime.

342
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:25,535
Jesus! Come on already!

343
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:27,634
It's about to give, man.
I'm sensing it.

344
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,129
You don't know what you're doing.
I thought you told me

345
00:27:30,254 --> 00:27:32,354
you boosted, like, six of these.

346
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:33,861
Boosted.

347
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:36,612
It's not like he ever got one open.

348
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:39,711
At least I got persistence.
The law of averages,

349
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,371
lucky number 7.

350
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,739
Don't listen to that skank.

351
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,935
Stop calling me that!

352
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:48,796
I ain't no skank!

353
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:50,921
Skank, skank, skank ass skank!

354
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:52,571
Sit.

355
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:56,978
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face!

356
00:27:58,036 --> 00:27:59,174
Now chill!

357
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,884
You, get that thing open.

358
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,802
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

359
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,490
Where's the kid?

360
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:17,526
The kid! The little kid!

361
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:19,501
What are you asking me for?

362
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,822
What the hell kind
of mother are you?

363
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:51,895
How about you feed the kid
a decent meal every now and then?

364
00:28:52,938 --> 00:28:55,571
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

365
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:58,419
Get him some decent TV to watch.
What is this shit?

366
00:28:58,544 --> 00:28:59,987
Are you serious?

367
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,365
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

368
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,036
Diesel, this whole thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

369
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,582
Get out of the way.

370
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,575
Get out of the way!

371
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:31,856
So you didn't tell anyone.

372
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:34,381
- You didn't tell Elliott.
- Not yet.

373
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,593
What does that mean?

374
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:39,568
It means what it means.

375
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:42,565
It's a determination
I have yet to make.

376
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:48,709
All right. Fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

377
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,566
All right.
First let me say

378
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:56,339
I very much regret
involving you in this.

379
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:57,514
This was...

380
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:00,487
This entire thing was...

381
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,041
unfortunate.

382
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:03,664
Unfortunate?

383
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:08,242
And I apologize deeply.

384
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:15,202
Now please tell me why you did it.

385
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:20,195
That's not really at issue here.

386
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,708
You told me your insurance was
covering it. Was that a lie?

387
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:30,093
If you won't take our money

388
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:33,157
and your insurance isn't covering it,
how are you paying for it?

389
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:37,061
This is not an issue that concerns you,
Gretchen, okay?

390
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,351
Excuse me. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

391
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,548
You tell your wife and son

392
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:47,014
that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

393
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:48,789
Why are you doing this?

394
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:53,864
I will clear this up with them.

395
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:57,688
The look on Skyler's face...
She's sitting there, tears in her eyes,

396
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,304
thanking me for saving your life.
Why would you do that to her?

397
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:03,980
As I said, I will clear this up.

398
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:05,070
Just please

399
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,503
allow me to do this
in my own way in my own time.

400
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:09,963
All right?

401
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:12,996
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

402
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,510
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

403
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:20,881
I don't owe you an explanation.

404
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:24,747
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologized.

405
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:26,672
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

406
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:30,571
There. I've apologized twice now.

407
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,206
I'm humbly sorry.

408
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:35,236
Three times.

409
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:37,698
Let me just get this straight.

410
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:41,846
Elliott and I offer to pay for
your treatment, no strings attached...

411
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,430
an offer which still stands,
by the way...

412
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:47,015
and you turn us down out of pride,

413
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,528
whatever,
and then you tell your wife

414
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:51,825
that in fact we are
paying for your treatment.

415
00:31:52,236 --> 00:31:56,079
Without our knowledge, against our will,
you involve us in your lie.

416
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:00,497
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

417
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,014
That's pretty much the size of it.

418
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:12,298
What happened to you?

419
00:32:15,987 --> 00:32:17,137
Really, Walt.

420
00:32:18,243 --> 00:32:19,443
What happened?

421
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,210
Because this isn't you.

422
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:28,987
What would you know about me?

423
00:32:30,153 --> 00:32:32,220
What would your presumption

424
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:34,409
about me be, exactly?

425
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:37,120
That I should go begging
for your charity?

426
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:41,166
And you waving
your checkbook around,

427
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:44,211
like some magic wand,

428
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:47,172
is going to make me forget how you

429
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:49,549
and Elliott cut me out?

430
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:51,593
What? That can't be how you see it.

431
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:55,513
It was my hard work, my research, and
you and Elliott make millions off it.

432
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:57,593
That cannot be how you see it.

433
00:32:57,718 --> 00:32:59,714
- Good. That's beautifully done.
- You left...

434
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,761
You are always
the picture of innocence.

435
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:04,272
- You left me.
- The picture of innocence.

436
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:07,280
- Just sweetness and light.
- You left me.

437
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,477
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

438
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:13,448
You and my father and my brothers,
and I go up to our room,

439
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:16,366
and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

440
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:18,957
What? Did I dream all that?

441
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:21,164
That's your excuse...

442
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:24,844
to build your little
empire on my work?

443
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:27,867
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

444
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,175
You abandoned us... me, Elliott.

445
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,428
Little rich girl just
adding to your millions.

446
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,430
I don't even know
what to say to you.

447
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,436
I don't even know where to begin.

448
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:51,686
I feel so...

449
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:54,767
sorry for you, Walt.

450
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:00,046
Fuck you.

451
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:42,516
Little man,

452
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,265
you hungry?

453
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,423
What are you doing?

454
00:35:30,223 --> 00:35:32,173
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

455
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,964
Baby, get up and help me!

456
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:37,835
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

457
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,804
Get up, damn it!
Get our dope!

458
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:44,766
Bedtime.

459
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:49,607
Here we go.

460
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:58,697
Who's the big tough guy now?
Is that you?

461
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:02,309
You're the big man?
Try and hit me now, bitch!

462
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:05,457
Try and hit me now!
Try and hit me now, bitch!

463
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,649
Should I ask where you've been?

464
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:44,191
Never mind.

465
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:47,172
We're long past that, I suppose.

466
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,320
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

467
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:14,773
We need to talk.

468
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:28,616
Just say it.

469
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:41,191
They're cutting off the money.

470
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:55,524
What did she say, exactly?

471
00:37:59,002 --> 00:38:00,958
Not much. It was...

472
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:05,073
abrupt. She said...

473
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,269
something like...

474
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:10,897
"I'm sorry...

475
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,707
"to have to do this,
but Elliott and I

476
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:17,982
"can no longer continue
to pay for Walt's treatment.

477
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:20,415
"I wish you the very best."

478
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:24,608
And that was it.

479
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,619
She sounded apologetic.

480
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:40,163
I guess, it was quick.
She got right off the phone.

481
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:42,193
I was so stunned, but...

482
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:46,285
I called her back,
and she didn't pick up.

483
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:54,677
So...

484
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,059
what do you know about this?

485
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,565
She and I had a perfectly
nice visit this afternoon,

486
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,676
and then you come home, and all of
a sudden she's in a big hurry to leave,

487
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:13,951
and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

488
00:39:20,313 --> 00:39:22,313
What do you know that I don't?

489
00:39:27,308 --> 00:39:28,958
Where were you tonight?

490
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:33,119
I drove up to Santa Fe.

491
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:37,411
I was with Gretchen...

492
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,177
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

493
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,447
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

494
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:49,302
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

495
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,099
There was a lot of...

496
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:55,124
hemming and hawing and beating
around the bush from both of them...

497
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:57,600
What... Tell us what?

498
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:05,884
There was a lot of

499
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:09,579
business phraseology
being tossed around,

500
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:10,904
Things like...

501
00:40:12,014 --> 00:40:14,560
"cash poor" and "leveraged"

502
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:17,067
and "quarterly decline,"
yada, yada, yada.

503
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:20,192
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

504
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,573
They're broke.

505
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:29,353
You are kidding me.

506
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:34,136
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

507
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,211
And all these big banks and...

508
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:37,686
Fannie Mae and...

509
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:40,201
Apparently,

510
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:43,420
Gray Matter is no more immune

511
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:45,139
than anyone else.

512
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:48,261
That is...

513
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:51,888
Jesus, that's...

514
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:09,470
She could have just...

515
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,920
told me herself.

516
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
Well, they're prideful people.

517
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:22,414
Listen.

518
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,834
Not to sound selfish,

519
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:29,175
but as far as we go,

520
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:32,642
we'll get through this, okay?

521
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:38,778
They've already paid
for most of my treatment,

522
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:39,812
right?

523
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:47,951
We're going to make it.

524
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:50,430
All right?
I promise.

525
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,051
And yet...

526
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:09,056
she still drives a Bentley.

527
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:18,472
Keeping up appearances or...
I don't know. Who knows?

528
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,092
Baby, that don't make any sense.

529
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:38,680
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

530
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:41,820
Say you're designing a safe. Where
are you going to put your weak spot?

531
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:42,945
Nowhere.

532
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:45,065
I made it, like...

533
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:46,436
strong.

534
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,937
Jesus! On the bottom, that's where.

535
00:42:49,062 --> 00:42:51,025
You put your weak
spot on the bottom.

536
00:42:52,192 --> 00:42:53,702
Baby, that H is...

537
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:55,947
bringing me down.

538
00:42:56,668 --> 00:42:59,492
- You took too much. I told you.
- I need...

539
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:03,466
I need to even out.
Let me get a hit of that crystal.

540
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:05,081
Hell, no.
You've lost your share.

541
00:43:05,362 --> 00:43:06,722
Come on, baby.

542
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:09,752
It's all I need
is just a little hit.

543
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:13,584
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

544
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:15,925
I ain't no skank.

545
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:20,259
I would appreciate an apology.

546
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:25,279
What?

547
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:28,146
I am trying to take
the high road here.

548
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:31,531
- Are you going to do right?
- Listen to me, stupid.

549
00:43:31,656 --> 00:43:34,905
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

550
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,614
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole

551
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:41,249
and assist me and shut up!

552
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,829
I ain't no skank.

553
00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:50,198
Skank, skank, skank ass skank!

554
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:52,045
Skank ass skank!

555
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:53,868
Skank ass skank!

556
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:55,757
You listening to me skank?

557
00:43:56,488 --> 00:43:57,837
You hear me, skank?

558
00:43:57,962 --> 00:44:00,808
You are a skank ass skank!

559
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:07,906
I ain't no skank.

560
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:10,731
Don't!

561
00:44:28,392 --> 00:44:29,742
I ain't no skank.

562
00:45:31,384 --> 00:45:32,145
<i>911.</i>

563
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:49,496
Remember peekaboo?
Can you go peekaboo like this?

564
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:52,543
Can you keep your eyes closed?
You keep them closed.

565
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:54,751
That's good.
That's real good. All right.

566
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:56,904
You keep them closed just like that.

567
00:45:57,029 --> 00:45:59,529
It's a little game
we're going to play.

568
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:18,652
Look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

569
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,970
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

570
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:27,442
Look, just...
just don't go back inside.

571
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,503
All right?
You stay right here. Okay?

572
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:40,767
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.
