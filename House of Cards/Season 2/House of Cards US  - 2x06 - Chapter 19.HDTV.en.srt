1
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:32,132
<i>We've got an energy crisis, Frank.
And what the White House needs...</i>

2
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,551
The president chose
to remain tough on China.

3
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,220
- <i> No, you forced him to.</i>
- You chose Feng.

4
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:39,597
<i>You're the one who</i>
<i>put me in a room with him.</i>

5
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:41,474
<i>The cook can't blame</i>
<i>his ingredients</i>

6
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:43,142
<i>if he doesn't like</i>
<i>how they taste together.</i>

7
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,436
If samarium prices don't reduce,

8
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:48,647
the market will have no choice
but to compensate.

9
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,943
That's bad for everyone
who owns an air conditioner.

10
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,819
You should speak to the
president himself.

11
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,366
Well, the president hasn't placed
much value on my advice lately.

12
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:02,118
I'm in the same boat
as you, Raymond.

13
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:04,662
<i>Yeah, difference being</i>
<i>you've got an office</i>

14
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:06,997
three doors down from the Oval.

15
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:10,334
Let's work together,
for Christ sakes.

16
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,086
I'm willing to put Spotsylvania
behind us if you are.

17
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:16,381
- <i> I want nothing more.</i>
- Then you'll talk to him?

18
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:19,050
- Look, I'm late for a meeting, Raymond.
- <i> Yes or no, Frank?</i>

19
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,136
- I can't guarantee he'll listen.
- That's not a yes.

20
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,180
<i>But it's better than a no.</i>

21
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,515
Any pugilist worth his salt
knows when someone's on the ropes,

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,895
that's when you throw a combination
to the gut and a left hook to the jaw.

23
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:40,319

<font color="#3399CC">http://TV4User.de</font>

24
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,028
Samarium is the last thing
they'll let go of.

25
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:15,031
As long as our energy prices
rise, they have the leverage.

26
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,700
Why don't we offer nothing?
Move toward attrition?

27
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:19,994
If China doesn't show
at the refunding auction,

28
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,455
- long-term interest rates will spike.
- - And in a week,

29
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,958
yields on our ten-year notes
will pierce the seven percent threshold.

30
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:30,629
That could happen. But if we
go soft now, that will happen.

31
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,923
- You mean go on the offensive.
- We should at least consider it.

32
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:35,467
The Chinese don't like carrots?
Let's see how they like the stick.

33
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:37,010
What might that look like?

34
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,178
We could raise inspection
rates on foodstuffs.

35
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,931
- Hold them in ports till they rot.
- How much of a raise?

36
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,724
Twenty percent
if we wanna draw blood.

37
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:46,518
Bury the move with increased
spot checks all the way around.

38
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:48,937
These sort of tactics don't
solve the immediate problem.

39
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,731
People are paying triple
the standard rate for electric.

40
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,191
We'll hit a fivefold increase
by August.

41
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,944
What if you, Mr. President,
by executive order,

42
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,446
purchase samarium
through a third party?

43
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,824
Cut the Chinese out, force them to
either raise their prices worldwide

44
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,909
or lower them
to keep direct flow with us.

45
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:07,579
We stockpile samarium
for defense purposes, of course,

46
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:10,791
and quietly sell what we don't
need to our friends in nuclear energy.

47
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:14,044
- At a discount.
- - A subsidy for nuclear power?

48
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,504
The richest of the rich?
How's that gonna play?

49
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:20,508
Dealing with a national crisis. We can't
get sidetracked with public opinion.

50
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,635
It would show China
we're willing to wait this out.

51
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:24,512
Do we have the resources?

52
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:27,347
I'd have to run the numbers,
anticipate fluctuations,

53
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:30,434
- consider different models...
- Your best guess.

54
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:33,728
We do, for a moderate stockpile.

55
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,691
All right. Draw up a request
from the Defense Department.

56
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:41,819
- Yes, sir.
- Linda, draft the executive order.

57
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:45,114
And, Cathy, make sure we have a third-party
conduit to purchase the samarium.

58
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:46,240
We'll go through India.

59
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:47,991
That won't fly well
with Pakistan.

60
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:50,118
I'll alert them in advance.

61
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:52,204
As long as they're in the loop,
we'll be all right.

62
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:57,542
- Not that we owe them any favors.
- All right, let's get to work.

63
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,961
<i>Come on, Betsy.
Three additional counts under Section E?</i>

64
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:03,756
Three is low. It reflects a narrow
interpretation of criminal intent.

65
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,342
- Your client broke into a data center.
- And what's the offer?

66
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,427
- I'm not doing a plea.
- Will you let me handle this?

67
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,929
They don't want a trial.
The questions I'll be raising,

68
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,722
loud and clear, in open court...

69
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:14,349
- Lucas, please.
- We have our own questions, Mr. Goodwin.

70
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,309
For example, what were
you doing with these?

71
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,771
- I didn't take these.
- They were in your apartment.

72
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,314
Underwood took them.

73
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,274
Do you really expect a jury
to believe that?

74
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,150
- He did. They were having an affair.
- Are they gonna see them

75
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:27,694
for what they are? Proof of
your obsession with Ms. Barnes

76
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,031
and the ludicrous conspiracy you have
concocted to explain her death.

77
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:32,782
Tell us what you're offering.

78
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,617
Client pleads to one
count under Section E

79
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,161
for breaking into a data center.
One count for fraud

80
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:38,288
<i>for stealing a password</i>
<i>from the</i> Herald.

81
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:40,957
Ten years under Section E,
ten years for fraud, served concurrently.

82
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:44,126
Eligible for parole in seven.

83
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:48,672
I'd like to speak
to my client alone.

84
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,675
Cameras and recording equipment
off, please.

85
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,346
I'll introduce the president.
Then he'll introduce you.

86
00:06:56,471 --> 00:06:58,723
If he's there, we can't
mention the military.

87
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,268
- Just the endemic problem nationwide.
- Of course. I understand.

88
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:04,603
Good. So we should go
through these speeches

89
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,647
and make sure
that there's nothing...

90
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:10,484
- Hi, Mrs. Underwood.
- Hello, Christina.

91
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:12,861
- Mrs. Walker, you asked for me?
- We need to confirm

92
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:14,821
whether the president's
gonna make it to New Orleans.

93
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:16,531
- This Friday, correct?
- Yes.

94
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:19,534
But I know he had a cabinet meeting
this morning, so I imagine...

95
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:21,410
- I'll talk to Linda right away.
- Thanks.

96
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:25,831
I know you want Garrett there,
but with this energy crisis...

97
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:30,836
- No. It's not that.
- What?

98
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,713
- I shouldn't say anything.
- Well, now you have to tell me.

99
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:40,386
I've just never been
very fond of her. Christina.

100
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,930
- Why not?
- Peter Russo.

101
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,892
I just have a thing about women
who sleep with their bosses.

102
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,604
Anyway, I'm sure whatever
they had was genuine.

103
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,814
It's none of my business, 'cause
if she's doing a good job,

104
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,942
- that's all that matters, right?
- Garrett seems to think she is.

105
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,820
Then I should just keep
my feelings to myself.

106
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,657
So, if the president
is not able to be there,

107
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,201
that could be a silver lining for us. We
won't have to hold back with the military.

108
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:10,247
Phone taps, video surveillance,

109
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:14,000
premeditation, sustained intent.
They've got you cold.

110
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,169
If I plead out, that's it.
No one hears the truth.

111
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:18,463
You don't plead,
no one will hear you, period.

112
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,173
Not until you're
in your seventies.

113
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:21,674
Have you talked
to Hammerschmidt yet?

114
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,384
You're in no position
to make demands.

115
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,137
- It's not up to you.
- All you'll do is piss them off.

116
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:30,515
Look...

117
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:34,644
We've got a good deal here.
A great deal, considering what you did.

118
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,272
You should take it
before they change their mind.

119
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:42,151
Tom Hammerschmidt. I talk to him
or we're going to trial.

120
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:43,778
<i>Raise your arms, please.</i>

121
00:08:50,826 --> 00:08:53,119
- You have something here?
- My neck chain.

122
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:57,081
- May I see it?
- Really? I gotta take off my tie.

123
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:59,751
I need to see it, sir.

124
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:09,218
- You're a good Christian, Remy.
- My mother's.

125
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:12,429
- She was the good Christian.
- Well, then you're just the good son.

126
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:14,931
- Thank you, sir.
- Hot out there, huh?

127
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,891
Ninety-six according to my car.

128
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,685
We had heat like that
back in Gaffney,

129
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,645
but we didn't know
what air conditioning was,

130
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,106
so we just accepted as fact that
summer was meant to be miserable.

131
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,400
- Neat or with water?
- Just the water.

132
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,820
You can hold the bourbon.
We need to find a solution

133
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,905
so that this one isn't miserable
for 300 million people.

134
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,032
I already have found a solution.

135
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,034
Oh, please, Frank.
A samarium subsidy?

136
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,537
- Is that your skepticism or Raymond's?
- Mine, anticipating his.

137
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,332
So you haven't
spoken to him yet.

138
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,751
I want to offer him
something he can agree to.

139
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,046
- Well, he doesn't have much of a choice.
- Why are you cornering him?

140
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,757
I'm cutting the rate by half.
I'd call that liberating him.

141
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,383
You know that's not
how he'll see it.

142
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,801
This trade war
is preventing the refinery

143
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,678
from being approved in Beijing.

144
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,764
His co-venture with Feng is not
our highest priority right now.

145
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,058
A rare earth refinery solves
this crisis permanently.

146
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,976
Three years from now.
Not this summer.

147
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,478
It's not just that. With the subsidy,
he'll break even, at best.

148
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:08,814
There's no point in doing business
to hover between red and black.

149
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:12,526
Raymond's profits are an even lower
priority to me than his co-venture.

150
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,197
Tell me what
you're up to, Frank.

151
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:20,491
There's nothing to gain
by locking horns with Tusk.

152
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:23,369
Ask your client. It's Tusk
who's locking the horns.

153
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:28,248
- He's not a man who likes conflict.
- Neither am I.

154
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,712
Then make the ask. 'Cause I know
you don't care about the subsidy.

155
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:35,338
This is about something bigger.

156
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:37,590
I'm a good Christian, Remy,
like your mother.

157
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:40,426
I would tell you the truth
if I wanted more.

158
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:42,261
- You trying to send a message?
- Perhaps.

159
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:45,764
- Which is?
- That stubbornness is far more costly

160
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:50,060
- than obedience.
- Thanks for the water.

161
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:56,816
- You're on the wrong side, Remy.
- Yeah, well, one of us sure is.

162
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,901
And when the bumblebee
flew home,

163
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,946
all his friends were waiting
with buckets of honey, right?

164
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:07,368
And he's got his worm friend, and
his mouse friend, and his spider friend,

165
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:10,537
and his snail friend,
and they all had tons of honey.

166
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:12,080
- I like his feet.
- - And he looks happier now, right?

167
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,207
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

168
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:18,836
- They're funny, right?
- So they all buzzed with happiness,

169
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,965
because life is sweet when
you spend it with your friends.

170
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,094
Right? Can you all buzz your
wings? Buzz your little wings.

171
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,971
Buzz, buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

172
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,515
I think it would make
a fluttering noise, like...

173
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,769
- I don't know.
- Your flutters.

174
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,489
It's too hot out here for you
to be doing this, Francis.

175
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,282
I'm keeping hydrated.

176
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,162
- That even regulation?
- It's only half,

177
00:11:56,246 --> 00:12:01,834
but I don't want the press
to see me practicing on the street.

178
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:05,713
You remember when you threw out
that first pitch in Greenville?

179
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:07,923
I was wondering how long it
was gonna take to bring that up.

180
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:11,051
That wasn't even
on national television.

181
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:14,262
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

182
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:20,935
- What happened in Greenville?
- Oh, the Greenville Drive.

183
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,646
Single A team for the Red Sox.

184
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:26,482
It was a home game,
I get on the mound...

185
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:29,067
- You threw from the mound?
- Well, I wanted to throw a real pitch.

186
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:34,155
- Didn't make it.
- Not even close.

187
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:36,449
Halfway?

188
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,620
Ball slipped out of my hand
just before I released it.

189
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,663
Went straight up in the air
and hit me on top of the head.

190
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:46,250
The whole stadium
burst a gut laughing.

191
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:50,921
- Comic relief pitcher.
- Oh, that's very clever, Meechum.

192
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,636
- Don't tell Claire.
- I heard that.

193
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:01,973
- You're really good with them.
- Nah.

194
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:04,308
Did you see Robbie,
when they were finger-painting?

195
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,019
He pulled down his pants and
started painting himself blue.

196
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,146
- No!
- Yeah. I hope I got it all off.

197
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,023
I'm sure Alex and Daria
don't care.

198
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:12,691
They let him run around
naked all the time.

199
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:15,402
Yeah, but probably not
with his Smurf ass.

200
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,153
Probably not.

201
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:19,405
What do we want to do
for dinner tonight?

202
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,782
I've got some leftover chicken
or we could order pizza.

203
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,118
- Pizza. No dishes.
- Yeah.

204
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:34,294
I'm really sorry, I totally forgot I've
got a friend picking me up tonight.

205
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:35,962
- I completely blanked.
- That's fine.

206
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:38,965
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't sweat it.

207
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:44,470
- Is it your boyfriend?
- No, no... just an old friend.

208
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:49,808
- Can I meet him?
- Um... He's... kinda shy. I don't...

209
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,519
- ...know if he'd be up for...
- Totally cool. Don't worry about it.

210
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:57,398
- We'll just do dinner another night.
- All right.

211
00:13:57,523 --> 00:14:00,359
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah. You know where I'll be.

212
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,695
- Yeah.
- OK.

213
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:11,703
- How long?
- Couple of months.

214
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,956
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I can't go to church?

215
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,917
Anywhere you interact with other
people opens us up to risk.

216
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,919
I'm just supposed to slave away
at the fucking call center

217
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:22,588
- and then lock myself in the apartment.
- Don't get dramatic.

218
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:26,800
I like the Fellowship, OK?
There's nothing to worry about there.

219
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:30,721
All it takes is one person's
cousin to visit from Lynchburg.

220
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,765
Someone you went to school with, or
some client that you spent the night with.

221
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,017
- Those guys would never end up here.
- You don't know that.

222
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:40,021
- Yeah, I do.
- You ended up here, didn't you?

223
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:45,276
What?

224
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:48,403
- I can't live like this.
- Yes, you can.

225
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,406
You're a strong girl.

226
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,082
That's it?
That's everything?

227
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,667
I know, you've heard it before.

228
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:06,253
As a friend, Lucas,
not as a reporter.

229
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,218
Now I dig.

230
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:16,721
I make the phone calls.
I do the legwork.

231
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:19,807
They treating you OK?

232
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:21,934
- It's fine.
- That's not what I asked.

233
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:26,188
They're pushing
the plea deal pretty hard.

234
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,856
How seriously are you
considering it?

235
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:30,317
I want to see how this
article impacts things.

236
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:34,029
- What does your lawyer say?
- He thinks that's a bad idea,

237
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:36,156
that I should take the plea.

238
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:39,742
- Maybe you should listen to him.
- No. I want the article.

239
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:43,079
<i>- </i> That I'm certain of.
- All right.

240
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:48,458
- I better get to it then.
- Thank you.

241
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:52,337
You need to know, I'm gonna treat
this the way I would any other story.

242
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:56,090
Whatever the facts bear.
You might not like what I write.

243
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:59,260
- I get that.
- I'll let you read it first.

244
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,429
- Then you can decide.
- That's all I'm asking.

245
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:04,682
Hang in there.

246
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:21,239
Can you wipe this shit off?
Please!

247
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:23,199
And the other nuclear
providers are on board?

248
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,035
Most. Except Raymond's
company and a couple of others.

249
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,745
Lakeport Nuclear, Wolf Springs.

250
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,496
Now, I can't prove it,

251
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,541
but I am absolutely sure
they're colluding.

252
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,251
Raymond wants to embarrass me.

253
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:38,963
I offer a solution,
nuclear lobby turns its back.

254
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,132
He has a right to refuse,
Mr. President.

255
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:44,385
What he cannot do is manipulate
the energy market.

256
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,805
You want to put pressure
on the distribution side.

257
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,349
More than pressure. Ban vertical
integration entirely.

258
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:52,350
We don't have that
regulatory power.

259
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:55,311
We add an antitrust agreement
to the emergency energy bill.

260
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:57,146
We break up the regional supply

261
00:16:57,272 --> 00:17:00,650
and distribution monopolies
like the Bell System.

262
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,652
It'll be challenged immediately
in the courts.

263
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:06,613
We don't need it to pass,
we just need to threaten it.

264
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,532
See if he falls into line.

265
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:15,205
Is there a way to do that without
it making its way into the news?

266
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,167
I don't want the world's wealthiest
one percent on my phone sheet.

267
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,130
There is absolutely a way
to do that, sir.

268
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,345
Here you go.

269
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:36,141
- Crowded for a Tuesday night.
- We keep it at 65 degrees.

270
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,267
- And it's free.
- If you call 18 bucks

271
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:42,146
- for a vodka soda free.
- Still cheaper than a Pepco bill.

272
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,565
- Depends on how many you have.
- You trying to get us drunk?

273
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,568
Drunker you are, bigger you tip.

274
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:51,113
I don't have to be drunk
to appreciate good service.

275
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:54,741
- I'll get your change.
- No, you won't.

276
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:59,203
- Thank you.
- You're shameless.

277
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,789
Makes me a good lobbyist.

278
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,457
Cheers.

279
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,881
So, Jackie... bold move,
but it won't work.

280
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,592
You know we can pass this
amendment in a heartbeat.

281
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,885
Maybe, but no one will comply.
It'll get overturned.

282
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,304
- Big fuss for nothing.
- It might get overturned,

283
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,557
- but it gets ink along the way.
- One thing about Raymond Tusk

284
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:23,726
is he doesn't give two
bird shits about public opinion.

285
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,645
- His stockholders do.
- They'd jump in a pit of snakes

286
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,772
and light themselves on fire
if he gave the word.

287
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,608
All I'm asking is
that you convey our intentions.

288
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,611
Why me? Frank could
easily pick up the phone.

289
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:36,571
You still call him Frank?

290
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:40,241
Not to his face, which I try
to keep to a minimum.

291
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,284
Don't you appreciate having
an ear in the White House?

292
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,995
I would, if I had an ear.
But lately all I've got is a mouth.

293
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,541
Yeah. He's not
the best listener, is he?

294
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,253
- Try working for him.
- You were on his staff?

295
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:56,714
Eight years. Press secretary.
Before you joined Congress.

296
00:18:58,132 --> 00:18:59,175
That explains a lot.

297
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:03,846
- Like what?
- Like a lot.

298
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:06,390
- I'll take that as an insult.
- You should.

299
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,019
That's it? You abandoning me?

300
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:12,312
No, I'm buying the next round.

301
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:14,647
I can't accept
gifts from lobbyists

302
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:16,316
without reciprocating.

303
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,568
Plus, I'm a good wingman.

304
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:21,779
This gets you more face time
with the barmaid.

305
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:40,296
You already got 'em ready?

306
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:43,799
Your guys gave me the
heads-up you were comin'.

307
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:46,343
Well, I hope that they didn't
wake you earlier than usual.

308
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,098
Fuck, man, with this heat,
I ain't sleepin' much anyway.

309
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,934
- What? No AC at home?
- I got a unit.

310
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,436
I just don't wanna pay
the damn bill.

311
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,605
It's not too bad in here,
all things considered.

312
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,857
That's 'cause we in the shade.

313
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,985
You get outside a couple hours
from now on that pavement,

314
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,488
fry your damn dick off
from three feet below.

315
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:09,281
Must be bad over that grill.

316
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:12,534
I can't tell the
difference no more.

317
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:15,078
I tell you what, though,

318
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:18,831
stuff goes down 'round here
when the mercury pop a hundred.

319
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:23,836
Man who beat his wife at home
will beat her right out on the street.

320
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,505
- Brings out the animal in us?
- That ain't no joke.

321
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:30,509
What used to wake me up?
Gunshots.

322
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,763
Now you know what does it?
People fuckin'.

323
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:38,933
Moanin' and screamin'
like goddamn cats in the alley.

324
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:41,102
You know what they say,

325
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:45,314
when you get hot and sweaty,
it make you ripe and ready.

326
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:53,071
- Hey.
- Hey.

327
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:59,786
- I drank too much.
- We both did.

328
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,165
- Last night didn't happen.
- I know.

329
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,961
When I walk out that door,
it's business as usual.

330
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:10,379
- No special treatment.
- Don't worry.

331
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:13,256
You won't need
a restraining order.

332
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:19,929
I'm surprised you didn't
go for the waitress.

333
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:22,598
- You're much sexier.
- Yeah, OK.

334
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:24,767
She works for tips.
You run Congress.

335
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:28,395
- Only half of it.
- That's half more than she does.

336
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,023
So it's not my body.

337
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:35,360
- Those legs don't hurt.
- You're so full of shit.

338
00:21:37,403 --> 00:21:42,408
OK. It's your voice.

339
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:47,246
- My voice?
- Mm-hm. It does something to me.

340
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:52,042
Let me know what Tusk
has to say.

341
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:58,089
Business hasn't started yet.
You haven't walked out that door yet.

342
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,424
Watch me.

343
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:31,411
Thank you, Jackie.

344
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:36,291
We're going to the White House.

345
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,127
Little John on the move.

346
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,422
We raise the bet.
We get FERC involved.

347
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:45,424
- An investigation?
- We don't need Congress

348
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,509
- to activate the regulatory commission.
- But a price-fixing review?

349
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:50,220
- That would take months.
- Again, it's the threat,

350
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,097
- not the actuality.
- He'll employ the same logic.

351
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:53,848
Draw it out,
fight back with appeals.

352
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:56,809
But he'll have to divulge his
accounting if FERC takes action.

353
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,395
Now, no businessman
wants to open up his books,

354
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,981
especially one with $43 billion.

355
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:06,110
This is getting out of hand, Frank.
We shouldn't be duking it out with Raymond.

356
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,570
- Maybe we should talk to him.
- That's exactly what he wants.

357
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,364
To force himself
back into the mix.

358
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,116
What's to be gained
by shutting him out?

359
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,660
The simple lesson
that you cannot strong-arm

360
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,746
the president
of the United States.

361
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:22,458
We can't devolve
to a pissing contest.

362
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,835
I'm gonna call Raymond.
Invite him to Washington.

363
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,837
He won't accept anything
but total surrender.

364
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:30,465
- I'm making the call.
- Don't put yourself in that position.

365
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:33,593
I know how to maintain
the integrity of my office.

366
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:38,181
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

367
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:41,559
Two minutes with the president and
Tusk may be back in his good graces.

368
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:45,020
I need to disrupt the nuptials
and prevent a second marriage.

369
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:04,580
- Christina?
- Good to see you.

370
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:07,041
Oh, please.

371
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:10,085
- You look great.
- Thank you.

372
00:24:10,252 --> 00:24:13,463
- How are things?
- Great.

373
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:16,799
Linda works me to the bone,
but that's what I signed up for.

374
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,343
Well, from what I've heard,
you're doing a great job.

375
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:21,095
Well, that's really nice
to hear.

376
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,140
Look, I wanted to talk to you
about Tricia.

377
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:28,894
I'm sure you've noticed that she's still
sort of adjusting to her role.

378
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,397
You mean her... confidence.

379
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:34,899
I think it would be great
if you reached out to her.

380
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:38,986
Just let her know that you're there
if there's anything she needs.

381
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:41,864
I don't really know her that well.
I mean, we've met, but I...

382
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:44,492
That's OK.
Maybe just tell her

383
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:46,243
that you enjoy
working for the president,

384
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:51,331
and you're there to be of help
to her in any way you can.

385
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,250
You don't think that's a little,
I don't know, brash?

386
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,628
- How?
- For me to just approach her like that?

387
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,796
No. Not at all.

388
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,510
<i>You've reached the Skorsky residence.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

389
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:54,055
Tom Hammerschmidt again. I'm
still trying to reach Janine.

390
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,558
Still important. Thank you.

391
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:04,899
<i>Hammerschmidt's been
calling our press office all day.</i>

392
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:07,401
I don't want a story to come out
any more than you do.

393
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,236
We lose a major asset
if it does.

394
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,029
Can you squash it
for security reasons?

395
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,865
Not once it's been shared with
the press. First Amendment crap.

396
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,328
Ward isn't making things any easier.
She wants a notch in her belt.

397
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,539
We're giving her one.

398
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,667
Not Goodwin. She wants Orsay.

399
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,044
Most-wanted list for six years.

400
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,797
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

401
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,508
You need to make sure Goodwin
takes the plea.

402
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,136
If 35 with no parole doesn't
scare the piss out of him,

403
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,180
- I don't know what will.
- Then don't try to scare him.

404
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,267
Remove hope from the equation.

405
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:48,897
I tried to keep this contained.

406
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:53,568
I didn't anticipate
Hammerschmidt.

407
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:57,614
- Is Ms. Skorsky cooperating with him?
- He's called her.

408
00:26:57,697 --> 00:27:01,158
My guy at the bureau says
they haven't actually spoken.

409
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:04,078
At least not on the phone.

410
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:06,663
- If this goes to court...
- That won't happen, sir.

411
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,540
It will if he publishes.

412
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:12,377
I'm bringing this to you
because I can't control Hammerschmidt.

413
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:14,713
I don't know what to do.

414
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:23,429
We need to invite a full-frontal
attack. Then hold the line.

415
00:27:23,596 --> 00:27:28,016
- You want to speak to him?
- Face-to-face. Just the two of us.

416
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:31,812
- I don't think that's a good idea, sir.
- You have a better idea?

417
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:35,815
- No, sir.
- We can't avoid the battle,

418
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,942
but we can choose
the battlefield.

419
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:41,404
Set up a meeting at the White
House. We'll intimidate him with formality.

420
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,447
Yes, sir.

421
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:47,785
Mr. Vice President?

422
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,704
I know you don't have patience
for apologies,

423
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:52,539
but I'm sorry if I've
let you down in any way.

424
00:27:52,664 --> 00:27:54,958
Let's concentrate
on what's in front of us.

425
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,501
I'll let you know
when I have a time set up.

426
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:59,462
- As soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,439
So this is a sort of outline
to the larger piece?

428
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,233
With questions on the next page.

429
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,413
- We're off the record?
- Yes, off the record.

430
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:40,583
Now, Tom, I know that you care
about this young man,

431
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,793
and I respect you as a
journalist, but these questions?

432
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:47,131
Why don't you just ask me
when I stopped strangling people's pets.

433
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:48,799
Sir, the death
of Congressman Russo...

434
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,635
You mean my friend, Peter Russo,

435
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,013
whose suicide left two
small children with no father.

436
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:58,266
No, I will not answer
questions about that.

437
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:00,810
Yes?

438
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:04,480
I'm aware of that. No, tell her
I'll call her right back.

439
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:07,107
Two minutes. Secretary Durant.

440
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:09,610
- I can wait outside...
- No, let's finish.

441
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:14,364
Now, if you decide
to print any of this,

442
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:16,950
assuming you find an outlet
that's willing to, then yes,

443
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:19,827
it might cause me
a headache for a day.

444
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:21,203
But I will not engage.

445
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,289
And I think it will only
prove to highlight

446
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:25,207
how ridiculous Mr. Goodwin's
claims are.

447
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:28,460
I pity him. I truly do.
I think he needs help.

448
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:31,046
I've interviewed many mentally
ill people. He's not one of them.

449
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:34,466
Well, I would suggest that you
read your own article again.

450
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:36,759
He's distressed.
There's a difference.

451
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:40,096
Look, I understand. It must be
a terrible blow to see him in prison,

452
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:42,390
- but Tom...
- Rachel Posner exists.

453
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:46,518
I haven't been able to find her,
but I've proven she's not a fantasy.

454
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,896
The same goes for Roy Kapeniak.
These people were born.

455
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,231
They have Social Security
numbers, past addresses.

456
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,859
So does everyone from California to Maine.
Have I conspired with all of them?

457
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,613
You have to admit there are some
troubling details regarding the DUI.

458
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:01,657
You know, people say the same
thing about Area 51.

459
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:04,160
You can conjure up little gray
men if you really want to.

460
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:09,957
- Did you kill Peter Russo?
- Tom, you're embarrassing yourself.

461
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,917
Did you kill Zoe Barnes?

462
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,377
I've given you more time
than this nonsense deserves.

463
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:16,880
- I have to ask these questions.
- The only question I would ask is:

464
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:19,382
does this sort of article
hurt or help Mr. Goodwin?

465
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:23,219
You have to do what you think
is right. But I hope you can understand

466
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:26,263
if I don't demean myself
by taking any of it seriously.

467
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:28,932
I appreciate your time,
Mr. Vice President.

468
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:48,742
- How'd it go?
- I did my part. Now put it to bed, Doug.

469
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,869
I won't submit myself
to this sort of exposure again.

470
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:53,288
- Yes, sir.
- Has Tusk met with the president yet?

471
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:55,748
- Linda said they're meeting at 4:30.
- Call Remy.

472
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:58,292
Make sure he doesn't get on
his plane before I see him.

473
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:59,877
I'm on it.

474
00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:17,018
Oh, Mrs. Walker?

475
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:20,479
I just wanted to say how rewarding it's
been working here in the West Wing.

476
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:23,065
And I'm so proud to be working
for your husband.

477
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,569
Thank you. I know he
appreciates all your hard work.

478
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:30,155
Well, now that I'm working
so closely with him,

479
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,199
if there's anything
I can do for you,

480
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:36,619
anything that would make yours
or his life easier...

481
00:31:36,744 --> 00:31:40,706
- Just keep doing what you're doing.
- Truly, anything.

482
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:45,461
I want you to know you can
rely on me. Both of you.

483
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:49,047
I know that.
Thank you, Christina.

484
00:31:49,214 --> 00:31:51,133
Thanks, Mrs. Walker.

485
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:01,350
- Oh, here. Let me.
- Oh, it's just my hands...

486
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:04,853
- Are they bothering you?
- Yeah, probably gonna get rain tonight.

487
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:07,231
I'll get it.

488
00:32:07,356 --> 00:32:10,942
Um, no, just keep
the broth moving.

489
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,574
Agent Green, FBI. Do you have
a moment, Ms. Skorsky?

490
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,660
- Yeah, I...
- May we come in?

491
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:23,996
I just need to
turn the stove off.

492
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:27,791
- Stay in here, Mom.
- Who is it?

493
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,335
Just stay in here.

494
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,923
Only that once?

495
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:37,216
And I haven't seen him since,
or returned his calls.

496
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:40,887
- How many times has he tried to call you?
- I don't know.

497
00:32:41,012 --> 00:32:45,432
Eight or nine times, maybe.
And then he stopped after a while.

498
00:32:45,557 --> 00:32:49,061
Did he mention anything about
Heronymous Bot or Gavin Orsay?

499
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,563
You know, I think
I should talk to a lawyer.

500
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,232
Right now you're not suspected
of being an accomplice.

501
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:57,277
If you call a lawyer,
we might have to reconsider.

502
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:04,033
- He mentioned some hacker.
- Heronymous.

503
00:33:04,158 --> 00:33:06,076
I told him I thought it
was a bad idea to contact him.

504
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,788
- Are you aware of what he's claiming?
- No.

505
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,706
That you and he
were working together.

506
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:14,459
That you believe
in this conspiracy theory.

507
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:19,213
That it was you who received
explicit photos of Ms. Barnes.

508
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:21,507
Is any of that true?

509
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,056
We need you to come back
to DC with us

510
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:32,893
and sign this statement in the
presence of the US attorney.

511
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:37,480
- You want me to call him a liar.
- Isn't he?

512
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,065
I can't do that to him.

513
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,901
We also need you to speak
with Tom Hammerschmidt.

514
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:44,236
You know what, please, can you
just keep me out of this?

515
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:46,238
I had nothing to do
with the hacker or the...

516
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:48,031
Ms. Skorsky, we want
to believe you.

517
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:50,867
And we will,
if you put all of it in writing.

518
00:33:50,992 --> 00:33:55,205
He's not a criminal. You're
going after the wrong person.

519
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,624
And if you think
that you can intimidate me,

520
00:33:57,749 --> 00:34:01,544
harass me like this in my
own home, I will file a formal complaint.

521
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:04,129
You're starting to sound
an awful lot like him.

522
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,177
You can't arrest me.
I haven't done anything.

523
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:12,137
I'd like you to leave.

524
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:14,973
I have a right to legal counsel
and you haven't presented a warrant.

525
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:20,019
We can arrest you, Ms. Skorsky,
for abetting an act of cyberterrorism.

526
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:22,855
Who's going to take care
of your mother

527
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,151
while you're spending the next
three years in courtrooms?

528
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,987
Would you please
raise your arms?

529
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:32,113
- No, Meechum.
- Sir.

530
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,406
Meechum.

531
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,532
I know you don't want
to shake my hand,

532
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,618
so we'll just skip that part.

533
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,538
The president didn't
mention anything about it.

534
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,874
Why would he?
Better to catch you off guard.

535
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:49,421
- Then why would you?
- So we can avoid unnecessary conflict.

536
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,090
Garrett's not a good liar.

537
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:56,511
The gift of a good liar is making people
think you lack a talent for lying.

538
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:02,224
I know him far better than you, and so
I know what talents he has and lacks.

539
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,935
But let's assume he did lie.

540
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:09,273
I'm not intimidated
by a FERC investigation.

541
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:12,692
You'd have grid overload and brownouts
before you could even get a hearing.

542
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:15,153
You are deliberately keeping
electric prices at inflated rates,

543
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,655
- which is illegal.
- No.

544
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,785
- I'm responding to the free market.
- A regulated free market.

545
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:25,246
Why are you doing this, Frank?

546
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:29,207
Remy asked me the same thing.

547
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,586
- You're making this about me.
- This isn't personal, Raymond.

548
00:35:32,711 --> 00:35:35,755
The integrity of our energy
markets is my only concern.

549
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:38,925
Of course it's personal.
I asked you, personally,

550
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,260
to convince Garrett to pull back
from China.

551
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:43,971
You personally chose not to.

552
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:46,181
You personally sabotaged
the summit.

553
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:48,392
- I have never once in my career...
- You personally advised...

554
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,645
- ...allowed personal...
- ...to push me up against the wall.

555
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,440
Do not try and spin me, Frank!
I am too old to tango!

556
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:58,860
Then I'll be blunt. Accept the
subsidies or deal with FERC.

557
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:00,570
There is no third way here.

558
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:04,281
Are you intentionally trying
to destroy the president?

559
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:09,202
I'm trying to protect
the president... from you.

560
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:13,873
This is about the secretary
of state nomination, isn't it?

561
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:17,293
I'm the vice president now. I don't cry
over what happened in kindergarten.

562
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:19,879
You're vice president
because I vouched for you.

563
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:24,216
Because you had no other
options. Political necessity.

564
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:31,014
- You have 24 hours to decide.
- I'll show myself out.

565
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,228
Hello.

566
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:41,274
Raymond, this is Claire.

567
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,193
Mrs. Underwood, it is an honor.

568
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:49,823
Jean... my wife, has been very
taken with your recent efforts.

569
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,366
Well, I'd like
to meet her one day.

570
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,243
She would very much
like that, I'm sure.

571
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:56,829
- And what about you?
- I'm sorry?

572
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:58,915
What are your thoughts
about our recent efforts?

573
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,001
Oh. I am in favor of anything

574
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:05,713
that prevents
unnecessary violence.

575
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:07,965
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Underwood.

576
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,844
And good luck with that
first pitch tonight, Mr. Vice President.

577
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:16,389
Make it to the plate this time.

578
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:17,724
Ma'am.

582
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:41,245
- This Kevlar is cooking me.
- We have to use it, sir.

583
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:44,165
Well, I didn't practice with it.
Now I can hardly rotate my arm.

584
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,125
I should have mentioned it.
I apologize.

585
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,377
If this ball doesn't make it
over the plate, it's your ass.

586
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:52,380
And what are you doing here?
Don't you have things to do?

587
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:54,841
Never been to Camden Yards.

Ladies and gentlemen,
here to throw out the first pitch tonight,

591
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:16,027
we are honored to introduce
the vice president of the United States,

592
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:20,948
Frank Underwood!

593
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:31,374
Boss, boss. Use his ball.

594
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:41,008
Thank you very much. Where's
the mascot? There you are.

595
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,635
Pleasure.

596
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,095
Beautiful job.

597
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:49,391
Good evening. Now, I know it's a hot night
and you all want to get to the baseball.

598
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:54,437
So as soon as I throw this sucker,
grab a drink, enjoy the game,

599
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:56,356
and best of luck to both teams.

600
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:59,650
Ah, scratch that.
We're at Camden Yards.

601
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:02,820
Go Orioles!

602
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:40,563
Let's go, sir.
We've gotta move!

603
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,737
Got him.
We're on the move.

604
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:52,824
I'm told the distribution line that
controls the pinch point

605
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,243
caused the outages.
BAPCO, one of your companies.

606
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:57,495
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>There was a capacity issue.</i>

607
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,705
<i>We're working as quickly</i>
<i>as we can to resolve it.</i>

608
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,249
I've got
three governors calling,

609
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:02,875
hospitals on emergency power,

610
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,001
so quickly better mean quickly.

611
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:05,794
<i>The latest estimate I got</i>

612
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:07,546
<i>was two to three hours,</i>
<i>maybe sooner.</i>

613
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,923
Raymond, was this intentional?

614
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:15,845
Sir, I know you don't hold me
in the highest regard at the moment,

615
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,514
but I am alarmed

616
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,850
that you could even
entertain such a thought.

617
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:24,520
<i>Well, the timing makes</i>
<i>coincidence hard to swallow.</i>

618
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:28,774
There is a heat wave. That always
pushes the grid to its limits.

619
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:31,943
Let's get the people out of the dark.
Updates every 30 minutes on your progress.

620
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:37,991
I should inform you, sir, that I may need
to take two of my plants offline tomorrow,

621
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:41,285
- <i> for unscheduled maintenance.</i>
- Why? Which ones?

622
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,037
<i>Georgia and Tennessee.</i>

623
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:45,456
<i>This blackout has put</i>
<i>a great deal of stress on them.</i>

624
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:50,502
My engineers are concerned
about the seals on the fuel rods.

625
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:52,921
So we're looking at outages
on the Southeast grid, too?

626
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:55,507
- <i> Could be, for a few days.</i>
- That's unacceptable.

627
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:58,384
Safety comes first.
We don't want an accident.

628
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:02,054
- Let's get a full report to Linda ASAP.
- <i> Yes, sir.</i>

629
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:03,639
Thank you, sir.

630
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:08,268
- He's toying with you.
- This could be a legitimate safety issue.

631
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:11,146
He wants a seat back at the
table. Those plants are fine.

632
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,231
Why is he doing this?
We've had our differences,

633
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:14,774
but something drastic like this?

634
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:18,820
Well, I did tell him
about the possible FERC action.

635
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:22,156
- You did what?
- He called me, I answered the call.

636
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:23,491
Why didn't you inform me
immediately?

637
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:25,576
He told me you had
a productive talk,

638
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:27,536
that he was on board
with the subsidy.

639
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:29,955
I assumed everything was fine.

640
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,666
He was proposing renewed trade
talks. We didn't talk about subsidy at all.

641
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:36,002
He's playing both of us then.

642
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,463
If he told you he was on board,
why'd you bring up FERC?

643
00:41:38,504 --> 00:41:41,882
I told him I was relieved, that we
could've taken action if he didn't comply.

644
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:44,051
You think he's fishing, to see
what our next move might be?

645
00:41:44,176 --> 00:41:48,514
I think so, sir. I mean, he is lying
about those two plants in the South.

646
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:50,557
But we can't guess.
We have to be certain.

647
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:53,143
Do you want Raymond Tusk
to assess that risk,

648
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:54,936
or the United States government?

649
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:56,980
Are you suggesting
we take over his facilities?

650
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:58,731
There is precedent there.

651
00:41:58,856 --> 00:42:01,776
Woodrow Wilson did it with the
railroads for three full years.

652
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:03,360
In a time of war.

653
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:06,780
In a time of emergency,
which is what this is.

654
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:10,992
The country needs a leader,
Mr. President. Give them one.

655
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:14,287
Do not bend to Raymond Tusk.

656
00:42:23,587 --> 00:42:25,589
I'm done.

657
00:42:28,592 --> 00:42:30,969
- I said you might not like it.
- It makes me seem crazy.

658
00:42:31,094 --> 00:42:34,014
This is the most
toned-down version.

659
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:38,184
I tried to be as kind as I
could without being biased.

660
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:40,853
I don't think you want this
going out into the world.

661
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:43,022
Can I talk to Janine?

662
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,448
Tell him to go.

663
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,539
He wants you to leave.

664
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,506
- You lied.
- Luca...

665
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,508
You lied to Tom.
You lied to the US attorney.

666
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
I didn't know what else to do.

667
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:15,927
Tell the truth.

668
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,430
They'll arrest me.

669
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,557
They'll discredit
everything I say.

670
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,602
And nobody is going to believe
me more than they believe you.

671
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,479
But we can get the story out there.
Get people asking questions.

672
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:32,484
No. It'll just look like
two crazy people instead of one.

673
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:37,655
So you're saving yourself.

674
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,783
I'm trying to save
the both of us.

675
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,498
Please. Take the plea.

676
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:50,250
- I'm not guilty.
- You are.

677
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,461
You committed a crime.
Multiple crimes.

678
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:56,256
Not murder.

679
00:43:57,632 --> 00:44:03,137
Take the plea. Be good.
Get out early.

680
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:08,433
Everybody...
everybody's fucked me.

681
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,020
If I was trying to fuck you,
I wouldn't be here.

682
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:16,191
He's gonna get away with it,
isn't he?

683
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:21,779
Yes.

684
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,657
He is.

685
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:37,752
- I'll take an iced tea if you have any.
- We don't.

686
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,551
I wish I didn't have to keep coming
through back doors like this.

687
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:48,428
Well, we wouldn't want our
friends in the fourth estate

688
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:51,098
to know you were here, would we?
Especially since you've gone

689
00:44:51,223 --> 00:44:56,019
to such lengths to remain
above the fray of politics.

690
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:58,688
You can't seize
the plants, Frank.

691
00:44:58,813 --> 00:45:00,606
We haven't seized anything yet.

692
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,484
We're ready to, but we won't...
if you cooperate.

693
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:06,111
- It's illegal.
- It's not. You know that.

694
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:10,115
The president can issue an executive
order in times of emergency.

695
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,493
- I'll fight it in court. - Which will take even
longer than a FERC investigation would.

696
00:45:13,618 --> 00:45:17,664
And in the meantime, you make
nothing from those plants.

697
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:21,834
We agreed, right here
in this room,

698
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:24,962
we agreed to work together.
We agreed as men of our word.

699
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:27,756
And I held up my end of
that bargain until you abandoned me...

700
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:29,633
I sent Remy to help you.

701
00:45:29,716 --> 00:45:32,135
After I got it passed through
the Senate, with no help from you.

702
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,970
I had to protect my relationship
with the president.

703
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:36,764
And then you tried to use me
during the summit in Spotsylvania.

704
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,018
I was not put on this earth
to be your best friend,

705
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:44,855
or to share every piece
of information I have with you.

706
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,901
We agreed to a mutually
beneficial partnership,

707
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:51,361
that's all.

708
00:45:53,238 --> 00:45:56,574
Yes, and what's
become very clear to me

709
00:45:56,658 --> 00:45:59,911
is that I benefit in no way
from this partnership.

710
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:01,871
Let's not pretend to be naive.

711
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:06,000
We both respect self-interest
above all else.

712
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:12,756
Our versions of that
no longer align.

713
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:18,052
You are on the verge of making an
irreversible mistake, Mr. Vice President.

714
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:23,766
I may well be making a mistake.
Who knows?

715
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:27,019
What I do know is that you'll be
calling Linda and telling her

716
00:46:27,186 --> 00:46:29,563
that you'll accept
the subsidies.

717
00:46:29,688 --> 00:46:34,859
You may have all the money, Raymond,
but I have all the men with guns.

718
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:37,362
It's a burner.
Pre-dialed. She's expecting.

719
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:41,782
Oh, and uh, yes...
from last night.

720
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:46,120
The ball's in your court,
as they say.

721
00:47:03,594 --> 00:47:07,097
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

722
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:12,435
Are you supposed to take the
Lord's name in vain like that?

723
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:14,813
- Leave it on.
- Costs too much.

724
00:47:14,938 --> 00:47:17,607
I'll take care of it.

725
00:47:21,736 --> 00:47:25,281
Goodwin took the plea.
He's going away.

726
00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:29,660
- So does that mean this is all over?
- No.

727
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:32,537
- We still have to be careful.
- Well, why?

728
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:34,831
If he's gone, then nobody's
looking for me, right?

729
00:47:34,914 --> 00:47:37,959
Not that we know of.
Until we know, nothing changes.

730
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:39,961
So what, you just came over here
to get my hopes up?

731
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:43,839
I came here to make sure that
you don't go to church tonight.

732
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:54,015
Do you want to fuck me?

733
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,772
- Is that what this is all about?
- No.

734
00:48:01,856 --> 00:48:05,192
- You've done it before.
- That was different.

735
00:48:14,743 --> 00:48:16,578
Stop it.

736
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,959
If there's one thing I know,
it's when a man wants me.

737
00:48:38,556 --> 00:48:41,851
I learned who Rachel
was in church.

738
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:46,063
She was young and beautiful.

739
00:48:46,188 --> 00:48:49,900
Jacob fell in love with her
while she was watering a lamb and...

740
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:55,864
...she became his wife after he worked
seven years to earn her hand in marriage.

741
00:48:57,657 --> 00:49:03,120
