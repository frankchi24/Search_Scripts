1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:11,553
You're parsing the law, and
I'm talking about a spiritual code.

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,181
Confidentiality is a covenant,

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,391
not only between myself
and those I counsel,

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,643
but also between myself
and the Lord.

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,855
Dr. Larkin, my chief focus here
is the money laundering.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:26,609
If the President brought up Xander Feng,
Raymond Tusk, the Adohi casino...

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,446
Doesn't matter what the focus is. I can't
share anything we discuss privately.

8
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,573
Religious guidance is protected.

9
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,866
But you were also conducting
professional therapy.

10
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:37,702
- I never claimed that.
- Mr. and Mrs. Keith confirmed as much.

11
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:40,580
We were at their house.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,542
But they didn't participate in our
conversations, so how would they know?

13
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:48,170
So you're saying that you
only gave religious counsel.

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,256
That's how I choose
to interpret it.

15
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:56,803
The President and his wife have
never once attended your church.

16
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:59,889
- They're not even the same denomination.
- Irrelevant.

17
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,891
Not legally speaking.

18
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,186
I'm certain I can convince a judge to
issue a subpoena on the grounds

19
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,938
that you weren't their
legitimate spiritual advisor.

20
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:11,317
Which is your prerogative,
but I can appeal.

21
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:13,902
- And I would.
- You'd lose.

22
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:19,282
The only circumstance
by which I would talk

23
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:21,951
is if someone personally
waived their privilege.

24
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:25,246
Otherwise, I'd rather face
contempt of court.

25
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,622
It's a matter of ethics.

26
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:37,591
Mr. President.

27
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:40,552
Aww... You brought it back in.

28
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:42,553
Floyd Mayweather visited
the White House this morning.

29
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:45,306
- I thought he'd get a kick out of it.
- Did he have a go at it?

30
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,225
He threw a combination I thought
would bust the stitching loose.

31
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,185
That must have been
a treat to watch.

32
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,688
He was telling me,
it's not just about the power.

33
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:54,940
There are plenty of boxers
more powerful than he is.

34
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,109
No, it's his tactics,
his precision, his speed,

35
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,779
most important,
his counterpunch.

36
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:06,826
He dances and dodges, then picks
the perfect moment to strike.

37
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,703
Does that sound familiar?

38
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,538
How do you mean, sir?

39
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:15,250
You gave this to me
as a gesture of friendship.

40
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,379
When I look at this now,
I don't see friendship,

41
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,298
I see calculation.

42
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:27,762
You set me up, Frank.

43
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:30,556
- What?
- Your back-channeling,

44
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,599
the special prosecutor...

45
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,687
When I think about Raymond,
about Linda, about Jim Matthews...

46
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,066
You are wrong, sir.

47
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:46,153
Questions from Dunbar,
about the marriage counseling.

48
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,489
"It's a needle in the haystack,
she's not trying to find."

49
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,826
That's what you said.
Well, she found the needle.

50
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:55,245
- I am shocked, sir, I never...
- Like hell you are.

51
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:58,915
- You want to diminish me.
- Diminish you?

52
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:03,002
Laying the groundwork
for a challenge in 2016.

53
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:06,172
I am sorry to have to say this, sir,
but you are being ludicrous.

54
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:09,258
Do you really think
I'm so blind?

55
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:12,886
A vice president has never
challenged a sitting president!

56
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:15,722
You've climbed the ladder doing
things other men would never do.

57
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:18,725
Always in service
to you and the party.

58
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,643
It was your idea
to hand over those logs.

59
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:23,313
You connected the White House
to China, the casino.

60
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:26,232
Raymond Tusk entangled us
with China and the casino.

61
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:29,652
- And if I hadn't intervened...
- You can't dodge and duck like Floyd.

62
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,320
I've learned your moves now.

63
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:37,450
This office breeds paranoia.
Don't give into it, sir.

64
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,954
I'd ask for your resignation if
it wouldn't make things worse.

65
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,874
But from this moment forward,
I don't want to hear your voice.

66
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:46,667
I don't want to see your face.

67
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:51,505
And if I do, I will put you
on your goddamn back.

68
00:03:57,886 --> 00:03:59,679
Exile.

69
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:03,933
I've managed to isolate
the president from everyone...

70
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,686
...including myself.

71

<font color="#3399CC">http://TV4User.de</font>

72
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:50,906
"Congresswoman Sharp is a perfect example
of how the military brainwashes us

73
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:53,158
into never questioning
the party line.

74
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,952
Her opposition to the bill
is disgraceful.

75
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:59,581
It will cost thousands of men and women
the justice they deserve,

76
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:02,875
- and some of them their lives."
- Those are Megan Hennessey's words.

77
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,169
- They're biased...
- They're Claire's words.

78
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,631
Hennessey's just the mouthpiece.
Why does it say I declined to comment?

79
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,633
You said you didn't want to kick
up dust if we could avoid it.

80
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:14,011
<i>It's The New York fucking Times.
You should've let me know.</i>

81
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:17,806
That was my call.
I'll take the blame.

82
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:20,517
Find out when Hennessey's
next appearance is.

83
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:23,394
- I want to beat this bitch down.
- I know she went after you.

84
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:26,731
- but going after her...
- Not her, Claire Underwood.

85
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:30,776
I understand how Garrett might misconstrue
things, given the pressure he's under,

86
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:33,487
but you can't honestly
believe it yourself.

87
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:35,781
<i>I don't know
what to believe anymore.</i>

88
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,782
Francis is devastated.

89
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:41,244
All he wants to do is help, but he
feels like he's being unfairly accused.

90
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:45,164
<i>I don't want to believe it, Claire,
but Garrett is convinced.</i>

91
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:46,832
Will you talk to him?

92
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:50,127
I have to concentrate on keeping
my family together right now,

93
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,795
not getting
into arguments over...

94
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,755
<i>If Francis were
really up to something,</i>

95
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:56,466
don't you think he would've
told Dunbar about the therapy?

96
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:59,219
He basically did, by forcing us
to hand over the logs.

97
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,721
Your husband chose
to hand them over.

98
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,183
If he had said no, Francis
wouldn't have pressed the issue.

99
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,101
I don't want to debate this
with you, Claire.

100
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:11,522
<i>All I'm asking is that you
really think this through, Tricia.</i>

101
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:14,274
- Is he with you right now?
- Who?

102
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:18,486
<i>- Frank.
- No, it's just you and me.</i>

103
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:21,406
I want to get off the phone.

104
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:25,117
<i>- Will you please talk to Garrett?
- Goodbye, Claire.</i>

105
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:31,707
What do you think?

106
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:34,376
I don't think she's going to side
with me instead of her husband.

107
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,630
Did Tricia tell anyone else
about the Xanax, besides you?

108
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,883
I doubt she would.
She's very sensitive about it.

109
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:44,343
If she'd only told someone else,
then we could just leak it.

110
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,637
- But it'll too obvious.
- The doctor.

111
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:50,266
He's protecting them.
He won't say anything.

112
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,309
Unless they waive the privilege.

113
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,479
They have absolutely
nothing to gain by that.

114
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,860
But we do.

115
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:05,738
- You have to meet with Tusk.
- Why would he talk to me

116
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,240
- after I backstabbed him?
- That's precisely why he'll talk to you.

117
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,284
- I can't go to St. Louis.
- Tusk will come east.

118
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,994
Your job is to get
in the same room with him.

119
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:14,746
- What's the play?
- Remy Danton, go.

120
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,290
- Get me Durant, in person.
- I'll set it up.

121
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,085
And Doug, let's make sure we're
airtight on everything else.

122
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:25,214
- No Achilles' heel.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,634
"Cry 'Havoc,'" said he who
fought chaos with chaos,

124
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,345
"and let slip the dogs of war."

125
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,315
Missed appointments,
no contact in weeks...

126
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,109
- You know the rules.
- I'd like to speak to Agent Green, please.

127
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,112
- What are you up to?
- Put Green on the fucking line, please.

128
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,322
Anything you have to say,
you can discuss it with me.

129
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,700
What I have to say
is way above your pay grade.

130
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,410
Where do I turn off this shit?

131
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:01,956
Look at the other screen,
to the left.

132
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,091
- What is this?
- That is the access grid

133
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:14,801
to all eight
of AT&T's data centers.

134
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,345
So, what do you say you uncuff
me and tell Agent Green

135
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,681
I'll be waiting for his call.

136
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,727
I'm trying to repair
relations with China.

137
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:27,313
Giving Feng asylum
would be a slap in the face.

138
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,733
Garrett's in trouble.
He needs to appear resolute.

139
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:34,569
We're only as strong as the president
we serve. We have to rescue him.

140
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:37,447
How can you be sure his testimony
won't implicate the White House?

141
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,491
He knows where
his bread is buttered.

142
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,327
This isn't about
you saving the president.

143
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:45,246
- Of course it is.
- We've been down this road before, Frank.

144
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:49,750
Michael Kern, Adam Galloway.
I wanted to become secretary of state

145
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,838
in order to engage in productive diplomacy,
not full-time damage control.

146
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:57,382
Which is why we have
to put Garrett back on his feet.

147
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:00,677
You want him on his ass, Frank.

148
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,471
Is this what
the president told you?

149
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:08,184
He's paranoid, Cathy.
He's trying to turn people against me.

150
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:13,730
You're turning them against
yourself. You're asking me
to undermine the president.

151
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,862
All right.

152
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,076
Let's say that what the
president has accused me of...

153
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:30,204
...is true.

154
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:36,043
Would that be so bad,
if taken to its conclusion?

155
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,587
Wouldn't you stand to benefit?

156
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:42,173
Wouldn't the country?

157
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:47,678
- I don't want anything to do with this.
- Just one more time, Cathy.

158
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:51,265
Let's unshackle ourselves.

159
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:54,393
This is a one-time
offer, Mr. Feng.

160
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:58,063
<i>I would need it in writing.
Open-ended, no restrictions.</i>

161
00:10:58,063 --> 00:11:00,356
<i>The same goes
for legal immunity.</i>

162
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:03,735
First I need to know whether or not you
funneled money through Lanagin's casino.

163
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:07,530
No. I will speak freely once I have
arrived safely in the United States.

164
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,740
<i>Unless you provide
valuable evidence now,</i>

165
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,577
the attorney general will not
grant immunity on any level.

166
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:16,288
<i>I have denied
these allegations in China.</i>

167
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:19,708
<i>My enemies want me dead. You're asking
me to give them confirmation.</i>

168
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,210
And we're giving you
safe haven in return.

169
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,378
<i>I already have
safe haven in Dubai.</i>

170
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:29,341
Your asylum there is only temporary.
We're offering you permanent status.

171
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:32,052
<i>I'm confident that they will
grant me permanent status.</i>

172
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,389
Did you hear that directly from
the minister of foreign affairs?

173
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:37,641
<i>Because I just spoke to him.</i>

174
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:40,435
Right now you are a man
without a passport.

175
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:43,187
Whatever assets
Beijing hasn't seized

176
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:47,358
are frozen in every country with close ties
to the United States or China,

177
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:50,611
which is just about every
country in the world.

178
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:53,530
You want your freedom
and fortune.

179
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,366
<i>We want information.</i>

180
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,829
<i>Mr. Feng?</i>

181
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,705
What do you need to know?

182
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:06,876
<i>Confirm for me the existence
of a money laundering scheme.</i>

183
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,003
Yes.

184
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:13,298
<i>We used the casino
to mask foreign contributions.</i>

185
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,677
All right.

186
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:21,681
One of you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

187
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:25,101
- You have to comply.
- You mean I have to show up.

188
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:27,812
- Unless we appeal.
- We'd lose.

189
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:31,273
She wouldn't have issued the subpoena
unless she had something substantial.

190
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:34,526
I agree, which is why I think you
should go and plead the Fifth.

191
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:37,571
- What do you think she has?
- I don't want to speculate.

192
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:40,281
Goddamn it, I pay
the six of you more in one day

193
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,283
than it costs to put
a kid through college.

194
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:44,285
I pay you to know
more than I do.

195
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,329
Her line of questioning
will tell us a lot.

196
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,833
We could use that to prepare
a defense in case there's an indictment.

197
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,962
- When do I have to go?
- Your interview is the day after next.

198
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:57,214
Forty-eight hours?

199
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,290
- Having trouble starting it?
- Yeah.

200
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,083
I think the battery
might be dead.

201
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,127
I have some cables
if you want to try and jump it.

202
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,965
- You sure you don't mind?
- Not at all.

203
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:45,967
All right.
That's really nice of you.

204
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,551
Pop your hood.
I'll bring my car around.

205
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,011
Sure.

206
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:52,723
- Hey.
- Hey. This is Peter.

207
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:55,726
- He's the guy who drove me back.
- Oh.

208
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:59,396
- Where do you want these?
- I'll take them. Thanks.

209
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,733
- Rachel, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:06,152
- Lisa said you two are roommates.
- Can I get you something?

211
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:09,113
- A glass of water?
- No, thanks. I should get going.

212
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,739
All right.
I can't thank you enough.

213
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:12,241
My pleasure.
Good luck with the car.

214
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:15,118
- Thanks.
- I hope it's only a dead battery.

215
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:16,495
Have a good night.

216
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:19,831
We should give him some money.

217
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:22,625
- What?
- Peter!

218
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,297
She needs to be gone.

219
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,759
- You told me she could stay.
- I changed my mind.

220
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,761
But you said you didn't care
if she was here.

221
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:38,473
I don't need to explain myself.

222
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:42,644
You can't stand it, can you? The idea
that I might actually love somebody,

223
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:45,104
that I might have somebody
in my life who isn't you.

224
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:48,357
If you care about her,
make it happen, Rachel.

225
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:51,485
- Hey. Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

226
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:53,403
You need to tell your friend
that I won't take any money.

227
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:56,907
I was happy to do it. We all need
a good Samaritan every now and again.

228
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,956
Did you feel justice was served
when General McGinnis

229
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:06,082
got sentenced to 40 years?

230
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes, as far as his crimes go,

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,210
but not for thousands
of servicemen...

232
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,381
I'm sorry to interrupt, but my producer
is telling me that Jacqueline Sharp

233
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,883
has called in,
the House majority whip.

234
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,511
<i>- Congresswoman, are you there?
-  Yes, I'm here, Chris.</i>

235
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:22,472
<i>- Thank you for taking my call.
-  Thank you.</i>

236
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:25,349
<i>- Hello, Megan.
- Congresswoman.</i>

237
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,226
First of all, as a veteran like
yourself,

238
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,687
I want to thank you for your
service to our country.

239
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:33,232
<i>- Duty doesn't require thanks.
- I'm glad you brought up duty,</i>

240
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,568
because you recently
equated it with brainwashing.

241
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:41,030
<i>- That's not what I meant.
-  You said "toeing the party line."</i>

242
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,783
What I meant was the culture
and the system is one...

243
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,910
I didn't call to argue with you,
Megan. The opposite.

244
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,747
We can't fix this problem until we find
some common ground, wouldn't you agree?

245
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,874
There is no middle ground,
as far as I'm concerned.

246
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:54,710
- The military needs to change...
- Can't we agree that you and I served

247
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,297
so that we could protect open debate,
which is the very bedrock of democracy?

248
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,591
Yes, in theory, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

249
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:04,010
<i>Not in theory, in reality.</i>

250
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,679
Brave men and women
die fighting for that freedom.

251
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,850
The meaning of bravery is fighting for the
freedom of those with whom you disagree.

252
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,727
Sure, but let's get back
to the issue here.

253
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:15,312
<i>What I don't think is brave</i>

254
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:18,273
is Claire Underwood
dodging this debate

255
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:20,483
and having you fight this battle
for her instead.

256
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:22,277
<i>That's not true.</i>

257
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:25,279
<i>Then why am I talking to you
instead of her? It's her bill.</i>

258
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,198
<i>It's not just hers.
It's all of ours.</i>

259
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,075
<i>Except one of you
is brave enough to say it,</i>

260
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,286
<i>and the other is a coward.</i>

261
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:36,123
<i>Mrs. Underwood was brave enough to go
on national television and admit that...</i>

262
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:37,791
<i>And where has she been since?</i>

263
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,418
<i>Deflecting scandal
and hiding from the press.</i>

264
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:45,381
<i>You called me disgraceful in
The New York Times, Megan,
and you have every right.</i>

265
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:49,385
But I also have the right to say
that Mrs. Underwood is disgraceful,

266
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:53,597
because nothing is more
disgraceful than running from a battle.

267
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,976
- Megan?
- That isn't...

268
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,645
<i>We're not even...</i>

269
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,065
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

270
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,196
- Where are you going?
- To the Capitol.

271
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,907
Did Feng mention either
me or the president?

272
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,452
Dunbar wouldn't say, but the fact that
Feng confirmed the money laundering

273
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,329
increases focus
on the White House.

274
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,456
As long as we're innocent,
which we are...

275
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:24,167
Raymond Tusk
has been subpoenaed.

276
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,255
Why did you ask for this meeting, Bill?
Just keeping us in the loop?

277
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:32,674
Did you encourage Secretary
Durant to offer Feng asylum?

278
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:35,177
Bill, for godsakes.

279
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:37,596
The president could have
asked me that question himself.

280
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:39,264
As White House counsel,
it is my responsibility...

281
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:41,057
No, I did not.

282
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:44,268
So you're saying Durant
acted of her own accord.

283
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:46,437
I have no idea what her
motivations were.

284
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:48,939
I'm just as shocked as the president
that she would have gone through with this

285
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,233
without his direct approval.

286
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:55,445
There's another matter
I'd like to discuss, privately if we could.

287
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:57,697
Just give us a few moments.

288
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,249
- The therapy.
- Yes.

289
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,793
To be specific,
the confidentiality waiver.

290
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:13,879
Feng's testimony puts us
in a very awkward position.

291
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,047
We're under a great deal of
pressure to waive the privilege.

292
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:20,260
If we don't, it implies that the president
may have confessed to things he didn't.

293
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,637
Dunbar is just grasping,
don't give in.

294
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:27,266
I don't want to, but Larkin's argument
for spiritual confidentiality

295
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,268
is shaky at best.

296
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:32,354
We want to control
how this thing plays out.

297
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:34,064
How can I help?

298
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:36,566
We need to know if anyone else
might pop out of the woodwork.

299
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,985
Well, I haven't mentioned it to
anyone and neither has Claire.

300
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,863
I would never betray
the president's trust like that.

301
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:47,660
Thank you for your time.

302
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,997
Tell the president it saddens me that we
now have to communicate through lawyers.

303
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,459
I will make myself available if
he wants to discuss any of this in person.

304
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:56,585
Yes, sir.

305
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,336
What Megan said was offensive.

306
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,255
She shouldn't have
questioned your character.

307
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:04,300
Those were talking points,
carefully crafted and not by her.

308
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,928
I'm not here to pick a fight,
Jackie. I'm here to end one.

309
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:10,055
It'll end soon enough,
when the bill goes to the floor.

310
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:11,890
It won't go to the floor.

311
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,686
I've spoken to Elaine Brooks
and I'm withdrawing the bill.

312
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:19,606
What you said had some truth.

313
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:23,776
Early on, you offered to sit down
with me and find a middle ground.

314
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,320
I decided to draw a line
in the sand.

315
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,658
The braver thing would've been for me
to swallow my pride and sit down with you.

316
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:34,870
If you're still open to that,
I'd love to start over.

317
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,498
- Are you and Frank up to something?
- A passable bill.

318
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:43,628
He had Nancy spy on me. He
brought my personal life into...

319
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:45,880
Francis is used
to getting his way,

320
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,549
and he'll do anything
to make sure he does,

321
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,968
especially if it's something
important to me.

322
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:55,347
I don't know, Claire.
I'm skeptical.

323
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:57,557
We're deeply sorry
for the way we've treated you.

324
00:19:57,557 --> 00:20:01,561
And we want to rebuild
the trust we've lost.

325
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,688
Do you think that's possible?

326
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:17,033
I'm sorry to ambush you,
I tried calling.

327
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,535
You can't do this to me, Claire.

328
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:20,954
I was very clear that I have
to respect Garrett's...

329
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:25,291
Not that, the sexual assault
bill, it's not going to a vote.

330
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,543
Did the Speaker
remove it from the docket?

331
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,837
No, I did.

332
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,214
I just spoke to Jackie.

333
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,132
This is because of what
she said about you?

334
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,968
My main concern is that
she doesn't come after you next.

335
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:40,346
Not while you and Garrett are
going through the investigation.

336
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:44,642
I thought you should be aware, because
I know how much this bill meant to you.

337
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:47,937
- All the work you've put in.
- That we've put in.

338
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:52,149
But we'll pass Jackie's version,
take this baby step and build on it.

339
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:56,903
I'm disappointed about the bill,
but I have to say, I'm relieved.

340
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,822
How are you holding up?

341
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:01,950
Did you hear what Catherine did,
giving Feng asylum?

342
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,786
- Inexcusable.
- Garrett's beside himself.

343
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:08,289
He feels cornered, like we have no choice
but to waive the privilege now.

344
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:10,708
- But what about the medication?
- I know.

345
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,586
I shouldn't be sharing this.

346
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:16,379
We don't have to talk about it.
You should go.

347
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,132
I know you have
a packed schedule.

348
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,429
<i>Thank you for doing this.</i>

349
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,722
<i>All I had to do was
get her alone in a hallway.</i>

350
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:30,309
<i>- I meant with Jackie.
- We have our priorities.</i>

351
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,604
I know it isn't easy to let go
of something like that.

352
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:38,608
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

353
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:43,154
- I can't live in this house alone.
- I'm not going anywhere.

354
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:46,490
You say that,
but this could all backfire.

355
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,200
Raymond will plead the Fifth.

356
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,870
If he names me, it's an
admission of his own wrongdoing.

357
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,832
I'm more worried about Garrett.
You've made a powerful enemy.

358
00:21:55,832 --> 00:22:00,712
- We're stronger than they are.
- And he's still the president.

359
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:05,049
I promise you, of all the
sacrifices that you've had to make,

360
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:08,552
divorcing a convict
will not be one of them.

361
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:10,387
We can't waive
the privilege, Garrett.

362
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,264
- We don't have a choice anymore.
- Feng confirmed the money.

363
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,141
Over the phone,
not in a formal interview.

364
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:15,851
Rescind the asylum,
send him back...

365
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,228
- Obstruction of justice.
- Is that what Galich said?

366
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:20,772
Definitely how it will be perceived.
And anything we do that looks

367
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,358
like a failure to cooperate
amplifies that perception.

368
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:26,027
I just don't want
our marriage put on display.

369
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:28,904
Look, Dunbar will ask
if I brought up China. I didn't.

370
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:31,532
So Larkin can only help
to exonerate me.

371
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:33,867
And if the marriage counseling
ends up in her report, so be it.

372
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:36,369
- We can survive that.
- But he prescribed us medication.

373
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:39,205
- Technically, not us.
- You took mine, Garrett.

374
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:41,624
Larkin wrote the prescription
to me knowing you would.

375
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:45,461
Wait, have you mentioned it?
The medication?

376
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:50,382
- Claire?
- I'm sorry, but she's the only person

377
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,301
I can talk to who really
understands what it's like...

378
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,261
All the more reason
we have to waive the privilege.

379
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,847
If they leak this, we can't
control the information.

380
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:59,808
- Claire wouldn't do that.
- Don't underestimate her.

381
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:03,519
If they were going to, don't you think
they would have done it by now?

382
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,522
She dropped the sexual assault
bill to reduce pressure on us.

383
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:08,232
That may have been
what she told you.

384
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:10,192
They're not going
to say anything.

385
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,822
I'm begging you, Garrett,
don't waive the privilege.

386
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:20,493
The things we talked about
were so intimate.

387
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:23,496
- Imagine if the kids...
- I know, but Tricia...

388
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:28,209
When we ran, I knew every aspect
of our lives would be under scrutiny,

389
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,753
but I thought we could
protect at least this.

390
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:33,714
What happens in here...

391
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:36,091
I'll protect us.

392
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:38,551
Whatever I have to do.

393
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,555
You have to believe that.

394
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,373
We checked the USB dongle.

395
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:14,376
The code you're claiming
infected the data center isn't there.

396
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:17,337
I programmed the code to
self-erase as soon as it hit the server.

397
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:19,130
It was gone before
Lucas was in cuffs.

398
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:21,925
You don't believe me?

399
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,926
This is one of the most
sophisticated firewalls in the world.

400
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:26,429
Even if your code did get you in there,
you couldn't break it down.

401
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,973
Your wife uses AT&T.

402
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:31,934
- So does her lover.
- What?

403
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:33,769
She's over there right now.

404
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:37,689
Jonathan Kemp.
It's her chiropractor, right?

405
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,443
Want to see
their texts to each other?

406
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:48,282
- No.
- Oh, I see, you already know.

407
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:53,620
I don't blame you for not making a fuss,
with the kids still at home.

408
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,914
But you walked my code
right through that door,

409
00:24:55,914 --> 00:24:58,416
into 32 million people's phones.

410
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,002
And that's on you,

411
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:03,129
and it's on the FBI,

412
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:06,507
and it's a shit storm that will bring
the bureau right in front of Congress.

413
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:10,219
So you tell me, how much is
making that disappear worth?

414
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:14,348
You have a hundred years hanging over your
head, extorting the FBI won't help you.

415
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:18,643
Did Douglas Stamper tell you
to set up Lucas Goodwin?

416
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,814
Counterterrorism Director, that's
a big step up from White House Liaison.

417
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,732
- I think you had a helping hand.
- Not true.

418
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,276
Keep lying.
Meanwhile, here's what I want.

419
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:31,321
One... I'm no longer your bitch.

420
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,907
Two, all of my charges
are dropped.

421
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,700
Three, all of Barrett Brown's
charges are dropped.

422
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,787
- That's up to the US attorney.
- Figure it out.

423
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,791
If I'm hearing you correctly,

424
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,711
you'd like to keep Larkin's testimony
focused on the money laundering.

425
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,171
Which I never brought up,
because I knew nothing about it.

426
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:52,508
But your concern is other
matters, private matters.

427
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:55,344
Which are irrelevant
to the investigation.

428
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:58,763
I can't prevent Dunbar from
asking what she's going to ask.

429
00:25:58,763 --> 00:26:00,181
Of course not, Bill.

430
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:03,142
The most I can do is ask
Dr. Larkin how he would

431
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:05,519
respond to certain questions.

432
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,981
But he's a smart man. He'll
understand what I'm getting at.

433
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:12,901
And this approach keeps us within the law?
We're not tampering with testimony?

434
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:14,820
It's a fine line,

435
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,280
- but I'll stay on the right side of it.
- Thanks.

436
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,866
He shut me out, Frank,
just like he did with you.

437
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:23,161
My undersecretary has been
assigned full diplomatic authority.

438
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,330
A temporary setback, Cathy.
Where I go, you go.

439
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,875
At this very moment, the president
is in the Situation Room.

440
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:33,378
China responded to Feng's asylum
exactly the way I predicted.

441
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:36,423
They're doubling their naval
presence off the coast of Yonaguni.

442
00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:40,218
And you know who isn't in
the Situation Room? You and I, Frank.

443
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:45,473
You're thinking about where we
are instead of where we're headed.

444
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:51,687
Now, that isn't the Catherine Durant
I waltzed with at the Jefferson Ball.

445
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:55,399
She understood potential.

446
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:59,069
She had her eyes
toward the future.

447
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:03,740
I told that Catherine Durant that
we needed her in the State Department.

448
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,783
We still need her.

449
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:09,954
I wish I knew where she was,
because she's not the Catherine Durant

450
00:27:09,954 --> 00:27:12,498
sitting in front
of me right now.

451
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,625
But I'll tell you something.

452
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:20,713
If she doesn't show up soon,
I'm just gonna have to keep waltzing alone

453
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:26,761
because I'm done trying to
convince this woman in front of me...

454
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:29,680
...to take my arm.

455
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:34,518
Oh, don't let me keep you.

456
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:43,401
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere, Frank.

457
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:46,779
You still have access
to the presidential briefing?

458
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:48,489
Yes, I have it right here.

459
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:52,993
Walk me through everything
that's going on with China.

460
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:56,455
Feng is in play now.
We might be able to use him.

461
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:58,748
- How?
- I don't know yet.

462
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:04,087
But he's clearly valuable to Beijing,
which makes him valuable to us.

463
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:07,131
- Nothing about Xander Feng?
- Never.

464
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:10,092
Daniel Lanagin? Raymond Tusk?

465
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:11,844
We only discussed
their marriage,

466
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:13,387
nothing about the business
of the White House.

467
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:14,763
Any oblique reference

468
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:16,640
to work-related pressures
he was feeling?

469
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,809
He said he wasn't getting
as much sleep as he'd like.

470
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:22,603
Did you ever prescribe
him any medication?

471
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:26,315
As I've always stated,
I provided religious counsel.

472
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:29,068
I understand,
but I'm asking about medication.

473
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:31,195
How is this relevant?

474
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:35,198
I'm trying to assess whether his
judgment may have been impaired.

475
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:39,619
In my opinion, he and his wife
were dealing with standard marital issues.

476
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,371
That's not what
I asked, Dr. Larkin.

477
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:44,832
So I will ask for a third time,
and let me be more specific,

478
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:48,836
was any medication prescribed or taken
as a result of your counseling session,

479
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:51,672
by the president
of the United States?

480
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,178
His faculties were operating at
100 percent, if that's what you're asking.

481
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:04,183
Has anyone from the
Administration spoken to you?

482
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:06,227
- How do you mean?
- About this deposition.

483
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:10,773
Has anyone approached you,
coached you?

484
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:14,443
If you tell me now, I will qualify that
as a timely declaration.

485
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:17,571
- I'd like to leave.
- The president waived his privilege.

486
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:21,324
- But I'm here voluntarily.
- Dr. Larkin, at first you wouldn't

487
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:26,495
talk to me because it violated
your ethical code, I respect that,

488
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:29,790
but let me ask you,
as a man of faith,

489
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,085
is deliberately lying to me
an exception to that code?

490
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:38,214
Because that is what you're doing
by refusing to share the truth.

491
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:42,051
- I don't understand.
- It wasn't going to pass.

492
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:43,928
But you said
we almost had the votes.

493
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:47,264
We needed to be 100 percent
solid, and we weren't.

494
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:49,725
If the bill failed,
that would set us back.

495
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:53,854
We need to accept
incremental reform.

496
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:56,565
You sound
just like Jackie Sharp.

497
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,858
I'm actually
working with her now.

498
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:03,321
- She's a powerful ally for us to have.
- After what she did to me?

499
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:04,947
After what she said about you?

500
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:08,117
If I let the things people say
about me get under my skin,

501
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:10,494
I wouldn't be able
to leave my own home.

502
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:12,454
You know how this will go.

503
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:16,708
Everyone will say, great, we did
something, which is really nothing.

504
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:19,210
They'll pat themselves
on the back and they'll forget about it.

505
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,129
We helped put this on the radar.

506
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:25,633
I thought we were doing
something real, changing people's lives.

507
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:29,303
How naive, right? But at least
I didn't want to give up.

508
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:32,639
Maybe Jackie Sharp is right,
you are a fucking coward.

509
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,767
I'm the one that pulled
you out from under the covers.

510
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:40,688
You were hiding, you and your pills.
You tell yourself whatever you need to.

511
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:47,903
I'm sorry.

512
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:50,906
There were political realities
we couldn't ignore.

513
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,577
Do you ever wonder why
so many people hate Washington?

514
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:59,205
It's because of people like you
using phrases like that.

515
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:12,676
Raymond?

516
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:16,304
I'd turn the lights on, but when you're
paying for the room with the best view,

517
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:18,515
you might as well
make the most of it.

518
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:22,644
I've never been in
the penthouse here, have you?

519
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:25,521
What's going on?

520
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:28,607
Do you know why I'm in DC?

521
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:32,820
Oh, it's OK, Remy, there's nothing you
can say that I don't already know.

522
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,488
Feng is on his way to testify.

523
00:31:34,488 --> 00:31:37,199
Whatever Seth has told you,
don't believe a word of it.

524
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:42,245
What might he have told me
that I shouldn't believe?

525
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:45,456
You met with
the vice president in a church,

526
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:47,708
- don't pretend you didn't.
- Playing both sides?

527
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:51,211
- Raymond, look.
- I want to hear you say it.

528
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:52,880
That you met with Frank.

529
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,257
I'll talk to you, Raymond,
but not with him here.

530
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,135
Leave us.

531
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:04,474
- Should I hold the elevator for you?
- Go fuck yourself.

532
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:07,143
OK, you can take the stairs.

533
00:32:12,523 --> 00:32:17,110
- They're toying with you, Raymond.
- No doubt,

534
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,279
but so are you, Remy.

535
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,031
I wanted to lead Frank on, give
him a false sense of security.

536
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:24,033
If you're going to lie,
lie better than that.

537
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,869
They want to tear us apart.

538
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:30,039
I don't blame you for wanting
to keep your options open,

539
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,667
but clearly you have bought
the wrong insurance policy.

540
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,877
Don't shoot yourself
in the foot like this.

541
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:39,130
Your foot,
and you're holding the gun.

542
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,092
- Now go some place else to bleed.
- You want to talk about blood?

543
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:44,844
How much have you spilled
in this war with Frank?

544
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,679
All I've tried to do
is keep the peace.

545
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,389
You could've let him
have the upper hand.

546
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:51,266
What would that have really
cost you, other than your pride?

547
00:32:57,814 --> 00:33:01,442
Such a shame.

548
00:33:01,442 --> 00:33:06,697
You have just made 42 billion
enemies, Remy, and some change.

549
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:09,241
Thirty-nine billion, Raymond.

550
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:11,827
Your market cap is shrinking.

551
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:19,542
<i>White House counsel Bill Galich
was called into questioning this morning</i>

552
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,128
<i>by Special Prosecutor
Heather Dunbar.</i>

553
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:25,840
<i>According to Dunbar's office,
there are suspicions that Galich</i>

554
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,300
<i>may have tampered
with witness testimony.</i>

555
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,678
<i>The witness in question
is Dr. Thomas Larkin,</i>

556
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:34,890
<i>a reverend and therapist who allegedly
conducted secret marriage counseling</i>

557
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,934
<i>sessions for the president
and First Lady.</i>

558
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,186
The White House counsel wouldn't
be manipulating testimony

559
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,355
without explicit direction
from the Oval Office.

560
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:44,857
And just as disconcerting is the fact
that our president is seeking

561
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:48,277
psychological treatment, and chose to
hide this from the American people.

562
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,612
If we can't trust him about that,
how do we know he wasn't involved

563
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,533
in a money laundering scheme?
How do we know he's mentally fit to lead?

564
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,203
And most important, how can he
enforce the law when he's breaking it?

565
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,164
I believe our colleagues in the
House certainly have enough

566
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,790
to consider
articles of impeachment.

567
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,043
Both trust and laws
have been broken.

568
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:11,548
Whatever the House decides to do,
we must hold this president accountable.

569
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:14,718
Fully support the president, will stand
by him no matter what comes his way.

570
00:34:14,718 --> 00:34:17,512
Put that in, put it out.
And get me Ayla Sayyad.

571
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:21,015
And as for Remy, let's let him
wither on the vine a little longer.

572
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:23,684
In the meantime, have his better
half come by the house tomorrow.

573
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:27,563
- Raymond?
- No, Jackie.

574
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:34,611
Mr. Tusk.

575
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:49,875
Well, Ms. Dunbar,
in 67 years on this planet,

576
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,961
I have never once
been issued a subpoena.

577
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:56,715
I can now cross that
off my bucket list.

578
00:34:56,715 --> 00:35:00,426
This interview is being
recorded and sealed.

579
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:04,430
As the subpoena mentioned,
Mr. Tusk, I spoke with Xander Feng.

580
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,683
He verified that you were
his partner in laundering Chinese money

581
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:11,437
to political
super PACs since 2005.

582
00:35:11,437 --> 00:35:13,272
How would you respond
to his allegations?

583
00:35:13,272 --> 00:35:17,943
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

584
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:21,446
Did you ever use these contributions
to bargain for political favors?

585
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:24,782
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

586
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:26,951
What was your relationship
with Daniel Lanagin?

587
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:30,871
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

588
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:49,597
I don't even remember
why I came over here.

589
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:54,643
- You mean when you first showed up?
- No, to the kitchen.

590
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:57,437
I'm sorry.

591
00:35:57,437 --> 00:36:01,316
- Please don't think that I don't love you.
- Then why? I don't get it.

592
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:04,485
Everything's been so fast.

593
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:08,155
And...

594
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:10,157
I don't know, it's hard to explain.
But I'm not ready for this...

595
00:36:10,157 --> 00:36:13,160
- That's bullshit.
- No, it's not.

596
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,330
I'm still trying to figure out
this new life, and this is too confusing.

597
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,291
This is the only thing
that's clear and you know it.

598
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,543
You're afraid,
but it's good to be afraid...

599
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:26,547
I need you to leave, OK?
For your own good.

600
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:28,215
I'm just going to hurt you.

601
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:30,217
I have thicker skin
than you can even imagine.

602
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:32,594
Please don't make this harder
than it has to be.

603
00:36:32,594 --> 00:36:35,680
Everything was fine yesterday.
It's so sudden.

604
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,891
- It's like it's coming out of nowhere.
- Well, it's not.

605
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,350
I've been thinking
about it for a while.

606
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,935
No, you haven't.
I would've sensed it.

607
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,980
Would you please,
please, please just go?

608
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,067
- Just tell me what's going on.
- I don't expect you to understand!

609
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:51,320
- Maybe if you try...
- I don't want you here! OK?

610
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,447
I don't love you
the way that you love me!

611
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:57,909
I was using you because it felt good
to have you around, but it was selfish!

612
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:00,161
I said the words because
I knew you wanted to hear them,

613
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:03,164
but I didn't mean them and I
don't want to keep saying them.

614
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:05,499
I'm gonna go for a walk
while you pack your stuff.

615
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:08,919
No, I don't want anything
that's been here.

616
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,462
Lisa.

617
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:35,360
<i>There was a steaming
mist in all the hollows,</i>

618
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,571
<i>and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill,</i>

619
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:43,576
<i>like an evil spirit,
seeking rest and finding none.</i>

620
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:47,246
<i>A clammy
and intensely cold mist...</i>

621
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:52,292
<i>...it made its slow way through
the air in ripples that visibly followed...</i>

622
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:58,298
<i>and overspread one another, as the waves
of an unwholesome sea might do.</i>

623
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:03,094
<i>It was dense enough to shut out everything
from the light of the coach-lamps...</i>

624
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,929
I'm surprised you wanted
to speak to me.

625
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:07,973
I haven't been the biggest
friend of the administration.

626
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:10,768
Isn't that the very best
reason to speak with you?

627
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:15,147
- I'd like to begin recording.
- By all means.

628
00:38:15,147 --> 00:38:18,650
A number of political analysts predict
that the House Judiciary Committee

629
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,610
will commence with hearings
on articles of impeachment.

630
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:25,072
Let's just stop right there.
So these analysts you speak of,

631
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:29,285
they're making predictions prior to
Dunbar's report even being released.

632
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:31,036
That could take months.

633
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,788
There's no way the Judiciary
will sit on this for that long.

634
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,707
And isn't that the fundamental
flaw with these hearings?

635
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:39,252
The Committee feels compelled
to act because of hypotheses

636
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:41,963
advanced by those in the media,
such as yourself.

637
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:46,258
I can't speak for all of my colleagues,
but I'm just reporting facts.

638
00:38:46,258 --> 00:38:51,889
Well, you may call them facts,
but if we're being honest...

639
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:55,100
In every article and interview,
I report alleged activities.

640
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,313
And if you repeat allegations enough,
again and over and over and over,

641
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:03,274
people start to believe they're
true. That's human nature.

642
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,610
I've done my research. Xander Feng
admitted to the money laundering.

643
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,863
But you're no longer writing
about Xander Feng, are you?

644
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:11,824
You're writing about
the administration.

645
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:14,951
The truth is these hearings have
been initiated by the press.

646
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:18,163
And my fear is that the President
will be tried by the press.

647
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:20,123
- Do you believe he's innocent?
- Absolutely.

648
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:23,209
I said so in my written
statement, and I say so again now.

649
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:26,587
The White House counsel has denied
coaching Dr. Larkin, but according...

650
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:31,508
Whatever comes to light, it will only
prove the president's innocence,

651
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:33,218
and I'll tell you why.

652
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:36,638
I have never known anyone
more honest, ethical,

653
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:39,474
and patriotic
than Garrett Walker.

654
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:43,102
His reverence for the Constitution
and the laws of this country

655
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:45,646
are surpassed by none.

656
00:39:45,646 --> 00:39:49,191
Tricia and I have been blessed
with a strong and loving marriage,

657
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:52,402
but even strong marriages
face challenges.

658
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:57,073
Like millions of Americans, we sought
counseling from a spiritual advisor,

659
00:39:57,073 --> 00:40:00,118
one who happened also
to be a professional therapist.

660
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:04,914
Over the years, we have often turned
to our faith in times of adversity.

661
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:06,916
Many have criticized us,

662
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:10,627
<i>but would you rather have
a president that doesn't ask for help?</i>

663
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:13,755
<i>I ask for help
from my wife every day.</i>

664
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:17,467
<i>We've relied on one another
for 23 years,</i>

665
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:20,053
<i>we've raised two beautiful
children together,</i>

666
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:23,639
<i>endured the
campaign trails together.</i>

667
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,852
From the state capital in
Denver, to the nation's capital,

668
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:31,230
we've always been
at each other's side.

669
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,151
I married this man for the same reason
that so many of you voted for him:

670
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:38,445
because he's a man of God,

671
00:40:38,445 --> 00:40:40,697
because he believes in family...

672
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:43,866
<i>...because he is
compassionate and loving.</i>

673
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:47,119
<i>Now, none of us are
perfect: I'm not, Tricia's not,</i>

674
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,079
<i>although she certainly
comes close.</i>

675
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,414
Good morning, Mr. Feng.

676
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,917
I won't ignore
what makes me human,

677
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:56,253
that's a form of blindness.

678
00:40:56,253 --> 00:41:01,007
Good leadership means tackling
my imperfections head on.

679
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:03,634
Not bad for a man on the run.

680
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:05,761
You mean a man with immunity.

681
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:10,099
Wherever you're most comfortable.
We have a lot to discuss.

682
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:13,310
<i>I do so with open eyes,</i>

683
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:18,773
just as I love with open eyes...

684
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:23,444
...my wife,
my Maker and my country.

685
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:30,117
Come in.

686
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:34,913
Thank you, Meechum.

687
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:38,541
Jackie, in these circumstances,
normally I would come to you,

688
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:42,170
but we need to keep a public
distance for the time being.

689
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,840
I thought I was here to discuss
the sexual assault bill.

690
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,009
- You are.
- Among other things.

691
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:52,096
I see.

692
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:55,557
- There's a price.
- We don't think of it that way.

693
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:58,310
I'm going to support your bill,
no matter what you say today.

694
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,480
- Regarding?
- Impeachment.

695
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,651
- Well, if it goes to the Judiciary...
- It most definitely will.

696
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,653
I'm not sure about that. Did you
see the president's address?

697
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:11,572
- We did.
- I think it will help,

698
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,950
stop the bleeding.
Impeachment can be defeated.

699
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,244
But that's what
we need to avoid.

700
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:20,205
You want impeachment.

701
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,082
Why fight a losing battle?

702
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,751
- We have a majority in the House.
- We do now,

703
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:31,090
but not if this party fails to distance
itself from a toxic president...

704
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,758
We're thinking ahead here.

705
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,093
It's why I came to you
about the bill,

706
00:42:35,093 --> 00:42:37,470
because it wasn't worth
burning a bridge over.

707
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:41,724
In the long run, we have
a lot more to gain by working together.

708
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:44,852
<i>I don't understand. You said
in the Telegraph article...</i>

709
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:48,606
I had to. My office is three
doors down from the president's,

710
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:50,899
I can't publicly deride him.

711
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:54,069
You want me to do it.

712
00:42:55,946 --> 00:43:01,659
We want you to do what
you do so well: whip the votes.

713
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:12,836
I can't abandon the president.

714
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:17,591
If the party rescues him, we'll lose
50 seats in the House in the midterms.

715
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:20,009
You will lose your position
in the leadership

716
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:24,514
and it will take us a decade to
regain the trust of the electorate.

717
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:27,308
All we're asking
is that you have an open mind.

718
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:32,187
Claire kept an open mind and you'll
pass sexual assault reform as a result.

719
00:43:32,187 --> 00:43:36,274
- You can't possibly compare impeachment...
- It's an illustration, Jackie,

720
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:39,235
of what the future looks like.

721
00:43:39,235 --> 00:43:42,947
What we offer is progress,

722
00:43:42,947 --> 00:43:46,450
with a promise of more to come.

723
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,372
It's only the beginning, Jackie.

724
00:43:51,372 --> 00:43:54,124
Ruthless pragmatism, remember?

725
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:56,126
That's why I wanted you
to be the whip.

726
00:43:56,126 --> 00:43:59,546
The three of us,
we're cut from the same cloth.

727
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:06,761
Mr. Vice President,
what you're asking

728
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:09,346
is just shy of treason.

729
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,227
Just shy, which is politics.

730
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:21,274
Oh, be careful, it's delicate.

731
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:25,319
What is it?

732
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:28,864
Something I've been working on
for a very long time,

733
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:32,242
and it's nearly finished.

734
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:37,706
Jackie... help us finish it.

735
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
