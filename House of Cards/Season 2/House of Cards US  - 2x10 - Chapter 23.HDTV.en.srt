1
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,569
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.

2
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:46,906
"Do not grieve
the Holy Spirit of God,

3
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:50,117
by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.

4
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:56,207
Let all bitterness and wrath
and anger and clamour,

5
00:00:56,207 --> 00:01:00,920
and evil speaking be put away
from you with all malice.

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,215
And be kind to one another,

7
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:08,052
tenderhearted,
forgiving one another."

8
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:14,892
Do you want me to keep going
with this, or something else?

9
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:25,903
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.

10
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:31,617
Doug, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

11
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,095
You said that she was
just staying for a few nights.

12
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,889
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.

13
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:57,935
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.

14
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:59,436
What's her name?

15
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,188
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?

16
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,107
You don't have anything
to worry about.

17
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:05,901
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.

18
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:08,362
There's a sleepover with some
of the kids from the day care.

19
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,991
Does she know about me?

20
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,742
No, I haven't told her anything.

21
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:16,829
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,

22
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,165
- and you've taken advantage...
- I'm not kicking her out.

23
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:26,964
- I could have said nothing,
but I told you. - I have to go.

24
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,510
She better be gone
by the next time we talk.

25
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,287
- Sir.
- What took you so long?

26
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:59,872
I can have a briefing ready
in five minutes.

27
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,373
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.

28
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:02,875
He doesn't have
security clearance.

29
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,711
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.

30
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,755
I'll see you in my office.

31
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:14,261
<i>Japanese sovereignty
is a matter of precedent.</i>

32
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,555
Mr. Prime Minister,
my concern is escalation.

33
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:19,475
<i>Well, I'm asking for a small
portion of the 7th Fleet.</i>

34
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,310
<i>We must bring China into line.</i>

35
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,438
<i>Show them that the US and Japan
maintain a strong alliance.</i>

36
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,690
Have you reached out
directly to Beijing?

37
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,944
<i>No recognition that
the island belongs to Japan.</i>

38
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,154
Well, I'd like to speak to my
team and formulate a plan.

39
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:34,782
<i>- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.</i>

40
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,575
Admiral,
for those catching up...

41
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:40,913
Two Chinese destroyers
entered waters

42
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:44,375
within three miles
of Yonaguni Island here,

43
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:49,004
approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.

44
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:51,298
This is different than the standoff
over the Senkaku Islands.

45
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,050
It could have to do
with shipping routes.

46
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,219
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids,

47
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,763
so they're picking
on the little one.

48
00:03:57,763 --> 00:03:59,348
- Do you see that?
- What?

49
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:01,517
In the alley, camera two.

50
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:05,813
All posts, white male,
hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.

51
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,065
Southeast side of Fair St.

52
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,930
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag

53
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,016
and place your hands
on your head.

54
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:44,852
Stay right where you are.

55
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:54,653
Mrs. Underwood? Will you
come downstairs, please?

56
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:58,449
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House,

57
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,117
there was an emergency meeting.

58
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,870
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.

59
00:05:05,456 --> 00:06:39,300
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

60
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:43,345
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?

61
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:46,682
Ninety miles north. We could have
ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.

62
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:50,311
But even sending them in that direction will
be picked up by the Chinese satellites.

63
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,813
Well, we have to stand with our allies,
that can't be in question.

64
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,441
What if we don't send ships,
just make a strong statement

65
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,985
condemning their excursion
into Japan's territorial waters.

66
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,071
We still have to offer the Chinese
an incentive to call back their destroyers.

67
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:04,450
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like
to have contingency plans in place.

68
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,995
- Already drafting them, sir. - Cathy, open
up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.

69
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:11,874
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't
have one, let's create a list of options.

70
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:16,212
- Right away, sir. - How about coordination
with the Japanese navy?

71
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:19,215
Go. Don't engage
with our navy yet.

72
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:23,552
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister
Oshiro and express our intentions.

73
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:32,353
Former marine. He showed up at the outer
perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.

74
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:34,313
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.

75
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,565
We apprehended him,
the press isn't aware.

76
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,859
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible

77
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,237
for sending the package
of white powder to the capitol.

78
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:44,114
So this time he really wanted
to take me out for real.

79
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:49,703
Not exactly. His wife got an abortion last
week without telling him.

80
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,791
- Oh, my God. It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.

81
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,918
We'd like to keep you
down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,

82
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,171
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.

83
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:00,923
No, you have to get back
to the White House.

84
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,634
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine. Honestly.

85
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:05,886
I'm just gonna be in here.

86
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:10,266
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.

87
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,434
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on...

88
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:17,439
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir. As long as necessary.

89
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:23,946
I'll be back as soon as I can.

90
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,323
It's OK.

91
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,880
Don't go to California.

92
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,633
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.

93
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,596
You're gonna win.

94
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:52,433
Not if I don't give
the voters more face time.

95
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,988
When did you get it?

96
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,829
- The Army?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,874
It's grown since then.

98
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,544
Tell me about it.

99
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,464
No.

100
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,383
Why not?

101
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,636
I don't want to.

102
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,815
What are you doing?

103
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:45,110
Tell me about the tattoo.

104
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:52,827
- That's not fair.
- So what?

105
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:56,038
You think you can just get me
wet and I'll spill everything?

106
00:09:56,038 --> 00:10:00,751
- I don't think so...
- Mm...

107
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,839
...I know so.

108
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,062
Tell me.

109
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,233
I like the pain.

110
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:31,407
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.

111
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:34,660
How bad did it hurt?

112
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,539
It hurt a lot.

113
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,086
You like when it hurts?

114
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,051
I killed a lot of people.

115
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:56,932
What?

116
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,227
In the Army.

117
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,941
The pain...

118
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,360
...it helped.

119
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,703
Finish.

120
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,756
The most I could find
was some wrangling with the EPA

121
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,884
when he opened his first plant,
but that was almost 40 years ago.

122
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:35,596
- We need more. I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.

123
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,973
If you haven't found anything now,
what makes you think you will?

124
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:41,185
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.

125
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:44,563
You think Tusk isn't planning
his next attack even as we speak?

126
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:48,150
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.

127
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,194
You want to shift tactics?

128
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,657
The casino. We go public
as soon as possible.

129
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:56,408
You said that was a last resort.

130
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,285
Seth, you need to find a way
to make that happen

131
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,037
so it doesn't link to us.

132
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,915
If we launch that missile,
it could blow us up too.

133
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,458
Not if we spin it right.

134
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,168
- If we keep the focus on...
- Seth.

135
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:08,045
You're here to listen,
not contribute.

136
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:10,714
I wouldn't have him here if I
didn't want him to contribute.

137
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:14,718
Sir... he's been sitting
with this for three hours.

138
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,637
I've been working on it
for three months.

139
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:17,888
And accomplished nothing.

140
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,431
It's time we go on the
offensive.

141
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:21,642
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.

142
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:24,645
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?

143
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:28,107
She never mentioned a casino,
but now that I know what the dots are,

144
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:30,776
I can see that she's
starting to connect them.

145
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:33,988
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.

146
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:38,534
I imagine they're
waiting on the White House.

147
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:42,746
I hear there have been regular meetings
in the Situation Room since last night.

148
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:52,089
Let me call you right back.

149
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:18,282
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.</i>

150
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:20,284
<i>- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.</i>

151
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:23,037
<i>- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.</i>

152
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:27,750
<i>- Tell me. - "Pursue currency" would be
the most literal translation.</i>

153
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,127
<i>Or "pursue money."</i>

154
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:33,047
<i>- Follow the money?
- That could work.</i>

155
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,715
Thanks, Lynne.

156
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,902
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?

157
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,905
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.

158
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,242
You get so used to a place,
the smallest things stand out.

159
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:03,410
I apologize for not
being responsive sooner.

160
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,746
I've been focused
on the midterms.

161
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:09,041
Oh, there's no need to explain.

162
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:13,879
Mrs. Underwood, you know how
much I respect your intentions,

163
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,675
but I've thought
deeply about this and

164
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:21,220
I can't cosponsor the bill
in its current form.

165
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,722
Civilian oversight
is too extreme a step,

166
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:28,102
but I'd be happy to revisit some
of the other less extreme proposals.

167
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:30,980
You think we're being extremist?

168
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,816
I want to help with this issue,
but this bill goes through...

169
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:37,987
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.

170
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:41,240
Almost every woman in the
House supports this bill.

171
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,287
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.

172
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:49,081
I didn't lie. I didn't lie.

173
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:53,210
I... I want to help. As long as
we rethink some of the language.

174
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,505
Are you trying to distance yourself
from us because of the Galloway scandal?

175
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:59,049
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances

176
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:02,011
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.

177
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:05,389
It's because I honestly don't
believe in this approach.

178
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:09,393
Do you realize
the message this sends?

179
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:14,398
The only woman in congressional leadership
in both parties, and you bow out?

180
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:20,112
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't
just bow out. I'll actively fight it.

181
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:23,699
You never asked my position.
You assumed.

182
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,327
I can't imagine
what that position must be.

183
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:29,955
I've served in war zones,
I know firsthand how important...

184
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:32,208
We're not talking
about war zones.

185
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,210
We're talking
about sexual assault.

186
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,380
How about a military commission
to review the internal...

187
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,968
We don't need more studies,
we need reform.

188
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:48,140
Well, let's continue this conversation
when I return from California.

189
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,269
I'll be back the day
after tomorrow if you change your mind.

190
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:56,982
I won't, but I hope
you change yours.

191
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:06,367
China was insulted at the notion that
we could buy them off.

192
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,536
Do I need
to call President Qian?

193
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,746
I doubt he would contradict
one of his ministers.

194
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:12,623
See if he's willing
to talk one-on-one.

195
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:15,167
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing

196
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:18,712
to deploy three destroyers
and a light cruiser.

197
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,465
They're upping the ante.

198
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:24,135
Have Ambassador Hines
get in touch with the prime minister,

199
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:27,221
and ask if Japan will
hold off until I make contact with Beijing.

200
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,181
Yes, sir.

201
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,433
Have you gotten any rest at all?

202
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:35,396
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.

203
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,441
How's Claire?

204
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:43,571
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated
attempt, but they're being cautious.

205
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,449
After the Galloway thing
and the interview,

206
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:49,535
half the country thinks
she's a baby killer,

207
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:51,495
or an adulterer, or both.

208
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,790
But Claire's taking it in
stride. We're in good hands.

209
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,335
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.

210
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:01,630
One of us should, probably
the one that's calling all the shots.

211
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,175
No, I can hold out
a little while longer.

212
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:06,051
No, go to the residence,
spend some time with your wife.

213
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:07,970
You'll come back feeling
like a new man.

214
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,641
Honestly, it's less
stressful here.

215
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:19,315
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.

216
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:24,612
- I got rid of Christina
when Linda resigned. - I heard.

217
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:27,865
It's improved things some,
but...

218
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:30,618
...there's
still work to do.

219
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:33,579
Makes me tired
just to think about it.

220
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:36,999
Well, you probably wouldn't be the
first president to get a little shut-eye

221
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,876
on one of these sofas.

222
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,962
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.

223
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:44,173
Do the free world a favor
and get some rest.

224
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:46,717
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.

225
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:49,887
You should be nearby if President Qian
wants to get on the phone.

226
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,109
I've always loathed
the necessity of sleep.

227
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:08,489
Like death, it puts the most
powerful men on their backs.

228
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:15,996
<i>DC Limo and Bus Rental.</i>

229
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,541
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

230
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,626
We've got a corporate account.

<i>Let's see...
I'm sorry,</i>

232

<i>we don't have one
in our records.</i>

233
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,381
My mistake.
I must've called

234
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:27,842
the wrong limo service.
Thank you.

235
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,142
<i>Missouri Bus and Limo.</i>

236
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:38,352
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

237
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:42,231
<i>- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.</i>

238
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:44,692
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.

<i>How can I help you, Pam?</i>

240
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,946
We've got a flight
coming in from China tomorrow.

241
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:50,906
We'll need some transportation.

242
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,994
<i>How many you got coming?</i>

243
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:56,537
I don't have the manifest

244

<i>- The usual?
- That's right.</i>

245
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:01,500
<i>- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?</i>

246
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,503
<i>Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.</i>

247
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:06,130
That's great, thanks.

248
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,549
Do you think
it's really her conscience,

249
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,260
or because the
bill's controversial?

250
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,887
I don't think she would have
threatened to fight us

251
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,890
if all she wanted to do
was avoid controversy.

252
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,975
I'll talk to her.

253
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:20,603
I really want this bill to pass.

254
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:23,772
I know you do, so do I.

255
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,358
We need Jackie more
than ever, Francis.

256
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,821
I'm damaged goods,
this whole Adam thing.

257
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:33,532
No, you're not.
We fought past that.

258
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:36,952
Well, there's plenty of people
who still believe it's true.

259
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:40,122
We'll get it passed, I promise.

260
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:47,254
- No, thanks.
- Come on. It's no fun doing it alone.

261
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,135
We could just go for a run.

262
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,555
No more runs until the death
threats die down, that's the new rule.

263
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,349
But they let you go
to the office.

264
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:00,601
Because I was
in a bulletproof car.

265
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,606
Does this mean
we've officially not quit?

266
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,067
We've never been quitters,
have we?

267
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,113
Sir, Mrs. Underwood,
sorry to interrupt.

268
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:16,951
I was gonna head home,
but I'll stick around if you want me to.

269
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,620
Oh, no. You've been up long
enough. Get some sleep.

270
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,039
I'll be back first
thing in the morning.

271
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,916
Thank you for looking
after me today.

272
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:28,212
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.

273
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,802
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.

274
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,221
It's rare to find
someone like Edward.

275
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:43,352
- What?
- You never use his first name.

276
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:46,355
Oh, did I?

277
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:51,944
I don't feel right
talking about her like this.

278
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:55,531
It's just... technically,
she's my boss now.

279
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:58,951
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.

280
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:02,496
Which means it's coming directly
from the vice president.

281
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:12,006
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton
around from time to time.

282
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:14,800
Do you know what he and the
congresswoman were discussing?

283
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,386
No, they were private meetings.

284
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:21,390
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.

285
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,769
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.

286
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:28,022
Most of the time
pretty late at night.

287
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,735
Did the money
originate in China?

288
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:35,112
<i>The money came
from tribal revenue.</i>

289
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:37,990
<i>As our FEC reports
clearly stated.</i>

290
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,909
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue

291
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:42,786
come from Chinese visitors
who gambled at your casino?

292
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:44,997
<i>We have visitors
from all over the world.</i>

293
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:48,751
I'm speaking specifically about
a businessman named Xander Feng.

294
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:52,087
I have no idea who that is.

295
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:53,798
<i>I'm looking at FAA
flight records that show</i>

296
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:55,925
<i>a private plane he owns
making numerous trips</i>

297
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:59,220
<i>to Kansas City. And I spoke
with Missouri Bus and Limo,</i>

298
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,056
which has transported Chinese
visitors to your casino.

299
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,933
<i>- Ms. Said...
- Sayyad.</i>

300
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,519
<i>Ms. Sayyad, the only reason
I returned your call</i>

301
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,729
<i>was because you work
for The Telegraph.</i>

302
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:12,066
<i>It's not every day that I get a call
from a paper as big as yours.</i>

303
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:14,902
But I don't know what you're trying
to get at here, so if you'll excuse...

304
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,529
What about Raymond Tusk?

305
00:22:18,322 --> 00:22:20,950
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.

306
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,494
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.

307
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:26,705
<i>That looks like foreign money
being used to influence political...</i>

308
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:29,542
What you're insinuating
is not only wrong,

309
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,753
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.

310
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:35,631
I won't bat an eyelash
getting my attorneys involved.

311
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:38,217
<i>Tusk made the same threat.</i>

312
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:40,678
<i>If a man worth 40 billion
dollars doesn't intimidate me,</i>

313
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:42,388
<i>you certainly don't,
Mr. Lana...</i>

314
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:49,812
Hello?
He hung up.

315
00:22:49,812 --> 00:22:52,314
<i>I had nothing
to do with it, Raymond.</i>

316
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:54,942
I can smell the horseshit
through the phone.

317
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:57,528
<i>You think I'd put
myself at this great a risk?</i>

318
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,822
Desperate men
are capable of anything.

319
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:03,576
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.

320
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,786
I have no control
over the press, Raymond.

321
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:08,038
<i>You'll destroy
yourself, Frank, not me.</i>

322
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,374
Thank you for that
unsolicited advice.

323
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,752
Work with Doyle,
make sure we have no weak spots.

324
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:15,921
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?

325
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:21,135
Well, it looks like Jackie may
be sleeping with the enemy.

326
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:25,598
Lanagin is correct in saying
we run the risk of libel.

327
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:27,349
These links
are supported by fact.

328
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:29,268
Individually, but you can't
complete the circle.

329
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:30,728
I'm not saying the
headline should read:

330
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:33,481
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!

331
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:36,442
Just that we present the
landscape as we currently know it.

332
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:38,068
We're first and foremost
a financial paper.

333
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:40,112
Many of our readers
worship Raymond Tusk.

334
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:41,655
So we just protect him?

335
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:44,033
We don't insinuate
connections we can't back up.

336
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:47,119
If there's any basis for litigation, you
can be sure his team will be aggressive.

337
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,330
They've bankrupted
papers before.

338
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,625
I think you should slow down and take
your time. When, and if, you have a story...

339
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,169
Mr. Maxfield,
Raymond Tusk is on the line.

340
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,297
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.

341
00:23:58,297 --> 00:24:00,174
He's specifically
asking for you, sir.

342
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:02,468
We got off the phone
with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.

343
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,887
That means Tusk was the
first call Lanagin made.

344
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:07,681
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?

345
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,600
They're not talking to anyone
until after the president

346
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,352
does his press briefing
tomorrow.

347
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:13,187
All right, walk me through

348
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:15,314
all of this again,
point by point.

349
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:11,954
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.

350
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,749
No. What is it?

351
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:26,343
I'd like to put in a request to
be on your wife's detail full time.

352
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:28,429
At least until the death threats
quiet down.

353
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:30,973
That's very thoughtful.

354
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:32,766
I'll only do it if you approve,
sir.

355
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,685
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.

356
00:25:34,685 --> 00:25:37,813
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.

357
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:39,857
I'll let Agent Rockland know.

358
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,694
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.

359
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:45,404
You didn't interrupt anything.

360
00:25:45,404 --> 00:25:48,073
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.

361
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:55,122
- Hey.
- Hey.

362
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,291
You'll never believe
what just happened.

363
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,419
- What?
- Meechum came into the office

364
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,923
and found me
watching something...

365
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:09,762
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!

366
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:13,557
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.

367
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:17,561
- Were you...?
- No, no. I was just watching.

368
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:20,481
That's really funny.

369
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,525
What about you?
What are you watching?

370
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:26,111
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.

371
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:27,655
I forgot about that.

372
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,698
So did I, until I found it
in the desk this morning.

373
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,534
Let me see.

374
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:33,536
<i>...been there, like I have.</i>

375
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:36,038
<i>Of course, it doesn't hurt to
have a little Texas in them...</i>

376
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:38,958
My God, look how young we are.

377
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,709
I know.

378
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,586
<i>Everyone here has been
so kind, and so welcoming.</i>

379
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,964
<i>We'll have her rooting
for Clemson before too long.</i>

380
00:26:44,964 --> 00:26:47,758
<i>That's where
I have to draw the line.</i>

381
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:54,306
Do you miss being with Adam?

382
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:56,267
Where did that come from?

383
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:01,105
Miss it? No.

384
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:04,066
Well, you must, sometimes.

385
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:10,072
He meant a lot
to me for a while.

386
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:12,533
But that's done now.

387
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:16,078
What about you?

388
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,330
What about me?

389
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,418
Are you unsatisfied?

390
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:27,298
There's just
too much at stake now.

391
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:29,633
No one we can trust.

392
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,428
We don't have
the freedom we once did.

393
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:39,727
Maybe it's better this way.

394
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,605
No room for distractions.

395
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:46,650
I don't mind the sacrifice.

396
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,486
We chose this instead.

397
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,404
<i>I think the one thing
we can agree on</i>

398
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,490
<i>is the ribs here are better.</i>

399
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,450
<i>See, he's just trying
to get under my skin.</i>

400
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,869
<i>No, it's not even debatable...</i>

401
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:07,213
- How was California?
- Oh...

402
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:11,717
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.

403
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:15,387
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.

404
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:20,100
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.

405
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,436
Took 85 years to complete it.

406
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:26,232
- How long did it take to
complete the bridge? - About four years.

407
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:29,693
It opened a few months
after FDR's second inaugural.

408
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:31,987
There was a man
who got things done.

409
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:34,573
Strong beliefs
and he stuck to them.

410
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:36,617
But compromised when he had to.

411
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,996
I assume you're here
to talk about Claire's bill.

412
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,290
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen

413
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,459
cosponsors on either
side of the aisle.

414
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,795
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.

415
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:51,882
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking,

416
00:28:51,882 --> 00:28:53,801
but I doubt I'll convince you
anymore...

417
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,762
Putting aside the military's
honor, chain of command,

418
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:58,681
all the things
that you hold dear...

419
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:03,769
...let's consider
one simple fact.

420
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:07,148
You wouldn't have this office
if it weren't for me.

421
00:29:07,148 --> 00:29:11,986
I made very clear
that I wouldn't be a puppet.

422
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:16,407
I'm not trying to pull strings,
but you could show a little gratitude.

423
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:21,203
If it were anything else,
Mr. Vice President... but not this.

424
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:24,290
All you're doing is making
the inevitable more difficult.

425
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,959
It's not inevitable. Claire
doesn't have the votes yet.

426
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:30,796
You really want
to fight us on this.

427
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:32,840
I don't want
to fight you at all.

428
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,925
Which is why I suggested to
Claire that we sit down...

429
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:38,220
I neither have the time
nor the inclination to negotiate with you!

430
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,475
Cosponsor the bill, whip
the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.

431
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:45,269
Then I'm no longer listening.

432
00:29:48,564 --> 00:29:51,525
You don't have just this office
to thank me for.

433
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:54,862
If you win reelection,
you can thank me for that, too.

434
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:57,656
Those attack ads didn't just
disappear on their own.

435
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,743
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.

436
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:03,370
And ask him about Raymond Tusk
while you're at it.

437
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,207
That ought to make for some very
interesting pillow talk.

438
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:23,474
You keep up the good work,
Nancy.

439
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:26,185
I will, Mr. Vice President.

440
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:29,188
I miss having you around,
but you're my eyes and ears now,

441
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:31,232
otherwise I'd steal
you back in a heartbeat.

442
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:35,027
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.

443
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:43,786
- Doug?
- I'm busy.

444
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,457
The story just broke.

445
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:55,548
They timed it with
the president's press conference.

446
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:57,925
Connect me with
the vice president.

447
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:01,053
<i>So the 7th Fleet is
currently positioned near Guam,</i>

448
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:05,724
<i>where it will remain if China removes
its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.</i>

449
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:08,477
<i>I've been in frequent touch
with prime minister Oshiro,</i>

450
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:11,230
<i>and have made personal
overtures to President Qian.</i>

451
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,483
<i>And I remain optimistic
that tensions will be quelled</i>

452
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:17,903
<i>without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.</i>

453
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,030
<i>- Henry, you first.
- Can you comment</i>

454
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,074
<i>on the Wall Street Telegraph
article...</i>

455
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:25,452
<i>I was just notified of that
moments before I joined you.</i>

456
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:27,204
<i>I haven't had a chance to read
it yet. Yeah, Jane.</i>

457
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:28,998
<i>Mr. President, would
you walk us through</i>

458
00:31:28,998 --> 00:31:30,875
<i>your history with Raymond Tusk?</i>

459
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:34,336
<i>I'm here to answer questions on
Sino-Japanese relations. Mark.</i>

460
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:38,132
<i>The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy
and influential Chinese business...</i>

461
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:40,092
<i>Unless this has to do with the
statement I just made...</i>

462
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:42,094
<i>It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties</i>

463
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:43,929
<i>to the standing committee
and we're currently in a</i>

464
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:45,764
<i>standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...</i>

465
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:47,433
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

466
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:52,021
It's not beginning the story
that I fear,

467
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:53,814
it's not knowing
how it will end.

468
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:57,902
Everyone is fair game now,
including me.

469
00:31:57,902 --> 00:32:01,447
<i>This is par for the course, what we've
come to expect from President Walker.</i>

470
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,742
<i>Whenever he's selling a shiny
new car, he can't say enough about it.</i>

471
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:07,495
<i>The engine breaks down,
the transmission gives out,</i>

472
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:10,706
<i>he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something,</i>

473
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:13,876
<i>our warranty is the Constitution of the
United States,</i>

474
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:16,962
<i>and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print</i>

475
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:19,340
<i>and start answering
our questions.</i>

476
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,260
<i>If any of this is true, we're
talking Congress, the White House,</i>

477
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,347
<i>both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"</i>

478
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:29,558
<i>but when it look like dirty money,
and it smells like dirty money,</i>

479
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:31,519
<i>somebody has probably got dirt
under their nails.</i>

480
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,813
<i>Look, there's no real proof
this money laundering is even...</i>

481
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:36,357
<i>The connections are troubling,
especially Underwood.</i>

482
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:39,652
<i>He was the House whip the entire time
Adohi were contributing to the Democrats,</i>

483
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:41,904
<i>and he's working side by side
with the president now.</i>

484
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:43,781
<i>The president. So this goes all
the way to the White House?</i>

485
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:46,033
<i>- It might.
- It's hypothetical. And by the way,</i>

486
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,868
<i>you've cherry-picked the facts
to make your case.</i>

487
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:50,121
<i>I'm not making a case.</i>

488
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,790
<i>PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.</i>

489
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,792
<i>I haven't answered
those questions,</i>

490
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:57,294
<i>but I think the American people
deserve answers. Don't you?</i>

491
00:32:57,294 --> 00:33:01,257
You can bet your bottom dollar
the attorney general is gonna investigate.

492
00:33:01,257 --> 00:33:04,844
- With the firestorm this is causing in
the media... - What's our course of action?

493
00:33:04,844 --> 00:33:07,972
As your counsel, I would encourage you
not to speak to the press

494
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:11,267
until we have more information.
As your average citizen,

495
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:13,561
the longer you wait,
the more suspicious it looks.

496
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,438
If there's been any irregularity,
I had nothing to do with it.

497
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:19,692
Your friendship with Tusk
implies guilt by association.

498
00:33:19,692 --> 00:33:21,443
Are we presuming guilt
before innocence?

499
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:24,029
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.

500
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:26,574
But public opinion
doesn't have a law degree.

501
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,326
Give us a few moments.

502
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:35,624
I have to advise you not to have
any conversation about this matter

503
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:38,419
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.

504
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:40,296
I'll be right outside.

505
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,177
Is this what you were keeping
from me?

506
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:48,679
We should follow
your counsel's advice

507
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,931
- and not...
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.

508
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,350
With Bill out of the room,
we open ourselves up to...

509
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:58,105
Damn it, Frank! I've been in the dark
too long on this. That ends now.

510
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,821
I don't know any details.

511
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:08,657
Feng told me if the Bridge
project got approved,

512
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:11,660
the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.

513
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,622
Jesus Christ, that connects
the White House directly to the money.

514
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:18,918
No, sir. You knew nothing,
you still know nothing.

515
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:21,670
If the DOJ finds any concrete
evidence of foreign money...

516
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,590
That's Raymond Tusk's head,
not yours. You've done nothing wrong.

517
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,675
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.

518
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:30,429
If the DOJ investigates,
it will only prove your innocence.

519
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,349
Nobody walks away from something
like this without bruises.

520
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:35,684
Well, bruises you can survive.

521
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:38,395
I just don't know how we can
avoid it at this point.

522
00:34:38,395 --> 00:34:40,940
Unless you want to accelerate
the process and get rid of it.

523
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,652
We could always have the attorney
general appoint a special prosecutor.

524
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:47,571
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.

525
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:50,783
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not
inclined to follow your suggestions.

526
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:53,202
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was
something you should do.

527
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:56,288
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.

528
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:58,916
I think it's better to drag these
things out as long as possible.

529
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:02,711
- Let the public fatigue on it. - And have it
hanging over our heads until the midterms?

530
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,297
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.

531
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:08,134
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical
drone strikes in the South China Sea.

532
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:10,469
I can't be dealing with
something like this for months on end.

533
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:13,347
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.

534
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,182
I didn't say that, you did.

535
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:17,476
Oh, no. I just meant in terms
of getting it off your plate.

536
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:19,687
It wouldn't be on my plate
if you kept me better informed.

537
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:22,439
I have done nothing but try
to insulate you, sir.

538
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:24,942
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy
I just went through?

539
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:29,947
I make this solemn promise
to you, Mr. President.

540
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:33,659
I will take the fall
if it comes to that, but it won't.

541
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:37,371
However you decide to deal with this,
I think your instincts are right.

542
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:40,666
We probably shouldn't
involve a special prosecutor.

543
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:46,380
Send Bill back in.

544
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,469
You knew about this.

545
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,264
Tusk is a client,
doesn't mean I know everything...

546
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:59,101
Bullshit. The reason you're
a partner at Glendon Hill

547
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,353
is because you know the
things nobody else does.

548
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:04,773
What do you want me to say?

549
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:08,027
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.

550
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:11,071
We're not in bed,
we're in my fucking office.

551
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,073
And in here, you work for Frank.

552
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:15,951
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.

553
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:21,624
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods
for whoever can pay the highest retainer.

554
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:24,960
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs,
I'm fully aware and willing,

555
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,756
but you're worse. You're Frank's bitch
and refuse to believe it.

556
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,967
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.

557
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:34,845
Don't turn this. You knew about
the money and you didn't tell me.

558
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:37,389
Even though it's thrown
my seat into contention.

559
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:40,935
Let's say there was money,
and let's say I did know,

560
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:45,064
- what good would it have done? - It means
you were willing to watch me lose!

561
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:47,233
It means I respected the
boundaries that you demanded.

562
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:50,611
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!

563
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:54,615
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!

564
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:56,742
You can't have it both ways.

565
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,247
Were you...?

566
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:03,457
Was I what?

567
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,128
...fucking me
to get info on Frank?

568
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,807
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.

569
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:23,978
I care about
you more than I should.

570
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:25,980
But I'm getting tired
of having to say it.

571
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:32,486
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric
facility for assessment.

572
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:36,198
Then a high security detention center
until the official sentencing.

573
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:38,492
Well, that's good to hear.

574
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:41,787
The bad news is we don't want
you doing any public events for a while.

575
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:45,458
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.

576
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:50,045
Your death threats continue to
rise. We can't take the risk.

577
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:53,674
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.

578
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:55,634
But we want you
to avoid large crowds.

579
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:59,263
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.

580
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:02,141
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood

581
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:04,310
on her new security protocol.

582
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,313
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.

583
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,486
How did it go?

584
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:17,031
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?

585
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:20,785
No. It could look like
I was trying to go behind his back.

586
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:23,537
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.

587
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:25,289
Hopefully,
he'll disagree with it.

588
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,459
But this could've
been the wrong move.

589
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:30,669
Well, don't doubt yourself.

590
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:33,088
Seth has gotten over 3,000
e-mails in the last six hours.

591
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:36,592
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?

592
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:39,261
I can't ignore
the Department of Justice.

593
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:40,930
What can I do?

594
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:44,225
Come and visit me
when I'm in prison.

595
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:01,826
You don't have
to stand by that door.

596
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:11,043
Take a load off.

597
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,546
Thank you, sir, but I'm
supposed to stay on my feet.

598
00:39:13,546 --> 00:39:15,965
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

599
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:20,177
And if anybody gives you
any trouble about this,

600
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:24,014
or anything,
they can talk to me.

601
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:31,564
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.

602
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,528
It's been strange not having
you around these last few days.

603
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:39,488
You want me to switch back
to your detail?

604
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:41,615
No, no. I'm glad
you're with Claire.

605
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,702
I just...

606
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:49,123
...didn't realize how much I got used
to your company until you were gone.

607
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:52,460
Protecting her is the same
as protecting you, in my mind.

608
00:39:57,465 --> 00:39:58,799
Oh, come on.

609
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:17,818
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?

610
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:21,113
I've always been awestruck,

611
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:25,242
people who are willing
to take a bullet for someone else.

612
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:29,622
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways
to serve your country.

613
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:32,583
And this is my way.

614
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:39,256
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.

615
00:40:40,382 --> 00:40:42,384
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.

616
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:44,470
It's not for you either.

617
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,931
Well, come on over
and join the party.

618
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:54,438
Haven't you got sick
of seeing my face yet?

619
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:56,232
Never, ma'am.

620
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:04,156
To Meechum,
for his loyalty and service.

621
00:41:04,156 --> 00:41:05,866
To Edward.

622
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm on my way
to my lawyer's office, Remy.

623
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,255
That's not where I want to be
when I'd usually be in bed.

624
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:22,675
I can't stop Frank
from leaking things.

625
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:26,929
No, but you can make sure
he suffers more than us.

626
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:32,643
And I say "us," Remy, because
your skin is in this game now, too.

627
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:35,688
<i>- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.</i>

628
00:41:35,688 --> 00:41:38,232
Every step of this was legal.

629
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:40,609
They can't prove
the links between them.

630
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:45,197
<i>- What about Lanagin? - He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.</i>

631
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,783
I'll find a way
to get in touch with him.

632
00:41:47,783 --> 00:41:50,411
<i>We do have one major advantage.</i>

633
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:54,832
The public can hate me,
but as long as Clayton West

634
00:41:54,832 --> 00:41:57,751
remains profitable, my
stockholders won't care.

635
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:00,838
Frank doesn't
have the same liberty.

636
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,926
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.

637
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,845
I can work with
the Republicans on that.

638
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:09,930
<i>Well, we'll be under the
magnifying glass too.</i>

639
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,557
<i>This will be a witch hunt.</i>

640
00:42:11,557 --> 00:42:13,517
I'll make sure that they pick
the right targets.

641
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,521
What you need to do
is go after the leadership.

642
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:22,359
Make them hurt. They'll turn on
Frank to save themselves.

643
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:25,029
<i>Birch, Womack, Sharp.</i>

644
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:29,325
<i>Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.</i>

645
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:36,290
- Remy?
- I heard you. I got my marching orders.

646
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,418
<i>- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.</i>

647
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:42,254
<i>Let's talk in the morning.</i>

648
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:45,174
The two names I like the most
are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.

649
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:46,717
Gaines has better credentials.

650
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:48,469
But he's close
to the administration.

651
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,720
I would've made him
a federal judge

652
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,388
if the GOP hadn't blocked it.

653
00:42:51,388 --> 00:42:53,224
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.

654
00:42:53,224 --> 00:42:55,351
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?

655
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:58,229
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general

656
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:00,189
would've put her on his list
if he thought she was a wild card.

657
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:03,776
Sir, I have to say,
I think this step is premature.

658
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:06,737
We should hold off and see what
the DOJ does on its own.

659
00:43:06,737 --> 00:43:09,240
I don't want to do it,
Bill, but my fear is this:

660
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,575
if we wait until the water
goes from hot to boiling,

661
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:13,244
we seem reactionary,
not proactive.

662
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:15,996
But proactive could
also seem defensive.

663
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:19,250
Like the suspect that screams
"I didn't do it" before anyone asks.

664
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,378
Aside from that, we simply
haven't had time to prepare.

665
00:43:22,378 --> 00:43:24,839
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.

666
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,799
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.

667
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:28,634
- Sir...
- I've made my decision.

668
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:32,179
Bill, I'd like you to convey my
wishes to the attorney general.

669
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:35,516
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.

670
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:37,810
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.

671
00:43:40,646 --> 00:43:44,567
The only thing more satisfying
than convincing someone to do what I want,

672
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:46,986
is failing to persuade them
on purpose.

673
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:51,532
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign,
it just begs you to walk through the door.

674
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:53,742
Doyle's about halfway
through our initial background check.

675
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:55,828
Every donor,
every political event.

676
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:57,371
Everything that Dunbar
might be looking into.

677
00:43:57,371 --> 00:44:00,624
- Good. Seth?
- We avoid any official statement,

678
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:02,460
follow the president's cue.

679
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,795
In the meantime, I'd like to
make some off the record calls.

680
00:44:04,795 --> 00:44:07,339
You welcome the investigation,
it's the right step, et cetera.

681
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:08,924
Give folks the personal touch.

682
00:44:08,924 --> 00:44:11,093
That's fine, as long
as we don't come off defensive.

683
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:12,720
I'd like to see a list
of who you'd be calling.

684
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,472
Some of this is gonna be
on the fly,

685
00:44:14,472 --> 00:44:16,348
it'd be great
if I had a little leeway.

686
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:17,975
Let Seth do his thing, you'll
have your hands full with Doyle.

687
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:19,226
I'll let you know
who I've called.

688
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:20,769
All right, let's get to work.

689
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:30,196
Sir?

690
00:44:31,363 --> 00:44:33,866
Yes, what is it?

691
00:44:33,866 --> 00:44:35,826
I understand that
you need to delegate,

692
00:44:35,826 --> 00:44:37,411
but when you contradict me
in front of Seth,

693
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,996
it compromises
my authority over him.

694
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:40,998
You can't micromanage,
we have too much to do.

695
00:44:40,998 --> 00:44:43,501
Seth is still new to the team.

696
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:45,711
I need to make sure that
he's doing his job properly.

697
00:44:45,711 --> 00:44:50,049
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.

698
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:52,134
But I can't be that
if you won't let me.

699
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:00,601
Are you, Doug?

700
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:05,272
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?

701
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:08,025
We're flying full throttle
into a hurricane,

702
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:09,985
and you're talking
office politics

703
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:13,948
instead of focusing on making
sure we don't get ripped apart.

704
00:45:15,491 --> 00:45:17,952
You're right, sir.

705
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:19,787
I shouldn't have brought it up.

706
00:46:01,412 --> 00:46:04,665
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.

707
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:07,293
I told her I was
going for a walk.

708
00:46:07,293 --> 00:46:11,422
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted
her gone, but you have to understand...

709
00:46:11,422 --> 00:46:14,049
She can stay.

710
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:17,803
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.

711
00:46:19,096 --> 00:46:21,182
I trust you to be smart.

712
00:46:26,437 --> 00:46:27,688
Will you read to me?

713
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:33,819
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.

714
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:36,864
Just pull up something
on your phone.

715
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:46,373
<i>- Like what? - A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.</i>

716
00:46:58,302 --> 00:47:02,640
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,

717
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,518
it was the age of wisdom,

718
00:47:06,685 --> 00:47:09,313
it was the age of foolishness,

719
00:47:10,648 --> 00:47:12,233
it was the epoch of belief,

720
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:14,819
it was the epoch of incredulity,

721
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:16,570
it was the season of Light,

722
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,447
it was the season of Darkness,

723
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:20,032
it was the spring of hope,

724
00:47:20,032 --> 00:47:22,201
it was the winter of despair,

725
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:24,662
we had everything before us,

726
00:47:24,662 --> 00:47:27,456
we had nothing before us,

727
00:47:27,456 --> 00:47:29,500
we were all going
direct to Heaven,

728
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,752
we were all going
direct the other way."

729
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:40,094
Hello?

730
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:48,811
Doug, is that you?

731
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:53,774
Hello?

732
00:47:58,571 --> 00:47:59,780
Hello?

733
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:02,992
<i>Doug?</i>

734
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:08,914
Yes, Doug, it is you.
