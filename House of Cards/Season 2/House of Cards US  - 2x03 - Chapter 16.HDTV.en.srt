1
00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:03,981
Raising the age of retirement is
an unacceptable erosion

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:05,858
of the American dream.

3
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:09,111
If the Republicans fail to pass
a reasonable omnibus package

4
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:11,614
by demanding entitlement reform,

5
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:14,450
they will force the federal government
into a spending freeze.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,704
The frostbite will be
on their hands, not ours.

7
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:21,123
Do you think that's a bit much?
The frostbite bit?

8
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:24,251
It's the State of the Union.
We want to appeal to fly-over states.

9
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:27,088
- They'll like that line.
- I want something more forceful.

10
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:29,131
- "Blood on their hands"?
- No.

11
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:31,926
- "Throw us back into the ice age."
- Oh, I like that, Christina.

12
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:36,055
Let's try that. Linda.
Christina, you come up here too.

13
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:50,027
There are two types of vice presidents:
doormats and matadors.

14
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:53,823
Which do you think
I intend to be?

15
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,324
Raymond.

16
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:03,165
He's hung up on the domestic agenda.
Not a single word about China.

17
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:06,711
His instincts are right. If the government
shuts down one day after the speech,

18
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:09,964
not a single word in the speech matters.
We have to address the freeze now.

19
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:13,509
- China comes later.
- Both parties have been wrangling

20
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,928
over entitlements for months.
What makes you think

21
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:19,056
a miracle's gonna happen
in the next three days?

22
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:23,602
We give the Republicans
exactly what they want.

23
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:25,646
- Retirement age?
- Yes.

24
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:29,317
That's a line in
the sand we cannot cross.

25
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:32,611
We will cross it, eventually.
So why keep fighting it?

26
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:36,866
I can push this through the Senate,
and once I do, the president will announce

27
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:40,536
a major bipartisan agreement
in the State of the Union.

28
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:44,040
We avoid a government shutdown
and the White House gets credit.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,169
It's a huge risk, and if it fails,
a huge embarrassment.

30
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:51,756
The embarrassment will be
entirely my own. This is on my shoulders.

31
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:56,802
Even so, the president is
gonna require some serious persuasion.

32
00:01:56,802 --> 00:02:00,348
- I'm happy to talk to him.
- No.

33
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:04,018
No... I'll do it.

34
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:07,730
He'll be more amenable
if it comes from a friend.

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,566
You're right.
A trusted confidant.

36
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,985
Let me test the waters.

37
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:19,075
The Cult of Tusk.
one.

38
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:21,535
But that one disciple
just so happens to be

39
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:26,248
the most powerful man
in the free world. For now.

40
00:02:29,418 --> 00:04:04,347
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

41
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,392
Entitlements. Raising
the age of eligibility to 67.

42
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:09,894
Your people will
never go for it.

43
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:11,395
They will if the
leadership does,

44
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:12,938
and the leadership will.

45
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:14,940
They've fought us on this
since I was in diapers.

46
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,110
Assuming that I can get this past
my people and convince them,

47
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,280
- can you convince yours?
- It's a tough sell.

48
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,618
You're the Senate majority leader, Hector.
You don't have to sell, you can dictate.

49
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:27,912
- What do you want in return?
- A working government.

50
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:30,373
- We stave off the freeze.
- You won on education,

51
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:32,458
we confirmed you
as vice president.

52
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,127
- The Republicans need a win, Frank.
- And that's what I'm offering.

53
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:37,630
You get a win on entitlements,
we avoid a shutdown.

54
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,967
Everyone gets points
for bipartisanship.

55
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:44,053
- You know who I'm worried about?
- Curtis Haas.

56
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:47,306
- He's a troublemaker, Frank.
- Who controls a third of your caucus.

57
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:50,434
And he'll never go for this.
He wants to see the Democrats suffer.

58
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:54,438
Just bring him to the table.
That's all I'm asking.

59
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:05,199
Miss Gallagher?
My name is Lucas Goodwin,

60
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,243
<i>I'm a deputy editor
of the Washington Herald.</i>

61
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:09,078
- Mr. Goodwin, please.
- Just a few moments,

62
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:11,539
- that's all I'm asking.
- If I wanted to talk to you,

63
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,624
- I would've returned your calls.
- Did you read my e-mails?

64
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:15,376
Yes. Which is
why I didn't call.

65
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,877
Give me a chance
to walk you through it.

66
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:18,504
I have to get back
to the White House.

67
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,089
- Peter Russo was killed.
- Let go.

68
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,966
So was Zoe Barnes.
I was working with her.

69
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,759
- Stop and listen.
- Frank Underwood is the one who did this.

70
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,262
Listen! This is nuts.

71
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:29,140
- The DUI, the brachiums. All of it...
- This has to stop. OK?

72
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,475
Underwood talk to you?
Tell you not to speak with anybody?

73
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:32,601
- No.
- Doug Stamper?

74
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,061
Whatever you think happened,

75
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,022
whatever compelled you
to stalk me like this...

76
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:37,648
You're the only person
who might know something,

77
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:38,899
who could understand.

78
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,776
I've got no one else
I can talk...

79
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:44,113
I don't understand.
And I don't want to. OK?

80
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:46,615
- There's no story here.
- Please, five minutes.

81
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:48,451
Think about what you're doing.
Waiting outside...

82
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:51,078
Peter would be alive if it
wasn't for Frank Underwood.

83
00:05:52,997 --> 00:05:56,250
I've worked really hard
to put Peter behind me.

84
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,629
So if I see you again,
if I hear from you again,
I'll not only contact the police,

85
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,757
I'll let the vice president
know what you're saying,

86
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:05,843
and then you can deal
with the Secret Service, too.

87
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:09,180
It's the usual overseas chatter.

88
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,848
A bit of a bump in China,

89
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,142
but we chalk that up
to the trade tensions.

90
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:15,770
- Secret Service?
- Average number of death threats

91
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,480
to both POTUS and the VP.

92
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,940
We passed them along
to our dear friends at the FBI.

93
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,485
FBI?

94
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:24,236
The FBI confirms the level

95
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:27,239
of activity of our dear friends
at the Secret Service.

96
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:30,409
We've followed up on everything.
No high-level threats.

97
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,663
So nothing we need to report directly
to the president or vice president?

98
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:36,040
- No.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

99
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,796
The e-mail you sent,
has anyone else seen it?

100
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:44,048
Except for the agent
that alerted me, no.

101
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:46,676
Other agencies might
have stumbled upon this.

102
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,260
Even so, they
probably ignored it.

103
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,346
Any idea who's making the posts?

104
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:52,974
Deep Web forums. Almost impossible
to trace. Lone wolf, most likely.

105
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:57,144
- I want you to find him.
- We need a direct threat to life.

106
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:59,230
The vice president
just assumed office.

107
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,066
I can't have this conspiracy
stuff going mainstream.

108
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,319
- This sort of thing usually fizzles out.
- I can't take the chance.

109
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,780
I want you to find him
and put him away.

110
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,367
- He hasn't committed a crime.
- But he wants to.

111
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:14,453
- So help him.
- That requires manpower.

112
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:18,249
- You've got men.
- It exposes me, Doug.

113
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:22,044
I've always kept you informed
because you're an old pal and I trust you.

114
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:23,713
But...

115
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:28,134
We're talking
about an operation.

116
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:31,929
I'm an old pal who now works
at the White House.

117
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:36,267
Between old pals,

118
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:40,396
I've been stuck at the
executive liaison for way too long.

119
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:45,276
How worried are you that a mass
shooting could happen in a school

120
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:50,656
in your community? Great deal,
somewhat, not so much, not at all, unsure.

121
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,492
<i>You sound hot. Are you hot?</i>

122
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:57,246
<i>- Sir...
-  Somewhat hot, a great deal hot?</i>

123
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:40,831
<i>Lynchburg Children's,
Pediatric Division.</i>

124
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:43,584
Can I talk to Cheryl Posner?

125
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:46,087
<i>Sorry, she's on duty right now.</i>

126
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:49,632
<i>- It's her daughter.
-  Hold on one moment.</i>

127
00:08:58,432 --> 00:09:01,268
<i>Rachel? Rachel?</i>

128
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:04,605
<i>Sweetheart, are you there?
Please don't...</i>

129
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:12,446
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Jay, my name is Rachel</i>

130
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:15,491
and I'm calling on behalf
of the National Firearm Education Center.

131
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:18,577
Would you be able to speak with
me briefly regarding firearm legislation

132
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,705
and Second Amendment protection?

133
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:24,041
So you're Willa's top choice.

134
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,003
Why should you be my
husband's and my top choice?

135
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:30,464
Over the past ten years, the two
of you combined have gotten less coverage

136
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,717
than the average junior
congressman from Nebraska.

137
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:36,053
- Well, we don't seek the spotlight.
- I'm not suggesting you should.

138
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:41,017
But am I correct in assuming that your
husband will be an active vice president?

139
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:43,686
Well, it's harder to keep
an active VP out of the press than in it,

140
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:47,481
but it's possible if we give the media
just enough to keep them from starving.

141
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:51,944
- Where'd you grow up, Connor?
- Texas. Just like you.

142
00:09:51,944 --> 00:09:54,280
- Dallas?
- Lubbock.

143
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,325
I had a much thicker accent
to get rid of than y'all.

144
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,827
- How do you know I had one?
- Your first joint interview,

145
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:02,038
when your husband was running
for state Assembly in '86.

146
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:08,461
- That's on the Internet?
- No. No, I contacted the
local affiliate in Greenville.

147
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,379
They wouldn't send me
the tapes via mail,

148
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,173
so I went down there
and watched in their vault.

149
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,799
To South Carolina?

150
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,637
When I want a job,
I do my homework.

151
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:22,266
I look forward to seeing
what you come up with.

152
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,851
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.

153
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:28,856
Thursday.

154
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:43,579
I don't see how this
is a victory for us.

155
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:46,666
Our choices are the freeze,
which the Democrats get blamed for, or...

156
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,835
- Not necessarily, the Republi...
- Which we definitely get blamed for.

157
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:52,630
- Or we offer them...
- Entitlements, Frank?

158
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,465
We took a stand.
We can't turn back now.

159
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,258
I'd rather see the
government grind to a halt.

160
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,761
Think of the headline:
"Democratic Leadership

161
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,305
Enacts Entitlement Reform,
Staves Off Freeze."

162
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:03,975
We show unity.
We offer progress.

163
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:07,687
Let's convert some
lifelong conservatives.

164
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,357
You have Mendoza's assurance
he'll work with us?

165
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:15,194
- I do.
- I don't want to put our necks out there

166
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:17,029
just to have the
guillotine fall.

167
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,449
You won't. My neck will be right
out there with you.

168
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:25,746
Francis faints at the sight of blood.
He'd never let them break the skin.

169
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,456
To unity.

170
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:50,646
No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.

171
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,285
Larry, can you come by? Something weird's
going on with my computer. Thanks.

172
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:19,967
Come on!

173
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:29,310
- Hey, what's the problem?
- Nothing. It's fine. I fixed it.

174
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,188
- OK. Cool.
- Yeah.

175
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:53,209
- It's not as progressive as I'd like.
- You mean radical.

176
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,964
Raising retirement age to
67 makes entitlements solvent until 2055.

177
00:12:57,964 --> 00:13:03,469
And it saves us over a trillion dollars
without a single penny of taxpayer income.

178
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:05,554
Sixty-eight would give us
another 300 billion,

179
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:07,264
and I'd like to
eliminate early retirement.

180
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:08,933
- Entirely?
- Forget it.

181
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,186
What about... 68 and 64?

182
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:14,605
I have a responsibility
to my constituents.

183
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:17,191
- I promised I wouldn't waver...
- Are we really going to allow

184
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:19,402
the tea party to determine
fiscal legislation?

185
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:22,071
- Never been beholden to the tea party.
- Come on. You wouldn't have won

186
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,991
reelection if their PACs hadn't dumped
ten million into your campaign.

187
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:27,952
If their definition of budgetary
conservatism happens to overlap with mine,

188
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:31,122
- that's a function of...
- Curtis, let's show some goodwill.

189
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:34,417
- Can you stomach 68 and 64?
- Effective immediately?

190
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,711
- Five years from now.
- Not interested.

191
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:39,213
We can't throw this on people
without any warning.

192
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:42,883
- They need some time to digest.
- I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

193
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:48,389
OK, meet with your staff,
consult with your colleagues,

194
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,224
I'll consult with mine
and let's talk tomorrow.

195
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:54,145
- All right. I can agree to that.
- But this is a good first step.

196
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,449
How do we make sure Curtis
can't filibuster

197
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,743
- when we get the amendment passed?
- Assuming we do.

198
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:10,786
Between you and me,
I'm sure we can turn him around.

199
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:12,079
I just want to be
on the safe side.

200
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,081
Make sure the
passage of the amendment

201
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:17,001
- constitutes the passage of the bill.
- By previous agreement.

202
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:19,211
We pass the amendment,
then we're done. Wham-bam.

203
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:21,714
- Can we put that in writing?
- Have Erikson reach out to me.

204
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:23,341
"Muchas gracias."

205
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:48,783
Lucas Goodwin?

206
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:31,951
<i>Good evening, Lucas.</i>

207
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,708
<i>Speak into the microphone.</i>

208
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,627
<i>- Who are you?
-  Go to the home screen.</i>

209
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:44,880
<i>- Open the other app.
- Tell me who you are.</i>

210
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,801
<i>You've done your research.
You know who I am.</i>

211
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:51,137
Well, I know
who you claim to be.

212
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:55,224
<i>If you're not
convinced by now, goodbye.</i>

213
00:15:55,224 --> 00:16:00,438
Wait a minute. Uh...

214
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:03,858
<i>- All right, I'm on the home screen.
-  Open the notary app.</i>

215
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:08,321
What is this?

216
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:10,489
<i>To ensure you
aren't law enforcement.</i>

217
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:14,035
<i>- I'm not.
-  Then sign.</i>

218
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:18,414
<i>- How? - Hold your thumb to
the camera and press "capture."</i>

219
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,293
How do I know you're
not law enforcement?

220
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:25,129
<i>Sign the document or walk away.</i>

221
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:32,094
All right. I did it.

222
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:36,140
<i>- Press "send."
- Where is this going?</i>

223
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,271
<i>I'm VPNing through Iran and 12 other
countries, don't worry. It's secure.</i>

224
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:47,193
<i>Now, one last thing.</i>

225
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:52,073
<i>I need the two-step verification code
for the Herald's internal servers.</i>

226
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,661
- I don't even know
how to do that.

227
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:59,955
<i>-  Yes, you do. Check your
e-mail.</i>

228
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:09,507
<i>Destroy the iPad,
especially the serial number,</i>

229
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:13,010
<i>and delete the e-mail
after you've memorized it.</i>

230
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,929
<i>Good luck.</i>

231
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,437
<i>Hello?</i>

232
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:25,439
Raymond, are you there?

233
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:31,112
Yeah, uh, sorry, Frank, I...

234
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:32,863
I thought I saw an Inca dove.

235
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:35,074
<i>It must have flown
the wrong direction for winter.</i>

236
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:38,494
<i>- It sounds windy. Where are you?
-  Top of my building.</i>

237
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:41,664
<i>Got a bird feeder up here.</i>

238
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:45,001
Nice work with the president.
I hear we have a green light.

239
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:50,339
He pushed back in the beginning but, yeah,
his writers are reworking the speech now.

240
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,343
I'm very close to a deal.
Sixty-eight, 64 in five years.

241
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:58,264
- Spending cuts as discussed.
- That rock solid?

242
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:01,851
<i>- Soon as we shake hands.
- What's the holdup?</i>

243
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:05,062
Curtis Haas, which isn't a surprise.
I'm meeting with him soon.

244
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:08,232
<i>- He's the final hurdle.
-  Cutting it pretty close, Frank.</i>

245
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:10,943
Well, this is...
this is historic.

246
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:14,739
The Republicans have wanted
entitlement reform since Johnson.

247
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:17,908
Curtis will come around. In the meantime,
we should get the new retirement ages

248
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:22,288
<i>- into his speech.
- I would stay away from specifics.</i>

249
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:25,708
- I mean, even if it passes, the House...
- I know the House

250
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:30,254
better than you know birds. Believe me
when I say they'll pass the Senate version.

251
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:34,258
I'll talk to the president.

252
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:37,803
<i>- Just make sure this is airtight.
- Thank you. What is it?</i>

253
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:41,057
<i>- Lucas Goodwin.
- From the Herald?</i>

254
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:42,975
He must have been
working with Zoe.

255
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:45,645
- How much does he know?
- No more than she did.

256
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:48,147
- She knew enough.
- I'm on it, sir.

257
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,316
- Proof?
- Not yet.

258
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:54,278
- Jesus, Doug. - It's under control.
I thought you should be aware.

259
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:56,739
I'm juggling the president,
the Republicans, Tusk. I can't...

260
00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:02,119
And you should stay focused
on that. Goodwin's on my plate, not yours.

261
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,415
It wasn't until the 20th century

262
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:10,127
that the notion of noble objectivism
came into the forefront.

263
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:13,965
- But facts are facts.
- Nineteen ninety-two.

264
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:17,885
George Bush Sr. is shown asking how
a grocery scanner works,

265
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:22,848
and he gets nailed for it.
they were showing him a new model.

266
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:26,435
He was asking how the new one
was different than the old one.

267
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:29,188
Curiosity, not ignorance.

268
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:33,275
But the lack of context
told a more powerful narrative.

269
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:37,279
There is no arrangement of facts

270
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,532
that is purely objective.

271
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:42,034
We can finally do something.
We have the means to act.

272
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:43,953
Some teenage,
pimple-faced hacker...

273
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,788
This was a
sophisticated infiltration.

274
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:50,126
It's not the work of a child.
Look, here's the e-mail.

275
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:53,421
"Heronymous Bot." The FBI's
been hunting him for years.

276
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:55,339
- Listen to me...
- If we get these records,

277
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:57,758
I'll need your help tracking
timelines, piecing together...

278
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:00,845
No! You want somebody to hold
your hand and say it's OK to go on this

279
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:03,055
fucking goose chase.

280
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:06,183
You shouldn't be teaching in Ithaca.
You're better than that.

281
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,019
- You should be back...
- I belong here.

282
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,937
Droning on to a bunch
of hung over English majors?

283
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:11,897
- Exactly.
- You're wrong about the truth.

284
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:16,235
There is objective truth.
He killed her.

285
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:17,945
You know it's a fact.

286
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:21,657
Here's a fact: my mom has ten,
15 years left at best.

287
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:25,161
I've seen her more in the past
month than since I left for school.

288
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:30,791
It's simpler here. It's quiet.
I need that. She needs me.

289
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:42,053
I'm sorry, Lucas. I'm sorry
that night how I reacted.

290
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,846
I'm sorry you lost
your girlfriend.

291
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:47,850
I'm sorry the world
is this fucked up.

292
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,019
I really am.

293
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,229
But I can't help you.

294
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,364
Thank you.

295
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:10,831
- Where's everyone else?
- I did you a disservice yesterday.

296
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:13,584
We shouldn't have put you
on the spot in front of all the leadership.

297
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,586
Have a seat, Curtis.

298
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,678
We know that you have an obligation
to take a firm stance,

299
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:27,348
but entitlement reform
is something you ran on,

300
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:30,434
and now it's within your grasp.

301
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:33,771
So tell us your fears.

302
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,023
That the Democrats
get another win.

303
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:38,943
We suffer in the midterms and
the next Congress dismantles the agreement.

304
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:40,987
You think we're
being disingenuous.

305
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:43,531
My constituents
don't trust the administration.

306
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:46,075
I can't have them thinking the wool has
been pulled over our eyes.

307
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:49,620
As I suspected. Hector?

308
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,457
Frank and I propose this:
we include a super majority point of order

309
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:55,793
against revisiting
the issue for ten years.

310
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:59,088
You'll have it in black-and-white.
A serious, long-term commitment

311
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:00,631
with no opportunity
to dismantle.

312
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:03,175
That's on top of everything
else we asked for.

313
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:05,386
VA services and FEMA
stay at current levels.

314
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:08,889
Everything else at 80 to a hundred
percent of the cuts you propose.

315
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:13,436
You get your win, Curtis.
We just avoid disaster.

316
00:22:13,436 --> 00:22:16,772
Maybe the country needs
to see what disaster looks like.

317
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:21,068
The tea party is a strong voice,
and you're its bullhorn.

318
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:26,907
Show your people that voice can translate
into law, and not just add to the noise.

319
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:33,331
Fifteen years before
revisitation, not ten.

320
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:37,918
- OK. - And if the House fails to pass
the bill after we do,

321
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:41,088
you go on record blaming your
own party for the gridlock.

322
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:46,135
I believe we have a deal.

323
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:04,570
What are you listening to?

324
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,281
- Sorry. I'll turn it down.
- No, it's nice.

325
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:09,617
Can I listen?

326
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:12,203
My ears are clean, I promise.

327
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:16,499
OK.

328
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,334
Thanks.

329
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,468
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

330
00:23:27,468 --> 00:23:31,472
- It's so sad.
- It helps me relax.

331
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:35,434
Long day?

332
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:38,562
I work at a call center.
So yeah.

333
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:41,107
Two hundred strangers an hour.

334
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:44,193
I'll leave you alone. You probably
don't want to talk to another one.

335
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:49,281
It's all right. As long as you don't
hang up on me.

336
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:53,494
Do you ever just talk to them?
The strangers?

337
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:57,331
- We're not allowed to. - All I would want
to do is ask them about who they are.

338
00:23:58,374 --> 00:23:59,875
What about you?
What do you do?

339
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:04,714
I... I work at the bookstore,

340
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:05,840
at the day-care center.

341
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:12,263
I had that same look on my face the first
time somebody handed me one of those.

342
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:15,891
- I'm just... I'm not religious.
- Just keep it.

343
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:19,270
Check it out. Or don't.

344
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,772
We've got really
good music there.

345
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,527
Thank you.

346
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:42,543
The House sent a bill to the
Senate. What Frank wants to
send back bears zero resemblance.

347
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,629
Because it's bipartisan,
unlike ours.

348
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:46,714
That sounds like
something Frank would say.

349
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:49,800
- I'm not Frank.
- He has a desk in your office.

350
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,928
- If this bill passes in the Senate...
- It won't.

351
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:56,474
We should be prepared, Bob.

352
00:24:56,474 --> 00:25:01,896
Well, I'm prepared
to wait and see.

353
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:05,107
Have a good afternoon, ladies.

354
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:08,361
- Ladies?
- He's threatened.

355
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,530
- He's a pig. - Give him time. He used to
have two white, middle-aged guys

356
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,700
at his side. Now he's got a black guy and
a woman 20 years his junior.

357
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,786
Who knows how to shoot a rifle.

358
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:19,622
We just need to keep at him.

359
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:22,875
<i>- Yes?
- Catalina Rodriguez is on line four.</i>

360
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:27,588
Give me a moment.

361
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,975
<i>- Catalina.
- Ted told me it was you.</i>

362
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:42,687
<i>-  You there?
- Yes. I'm here.</i>

363
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,022
<i>The press won't leave us alone.
For weeks.</i>

364
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:48,442
<i>They're showing up, trying to
get pictures of me and Emily.</i>

365
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:52,279
<i>- It wasn't me.
-  You're the only one who knew.</i>

366
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,200
<i>- I don't know how the story got out.
-  Why would Ted lie about that?</i>

367
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,495
I don't know.
Maybe... maybe he's ashamed.

368
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:01,872
<i>So, what do I do?
When will they leave us alone?</i>

369
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:04,917
I... I don't know, Catalina.

370
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:07,461
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

371
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:09,880
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

372
00:26:15,428 --> 00:26:19,307
How... how is Emily doing?

373
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:21,809
Catalina?

374
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,698
- He's very confident.
- Yeah, but does he have what it takes?

375
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:40,536
- We'll see when I get his media plan.
- What about his personality?

376
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:45,291
Charming. Direct.
Very thorough.

377
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,710
He found our first
interview together, in '86.

378
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,880
I would love to see that.
Does he have a copy?

379
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,674
I don't think so. The TV
station made him watch it there.

380
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:56,302
We should screen that for the
president and the First Lady.

381
00:26:56,302 --> 00:26:59,138
- Show 'em how it's done.
- Christina.

382
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:01,932
- What about her?
- Have you noticed anything strange

383
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:05,436
- between her and the president?
- How do you mean?

384
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:08,856
I passed them
in the hall yesterday.

385
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:12,860
They seem, I don't know...
very intimate.

386
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,739
They did seem cozy
at the prep session.

387
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:21,243
- Do you think...?
- No. Not necessarily.

388
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:23,454
An interesting thought, though.

389
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:25,790
- Sorry to interrupt, sir.
- We're having lunch.

390
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,918
The Republicans are backing out. Mendoza's
chief of staff just gave me the heads up.

391
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:33,297
- Get Mendoza on the phone.
- It's Curtis Haas. He got cold feet.

392
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:37,385
Too many cages. It's
really... kind of inconvenient,

393
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:40,513
but, you know, people look at
them. It's kind of funny. And...

394
00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:42,640
- I got your e-mail.
- Now good for you?

395
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,686
Yeah, sure.
Can I call you right back?

396
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:48,521
What exactly did you
need to know?

397
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:50,856
We're doing some follow-up pieces
on the cyberwarfare thing.

398
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:53,150
I just wanted to get
a layman's understanding

399
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,528
of how the Chinese might
get through a firewall.

400
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:57,989
It's a bit complicated,
but I can show you the basics.

401
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:59,532
That's all I need.

402
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,467
We use a standard
N-tier architecture.

403
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:21,595
Think of it like a big sandwich,
with layers of bread.

404
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:26,142
Between each is the lettuce, the tomato,
the roast beef, you know, whatever.

405
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:29,729
What I'm pulling up here is the
org code which separates the database...

406
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:32,565
Shit, I forgot there's a meeting
with sales in a couple minutes.

407
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:34,734
- You wanna do this later?
- No, I'll just run over

408
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:37,028
and let them know I'll be
a few minutes late. Be right back.

409
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:38,904
Cool. I'll be here.

410
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:57,965
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

411
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:03,179
Yeah.

412
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:16,484
Come on.

413
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:22,782
OK.

414
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:34,502
Delete. Go.

415
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:38,923
- Something wrong?
- Can't find my phone.

416
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,508
It's weird,
I had it a minute ago.

417
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:48,182
Oh!

418
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:50,935
- Here it is. Sorry about that.
- No problem.

419
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:56,065
So the N-tier architecture, the
hi-tech sandwich I was talking about....

420
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:58,401
I thought Mendoza was
willing to work with us.

421
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:01,445
He is. The problem
is Curtis Haas.

422
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:04,991
- And have you spoken with him?
- His office isn't returning our calls.

423
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:07,827
- Neither is Mendoza's, but...
- I should've stuck to my guns.

424
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:11,747
The vote isn't until tomorrow afternoon.
I'll reach out to Mendoza...

425
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:17,378
This is the State of the Union,
Frank. I won't be left in limbo.

426
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:20,840
If we need to start rewriting that
speech now, I don't want to waste a minute.

427
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,551
I can turn this around, sir.

428
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:27,305
Raymond told me this was your
idea, to pursue this compromise.

429
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:31,100
- I suggested it as an option.
- No, he said you bullied him into it.

430
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,394
That he thought
it was a mistake.

431
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:36,314
If he felt so strongly,

432
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:38,524
he should've have
advised you otherwise.

433
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:42,028
Raymond's not a politician.
He relies on our political expertise

434
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:43,988
as much as we rely
on his business acumen.

435
00:30:43,988 --> 00:30:46,532
Maybe we shouldn't
point fingers until there's a problem.

436
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:49,160
- You wouldn't call this a problem?
- Not if it's solved

437
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,537
before it becomes one.

438
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:56,584
You see, I wanted a vice president
who can manage Congress,

439
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:58,961
not one who bites off
more than he can chew.

440
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:01,547
Then have faith you made
the right choice, sir.

441
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:04,967
Whatever faith I have...
is quickly evaporating.

442
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:09,555
Don't humiliate the administration, Frank.
You're part of it now.

443
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:13,643
- Yes, sir.
- We're done.

444
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:16,145
Thank you, Mr. President.

445
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:24,070
Give me the private line,
please.

446
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,865
Tusk is blocking my way.
Goodwin at my heels.

447
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:29,700
There can be no false steps now.

448
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,329
The higher up the mountain,
the more treacherous the path.

449
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:36,666
Lucas Goodwin went up
to visit her.

450
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,335
- They may be looking for you.
- Nobody's contacted me.

451
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:40,962
I don't think anyone
knows I'm here.

452
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:43,589
We need to make sure
it stays that way.

453
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:47,176
Don't speak to anyone you don't have to.
Don't go anywhere you don't need to be.

454
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:53,057
- Tell me you heard what I said.
- I heard you. I get it.

455
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:09,782
I'm fine.

456
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:15,329
- Let me put some ice on it.
- I said it's OK.

457
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,440
What is this?

458
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,650
What, are you going
through my garbage now?

459
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,822
Someone gave it
to me on the bus.

460
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:04,045
You let me know
if anyone contacts you.

461
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,373
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

462
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:42,208
No worries.

463
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:58,516
How much more you wanna
do right now? Fill in this area?

464
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,935
Yeah, and one
more poppy down here.

465
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:03,771
- That's a lot for one sitting.
- I know.

466
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:05,731
OK.

467
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:39,265
Francis?

468
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:52,028
- You're heading in?
- Mendoza's an early riser.

469
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:56,657
- You'll figure this out. - I need to prove
what the vice president is capable of.

470
00:34:56,657 --> 00:35:00,870
Don't prove it to them.
Prove it to me.

471
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,793
Curtis has me by the
tea bags, Frank. I don't have
a working majority without him.

472
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:11,922
- He wasn't elected leader.
- True. But I have to pick my battles.

473
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:13,924
If you can't control him
on budgetary issues...

474
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:16,761
It's not just him. It's the 15
senators he has under his thumb.

475
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:18,679
I won't be the leader next year
if they turn on me.

476
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,473
So he wants to be courted.
Sit him down...

477
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:22,683
I already tried talking
to him. He wouldn't budge.

478
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:24,727
- We'll both talk.
- He's made his position clear.

479
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,646
We all shook hands
at this table.

480
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:29,065
The most I can do is put
the substitute amendment on the floor

481
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:32,985
with limited debate. And your people
can say whatever they want for the record,

482
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:34,487
but we're gonna vote
the amendment down.

483
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:38,574
I'm not interested
in symbolic gestures.

484
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:41,118
Well, that's all I can offer.

485
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:46,374
- Where's your courage?
- My power has limits, Frank.

486
00:35:46,374 --> 00:35:49,210
Five Republicans makes
you the deciding vote.

487
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,213
Now, it's highly doubtful we can get
them to vote against their own party.

488
00:35:52,213 --> 00:35:54,548
- But they might abstain.
- - You'd need ten.

489
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:57,635
Entitlement is the Republicans' white
whale. I can get at least two to flip.

490
00:35:57,635 --> 00:35:59,053
Then you'd only
need six abstaining.

491
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,554
Erikson's already making calls.

492
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:02,515
- Donner.
- And Pulaski.

493
00:36:02,515 --> 00:36:04,558
Get me a call list
so I can tag-team with him.

494
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:05,726
Got it right here.

495
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,937
We have to get medieval.

496
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:10,439
When it comes to parliamentary
procedure, there's not a rule I don't know.

497
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,358
Find me the ones we can bend.

498
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:16,487
Mark, you're a sensible man.

499
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:21,701
Yes, I... I know. I understand.

500
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,494
What if...

501
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:27,456
Tell you what, what if both
VA hospitals in your district...

502
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:29,333
Yes, both of them. Hold on.

503
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,460
- Who?
- Moriarty. I promised him an amendment

504
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,878
for his bovine research center.

505
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:35,006
- That makes six.
- Mark, if I can get you

506
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:39,635
funding for both,
are you with us? Excellent.

507
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:42,471
Well, you come by the White House
and have lunch with me sometime soon.

508
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:44,682
Bye-bye. We have the numbers.

509
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:47,226
Once you break the quorum call,
it's gonna be a little tricky.

510
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:48,394
Tell me on the way.

511
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:50,271
Sir.

512
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:53,983
- Sir, we might not have a majority.
- What?

513
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:57,194
The Dems are poaching people.
Donner, Pulaski. Maybe more.

514
00:36:57,194 --> 00:36:59,739
- Voting for the amendment?
- Some. Others abstaining.

515
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,074
- I'm still trying to figure out who.
- We need to delay

516
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:04,785
- and figure out what is going on.
- Quorum call.

517
00:37:04,785 --> 00:37:08,331
There's 49 hours until the
recess. We call a name an hour.

518
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:20,718
- Mr. Avendale?
- Here.

519
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:35,650
Excuse me, I do believe
you're sitting in my chair.

520
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:42,698
Mr. Drewery, what is the order
of business?

521
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:46,243
- We are in a quorum call, sir.
- Then why aren't you calling the roll?

522
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:50,122
- We are, sir, in a deliberate manner.
- Let's speed it up.

523
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:54,752
- Mr. Brown.
- Here.

524
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,088
- More expeditious than that.
- Mr. Burr.

525
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:58,381
- Here.
- Ms. Cantwell.

526
00:37:58,381 --> 00:37:59,924
- Here.
- Mr. Cerini.

527
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,555
- Thank you.
- Cornwall.

528
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:07,890
- Here.
- Mr. Colson.

529
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,183
- Here.
- Ms. Douster.

530
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:11,143
Here.

531
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:13,729
They have a quorum.
We don't have the numbers.

532
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:16,983
- Out, let's get all our people out.
- Mr. Demerell.

533
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,527
- Mr. Darling. Mr. Daswani.
- Here.

534
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:21,320
- Mr. Donner.
- Faster.

535
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,406
- Mr. Dobben. Mr. Dwyer.
- Here.

536
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:26,742
- Erinburgh, Engle, Erikson.
- Here.

537
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:30,538
Mr. Feld. Farrison. Gentry.

538
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:34,625
Mr. Haas.

539
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:37,169
- Mr. Whitehouse.
- Here.

540
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:40,047
Mr. Wicker. Mr. Wyden.

541
00:38:40,047 --> 00:38:44,635
Mr. President,
a quorum is not present.

542
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,393
The chair recognizes the
minority leader, Mr. Erikson.

543
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:57,398
Mr. President, "I move to direct the
sergeant at arms to compel the attendance

544
00:38:57,398 --> 00:39:01,068
of absent senators, that
warrants for the arrests of all senators

545
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:06,240
not sick nor excused be issued under
the signature of the presiding officer."

546
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,784
The question is on the motion,
all those in favor say aye.

547
00:39:08,784 --> 00:39:11,162
- Aye.
- All those opposed nay.

548
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:13,831
- Nay! - The ayes have it,
and the motion is agreed to.

549
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:17,752
The sergeant of arms is hereby
instructed to compel the
attendance of absent senators.

550
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,139
It feels good
to be back in Congress.

551
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,600
<i>The Democrats have now empowered
the Capitol Police</i>

552
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,102
<i>to arrest absent members
if necessary.</i>

553
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:37,605
<i>According to Republican
Senator Curtis Haas,</i>

554
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:40,441
<i>one of the staunchest opponents
of the entitlement amendment,</i>

555
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:43,819
<i>the vice president is, quote:
"Replacing democracy with tyranny.</i>

556
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:48,824
<i>He's transformed the Senate into
a police state within the Capitol." But...</i>

557
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:52,036
Well, it'll be even harder
to stay out of the news now.

558
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:56,749
- Then why the joint interview?
- I watched the South Carolina one again.

559
00:39:56,749 --> 00:40:00,252
Convinced them to make me
a copy. It's powerful.

560
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:02,505
Here you go.
I thought you might want it.

561
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:06,384
There's a moment where
you ran your fingers through his hair.

562
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:09,303
It's intimate. Human.
That moment alone

563
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,888
would've made me want
to vote for your husband.

564
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:15,017
Something like that
will buy you months

565
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:16,602
of flying beneath the radar.

566
00:40:16,602 --> 00:40:19,188
And who do you have in mind
to conduct the interview?

567
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:21,357
Does this mean I have the job?

568
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:25,027
It means you still
haven't been ruled out.

569
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:27,655
Well, I'll
consider that progress.

570
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,810
This is the Democratic cloak room, Hector.
Yours is on the other side.

571
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,522
- What you're doing won't work.
- It might.

572
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:05,693
Which is why you made the long walk
over here. Ice water?

573
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:08,362
I have my people in planes,
trains and automobiles.

574
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:10,698
All I need is six
to make my quorum.

575
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:14,660
Think what I can do with
26 votes, and I've got 45.

576
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,455
You won't be able to get your planes
and trains back here fast enough.

577
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:18,831
I'll roll those dice.

578
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:22,960
The sergeant at arms
is very good at his job.

579
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,964
And this is the perfect way
to show Curtis who's in charge.

580
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:30,718
- I'm doing you a favor, Hector.
- Tell me what you want.

581
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:33,429
What I've always wanted.
The package we shook hands on.

582
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:37,224
Then I'll give you
your Senate back.

583
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:41,270
- They can't come back voluntarily?
- Pick your six best actors.

584
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,316
- We can't give in, Hector.
- We wouldn't be in this situation

585
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:47,401
had you toed the party line.

586
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:53,991
- Mr. Mendoza is present.
- Under protest.

587
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:57,078
- Ms. Cornwall is present.
- Under protest.

588
00:41:57,078 --> 00:42:00,247
Mr. Ullman is present.
Mr. Walsh is present.

589
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:02,708
Ms. Douster is present
and Mr. Haas is present.

590
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:06,462
- Mr. President, a quorum is now present.
- You can pass the amendment.

591
00:42:06,462 --> 00:42:09,548
- I'll just filibuster the main bill.
- No, you won't.

592
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:11,884
- Watch me.
- As much as I'd like to see you

593
00:42:11,884 --> 00:42:15,137
hold your piss for two days,
we struck a deal with Hector.

594
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:19,809
Passage of the substitute amendment
constitutes passage of the main bill.

595
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:23,229
- I wasn't informed of that.
- Pay attention to the fine print, Curtis.

596
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:25,815
It's far more important than
the selling price. Let's go.

597
00:42:25,815 --> 00:42:28,943
I want an immediate call to the roll.
Don't let half a second pass.

598
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:31,737
- Yes, sir.
- A quorum is present.

599
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:35,324
The question is on the adoption
of the substitute amendment to HR 934,

600
00:42:35,324 --> 00:42:38,369
the yeas and nays have been
ordered and the clerk will call the roll.

601
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,204
- Mr. Abner.
- Aye!

602
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:41,872
- Mr. Avendale.
- Aye!

603
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:43,291
Mr. Brown.

604
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,126
I'd like to propose an amendment
to HR 934.

605
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:47,378
Mr. Haas, you are out of order,
the roll call has begun,

606
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:51,090
- the clerk will continue to call roll.
- Mr. Brown. Mr. Burr.

607
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,717
- Aye!
- Ms. Catwell.

608
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:54,093
- Aye!
- Mr. Cerini.

609
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:55,469
- Aye!
- Mr. Chess.

610
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:56,929
- Aye!
- Ms. Cornwall.

611
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:58,597
- Nay!
- Mr. Colson.

612
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:01,869
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:04,914
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.

614
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:10,753
- What did you think?
- The music was really beautiful.

615
00:44:10,753 --> 00:44:15,341
- Not what you expected?
- I wasn't sure what to expect.

616
00:44:16,926 --> 00:44:20,054
- I'm Lisa.
- Rachel. Sorry.

617
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:24,433
No. We've got cookies
and cake inside, if you...

618
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:28,270
- I think I'm gonna...
- If you want to meet some of my friends.

619
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:31,565
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

620
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:34,151
- OK. Yeah.
- OK.

621
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:41,033
We should add miracle worker
to your résumé, Frank.

622
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:43,744
Lazarus makes
for a good magic act,

623
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:46,497
but life would've been a lot easier if
the bastard hadn't died in the first place.

624
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:51,085
Well, the president wanted to go ballistic,
but I calmed him down.

625
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:53,796
<i>I said don't worry,
Frank will pull this out.</i>

626
00:44:53,796 --> 00:44:57,216
Did you? I don't blame you
for being two-faced, Raymond.

627
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:59,010
It's good politics, as long
as you don't get caught at it.

628
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,095
Now, Frank,
if you think that I...

629
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:02,513
<i>It's OK, Raymond.</i>

630
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:05,725
Jesus forgives you. Good night.

631
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:29,874
Hello?

632
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:36,047
Hello?

633
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,639
- Care for some wine?
- No.

634
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:51,312
Step into the room.

635
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:57,652
Closer. Closer.

636
00:45:58,944 --> 00:46:01,072
- State your name and the date.
- Wait, why?

637
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:03,658
State your name and the date,
please.

638
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:08,537
Lucas Goodwin. February 13th.

639
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:12,083
- Year.
- Two thousand fourteen.

640
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,251
Are you currently or have
you ever been a member...

641
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:15,962
- What is this?
- Are you or have you ever been

642
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:17,838
a member of any
law enforcement agency?

643
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,008
- I already told you I wasn't.
- Two-step verification.

644
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:23,469
No. I'm not and I haven't.

645
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:27,056
Are you currently or have you ever been an
informant for law enforcement?

646
00:46:27,056 --> 00:46:29,183
- No.
- - You think you might've been followed?

647
00:46:29,183 --> 00:46:31,519
- Anything strange the past few weeks?
- You know what?

648
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:32,728
This is making me feel
uncomfortable.

649
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:35,064
We're not fucking around here.

650
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:38,609
If you think the FBI hasn't been
tracking your posts, then you're naive.

651
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:45,157
- You think they know who I am?
- No, you hid yourself well.

652
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:46,784
<i>What are you going to do
with the Herald?</i>

653
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:49,036
- Nothing.
- Then why did you want access?

654
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:51,706
I already had access. It's how I contacted
you in the first place.

655
00:46:51,706 --> 00:46:55,251
I just needed to know
if you were serious.

656
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:04,176
That's Cashew.

657
00:47:04,176 --> 00:47:07,013
Why did you contact me?

658
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:10,558
Because you're desperate.

659
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:15,646
And I'm not fond of authority.

660
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:19,400
<i>Just today, under the leadership
of Vice President Underwood,</i>

661
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,695
the Senate passed HR 934,

662
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:26,574
along with an historic
entitlement reform amendment.

663
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:30,494
By raising the retirement age
to 68 and 64

664
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:33,748
<i>for normal and early
retirement respectively,</i>

665
00:47:33,748 --> 00:47:37,960
<i>we will ensure entitlements
for generations to come.</i>

666
00:47:47,553 --> 00:47:51,849
And when the House passes that bill in
a few weeks, as I fully expect them to do,

667
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:54,977
we will put the government
freeze to rest.

668
00:47:54,977 --> 00:48:01,067
We will continue the business of serving
our country rather than paralyzing it.

669
00:48:01,067 --> 00:48:03,903
The American people
deserve no less.

670
00:48:03,903 --> 00:48:08,157
<i>We stand at the
altar of democracy.</i>

671
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:11,744
<i>Let us stand together.</i>

672
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:22,296
I spoke to Jackie. You have
my support in the House.

673
00:48:22,296 --> 00:48:24,715
But it hasn't passed
the House yet.

674
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:28,177
We've a long march before it
arrives on the president's desk.

675
00:48:28,177 --> 00:48:32,306
As for me, I used to be
on the edge of the frame.

676
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:36,310
Now, I'm only three feet away.

677
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,400
