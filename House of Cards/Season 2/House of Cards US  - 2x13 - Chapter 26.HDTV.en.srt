1
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,045
We have a president
who not only took

2
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:13,965
mind-altering medication,
a man who has his finger on the button

3
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:16,134
while US ships
are squaring off with China,

4
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:19,554
but then instructed his White
House counsel to coach a...

5
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:23,933
- Allegedly, sir, not proven.
- To coach a witness.

6
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:26,852
Which is behavior either
resulting from the use of those drugs,

7
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,605
or worse, a deliberate attempt
to obstruct the law.

8
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:32,482
Wouldn't you call
either scenario impeachable?

9
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:35,485
That's for the United States
Congress to decide, sir, not me.

10
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,112
Were you aware that the president
was taking any form of medication?

11
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:41,782
- No, I was not. - Did you notice him
acting in a bizarre fashion?

12
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:43,617
- Unstable, incoherent?
- No, sir.

13
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:45,911
- Any odd behavior?
- No, sir.

14
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:49,414
Not even firing his chief of staff
in the midst of a trade war?

15
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:51,708
He didn't fire me. I resigned.

16
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:56,337
- Would you tell us why?
- I resigned because I felt

17
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:59,424
I could no longer serve the president
to the best of my ability.

18
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:02,468
And what changed? How did you
come to that conclusion?

19
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:07,014
I had some fundamental
differences of opinion

20
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,016
with certain people
in the White House.

21
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:11,560
- Like who? The president?
- No, sir.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,812
What "certain people" then?

23
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:16,356
One person, actually.
The vice president.

24
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:19,692
- Frank Underwood.
- He wanted you gone?

25
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:23,404
I can't speak as to what
the vice president did or didn't want.

26
00:01:23,404 --> 00:01:28,033
Was he trying to hide anything?
Was he afraid you might expose something?

27
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,993
You'd have to ask him, sir.

28
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:32,746
What's happening in the
Judiciary Committee is a farce.

29
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:36,583
- The Republicans are exploiting...
- Excuse me, Mr. Vice President,

30
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,835
but it's not just Republicans.

31
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:43,089
A number of Democrats have come out
saying they would support impeachment.

32
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:45,716
Including the majority whip,
Jackie Sharp.

33
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:49,469
Which is egregious, since the committee
hasn't stopped hearing testimony,

34
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,264
nor has the special prosecutor
completed her investigation.

35
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:54,391
You vigorously
defend the president,

36
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,935
but there are reports that
you've had a falling out,

37
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:59,854
- that you haven't spoken in weeks.
- That is simply not true.

38
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,398
I've spoken to senior staff
at the White House

39
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:06,402
who say the president is worried
you want to run against him in 2016.

40
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:09,446
And just today Linda Vasquez
intimated that you...

41
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:12,866
Look, I fully expect that
the president will run in 2016,

42
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,286
and I hope that he's generous
enough to invite me to be his running mate.

43
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:18,871
Impeachment, conviction,
let's say it happens.

44
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,957
It won't.
He's completely innocent.

45
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's say it does happen.
You become president...

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,044
That is not a scenario
I'm going to entertain.

47
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,421
The thought must
have crossed your mind.

48
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:31,174
And one could make the argument that the
president wouldn't be in this predicament

49
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:35,512
if it weren't for you. It's your staff's
involvement with Feng and Lanagin

50
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:37,930
that expanded Dunbar's
investigation,

51
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,349
- which resulted in the travel logs...
- These impeachment hearings

52
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,852
are the result
of political maneuvering, not...

53
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,687
Your maneuverings,
or the Republicans?

54
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:49,024
Morley, I've always liked you.
You ask the tough questions.

55
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:51,151
And you can certainly
question my judgment,

56
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,570
but do not question
my patriotism.

57
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,490
I serve this nation
and my president, not myself.

58
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,826
- He's lying through his teeth.
- What we're doing is working.

59
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,787
We keep the whisper
campaign alive.

60
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:05,456
We spin him as power hungry,
as duplicitous.

61
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,958
- Focus attention on him, not you.
- What's the latest?

62
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:12,712
- Twenty percent? - Zogby has you at 24.
Your speech made a difference.

63
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:16,841
The approval numbers
are moving in the right direction.

64
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:20,136
We need to do more
than play the spin game.

65
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:22,388
We need to destroy Frank.

66
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:25,224
Offer his head instead of mine.

67
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,644
- We use Raymond Tusk.
- How?

68
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:32,230
At his hearing.
When he goes to the judiciary.

69
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,525
Sir, you're already being
accused of coaching one witness.

70
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:38,986
- If you take steps to coach another...
- Not coaching. The truth.

71
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,738
Raymond admits
to the money laundering,

72
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:43,699
puts Frank at the center of
this, and says I knew nothing.

73
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,744
And then we'll reward him
for his honesty.

74
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,495
You mean a pardon?

75
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:55,001
- I want you to talk to him.
- And put myself at risk?

76
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,295
You're not part of this
administration anymore.

77
00:03:57,295 --> 00:04:00,590
There's no law that says you can't
pay Raymond Tusk a visit.

78
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,053
And in return, resignations
don't have to last forever.

79
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:13,810
If I do this, you have to be
a million miles away.

80
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,645
Tricia and I will
go to Camp David.

81
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:21,525
It's not a million miles away,
but it'll do the job.

82
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,444
I can go after Linda,
dig into her past...

83
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:26,155
Neutralizing her won't
neutralize the bigger problem.

84
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,241
- The president is after blood.
- Then what's his move?

85
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:33,203
He can't ask me to resign,
he'd have to force me out.

86
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:37,457
And to do that, if I were him...

87
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:40,418
...I would return
to the hand that first fed me.

88
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,545
- Raymond Tusk?
- Exactly.

89
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,922
He'd have to implicate himself
to implicate you.

90
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:46,840
Not if he gets a pardon.

91
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,427
It's the one thing that only
a president can offer.

92
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:52,429
Tusk is a hand grenade.
If he pardons him...

93
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:53,888
You're right.
Tusk is a hand grenade.

94
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,974
We need to pull the pin
and throw him at Walker

95
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,976
before Walker pulls the pin
and throws him at us.

96
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:01,854
I want to meet with Raymond.
One-on-one.

97
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:03,898
Let me speak on your behalf.
That way if anyone finds out...

98
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:06,984
I know Raymond. He won't
respond to anyone but me.

99
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:10,320
- When's his hearing scheduled?
- Day after tomorrow.

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,073
- Two p.m.
- That gives us...

101
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:17,076
- ...40 hours to make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

102
00:05:18,703 --> 00:06:52,539

103
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,677
I think it's mine.

104
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,434
Seth, it's four in the morning.

105
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,270
- When?
- I want you to go with her.

106
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,813
I'll get it cleared right now.

107
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,815
Thank you.

108
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,944
Meechum says the plane
will be ready in 30 minutes.

109
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,155
- OK, good.
- Think it was just a panic attack,

110
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:29,990
- or was she really trying...
- I don't know.

111
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,284
It was bad enough they felt
they had to keep her overnight.

112
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,910
I'm gonna call the White
House physician's office,

113
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,787
- see if they can recommend anyone.
- OK.

114
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:39,248
- Oh, wait, my phone.
- It's in your hand.

115
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,377
I'll be back sometime tonight.

116
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,256
Impeachment is our only chance.

117
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:50,634
Here are the seats that are still in
contention in the midterms.

118
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:54,846
These 13 we're gonna lose, no matter what
we do. But even if we win all the rest,

119
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:58,266
that only leaves us
with a five-seat majority.

120
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:00,601
We either save the party
or we save the president.

121
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,853
Anyone who votes
against impeachment

122
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:06,190
is gonna get pummeled by attack ads
between now and election day.

123
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,901
- How many do you have already?
- We need 18.

124
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:13,655
- I have six.
- So 12 more to go.

125
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:17,909
Look, Donald,
I know this is a big ask,

126
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:22,288
- and you prefer to focus on policy...
- Jackie, you can stop.

127
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,748
- I'm on board.
- Really?

128
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:27,000
One hundred percent.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,211
I have to say
I'm a little surprised.

130
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:31,254
When you rolled those dollies
into the cloakroom,

131
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:36,217
you said, "Work with me,
I'm not Frank Underwood."

132
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:41,305
And then you helped get my stimulus
package through, just like you promised.

133
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:45,184
And what do you
expect this time?

134
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:48,270
That you never
become Frank Underwood.

135
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,148
You must realize, if we're successful,
he will replace Walker.

136
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:56,319
I don't like Frank, but I hate being in
the minority even more.

137
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,072
We can't let the Republicans control
both houses of Congress.

138
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,742
You've changed
since I joined the leadership.

139
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,578
Just getting better
at playing the game.

140
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,789
I guess you can teach
an old liberal new tricks.

141
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,792
I guess so.

142
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:16,337
So tell me who you still need.

143
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:20,466
My lawyers are saying
fifty-fifty that I survive a trial.

144
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:25,054
Now, I'm not a big fan of those
odds, but I'm willing to take them.

145
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:27,473
If your lawyers are
putting it at a coin toss,

146
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:30,100
then you're paying them too
much to be overly optimistic.

147
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,395
How can I trust Garrett? He turned his
back on 20 years of friendship.

148
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:35,063
He could accuse you of the same.

149
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:43,863
Nobody on this planet wants to see
Frank Underwood go to jail more than I do.

150
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,198
I just don't want to be
sharing a cell with him.

151
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,075
That won't happen.

152
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:51,661
All you've given me
to go on is Garrett's word.

153
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,913
He's asking you
to tell the truth.

154
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:56,291
Good things happen to those
who do the right thing.

155
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:03,422
And you just expect
Frank to lie down, throw in the towel?

156
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:06,800
We don't even give him the chance.
Your testimony knocks him out cold.

157
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,970
Excuse me.

158
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:16,976
Yes? Oh, thank you.

159
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,644
Hold on.

160
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:22,481
There you go.

161
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,413
Care package, from my wife.

162
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:44,376
Now, you were saying.

163
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:51,258
I just want to warn you,
she's not herself right now.

164
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:54,386
They had to put her
on some heavy doses.

165
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:57,305
- Of what?
- Lithium, mostly.

166
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:00,558
It was either that
or commit her for 30 days.

167
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:04,436
She just took some,
so she might be a little...

168
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:13,320
Megan?

169
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,008
Stop.

170
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:54,190
Your mom told me
they found you in the lake.

171
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,319
- What do you care?
- I care very much.

172
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,698
No, you don't.

173
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,119
You don't use
somebody you care about.

174
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,668
Whore.

175
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,545
Slut.

176
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:20,047
Bitch.

177
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,509
Traitor.

178
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,053
That's what they call me,

179
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,681
in my mail, online.

180
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:33,852
I wish I had never called.

181
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:36,604
I wish I had never met you.

182
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:42,485
I feel so stupid, believing what you
told me, thinking that you did care.

183
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:46,238
I was getting better.

184
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:48,532
You did this to me.

185
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:56,247
Every time I take one
of these, I think of him.

186
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,750
And the next face I think of?

187
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,127
It's yours.

188
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:08,842
I'm sorry that you felt used.

189
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:11,970
You weren't.

190
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,391
I just, um...

191
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:24,106
Like I told you, the political
landscape shifted and we...

192
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,817
...found...

193
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,198
Megan?

194
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,215
<i>- Hello?
- I got your text.</i>

195
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:56,219
I know I shouldn't be reaching
out to you, but I thought...

196
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,470
<i>No, that doesn't matter.</i>

197
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,847
I'm glad you did. How is she?

198
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,393
In bad shape.

199
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:07,396
I'm surprised they even let her
out of the hospital, to be honest.

200
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,898
Is there anything I can do?

201
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:11,650
Should I contact her family,

202
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,235
<i>or go out there myself?</i>

203
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:17,155
We should probably
leave her alone.

204
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:21,909
<i>- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.</i>

205
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,413
<i>- How about you?
-  Holding up.</i>

206
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:30,250
I spent the whole day
talking to lawyers.

207
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:34,004
It's hard on the kids.

208
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:38,549
They're embarrassed, and
frightened, but we'll get through it.

209
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:43,262
I thought the speech you
and Garrett gave was very moving.

210
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:45,472
<i>Well, it seems
to have helped some.</i>

211
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:48,475
I was inspired by you, actually.

212
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:52,437
When you admitted
to the abortion on TV.

213
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:55,523
<i>The truth is a powerful thing.</i>

214
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,614
Tricia, I want... to apologize.

215
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:05,616
<i>What for?</i>

216
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:07,784
I feel partly responsible
for everything

217
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,162
your family is going through.

218
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,000
It was my suggestion
that you get counseling.

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,836
And had I known then,
I never would have said a word.

220
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:23,382
Claire, please.
Counseling was a godsend.

221
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:28,470
Garrett and I needed help, and it's made
things better. I should be thanking you.

222
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,181
And thank you for letting me
know about Megan.

223
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,308
It was kind of you
to make that trip.

224
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,644
<i>You're a good person, Claire.</i>

225
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,813
<i>Be well.</i>

226
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:33,293
I take it
this is about my hearing?

227
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,171
Did Walker get to you first?

228
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,338
Barely.

229
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:40,633
But sometimes barely is enough.

230
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:43,010
I'm sure he
offered you a pardon.

231
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,888
Always better to offer something
your competitor can't.

232
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:51,685
- Oh, but I can.
- Hm.

233
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:56,189
Last time I read the Constitution,
the most a vice president could offer

234
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:59,108
was a... smile and wink.

235
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:03,279
I think I've proven that I'm
not your typical vice president.

236
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,948
Typical or not,
you've lost, Frank.

237
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:08,659
I have an out. You don't.

238
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:12,495
Garrett will not
survive impeachment.

239
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:17,667
If there's one skill you can't deny,
it's my ability to whip votes.

240
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,962
In the House, not in the Senate.

241
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:24,048
Which the Constitution
makes me the president of.

242
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:26,008
And you saw what
I did with entitlement.

243
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:30,595
Hubris is giving you delusions
of grandeur, Frank.

244
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,474
Let's say Walker squeaks by.

245
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:36,392
Yes, you get your pardon,

246
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:38,644
but you've bound yourself
at the hip to a man

247
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:41,188
- who has zero
political capital.

248
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,195
And if he gets convicted,
we all go to jail.

249
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:52,240
- There's no pardon for anyone.
- I'll roll the dice.

250
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:59,539
Raymond, think
like a businessman.

251
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:03,501
Haven't you built a fortune
by minimizing risk?

252
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:06,420
Isn't that why you stacked
Congress all these years,

253
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,466
why you guided Garrett to the Oval
and why you kept me on as whip?

254
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:15,303
Walker is a junk bond
quickly depreciating,

255
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:19,807
whereas I can end the conflict with
China and keep you in the black.

256
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,893
You can't promise better
relations with China.

257
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:26,897
I wrecked them,
I can repair them.

258
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:33,111
Now, let's work together,
as we always intended to do.

259
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:47,958
When they put you in that box
barely bigger than a coffin...

260
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:54,798
...remember how beautiful
the music was tonight.

261
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:59,969
It might give you
some small degree of comfort.

262
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:08,810
Puccini's a downer. I prefer
something much more optimistic.

263
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,155
- They won't touch
Brown. The trial date is set.

264
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:24,450
- They can reduce the charges.
- Dallas won't give.

265
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,494
If I keep pressing,
it'll start to look suspect.

266
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:31,581
What I can do is make sure
you don't get prosecuted.

267
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:34,626
- And I stop working for you.
- Not quite.

268
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,837
I told the US attorney that we
wanted to bring you on with us,

269
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:42,466
- cyberterrorism division. You'd get
a clean slate... - No fucking way.

270
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:45,803
They're not gonna let your case go
unless we give them a compelling reason.

271
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,763
- There's no...
- I've spent half of my life

272
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,515
- fighting the bureau.
- It's the only way I could sell it.

273
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:54,602
Take this opportunity, Gavin,
before they change their minds.

274
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:57,146
I want to meet
with Douglas Stamper.

275
00:20:57,146 --> 00:21:01,400
No. The deal was
I find you a way out...

276
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,986
No, the deal was you help out
Brown and give me my freedom.

277
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:06,989
You haven't done shit for Brown and
you want me to keep me under your thumb.

278
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:10,242
So I meet Stamper,
or any kind of deal is off.

279
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,590
Raymond said no.

280
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,509
He said neither yes nor no.
I'll keep the pressure on.

281
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:33,346
- So he could still name you.
- He could. Anything's possible.

282
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,431
- You have to stop him.
- I'm trying.

283
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:37,350
Trying's not enough, Francis.

284
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,435
Well, I can't sit next
to him in the hearing room

285
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:40,978
with a gun to his head.

286
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:43,230
- That sounds like an excuse.
- It's a reality.

287
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,608
You promised me I wasn't going
to have to prepare for the worst.

288
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:49,278
- And I intend to keep that promise.
- Well, I want to be sure.

289
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:51,905
- I want both of us to be sure.
- The only surefire way

290
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:55,742
- is for Walker to call him off personally.
- Then make that happen.

291
00:21:55,742 --> 00:22:01,372
I cannot force a man who thinks I'm
his enemy to suddenly call me his friend.

292
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:04,917
I've done what I had to do.

293
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:08,003
Now you do what you have to do.

294
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:10,547
Seduce him.
Give him your heart.

295
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:14,884
Cut it out and put it
in his fucking hands.

296
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:24,949
<i>Dear Mr. President.</i>

297
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:28,744
<i>I'm writing you on an Underwood
portable my father gave me</i>

298
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,620
<i>when I left for the Sentinel.</i>

299
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,748
<i>It was the words my father said
when he gave it to me</i>

300
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:39,629
<i>that resonated even more
than this 70-year-old machine.</i>

301
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:42,882
<i>"This Underwood built
an empire," he said.</i>

302
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:46,385
<i>"Now you go
and build one of your own."</i>

303
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:51,306
<i>Those words have been a large part
of what has motivated my life.</i>

304
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:56,477
<i>I've only written one other
letter with these keys.</i>

305
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,646
<i>It did not fail me then.</i>

306
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,525
I hope it will not fail me now.

307
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,860
<i>You said I wanted
to diminish you.</i>

308
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,737
The truth is I don't.

309
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,906
You said I wanted
to challenge you in 2016.

310
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,950
The truth is I don't.

311
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,160
You said I wanted
the presidency for myself.

312
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,916
The truth is... I do.

313
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,585
What politician hasn't dreamed
about what it would be like

314
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:26,213
<i>to take the oath of the
highest office of our land?</i>

315
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:29,299
<i>I've stared at your desk
in the Oval and coveted it.</i>

316
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,843
<i>The power. The prestige.</i>

317
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:35,472
<i>Those things have a strong
pull on someone like me,</i>

318
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:40,518
<i>who came from a small South Carolina
town with nothing.</i>

319
00:24:40,518 --> 00:24:45,439
<i>But since you assumed office,
my only aim has been to fight,</i>

320
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,483
<i>for you and alongside you.</i>

321
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:50,152
<i>Whether that be in Congress
or, as now,</i>

322
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:52,487
<i>the battle over impeachment.</i>

323
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:56,699
<i>Maybe one day I'll have my
chance to serve as president.</i>

324
00:24:56,699 --> 00:25:00,161
<i>But not while you
are the nation's leader.</i>

325
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:04,415
<i>And in you, sir,
I see a brave man.</i>

326
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,250
<i>A just man.</i>

327
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,752
<i>A president whom
I would follow anywhere,</i>

328
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:13,048
<i>no matter how strong
the wind blows against us.</i>

329
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:21,180
<i>I want to tell you something
I have never told anyone.</i>

330
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,934
<i>When I was 13, I walked in
on my father in the barn.</i>

331
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:27,978
<i>There was a shotgun
in his mouth.</i>

332
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:30,814
<i>He waved me over.
"Come here, Francis," he said.</i>

333
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:33,858
"Pull the trigger for me."

334
00:25:33,858 --> 00:25:36,903
Because he didn't have the
courage to do it himself.

335
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:41,115
I said, "No, Pop," and walked out, knowing
he would never find that courage.

336
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:43,784
<i>The next seven years
were hell for my father,</i>

337
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:46,787
<i>but even more hell
for my mother and me.</i>

338
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:52,125
<i>He made all of us miserable,
drinking, despair, violence.</i>

339
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,502
<i>My only regret in life</i>

340
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:57,088
<i>is that I didn't
pull that trigger.</i>

341
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,006
<i>He would've been
better off in the grave,</i>

342
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:01,592
<i>and we would have been
better off without him.</i>

343
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:03,719
<i>I'm not going to put you
in the same position</i>

344
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:05,679
<i>as my father put me in.</i>

345
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,891
<i>You will find enclosed,
on a separate sheet,</i>

346
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:12,894
<i>a confession to the crimes
you have been accused of.</i>

347
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:17,440
<i>They're false words, but my signature
will make them true.</i>

348
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,860
<i>Use them if you must.</i>

349
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,572
<i>If you truly believe
that I have only served myself,</i>

350
00:26:24,572 --> 00:26:27,324
<i>then I have forever
lost your trust.</i>

351
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:33,288
<i>All I can do now is give you
my freedom to save your own.</i>

352
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,457
<i>I said I would
take the fall for you,</i>

353
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:39,085
<i>and now I give you the means
to make that happen.</i>

354
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:42,546
<i>I am pulling the trigger myself.</i>

355
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:46,133
<i>We all must make sacrifices
to achieve our dreams.</i>

356
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:49,970
<i>But sometimes we must sacrifice
ourselves for the greater good.</i>

357
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,807
It is my honor to make
such a sacrifice now.

358
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:57,435
Your loyal friend, still in my
heart, if not in yours...

359
00:26:57,435 --> 00:27:00,313
<i>...Francis.</i>

360
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:11,531
The Constitution sets forth
the general principle...

361
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:14,159
Sir, the president's
on the phone.

362
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:32,050
<i>- Mr. President.
- I got your letter.</i>

363
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,136
I had Tricia read it too.

364
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:38,598
<i>I'm torn, Frank.</i>

365
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:40,725
<i>Half of me wants to think
you're genuine.</i>

366
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,978
The other half
doesn't trust a word of it.

367
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,938
<i>Does Tricia feel the same way?</i>

368
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:49,983
She believes in Claire,
which inclines her to believe in you.

369
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:52,027
I meant every syllable.

370
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:54,279
I wanted you to know
beyond a shadow of a doubt

371
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,907
that I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary.

372
00:27:57,907 --> 00:28:00,952
Then why can't
I shake the shadow?

373
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:03,996
<i>Because I'm a liar, sir.</i>

374
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:07,791
Because I lack scruples and some
would even say compassion.

375
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:10,752
But that's just the image
that I present to the world

376
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:15,256
<i>because it elicits fear and respect.
But it is not who I am.</i>

377
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:20,595
My hope was that my letter
would prove that to you.

378
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:24,098
Even if you are being genuine,

379
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:27,309
that doesn't do much for me.

380
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:31,146
I won't survive impeachment because
I got along with my vice president.

381
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:35,817
No, I agree you need more
than my good intentions.

382
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:39,445
Proof, that's what
I want to see, Frank.

383
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:44,200
Not just falling on the sword.
Show me results,

384
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,035
and then I'll reconsider whether
you're worth any of my trust at all.

385
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:51,498
<i>- You're talking votes.
- Whipping votes is your strong suit.</i>

386
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,958
<i>That's the side
of you I want to see.</i>

387
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,878
- I've already begun, sir.
- You have a count?

388
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:59,255
<i>An approximation,
the sands keep shifting.</i>

389
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:02,883
- Can we survive the House or not?
- Possibly. But Jackie Sharp

390
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:05,511
<i>- is making it very difficult.
-  Give me numbers.</i>

391
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,638
Over half of the 18
that she needs,

392
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:10,515
which is why I'd like to start
focusing on the Senate.

393
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,518
<i>- Don't you think that's premature?
-  We should be prepared.</i>

394
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,105
The key battle is making sure
that you avoid conviction.

395
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,650
You keep whipping,

396
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,570
you keep getting me information,
I'll answer your calls.

397
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,240
But don't take that as a sign
of reconciliation, Frank.

398
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,328
I'll sing for my supper, sir.
I don't expect it for free.

399
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:39,208
<i>- Let's talk again tomorrow.
- Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

400
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,044
- You said you wanted options.
- Frank didn't leave me options.

401
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:45,089
- He fucked me. - You fucked him first,
when you sided with Tusk.

402
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:46,965
But who cares what
happened each inning?

403
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:49,134
It's the final
score that counts.

404
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:52,929
Eight years I spent
busting my ass in this office,

405
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:55,974
- I can't seem to escape it.
- Are you going to help us or not?

406
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:58,351
- I need to know what I gain.
- You'll be taken care of.

407
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:00,436
Specifically.

408
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:03,939
We'll see what makes sense
when all the chips have fallen.

409
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:07,151
So you just want me to leap off a cliff
and hope for a soft landing beneath?

410
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:09,986
No one will touch you now.
Nobody except us.

411
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:11,738
We're as soft
as you're going to get.

412
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:17,160
- A job at the White House?
- No promises.

413
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,123
Other than something commensurate
with your loyalty and experience.

414
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:24,959
I could just walk away
from it all, start a new life.

415
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:27,961
No, you can't.
You know you can't.

416
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:30,464
You'd wither away anywhere
but the Hill.

417
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:33,091
It's never been about the money,
no matter what you tell yourself.

418
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:37,178
When I left,
Frank begged me to stay.

419
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:41,807
Power vs. money, he said.
Don't reduce myself to a tax bracket.

420
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,560
He was right.
And I doubt he begged.

421
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,022
He was half right. Power is better
than money, for as long as it lasts.

422
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:53,943
- But it never lasts.
- What's your answer?

423
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:03,702
You've gotten colder since
you've taken over this job.

424
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:08,665
It makes things easier.

425
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:13,295
- On the outside.
- And the inside.

426
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:17,590
I miss you, Jackie.

427
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:22,928
Tell me if you'll cooperate.

428
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,394
Excuse me one second.

429
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,105
Mr. President?

430
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:37,150
<i>I want you to call
Tusk. Tell him the deal is off.</i>

431
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,609
<i>- What?
-  You were right.</i>

432
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:40,528
I don't want to take the risk.

433
00:31:40,528 --> 00:31:42,405
<i>But I already spoke to him.</i>

434
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:44,323
Well, so speak to him again,
and tell him there's no pardon.

435
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:48,076
Sir, I was skeptical
of this strategy at first,

436
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:50,829
but now that we've gone down
this road, we should stick to it.

437
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:53,290
<i>Linda, do you
still want your job back?</i>

438
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,210
- Of course, sir.
- Then make the call.

439
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:05,384
I'd rather see what happens in the House
before I get involved in any way.

440
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:08,011
But if you come out vigorously
in defense of the president,

441
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,554
it might convince
the judiciary committee...

442
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,556
To be honest, I'm not
particularly inclined

443
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,558
to be doing Walker any favors.

444
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,353
Now, Michael, I know
he revoked your nomination.

445
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:20,147
- He didn't fight for me at all.
- He had just been elected.

446
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,567
- He wasn't in a position...
- Wrong. He had a clear mandate.

447
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,736
He was in a strong position
to defend me.

448
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,990
You're right.
If I'd been president,

449
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,867
I wouldn't have
given in so easily.

450
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,911
I would've stuck by you after
that article came to light.

451
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,456
In fact, if you'd been our secretary
of state instead of Durant,

452
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,374
I don't think we'd be
in the mess we are with China.

453
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,960
The truth is I wouldn't have
nominated you

454
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,587
for secretary of state
in the first place.

455
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,754
I would have nominated you

456
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:47,047
for secretary of treasury.

457
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:48,840
Because your expertise
in economics

458
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,967
is even better than your grasp
on foreign affairs.

459
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:54,971
Now, if I were president,
you'd be secretary of treasury.

460
00:32:56,222 --> 00:33:01,560
- If you were president.
- That's right.

461
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,063
You can't do this.

462
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,191
What happened?

463
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,070
Was it Frank?

464
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:16,241
Linda, listen to me...

465
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:22,788
I understand.

466
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:25,833
Thanks.

467
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,627
- The deal is off.
- Did she say why?

468
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:32,339
No. Other than
he changed his mind.

469
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,174
But it must be Frank.

470
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:36,759
- Then we go back to the original plan.
- That's right.

471
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,345
You plead the Fifth, just like you
did before. This is political theater.

472
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:40,930
- We get past it and focus...
- Jesus Christ.

473
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,557
- What is it?
- Remy Danton is volunteering

474
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:45,768
to testify to Dunbar, right now.

475
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,853
He volunteered?
He wasn't subpoenaed?

476
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:51,231
- Looks that way.
- He's going to sell me out.

477
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:54,567
That would open
him up to prosecution.

478
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:57,403
Unless he's being protected.

479
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:07,121
- Where's Danton?
- I'll call his assistant.

480
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:12,459
Did you or did you not
facilitate foreign money

481
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:17,130
being funneled into
political action committees?

482
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:22,510
On the advice of my counsel, I reserve
my right to invoke the Fifth Amendment.

483
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,388
Xander Feng claims you not only
facilitated, you orchestrated the scheme.

484
00:34:26,388 --> 00:34:30,559
What is your response
to that testimony?

485
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,396
On the advice of my counsel,
I reserve my right...

486
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:37,231
You can reserve your right
all day long, Mr. Tusk.

487
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:39,609
But when you appear
in front of a grand jury,

488
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:42,236
as I'm sure the
justice department intends,

489
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:44,321
your silence will
be your downfall.

490
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:45,614
Does the Congressman
have a question?

491
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:48,283
You can hide from us all
you want, sir,

492
00:34:48,283 --> 00:34:50,744
you cannot hide
from a jury of your peers.

493
00:34:50,744 --> 00:34:52,787
- Mr. Chairman.
- That's it. I'm done.

494
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:55,874
I relinquish
the remainder of my time.

495
00:34:55,874 --> 00:35:00,169
The chair recognizes the congresswoman
from Tennessee. You have 12 minutes, ma'am.

496
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:04,340
Mr. Tusk, our nation is currently
embroiled in a trade war with China.

497
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,176
It has gutted our economy.

498
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:10,011
It has placed our Navy
in harm's way.

499
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:12,555
- The president who put us there has...
- He knew.

500
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,686
- Excuse me?
- My client reserves the...

501
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:21,314
He knew. Isn't that what
you're all wondering?

502
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:28,153
- Quiet, please.
- Knew what, exactly?

503
00:35:28,153 --> 00:35:33,033
There was a mechanism by which
a great many contributions were made

504
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:36,995
over the last ten years.
The legality of this mechanism

505
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:42,458
is something I continue to believe
is within the boundaries of the law.

506
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:48,672
<i>But as for the mechanism itself, Mr.
Feng is correct.</i>

507
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:54,052
<i>I orchestrated it, I facilitated it,
and the President knew about it.</i>

508
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,471
Danton just cancelled.

509
00:35:56,471 --> 00:36:00,474
Screw Danton. We've got Tusk.

510
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:02,768
Get me the attorney general.

511
00:36:10,192 --> 00:36:13,862
That won't be necessary, Mr.
Tusk, if you'll come with us.

512
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:17,865
That's a shame. Handcuffs were
another item on my bucket list.

513
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:20,993
Right this way, sir. You have
the right to remain silent.

514
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:23,078
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

515
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:26,915
We'll want a bond,
for his cooperation in the hearing.

516
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:29,543
I'll talk bonds
if you'll talk a plea.

517
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:32,921
<i>Response to the testimony
has been swift and vocal.</i>

518
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:36,299
<i>Protesters have been gathering in
front of the White House since yesterday</i>

519
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:38,926
<i>demanding President
Walker's resignation.</i>

520
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:43,472
<i>And an online petition has already
accumulate over 200,000 signatures</i>

521
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:45,057
<i>in the past 24 hours.</i>

522
00:36:45,057 --> 00:36:47,518
<i>The list of lawmakers
publicly condemning</i>

523
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,978
<i>the president has grown
on both sides of the aisle.</i>

524
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:52,772
<i>This afternoon, the Chinese
ambassador also condemned</i>

525
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:55,275
<i>the Walker administration,
saying China would not</i>

526
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:57,443
<i>negotiate with a president
who dealt</i>

527
00:36:57,443 --> 00:36:59,946
<i>with corrupt businessmen
behind Beijing's back.</i>

528
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,198
<i>This at a time when warships
from both countries...</i>

529
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:05,784
<i>Meanwhile, the president and First Lady
remain bunkered at Camp David,</i>

530
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:09,913
<i>and have offered no public response to the
most recent developments in Washington.</i>

531
00:37:09,913 --> 00:37:12,082
<i>I'm here with Ayla Sayyad
of the Wall Street Telegraph.</i>

532
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:15,877
<i>I have to begin by saying
that sources on the Hill are telling me</i>

533
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:19,338
<i>that the Judiciary Committee
may bypass debate altogether.</i>

534
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,674
<i>No one on the committee has
gone on record about that.</i>

535
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:24,260
<i>But do you think these rumors would be
circulating if there weren't some sort</i>

536
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,554
<i>of strong preference to recommend the
articles of impeachment to the House?</i>

537
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:30,140
<i>I think it's safe to assume
there is strong support.</i>

538
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,268
<i>Every poll I've seen shows
an overwhelming majority of Americans</i>

539
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:36,104
<i>want this to move forward. I don't think
politicians are going to ignore that.</i>

540
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:39,065
I've talked to a number
of my colleagues already.

541
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:41,150
There is support on my side
of the aisle.

542
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,069
- How many do you have?
- Five at this point, including me.

543
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,864
That would put us at 60.
We'd still need seven more.

544
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:51,118
You've seen the overnight polls.
He's dipped down into the single digits.

545
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:53,745
Are you willing to make
a public statement with us?

546
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:58,833
I think the country could use a little
bipartisanship right now, don't you?

547
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,126
<i>Do you think they're bluffing?</i>

548
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:03,003
That it's some sort of stunt

549
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:05,839
to sway the undecideds
in the Senate?

550
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,550
Michael Kern is bitter
and small-minded, sir,

551
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,137
but he wouldn't have appeared publicly with
Mendoza if they didn't have the numbers.

552
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:14,389
<i>I imagine we're worse off in
the House than we were before.</i>

553
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:17,558
In fact, I had a very productive
conversation with Jackie Sharp.

554
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:20,353
<i>She agreed to stop the attack
if we give her our support</i>

555
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:24,356
for majority leader after the midterms,
but once Raymond gave his testimony,

556
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:25,983
she called to say
the deal was off.

557
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:28,777
Raymond really has set us back.

558
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:32,697
<i>- I can't fathom why he lied.
- It's retribution.</i>

559
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:36,618
<i>- For what? The energy crisis?
-  No.</i>

560
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:42,540
Did you offer him something?

561
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,334
Well, Raymond's testimony hurts,
but it can't finish us off.

562
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:47,336
It's impossible to prove a lie.

563
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:49,921
Impeachment is inevitable.

564
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:54,134
Public opinion is the adversary
now. Facts no longer matter.

565
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:57,762
You should give Kern a call.
The personal touch.

566
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:01,682
If he came back to us, it might make
the other Democrats get cold feet.

567
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:07,354
China isn't helping. President Qian won't
return my calls. Beijing must smell death.

568
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:10,190
They're just exploiting
the situation for leverage.

569
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,611
Let's not worry about China for the moment.
One battle at a time, sir.

570
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:17,530
<i>Maybe I'm finished, Frank.</i>

571
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,741
Maybe I need to start accepting
that we won't pull out of this.

572
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:25,120
<i>Mr. President, I know you're tired. I know
this has been hell for you.</i>

573
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,081
And yes, impeachment
would be an awful blow.

574
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:30,584
We'd have to fight tooth
and nail in the Senate.

575
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:35,380
And yes, we'll have to beg and
compromise to regain our political capital.

576
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,760
But we have it in us, sir, no matter
how many scars it leaves us with.

577
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,970
It's not just us, Frank.

578
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,223
It's Tricia, it's my children.

579
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:51,645
I stay awake at night thinking
how much it would crush them,

580
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:53,772
seeing their father hauled off.

581
00:39:53,772 --> 00:39:56,357
Sir, that won't happen,
because I won't let it.

582
00:39:56,357 --> 00:40:00,152
If we're confronted by the worst, I'll make
sure you never step foot behind bars.

583
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:02,905
<i>You have my word on that.</i>

584
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:09,369
He's in the darkness now.
And I'm the only beacon of light.

585
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:12,956
Now we gently guide him
toward the rocks.

586
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:16,376
Mr. President,
you also still have my letter.

587
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:19,170
<i>It's not too late,
if you want to use that option.</i>

588
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,007
You're more useful to me
on the Hill than in handcuffs.

589
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:28,178
<i>I'll call Kern.
- Good night, sir.</i>

590
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,377
- How much did Green tell you?
- Enough that I showed up.

591
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,964
He probably didn't
mention Rachel Posner.

592
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,592
Don't worry, he doesn't know.

593
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:13,094
I do.

594
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:16,306
You have her in an
apartment in Joppa.

595
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:19,767
I have your movements,
I have your text messages,

596
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,437
before you destroyed your phone,
but that's more than enough.

597
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:29,026
I'll bet a lot of people would
like to know what she knows.

598
00:41:29,026 --> 00:41:32,112
Now you listen
to me very carefully.

599
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:37,200
Whatever you think you've got,
whatever you intend to do with it,

600
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,329
I don't respond to extortion
the same way that Green does.

601
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:44,623
What Green promised you...

602
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:47,626
...it can be undone
in a heartbeat.

603
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:50,545
That's why you're here,
to make sure it isn't.

604
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:56,426
You want my protection.

605
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:59,679
I don't trust Green,
or anyone at the bureau.

606
00:42:03,307 --> 00:42:08,979
- Who else knows about this?
- No one.

607
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:13,274
Why should I trust you?

608
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:17,820
'Cause we both
have too much to lose, man.

609
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:42,468
Get dressed.

610
00:42:42,468 --> 00:42:46,388
- What are you doing here?
- Put some clothes on.

611
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,059
- Why?
- Now. Let's go.

612
00:42:55,813 --> 00:42:59,233
Did anyone contact you?

613
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:02,778
- Where are you taking me?
- Answer my question.

614
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:06,323
No, nobody.

615
00:43:09,034 --> 00:43:11,870
There's someone
who knows about us,

616
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,289
who knows where you are,

617
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:16,499
and when we've met.

618
00:43:19,835 --> 00:43:22,922
Are you gonna hurt me?

619
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:25,799
Nothing's going to happen
if you tell the truth.

620
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:29,302
I am. I haven't been
contacted by anybody.

621
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:33,223
Stop lying, Rachel.

622
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:37,435
I will do whatever you want.
Please, just don't hurt me...

623
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:41,063
What I want is for you to answer
my questions, so I can help you.

624
00:43:41,063 --> 00:43:43,732
All you have ever done
is fuck up my life!

625
00:43:43,774 --> 00:43:46,151
You fucked up the Fellowship.
You fucked up what I had with Lisa!

626
00:43:46,151 --> 00:43:48,028
Even when I did what you asked!

627
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:52,198
Your sick fucking visits and
reading to you like a fucking child!

628
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:54,534
What is wrong with you?!

629
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:57,495
Why can't you just leave me be?!
Why do you have to be such a fucking...

630
00:43:57,495 --> 00:43:59,664
Stop!

631
00:44:41,744 --> 00:44:45,497
Rachel? Don't be stupid.

632
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:59,594
Rachel, everything's
going to be fine.

633
00:45:05,724 --> 00:45:08,769
All I've ever done
is try to protect you,

634
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:11,021
what I'm trying to do now.

635
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:15,525
You have to believe that.

636
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:18,111
I didn't have to.

637
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:20,655
It would've been a lot
easier if I didn't.

638
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:27,077
But I did. I did it,
because I...

639
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,168
What are you doing?

640
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,797
- Uh!
- Oof!

641
00:45:56,938 --> 00:46:00,441
Yesterday we completed hearings with
regard to articles of impeachment

642
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:02,568
for the president
of the United States.

643
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:05,529
The chair will now entertain
motions from the committee.

644
00:46:05,571 --> 00:46:09,908
- Mr. Chairman. - The chair recognizes
the congressman from Alabama.

645
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:13,244
I move that we put our
recommendation directly to a vote,

646
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:17,457
so that debate on this important
matter may take place on the House floor,

647
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:20,751
open to all 435 members.

648
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:26,215
Are there any objections
to bypassing debate in this committee?

649
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:28,258
We will now vote
on recommendation of the

650
00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:30,594
articles of impeachment
to the full House.

651
00:46:30,594 --> 00:46:33,263
Those in favor of
recommendation say "aye."

652
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:35,473
- Aye.
- Those opposed?

653
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:38,267
- Nay.
- The "ayes" have it.

654
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:41,395
This committee officially
recommends articles of impeachment

655
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:44,148
proceed to the House floor.

656
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,084
He's here.

657
00:47:33,693 --> 00:47:37,780
<i>The vice president is just arriving now
here at Camp David.</i>

658
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,783
<i>We expect President Walker
to speak within the hour,</i>

659
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:45,621
<i>announcing his official resignation
as president of the United States.</i>

660
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:02,178
- How are you?
- All right.

661
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:07,099
Mr. President.

662
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:10,185
I have coffee in the kitchen.
Would you like some?

663
00:48:10,185 --> 00:48:12,062
I'm fine.

664
00:48:20,278 --> 00:48:25,741
Well, you're about to become the
most powerful man in the free world.

665
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:30,328
- You don't have to do this, sir.
- I spoke to Kern last night.

666
00:48:30,328 --> 00:48:34,499
- He's not going to back down.
- So we'll beat him down.

667
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:37,960
No, Frank. My approvals
are at eight percent.

668
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,505
Even if I avoid conviction,
I have no mandate to lead, so...

669
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:46,301
...better I step aside with some dignity
so the nation can start to heal.

670
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:55,351
I can never fill
your shoes, sir.

671
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,690
You don't have a choice now.

672
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:11,324
Your letter.

673
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,001
Well...

674
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:26,213
...shall we go introduce the
46th president of the United States?

675
00:49:42,603 --> 00:49:48,233
Effective immediately, I am resigning
the presidency of the United States.

676
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:52,612
Tricia and I believe that this
is the best course of action,

677
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:55,865
not only for us
and our children,

678
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:57,950
but for country.

679
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,370
It's a sad day for us.
I can't deny that.

680
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,164
But I take solace in this:

681
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:09,586
Frank Underwood will bring
virtue, experience and courage

682
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:11,546
to the Oval Office.

683
00:50:11,546 --> 00:50:14,591
I have been blessed to have him
as my vice president.

684
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:18,010
But I'm even more blessed
to call him my friend.

685
00:50:20,429 --> 00:50:23,933
It has been...

686
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:30,188
...the greatest honor of my life to serve
this country as president.

687
00:50:30,188 --> 00:50:33,483
I thank my family, my staff,

688
00:50:33,483 --> 00:50:36,778
and all of those
who have supported me.

689
00:50:36,778 --> 00:50:38,946
Despite the last few months,

690
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:43,784
my faith in this country
has never been stronger.

691
00:50:43,784 --> 00:50:45,577
God bless all of you.

692
00:50:45,577 --> 00:50:49,081
And God bless
the United States of America.

693
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:53,626
Thank you, Mr. President.

694
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:12,519
Sir, please raise your
right hand and repeat after me.

695
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:17,607
- "I, Francis J. Underwood..."
- I, Francis J. Underwood...

696
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:21,319
- "...do solemnly swear..."
- ...do solemnly swear...

697
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,198
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

698
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:28,075
Madame Secretary.

699
00:51:28,075 --> 00:51:30,535
The rest of the cabinet
is awaiting you at the White House.

700
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:32,996
We'd like to give you a national
security briefing right away, sir.

701
00:51:32,996 --> 00:51:35,999
I'm aware of the particulars.
Please get Beijing on the phone.

702
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:39,669
Qian hasn't returned the
president's calls for two days.

703
00:51:41,003 --> 00:51:43,214
Well, there's
a new president now.

704
00:51:43,255 --> 00:51:46,717
Please get him on the line.

705
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:51,513
Two hours ago, President Underwood,
in his first act as commander in chief,

706
00:51:51,513 --> 00:51:54,766
gave orders to the Seventh Fleet
to vacate Japanese waters.

707
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:58,561
This was a result of a productive
conversation with President Qian,

708
00:51:58,561 --> 00:52:02,273
who gave similar orders to Chinese
naval vessels in the same region.

709
00:52:02,273 --> 00:52:06,318
- He moves quick. - Do you mean
with the Chinese, or with Walker?

710
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,571
<i>After a grueling night, the four
exiles make their way...</i>

711
00:52:11,114 --> 00:52:12,657
- Mr. Feng?
- What is it?

712
00:52:12,657 --> 00:52:13,867
US Justice Department.

713
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:15,618
We need you to come with us.

714
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:18,496
- Where?
- You're going back to China.

715
00:52:18,496 --> 00:52:20,456
- I have asylum.
- No, sir, you don't.

716
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:22,333
Your asylum has been rescinded.

717
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,835
I have it in writing.
Unconditional and permanent.

718
00:52:24,835 --> 00:52:26,503
Sir, I'm telling you,

719
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:29,047
your asylum has been rescinded.
Now, please,

720
00:52:29,047 --> 00:52:32,133
gather your things
and come with us.

721
00:52:34,135 --> 00:52:36,971
Revoking his asylum
will have consequences.

722
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:38,931
But we're solid
from a legal perspective.

723
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:42,893
Legally, yes. His initial paperwork
hasn't been processed,

724
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,979
and we can claim he poses
a threat to our national interests.

725
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:48,774
But it diminishes the integrity
of our State Department.

726
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:53,445
What's more important, Cathy,
integrity or peace?

727
00:52:53,445 --> 00:52:57,740
- You know they'll execute him.
- The Chinese are right about one thing:

728
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,285
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
the one for the many.

729
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:03,162
Let's get back to Washington.

730
00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:16,257
OK, please let me know.
Thanks very much.

731
00:53:16,257 --> 00:53:18,134
- Anything?
- Not yet.

732
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:20,261
See if you can track down anyone
from his regular AA meetings.

733
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:22,430
I spoke to the moderator,
he says he hasn't seen

734
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,849
Doug in several weeks. I checked all
the hospitals, his landlord...

735
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:28,769
- Sir, everyone's here.
- When this is all over,

736
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:30,353
I want you to work with
Nancy on finding Doug.

737
00:53:30,353 --> 00:53:32,272
I've already alerted
the DC Metro.

738
00:53:32,272 --> 00:53:34,899
- They put out an APB on his car.
- We'll find him, sir.

739
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:36,901
- Claire?
- Just outside.

740
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:38,736
Let's go, Nancy.

741
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:53,083
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President and the First Lady.

742
00:54:38,749 --> 00:54:41,210
Francis.

743
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,004
I know your birthday
isn't for a couple of weeks,

744
00:54:44,004 --> 00:54:46,173
- but I got you something.
- What's this?

745
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:48,091
Open it.

746
00:54:55,014 --> 00:54:57,600
I had a new one made.

747
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:03,689
- I love you.
