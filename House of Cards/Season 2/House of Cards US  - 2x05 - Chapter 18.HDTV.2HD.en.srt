2
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,679
Oh!

3
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,815
Come in.

4
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,652
Mr. Feng, it's time.

5
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:07,445
Ten thousand.

6
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,834
Let's go.

7
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,087
Here began
the last bloody march

8
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,671
toward Appomattox,

9
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,550
where General Grant met
General Lee for the first time,

10
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,635
and brave men bled to set
the course of history.

11
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:36,097
I'm so honored to be here
celebrating the 150th anniversary

12
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,724
of the Overland Campaign.

13
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,809
Thank you to County
Administrator Roberts,

14
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,020
to all the dedicated
re-enactors,

15
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,191
and of course
to Governor O'Keefe

16
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,985
for organizing such
a wonderful three-day event.

17
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:52,199
- That's all, sir?
- That's it. Short and sweet.

18
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,783
Or at least just short.

19
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:03,249
In Gaffney, people called it
the War of Northern Aggression.

20
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,793
I personally take no
pride in the Confederacy.

21
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:08,462
Avoid wars you can't win,
and never raise your flag

22
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:11,927
- for an asinine cause like slavery.
- He's on his way.

23
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:13,386
Fine.

24
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,559
- People will move on.
- They won't.

25
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,897
- The less you say, the more they'll dig.
- Let them.

26
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:29,569
- Willa, could you give us two seconds?
- I'll be right outside.

27
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,120
McGinnis happened in college.

28
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:42,248
The abortion
happened five years later.

29
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:46,128
- There aren't any medical records.
- None at all?

30
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,587
We specifically made sure.

31
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,296
A nurse, somebody
in the waiting room?

32
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:52,133
The doctor was
the only one there.

33
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,385
- Then where is he now?
- It's a long time ago, Connor.

34
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:59,141
He passed away. And if I'm not
worried, you shouldn't be.

35
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:03,226
Even still, sexual assault is
part of the conversation now.

36
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,186
Every article and column
mentions you.

37
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:08,439
If we offer nothing,
we can't shape your image.

38
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,902
I made it very clear,
I don't want exposure.

39
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:14,281
When we have something
new to say, we'll say it.

40
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:18,617
Willa? Any luck
with the Joint Chiefs?

41
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,829
The chairman's office still
says he's unavailable.

42
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,373
But they did offer to send the
director of the Joint Staff.

43
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:27,667
- Eleven a.m. tomorrow.
- Confirm it.

44
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:30,503
We'll meet in Francis's office
at the West Wing. Anything else?

45
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,880
No. I should get going.
Hit the road.

46
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,092
Thank you, Connor.

47
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,929
Get Congresswoman Brooks
on the phone.

48
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,683
And see if the First Lady will
be available this afternoon.

49
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:45,226
You want a brief on everyone
on the Chinese side of the summit?

50
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:49,983
No. What Durant's doing in Washington is a facade.
This is the real negotiation.

51
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,693
Give me what you have on Feng.

52
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:56,196
Xander Feng. Deep family
connections to the party.

53
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:58,823
Grandfather fought
side by side with Mao.

54
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:02,785
Big in the telecom industry. Estimated
net worth is over 50 billion.

55
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:06,331
- More than Raymond's.
- By a few billion, but who's counting?

56
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,833
Do they have any
other business partnerships

57
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:11,544
- other than the rare earth refinery?
- Not that I could find.

58
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,838
All right. Get a progress
update from Durant.

59
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,634
Tell her I'll be in touch as
soon as we know what Feng wants.

60
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,428
When a man like Raymond Tusk gets
involved in state diplomacy,

61
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,683
you can be sure he's not
after the Nobel Peace Prize.

62
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,560
He's an opportunist.
But so am I.

63
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:31,648
Maybe this is my opportunity to
loosen his grip on the president.

64
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,817
You must be the manager. Thank
you for having us. Good morning.

65
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:37,153
Mr. Vice President,
do you have any idea how long--

66
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:39,113
Any comments
on the talks with the Chinese?

67
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:40,781
Can we get a
comment on the summit talks?

68
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,660
The vice president will
be working from his room

69
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:45,662
for the remainder of the day.
All day.

70
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:02,512
Mr. Feng, it's a pleasure.

71
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:04,473
Likewise,
Mr. Vice President.

72
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,352
- Coffee? Tea?
- I have already been offered.

73
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:11,898
- But thank you.
- Thank you, Meechum.

74
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:18,862
It's a long flight from Beijing.
You must be exhausted.

75
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:23,617
I keep Western hours.
My midnight is your midnight.

76
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:26,788
So have you had a chance
to look over the proposal?

77
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:29,039
- I have.
- Shall we?

78
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,833
Page four.

79
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,463
- The refinery.
- With Mr. Tusk.

80
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:38,091
With the highest bidder.

81
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:42,345
We are prepared to offer
Clayton West a 40-year lease

82
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:47,641
on the Mei Mei rare earth elements
refinery, to which I will lend my name.

83
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,976
I understand that you and
Raymond are business associates.

84
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,728
But you're gonna have
to open it up to bidding.

85
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,899
Mr. Tusk will outbid
any competitors.

86
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,068
Well, even so, you know,
for appearances.

87
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,822
Yes. Appearances.
If you must.

88
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:06,034
- So there are no issues here, then?
- We may proceed.

89
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:10,289
- Page six.
- The bridge.

90
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,084
The committee on foreign investment will
approve a pilot infrastructure project

91
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:19,048
to build a bridge over the Long Island
Sound from Port Jefferson to Milford

92
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:23,051
in exchange for a 25-year
toll-taking contract.

93
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:27,096
Before we consider the bridge, there's
one more item I'd like to discuss.

94
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:29,140
Consider? I thought
the bridge was definite.

95
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,355
- Nothing is definite.
- This bridge is a priority-one item.

96
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:37,691
It's very important to your
president. I understand.

97
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:39,194
What would you like to discuss?

98
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:41,403
The currency manipulation suit

99
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:42,820
which you have filed against us

100
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,949
in the World Trade
Organization.

101
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,453
Which we are prepared to drop if
all other conditions are met.

102
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,871
The point of this meeting
is to allow us to say things

103
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,998
that cannot be said
in formal settings, yes?

104
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,586
- Yes, of course.
- We don't want you to drop the lawsuit.

105
00:08:57,587 --> 00:09:02,674
Forgive me, I...
I don't understand.

106
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,553
Do not back off in the WTO.

107
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,763
But you've been fighting us on
currency manipulation for years.

108
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:11,809
Free-floating
currency is inevitable.

109
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:14,855
Now I have something
I can work with.

110
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,106
- Why the sudden change of heart?
- Not sudden.

111
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,608
It has taken those of us
who are more forward-thinking

112
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,610
many years to convince
our counterparts.

113
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:26,197
But China could just do it.
I mean, you know as well as I,

114
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,911
- you don't require WTO ruling.
- Appearances, as you say.

115
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:36,458
It's important that it looks like America
forced us out, not that we gave in.

116
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,712
Well, I'll need a little more time
so that I can brief the president.

117
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,423
I'm here for
as long as necessary.

118
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:45,299
However you would like to
communicate, I leave that to you.

119
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,513
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
- Thank you, Mr. Feng.

120
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:57,771
In Gaffney, we had our
own brand of diplomacy:

121
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:02,110
shake with your right hand,
but hold a rock in your left.

122
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,572
Well, look who got
stuck with the pool.

123
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,949
We volunteered
because we hate ourselves.

124
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,536
- All's well on the Southern Front?
- No news is no news.

125
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,788
Come on. I hear there's
muskets out there.

126
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,582
When you giving us
something real?

127
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,542
We're here in beautiful
Spotsylvania, aren't we?

128
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,879
This is dress-up for
grown men with toy guns.

129
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,048
Sounds like 500 words to me.

130
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:29,469
Tell Durant that China won't discuss the
bridge unless we drop the WTO suit.

131
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,554
I thought you said
they want to keep it?

132
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:35,141
Feng does, which means Tusk does.
But we don't know if Beijing does.

133
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:36,642
You think Feng's lying?

134
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,394
An open currency could
free up interest rates,

135
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:40,980
reduce inflation in China.
They both profit.

136
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,982
If they're forcing
Beijing's hand, or we are,

137
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,903
- that could throw the summit into chaos.
- Exactly.

138
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:48,280
Look, Feng may
well have support,

139
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,448
but my guess is that the
Standing Committee's divided.

140
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,408
Either way, we'll
throw them off balance.

141
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:53,784
Let's leak we're
dropping the suit

142
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,702
as soon as Cathy presents it.

143
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:58,247
Just the lawsuit?
Nothing else in the leak?

144
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:01,586
A hint of Feng, but no names.
Let's let this grow on its own.

145
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,802
- How was that?
- Much better.

146
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,513
I feel good.
What do you think?

147
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:16,056
- I think you're ready.
- How long on the code?

148
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:17,682
Just a couple of bugs
to work out.

149
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,560
I told them tomorrow
or Wednesday.

150
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,770
- Work's not done.
- If I postpone again,

151
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:24,482
- don't you think it'll draw attention?
- It'll be done when it's done.

152
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,611
I'll email you when
the bugs are fixed.

153
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:29,738
Somewhere public.
Place and time.

154
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,495
Hey. Are you sure you
want to do this?

155
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,413
- I understand the risks.
- Well, you think you do.

156
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,207
This isn't the first time
I've been in danger.

157
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,833
Oh, yeah?
Paper cuts at the<i> Herald?</i>

158
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,419
Death threats. When I
exposed a drug ring in DC.

159
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,798
No, I read the articles.
That's small-time.

160
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,634
I almost had to go
into protection.

161
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:53,803
This is the FBI.
It's not a few street cops.

162
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:59,725
You think you're badass because you're
on some vigilante anarchy kick?

163
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:02,564
At least I have the balls
to put my name on the work I do.

164
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:08,067
You've never faced a hundred years
in prison, you self-righteous prick.

165
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:11,489
Most of my friends are locked up and
rotting away cause they poked the bear

166
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,323
one too many times. Why?

167
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:16,661
They wanted to expose government
surveillance, the PRISM program,

168
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:20,372
embezzlement, abuse,
fucking torture, lies.

169
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:24,001
You're a journalist? Who gives
a shit? We're fucking soldiers.

170
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:30,257
It's personal for me now.

171
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:33,135
I don't have a choice,
but you still do.

172
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,016
I don't have a choice.

173
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:47,607
- Where did you get this?
- You can say a source close to the Chinese delegation.

174
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,524
- Give me a name.
- All I know is that it's

175
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,652
a Chinese businessman with
ties to the Standing Committee.

176
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,654
- Back-channeling the summit.
- In Washington?

177
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:55,406
- I don't know.
- With who?

178
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,075
- I don't know that either.
- If I called the USTR's office,

179
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:01,912
- they'll confirm?
- I'm telling you as much as I know.

180
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:03,997
Why are you telling me
this at all?

181
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:06,461
They're going public with it tomorrow.
You might as well get the scoop.

182
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,336
Why me specifically?

183
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,546
You deserve better than a
Civil War reenactment.

184
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:14,093
Please don't pretend
you've suddenly become Santa Claus.

185
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,553
I give you something now,
maybe you remember.

186
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:21,142
- It's an investment in the future.
- I'm not big on favors.

187
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:23,603
I said "maybe."

188
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,276
Connect me to the USTR's office.
Skip the press secretary.

189
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,111
Tell them I want
to talk about the WTO suit.

190
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:36,447
- Who did you speak to?
- Connor.

191
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,868
- He's talking to Ayla Sayyad.
- How much did you fill him in?

192
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,539
- The bare minimum.
- I'd be a lot more comfortable

193
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,875
if it was you going directly,
as we discussed.

194
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:50,919
This puts distance on me,
which puts distance on you.

195
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,297
I want you to meet with Feng
tonight. No proxies.

196
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:56,302
- Understood.
- Now where are we with Mr. Goodwin?

197
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,805
Any day now.
Thirty-five to life.

198
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:04,685
Cyberterrorism.
The penalties are stiff.

199
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,853
- This needs to be clean, Doug.
- It will be.

200
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,897
One fall of the axe.

201
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:13,944
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,490
Well, I just think what
you did took so much bravery.

203
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:23,329
To go on air like that in front of the
whole country and say what you did?

204
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,539
That means a lot to me.

205
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,542
And I admire what you both have been
doing to advocate for the, well,

206
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:33,086
- for the victims.
- Women. Like you and me.

207
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:36,634
- Not victims.
- Men too. It's not gender-specific.

208
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,260
Well, yes.

209
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:44,932
- Would you consider pitching in?
- How?

210
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:50,104
It would send a strong message if we
had the First Lady in our corner.

211
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:55,150
- If you think I could help.
- Well, we have the head of the women's caucus.

212
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,110
Both wives
from the White House.

213
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:59,946
That's a meeting they couldn't
sweep under the rug.

214
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,783
And the fact that the chairman
sent anyone is promising,

215
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:05,621
but we need to make sure
our message gets back to him.

216
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:10,291
I just... I haven't been through
the same sort of experience.

217
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,625
Well, why should
that prevent you?

218
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,168
I don't know if I have a right

219
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:15,964
- to speak about it.
- You're the First Lady.

220
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,761
You have the right to speak
about anything you want.

221
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:23,136
- Mr. White?
- Mrs. Marbury.

222
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:25,681
- I'm Susan.
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

223
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:29,769
I know I'm a little off the beaten path.
Did you have any trouble finding me?

224
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,273
No, the directions were great.
Easy as pie.

225
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:35,818
Well, good. Come in.

226
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,989
I have to admit, I've been
looking forward to this all day.

227
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,866
I didn't realize you were
announcing so soon.

228
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:47,077
We've had some great luck
with the endowment.

229
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:51,415
Well, my husband didn't get much
recognition while he was alive.

230
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:56,338
I was so thrilled when Planned Parenthood
asked to name a fund after him.

231
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,048
We're thrilled that
you're open to it.

232
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:02,008
When you called, you said
you had some questions?

233
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,678
They're delicate. That's why
I wanted to come in person.

234
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,432
- Delicate how?
- There are a lot of people who will protest

235
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,810
this sort of financial
assistance to minors.

236
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:13,773
And we want to make sure
they have no cause to smear us.

237
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:17,442
People tried to smear my
husband his entire career.

238
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,821
He never let it affect
the work he was doing.

239
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:23,658
Did your husband ever perform
any illegal abortions?

240
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:30,037
I need you to answer me,
Mrs. Marbury.

241
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,458
Did your husband
perform any illegal abortions?

242
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,668
I won't discuss that.

243
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,838
- Nothing unreported?
- Young man.

244
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,343
You're not old enough to remember,
but there was a time when every--

245
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:47,555
What about any prominent figures who
the antichoice crowd could vilify?

246
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:51,435
- No. - Did Dr. Marbury perform
an abortion for Claire Underwood?

247
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:55,563
- No, he did not.
- I know for a fact that he did.

248
00:16:55,564 --> 00:17:00,443
That is not true. And I
would like you to leave now.

249
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:06,157
Forgive me, Mrs. Marbury. I haven't
been entirely honest with you.

250
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,997
My name's Seth Grayson. I don't
work for Planned Parenthood.

251
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,916
Mr. Feng?

252
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,337
There's speculation back home
that the back channel is you.

253
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,299
Two separate
articles in Hong Kong...

254
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,968
there's your name.

255
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,721
Do you want me
to contact the vice president?

256
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:31,975
No. Let him come to me.

257
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:34,645
Get Mr. Tusk on the phone.

258
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,691
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

259
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,571
I'm doing this for your
own good, Mrs. Marbury.

260
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:48,115
Imagine the media frenzy,
your husband's legacy destroyed,

261
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,619
the press hounding you
day and night,

262
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,831
and the Planned
Parenthood fund... gone.

263
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:57,083
How do I know you work for her?

264
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:00,586
That you're not just some right-wing
fanatic who wants to destroy--

265
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:04,550
Because I wouldn't have done you
the courtesy of paying a visit.

266
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:11,014
There would've been an army of satellite
trucks at your door instead of me.

267
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:14,309
Well, I won't tell anyone, if
that's what you're worried about.

268
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,271
I believe you.

269
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:21,442
Did your husband keep records
of any kind of who he assisted?

270
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:24,986
Anything at all? Notes?
Unofficial records?

271
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:28,699
- He kept a journal.
- Do you still have it?

272
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:47,718
- May I?
- Go ahead.

273
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:55,266
- I need to take this with me.
- Can't you just take out that page?

274
00:18:55,267 --> 00:19:00,021
Someone finds this with pages
missing, that could raise eyebrows.

275
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,983
There's 60 years
of his life in there.

276
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:06,653
From when we met until he died.

277
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:10,782
And do you want six decades
reduced to one night in August,

278
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,452
25 years ago?

279
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,620
Just imagine what it
looked like back then.

280
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,622
At the edge of the ridge was
a dense thicket which allowed

281
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:22,543
the Northern troops to come in
and form on the Mule Shoe.

282
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:26,463
The Southern regiments were entrenched
in this area at the apex of the line.

283
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:31,176
As you can see, the topography forced
the two sides down towards each other.

284
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:34,013
- This is the Bloody Angle?
- That's right.

285
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:35,597
I was reading
about it last night.

286
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:37,518
Close quarters,
hand-to-hand combat.

287
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,561
All told, about 15,000
Union and Confederate soldiers

288
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:43,562
lost their lives here
at the Bloody Angle

289
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:46,441
on a battlefield that's
only about half a mile wide.

290
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,611
Now, Mr. Vice President, we
have a surprise for you today.

291
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:53,032
I'd like to introduce you to
Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood

292
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:55,452
of the 12th Regiment
of McGowan's Brigade,

293
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:57,954
your
great-great-great-grandfather.

294
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,540
- I died here, in this battle.
- I think there's been a mistake.

295
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,417
My grandfather never mentioned
any Underwoods in the war.

296
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:06,672
We did our research. He
definitely fought and died here.

297
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:10,550
I was 24. And my son,
your great-great-grandfather,

298
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,718
was two years old.
I never met him.

299
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:15,180
It happened here?
At the Bloody Angle?

300
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,976
At the edge of those woods. My
skull was bashed in with a rock.

301
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:21,895
Thank you.
Now, over here,

302
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:24,732
we've got something that's
very interesting as well.

303
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,692
Just a moment.

304
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,575
- Tell me more.
- It was the middle of the night.

305
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:36,617
We were out of musket balls.

306
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:39,705
Just bayonets, and only
half of us had those.

307
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:43,666
I had nothing.
Just these hands.

308
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,503
So dark you
couldn't see nothin'.

309
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:50,049
But you could hear 'em,
the Yanks, running toward us.

310
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,175
Then you could smell 'em.

311
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:54,887
First Yank that brushed up against
me, I grabbed him by the throat.

312
00:20:54,888 --> 00:21:00,559
Fall down on the ground. I bit him
so hard I could taste the bone.

313
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:06,314
Then he grabs a rock, brings it
down right here. That was that.

314
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:09,859
I was buried in a mass grave.
No headstone.

315
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,737
Can we get a picture
with you and Augustus?

316
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,364
Yes.

317
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,748
Thank you.

318
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:32,465
- He takes it rather seriously.
- Oh, yeah, they all do.

319
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:37,219
Now up ahead we have examples of Confederate
ramparts that we've reconstructed.

320
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,930
You can see how they've cut the
timber and made the trenches.

321
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,060
Those trenches traded hands many
times over the course of the battle.

322
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:50,650
- You have keys?
- We own you. Yes, we have keys.

323
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:53,235
- Let me put some clothes on.
- Forget your clothes.

324
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:56,155
And I quote:
"You sure you wanna do this?"

325
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:59,199
And I quote: "I don't
have a choice, but you do."

326
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,118
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

327
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,330
He should know what
he's getting into.

328
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,584
Are those silk pajamas?

329
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,631
Looks even fancier in person.

330
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:17,511
Cashew.

331
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:21,306
No. Don't touch her.

332
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:25,392
Hey, there, little guy.

333
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,732
I've seen you before on camera.

334
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:34,528
Please put her down.

335
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,577
Don't take the chance.

336
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:47,039
I bought these shoes at J.C. Penney.
Seventy-two dollars with tax.

337
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,958
Rubber soles.
Can clean 'em off with a hose.

338
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,837
Please, you're hurting her.

339
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:56,007
I have a pet too.
His name is Gavin Orsay.

340
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,676
Sit!

341
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:03,057
I said sit.

342
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:12,566
Look what a good boy
you are, Gavin.

343
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,785
- Is that what you need me to do?
- Quiet.

344
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:27,121
When I say fetch, you fetch.

345
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:30,792
And now we are going to fetch
Lucas, just like we discussed.

346
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:36,172
If you try to bite my hand,

347
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:38,424
I will put you to sleep.

348
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:43,847
Mind if I take a couple?

349
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,201
Doug Stamper. I'm the vice
president's chief of staff.

350
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:08,162
I know. Sit down.

351
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,207
My grandfather fought
in the revolution.

352
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:15,253
China was poor then.
Sugar was hard to come by.

353
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,090
Now, sugar
is everywhere in China.

354
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:23,888
- Do you like Old Fashioneds?
- No, thanks.

355
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,056
I've seen the news.

356
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:29,766
Your government was enthusiastic
about us dropping the suit.

357
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:32,104
They've touted it as
a victory back home.

358
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:35,522
It is a victory.
But not the victory we wanted.

359
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,399
We're finding that
difficult to believe.

360
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,483
By "we" you mean
the vice president.

361
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:41,153
I mean the American government.

362
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:42,948
Which he proclaims
to represent.

363
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,783
He does.
And I'm representing him.

364
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,535
Don't inflate your status,
Mr. Stamper.

365
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:51,331
You're nothing
but an errand boy.

366
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:53,957
Do you have a message
for the vice president?

367
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,126
If he represents
the American government,

368
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,378
then why did he fail
to communicate my request?

369
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,755
We question your legitimacy,
Mr. Feng.

370
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:06,180
Nothing your delegation has done or said
has in any way supported your requests.

371
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:11,516
Mm... Smell that.

372
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:17,564
I use Macallan Rare and Fine, 1926.
Forty thousand dollars a bottle.

373
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:21,695
- You used to be an alcoholic, correct?
- Not used to be. Still am.

374
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:25,448
- A sober one.
- Do you miss it?

375
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,662
- Five thousand dollars you just spilled.
- I'll send you a check.

376
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:36,042
I like you, Mr. Stamper,
even if you're just an errand boy.

377
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:40,629
I'll ask you again. What is your
message for the vice president?

378
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,216
There will be no Port Jefferson Bridge
unless the lawsuit is reintroduced.

379
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:48,013
When you do, there will be those on
the Standing Committee who protest,

380
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:52,476
but I'll manage them.
The majority want reform.

381
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:56,603
I'll tell the vice president.

382
00:25:56,604 --> 00:25:59,482
Mr. Stamper, one more message.

383
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:02,275
Please remind the vice president
that we are both here at the behest

384
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:04,154
of our mutual friend, Mr. Tusk.

385
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:07,322
If the vice president
fails to cooperate,

386
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:08,783
I will simply bypass him.

387
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:19,585
- Yes?
- It's Doug.

388
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,171
Fine.

389
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:27,634
Spoke with Feng.
Here's your onion rings.

390
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:32,639
Did you know that General
Longstreet was shot here?

391
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,018
Accidentally by his
own men in the dark?

392
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,230
No, I didn't.

393
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:44,528
All right. Bring me up to date.
Where are we with Feng?

394
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,363
He wants us to
resume the lawsuit.

395
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:49,407
So he's sticking to his guns.

396
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,075
If we don't reintroduce it,
there's no bridge project.

397
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,578
Well, that will greatly
upset the president.

398
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,249
Do you want me to
deliver Feng's message?

399
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,042
Absolutely not.

400
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:02,044
We want the president angry.

401
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:06,466
The tricky part is making sure
he doesn't direct it toward me.

402
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:09,928
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Get ahold of Cathy's people.

403
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:15,558
Do not mention the lawsuit at all.
Have them bring up the bridge instead.

404
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,020
- Let's see if Feng is bluffing.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:25,400
We must learn from Longstreet.
He rode too high in the saddle.

406
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:28,322
If a bullet comes my way tomorrow,
it will not be an accident,

407
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:31,158
and I must be quick to duck.

408
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,203
Gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

409
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:39,414
Is the vice president
attending?

410
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:41,458
No, he's not. He's out of town.

411
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,339
I've just decided to use his office
because it's a bit bigger than mine.

412
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,257
Please, sit.

413
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:53,928
I know this isn't the first conversation
you've had about sexual assault.

414
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:57,516
We've had a very open dialogue with the
congresswoman for quite some time.

415
00:27:57,517 --> 00:28:01,894
"Open" is one way to put it. I think the
Joint Chiefs have tolerated my concerns--

416
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:04,772
To be fair, we've been quite responsive.
Over the past two years--

417
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:07,400
The congresswoman has
expressed her frustration to me

418
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:10,864
- that there's still room for improvement.
- Mrs. Underwood, if I may.

419
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:15,451
- Please.
- This is an issue we've grappled with seriously.

420
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:17,494
Increased education
and prevention measures,

421
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,787
restructuring
the reporting process,

422
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:22,457
insulating courts-martial
from abuse of power.

423
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:26,838
- It's still not enough.
- Civilian jurisdiction is not gonna happen.

424
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:33,887
We're all aware that's what the congresswoman
would prefer, but we won't allow our--

425
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:35,970
- Am I late?
- It's my fault.

426
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:39,017
The meeting got pushed up. I meant
to e-mail you. I'm very sorry.

427
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:42,186
That's fine. Please, sit.

428
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,189
We didn't know you'd be
attending, Mrs. Walker.

429
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,441
I'm sorry for interrupting.
Continue.

430
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:50,277
As I was saying...

431
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,575
...putting sexual assault cases entirely
in the hands of civilian courts

432
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:59,579
fundamentally erodes the military's
ability to self-discipline.

433
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,790
What about civilian oversight
instead of civilian courts?

434
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,584
That's a slippery slope.

435
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:08,253
There were those who said
the same of racial integration.

436
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:11,005
Integration didn't change
the core operational nature--

437
00:29:11,006 --> 00:29:14,135
But it did prove that the
military could shape its own evolution.

438
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,345
Absolutely. But in this case,

439
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:18,597
civilian oversight
is not the answer.

440
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:21,974
My husband is a
civilian who oversees the military.

441
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:25,311
Are you suggesting that
civilians can offer no guidance

442
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:28,481
- in matters like this?
- Forgive me, Mrs. Walker.

443
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:30,149
I didn't mean
to suggest that at all.

444
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,112
Then maybe you should
listen to the civilian

445
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:38,951
- sitting across from you.
- Yes, ma'am.

446
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:42,122
This is from your own sexual
assault prevention literature.

447
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:44,665
And in it, it says

448
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:51,213
in some cases it may be advisable
to submit than to resist.

449
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:55,885
I think it's quite clear that
there's still room for improvement.

450
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:04,226
Did you know about Xander Feng?

451
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:06,394
Not until I saw his name
on the wire.

452
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:09,897
He's been charged with corruption twice.
Both times, the charges were dropped.

453
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:12,024
Do you know what happens in
China if you're convicted?

454
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:14,110
- I'm guessing it's not good.
- You die.

455
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,903
- There you go.
- We're talking about a man

456
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:18,114
who's only one kangaroo court
away from lethal injection,

457
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:22,285
who's filthy rich and clearly corrupt,
and this is who the Chinese send?

458
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:24,623
- You are asking the wrong guy.
- Stop dodging.

459
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:27,709
I passed a note in class.
That's all.

460
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:31,252
<i>We placed</i>
<i>our faith in you, Frank.</i>

461
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:33,254
We still have the rest
of the day

462
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:36,215
- and all of tomorrow, Mr. President.
- <i> I need this bridge.</i>

463
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:39,135
<i>Otherwise we have to stall</i>
<i>my infrastructure program.</i>

464
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:41,304
No foreign investment,
no deficit reduction.

465
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:44,056
<i>And the Chinese know this.
They're using it for leverage.</i>

466
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:45,975
- Yeah, but for what?
- <i> That I'm not sure of.</i>

467
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:48,144
Then why did we send you
to Spotsylvania, Frank?

468
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:50,021
<i>You're supposed to have answers</i>
<i>to these questions.</i>

469
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:52,940
<i>Mr. President, I spoke</i>
<i>to Mr. Feng an hour ago.</i>

470
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:54,567
<i>- What'd he say?</i>
- Here comes the bullet.

471
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:56,736
<i>He claims that</i>
<i>Frank hasn't been</i>

472
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:58,490
<i>delivering</i>
<i>his messages properly.</i>

473
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:01,950
I have conveyed
his requests word for word.

474
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,160
<i>He says you've been</i>
<i>doing the opposite.</i>

475
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,204
Who is responsible for
the back-channeling here?

476
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:08,581
<i>- Me or Raymond?</i>
- You are, Frank.

477
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm simply here to facilitate,
not negotiate.

478
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,336
<i>And yet you continue</i>
<i>to have private conversations</i>

479
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:15,839
<i>- with Beijing's supposed emissary.</i>
- Listen, Frank...

480
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,008
<i>Are you prepared to trust
Mr. Feng's word over mine, Raymond?</i>

481
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,802
No one is doubting
your word, Frank.

482
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:23,054
<i>If Feng is truly representing</i>
<i>his government's interests,</i>

483
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,724
why is he telling Raymond one
thing and telling me another?

484
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:27,809
<i>How do you explain the</i>
<i>bridge falling through?</i>

485
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,729
He personally profits
from a free-floating currency.

486
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,566
Just as anyone would who's in business
with him, such as yourself, Raymond.

487
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:38,361
The refinery and the bridge
are two completely different issues.

488
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:40,822
Let's keep our focus here.
I want the bridge

489
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:42,824
back on the table.
End of story. Catherine?

490
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:45,242
<i>It'll be the first
item I bring up in the morning.</i>

491
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:48,413
<i>Frank, stay put for</i>
<i>now. But don't contact Feng.</i>

492
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:49,954
<i>And that goes for you too,</i>
<i>Raymond.</i>

493
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,374
I don't want any more
back-channeling

494
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,584
until the bridge is revived.

495
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,168
And Catherine, you communicate

496
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:55,963
- directly with me.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,715
We're done here.

498
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,926
The first drops of blood
have been spilt.

499
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:03,010
Bullet grazed my cheek,
but I haven't fallen.

500
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:05,263
Doug, find me a way
to meet Feng.

501
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:07,891
- We need to discuss something first.
- What's wrong?

502
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:11,145
I just got off the phone
with a guy named Seth Grayson.

503
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:19,611
- I've spoken to my husband.
- Doug told me.

504
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:22,198
- Thank you for fitting me in today.
- Is that it?

505
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:26,118
- August '86.
- And why should we trust you?

506
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,661
There was evidence that
Connor didn't make disappear.

507
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:32,542
I could've taken this to<i> Us
Weekly</i> and bought a new house.

508
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:35,836
Instead, I brought it to you.

509
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:39,633
And why didn't you apply when I
was interviewing candidates?

510
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:44,595
There was no point. Willa doesn't like me.
I intimidate her.

511
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,432
That journal is my
version of a résumé.

512
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:51,560
Or extortion.

513
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,103
I'm not extorting you,
Mrs. Underwood. I'm just...

514
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:57,982
...highlighting the difference between
a good choice and the right choice.

515
00:32:57,983 --> 00:33:02,278
And tell me, how would we handle the
repercussions of firing our comm director

516
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:06,073
- three months after we hire him?
- You don't fire him.

517
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:10,328
You tell him that you're bringing me
on board to help with the workload.

518
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:12,455
He stays on with you,
I cover your husband.

519
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,499
Connor will hate
working with me.

520
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,461
I'll arrange a job offer
elsewhere in a few months.

521
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:20,047
By the time it comes in,
he'll want to move on.

522
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:26,052
Connor knows. What's to prevent
him from going public?

523
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:31,142
I can handle Connor Ellis. You just
have to take me on my word on that.

524
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:36,647
Here's what I know.

525
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:41,610
It is far easier
for you to destroy me

526
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,780
than the other way around.

527
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,539
- I have to speak to my husband.
- Of course.

528
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:01,549
I didn't make any copies.
You have the only one.

529
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:23,945
Johnnie Walker Black. Neat.

530
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:29,659
- Where is it?
- It's in my pocket.

531
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,704
Come on.

532
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,041
- Is something up?
- No. We're good to go.

533
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:37,666
You seem nervous.

534
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,375
Just because I've been breaking
the law for 20 years

535
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:41,755
doesn't mean I don't
still get nervous.

536
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,298
- Gavin...
- Do not say my name.

537
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,052
Look at me.

538
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,100
This is gonna be fine. We've practiced.
I'm confident.

539
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:56,603
This is gonna work.

540
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:14,537
I got your drink.

541
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:29,676
He's more than qualified.

542
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:32,177
<i>What do your</i>
<i>instincts tell you?</i>

543
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:35,056
That I just don't want
to end up more exposed.

544
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:38,977
<i>Well, Grayson already knows. I mean,
we don't exhibit some degree--</i>

545
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:42,480
Have Doug look into him. Let's
see if there's some leverage.

546
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:46,067
Yeah, but we don't know what he'll find
or when or what he'll do in the meantime.

547
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,319
And that puts us
into uncharted territory.

548
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,155
<i>Connor will expose us</i>
<i>too if we let him go.</i>

549
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:52,615
Not if it goes smoothly.

550
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:54,119
<i>If we turn away Grayson now,</i>

551
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,995
<i>we can't predict anything.</i>

552
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:58,915
<i>And look, he has a lot less</i>
<i>to lose than we do.</i>

553
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,876
OK.

554
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:05,169
I just, I don't think
we can trust him, Francis.

555
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,797
<i>We wouldn't be having this conversation
if Connor had done his job.</i>

556
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,718
<i>I'd rather manage someone I don't
trust than someone who's reckless.</i>

557
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,719
Fine. What's the next step?

558
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,428
<i>I'd like to talk</i>
<i>to Grayson myself first.</i>

559
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:16,973
And then I'll have
Doug talk to Connor.

560
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,434
<i>- How are you doing?</i>
- You been following the news?

561
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:23,564
<i>- Is it bad for us or good?</i>
- Could go either way.

562
00:36:23,565 --> 00:36:27,527
<i>- I'm here if you need me.</i>
- I'm back tomorrow.

563
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,032
<i>- I love you.</i>
- Love you too.

564
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:37,327
- We all set?
- All set, sir.

565
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,164
Let's go.

566
00:36:57,098 --> 00:37:01,393
No, no. Turn those off.
Turn those off.

567
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:04,689
- Where is he?
- Right this way, sir.

568
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,652
- Did Augustus play?
- I like to think I did.

569
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:53,904
What's your name?

570
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,654
When I'm here,
I'm Augustus Underwood.

571
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:59,160
- What's your real name?
- Doesn't this feel real to you?

572
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:04,165
Will you show me where he died?
The exact spot.

573
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,211
I will, sir.

574
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,972
I'm gonna pay respects to my ancestor.
I would appreciate a little privacy.

575
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:22,142
- We'll wait here.
- Little John on the move.

576
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:30,275
- Just beyond those trees.
- Thank you. I'll be good from here.

577
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:52,212
We're fine.

578
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:55,633
- I hope you haven't waited long.
- It's peaceful here.

579
00:38:55,634 --> 00:39:01,597
- I didn't mind.
- Peaceful now. Fifteen thousand men died in these woods.

580
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:04,640
My grandfather's grandfather
died where we're standing.

581
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:08,771
- My grandfather was killed in the revolution.
- So I've heard.

582
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:14,485
Do you fear death,
Mr. Vice President?

583
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,903
No more or less than any man.

584
00:39:16,904 --> 00:39:20,573
It motivates me,
to experience everything.

585
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:22,533
Accomplish all I can
before it all vanishes.

586
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:25,369
I think you and I are
similar in that regard.

587
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:28,166
Then why are we working
at cross-purposes?

588
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:33,795
What you mean is, why am I not
submitting to you and Mr. Tusk?

589
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:35,420
You are sabotaging
the negotiations.

590
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:38,507
And you're using them
for your own personal ends.

591
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:41,260
Wrong. It's taken me
seven years to convince

592
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:43,428
the Standing Committee that this
was the right course of action.

593
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:47,099
A course of action that will
earn you and Tusk billions.

594
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,645
Why did you want this
meeting, just to attack me?

595
00:39:50,646 --> 00:39:52,563
To send a message to Raymond.

596
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:55,568
The president of the United
States and I are not his puppets.

597
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:57,277
Now, you tell him that.

598
00:39:57,278 --> 00:40:00,738
Fine. The bridge deal is dead.
There will be no saving it.

599
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:05,368
Stick a knife through its heart and put an
apple in its mouth. I won't shed a tear.

600
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,913
- Your president will ascribe the failure to you.
- I'll take the risk.

601
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:10,789
Think strategically,
Mr. Vice President.

602
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,960
You're setting us
on a very dangerous course.

603
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,885
Do you know how Grant
defeated Lee?

604
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,388
He had more men.
That's all.

605
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:27,057
And he was willing
to let them die.

606
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:30,643
It was butchery, not strategy,
which won the war.

607
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:33,689
Mr. Tusk and I have great
resources at our disposal.

608
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:39,111
Add up all your billions together
and you get the GDP of Slovakia.

609
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:42,489
I have the federal government
of the United States of America.

610
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,950
Your money
doesn't intimidate me.

611
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:47,953
The most that you can buy
is influence.

612
00:40:47,954 --> 00:40:51,748
But I wield
constitutional authority.

613
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,542
The strongest army
doesn't always win.

614
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,462
Mao started out
with only a few thousand men.

615
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:58,880
They took over
half a continent.

616
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:00,506
Mao is dead.

617
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:03,469
- And so is his China.
- But I'm not.

618
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,805
Not yet.

619
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:10,892
Don't forget, your ancestor
fought for the losing side.

620
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:13,396
There is no sacred ground
for the conquered.

621
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,958
We have over 9,000 servers here,
utilized by several hundred clients.

622
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:39,420
Everything from small businesses
to major corporations.

623
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:43,092
- What are some of the largest clients?
- The largest here is AT&T.

624
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:48,721
Their servers occupy more
than half of the floor space.

625
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,683
- Can you show me?
- Yeah.

626
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:53,353
Right this way.

627
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,412
Did you or did you not
meet with Feng last night?

628
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:15,122
<i>- Where is this coming from, Raymond?
- Answer the question.</i>

629
00:42:15,123 --> 00:42:18,376
I have not contacted him since
you and I spoke, Mr. President.

630
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:21,295
- Just as you instructed me to do.
<i>- Not according to Feng.</i>

631
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:23,881
I believe you were also instructed
to avoid him too, Raymond.

632
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:26,050
<i>He reached out to me.</i>
<i>I just answered the call.</i>

633
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:28,010
We had clear,
pre-arranged terms, Frank.

634
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:29,553
Months of back-channeling.

635
00:42:29,554 --> 00:42:31,596
<i>I am on the frontlines,</i>
<i>Mr. President.</i>

636
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:33,640
<i>And I can tell you firsthand</i>
<i>that we are dealing</i>

637
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:36,060
with a regime that
is not being forthright

638
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:39,397
and will seize upon the
faintest whiff of trepidation.

639
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:43,027
This is a test to see how far
they can push us before we break.

640
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,695
Do not play their game.
End the talks.

641
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,696
<i>We can't overreact here.</i>

642
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:49,698
Well, they walked away
from the Joint Commission.

643
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:51,325
<i>We can walk away</i>
<i>from the summit.</i>

644
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:53,702
The economic fallout
would be catastrophic.

645
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:56,287
- The market will--
<i>- Or we can just kowtow and submit</i>

646
00:42:56,288 --> 00:42:59,124
- to the new reigning superpower.
<i>- Don't be hyperbolic.</i>

647
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,835
Well, we are dealing with one
quarter of the world's population.

648
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:05,089
Mr. President, you would
be making a disastrous mistake.

649
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,759
Where are your allegiances, Raymond?
To Xander Feng or to the United--

650
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,929
<i>- Don't you dare question me--</i>
- All right. Silence.

651
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,475
<i>There were two</i>
<i>mistakes. Both of them mine.</i>

652
00:43:14,476 --> 00:43:17,102
The first was allowing you,
Raymond,

653
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:19,186
to enlist one of your business
partners for these talks.

654
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:21,313
- I was trying to--
<i>- The second</i>

655
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:23,441
<i>was enlisting you, Frank.</i>
<i>Instead of clarity,</i>

656
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:25,276
<i>we got miscommunication.</i>
<i>That's poor diplomacy.</i>

657
00:43:25,277 --> 00:43:26,818
Mr. President, listen...

658
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,448
I have listened to both of you.

659
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:31,324
And all I've heard
is accusations.

660
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:35,536
Now, if neither one of you will take
responsibility, I will. We're pulling out.

661
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:39,290
<i>And it's not because you suggested
it, Frank, it's because you've made</i>

662
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:44,088
<i>such a mess of these negotiations I have
no other choice than a show of strength.</i>

663
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:47,715
You both disappointed me...
greatly.

664
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:52,430
- Mr. President?
<i>- The president has left the call.</i>

665
00:43:57,143 --> 00:44:01,271
<i>Raymond, are you still there?</i>

666
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,442
That's the first time he's
ever hung up on me...

667
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:09,362
<i>- ...in 20 years.</i>
- Oh, I feel for you.

668
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,948
Goodbye, Frank.

669
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,412
And the butchery begins.

670
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:21,332
It's all the way down this row
and the next seven rows over.

671
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:25,671
- You wanted to see inside one, right?
- Yeah. That would be great.

672
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,343
Go ahead.

673
00:44:31,344 --> 00:44:33,845
There's not much to it,
actually.

674
00:44:33,846 --> 00:44:35,806
Just a lot of
hard drives and wires.

675
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:39,142
So, in terms of backup,
if the power goes down,

676
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:43,061
some natural disaster hits like a
storm, or an earthquake, what exactly--

677
00:44:43,062 --> 00:44:44,563
- On the ground.
- No, no--

678
00:44:44,564 --> 00:44:46,775
Right now.
I said on the fucking ground.

679
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:56,701
Why don't you ride back to DC with me?
We need to discuss something.

680
00:44:56,702 --> 00:45:00,413
- What's up?
- We'll talk about it in the car.

681
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:05,544
Today, we break earth on the
Overland Campaign Visitors Center,

682
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:10,382
so that generations to come
will fully absorb the importance

683
00:45:10,383 --> 00:45:12,384
of this hallowed ground,

684
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:16,430
the wilderness
where the campaign commenced.

685
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:25,105
Augustus,
would you do the honor?

686
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:43,165
And now, a moment of silence
and prayer for the dead.

687
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:11,110
Thank you.

688
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:15,740
And God bless
the United States of America.

689
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,122
I just heard.
We got Lucas Goodwin.

690
