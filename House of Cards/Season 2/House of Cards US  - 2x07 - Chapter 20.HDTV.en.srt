00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:11,974
<i>Jackie Sharp.</i>

2
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:13,975
<i>Terry Womack.</i>

3
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:18,354
<i>Bob Birch.</i>

4
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:22,693
<i>President Walker has surrounded himself
with a broken Congress.</i>

5
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:26,530
<i>He even brought one of them
into the White House.</i>

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,117
<i>Now, they've broken the economy and
put us on a collision course with China.</i>

7
00:00:31,117 --> 00:00:33,453
<i>Put a stop to them
before it's too late.</i>

8
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,289
<i>Send a message at the midterms.</i>

9
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,751
<i>Let's start fixing the country.</i>

10
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,754
<i>Paid for by Friends
of a Better America.</i>

11
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:47,675
Twenty-five million?
Out of thin air?

12
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:49,635
- That's our estimate.
- Where is the money coming from?

13
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:51,637
- Super PACs.
- These are issue-based attack ads.

14
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,722
- So who's giving to them?
- We can't trace the money

15
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:55,474
until this quarter's
filings come in.

16
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:57,976
We get killed in the midterms,
we can kiss 2016 goodbye.

17
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,855
You can deal with the Republican
majority and a Republican president.

18
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,523
We're trying to counter
with D-trip.

19
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:03,983
Make 25 million appear
out of nowhere?

20
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,984
- We can make a dent.
- Dents don't cut it.

21
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,362
No matter how fast we ramp up
fund-raising, we can't close the gap.

22
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,780
- We have to stop their money flow.
- I want to know how.

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,949
Locate the source
and then cut off the tap.

24
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:15,827
With this influx, you can be sure
that somebody's not playing by the rules,

25
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,495
but we can't whistle-blow
until we find the source.

26
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,207
Then find it. And you sure
as hell better find it soon.

27
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:23,293
In the meantime, I've been working
on a proposal to counter the attacks.

28
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,128
I've coordinated
national messaging effort.

29
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:26,713
I'll be sending copies
later today.

30
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,715
We should be open to every idea.

31
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:30,007
Now, go. Get to work.

32
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,515
Frank.

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,896
You were supposed
to steer Congress on my behalf.

34
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:47,316
- No one is as concerned as me.
- I should've kept you in the House,

35
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,485
like Raymond suggested
from day one.

36
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,944
But you've been distracted,

37
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,655
by the Senate,
the State of the Union,

38
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,323
meddling with foreign diplomacy.

39
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,575
- You asked me to negotiate...
- I know what I've done.

40
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,871
- And I know where it's gotten us.
- Sir, the attack ads are not

41
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,498
- a result of anything...
- You're scrambling from fire to fire

42
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,752
- instead of preventing them.
- I'm not the FEC, I can't wave a wand...

43
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,797
Give me more than excuses,
Frank! You're better than that!

44
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,175
- Or maybe you're not.
- If you need a punching bag,

45
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:19,221
I will stand here and take the punches,
as I have done time and time again,

46
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,766
since I swore my oath.

47
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,977
But I would much rather
get back to work, as you've asked me to do.

48
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,896
You are out of line, Frank.

49
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,900
Dismiss me or keep swinging,
Mr. President.

50
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:34,194
You're dismissed.

51
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,739
Thank you, sir.

52
00:02:41,535 --> 00:04:15,334

53
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:21,923
Dan Lanagin switched teams.

54
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:24,802
That doesn't make any sense.

55
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:28,722
I couldn't find any anomalies
among big Republican donors,

56
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:30,265
so I checked our own.

57
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:32,559
Lanagin hasn't given
a dime this quarter.

58
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:36,479
Yeah, but not giving isn't the
same as giving to the Republicans.

59
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,274
His casino's accounts.
Ernst and Young.

60
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:44,738
Eighteen million for donations,
and they're not going to us.

61
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:46,948
How did you get
your hands on those?

62
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:50,535
I've got friends.
That's why you solicit my services.

63
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,536
The estimate for
the ad buys was 25 million.

64
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:54,538
Those accounts are
up-to-date as of June 30th.

65
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:57,791
They could've made
more donations since then.

66
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:02,337
Tusk.

67
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:07,259
Lanagin's casino is in Missouri.

68
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,012
- Raymond Tusk?
- He's got an axe to grind with me

69
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:13,807
- and with the president. - I've never seen
his name on any FEC filings.

70
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:18,311
He doesn't make political contributions.
That's how he remains flexible.

71
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,897
You think he's funneling
the money somehow?

72
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:25,152
I don't know.

73
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:27,612
Get yourself to Kansas City.
I want you in that casino.

74
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:30,114
- Yes, sir.
- I'll keep digging.

75
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,326
Get me my wife.

76
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:36,287
- Where'd you get the recipe?
- My father taught me.

77
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,998
- You and your dad were close?
- Nah.

78
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,458
Cooking ribs was the only thing
that motherfucker did right.

79
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,630
- I guess you can't print that.
- I have ways.

80
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,506
This really gonna
be in the paper?

81
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:49,425
Well, at least in Boston, yeah.

82
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,719
Don't see why
anybody would care.

83
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,304
Well, it's a personal
interest story.

84
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:58,642
Vice President of the United States
comes here, of all places.

85
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:03,354
- You mean this shithole?
- That's not what I said.

86
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:05,065
It's OK.

87
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,943
It's not the Taj Mahal.

88
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:11,947
- How long has he been coming?
- About 20 years now.

89
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:15,158
- He's a good man, Frank.
- You still call him Frank?

90
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:18,911
Hey, in this joint, I'm the president,
the vice president and the Congress.

91
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:23,165
He just another customer.
A loyal one.

92
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,833
You think that's
why he likes it here?

93
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,003
'Cause you treat him
like a regular person?

94
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:32,049
Maybe. Mostly it's
the fuckin' ribs, though.

95
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:36,929
Now, if unemployment goes up more than
two-tenths, I want the Fed to consider...

96
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:09,419
- Get you something, hon?
- Club soda with lime, please.

97
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,796
- That's it?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:14,674
- Nothing to eat?
- No. That's it.

99
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:18,302
Tough spot to hang out
if you're in the program.

100
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:22,931
- How'd you know?
- Takes one to know one, right?

101
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:26,561
- How long?
- Little over a year. You?

102
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:28,396
Going on 15.

103
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:33,358
- Any luck with the ponies?
- None. Not yet.

104
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:37,946
- Pick a number, one through 12.
- Nine.

105
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:44,744
- Hot Fuzz.
- Sounds about right.

106
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:49,166
Club soda comin' up, darlin'.
With lime.

107
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,502
<i>Hasn't moved, last two hours.</i>

108
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:55,004
And he hasn't spoken to anybody?

109
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:57,465
Just been betting on the races.

110
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:01,260
- You want us to bring him in?
- No.

111
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,304
That's the vice president's
chief of staff.

112
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:08,142
- Really?
- We don't want to make a scene.

113
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:10,478
Just keep an eye on him.

114
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,357
Let me know what he does,
where he goes and who he talks to.

115
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:16,942
You got it, Mr. Lanagin.

116
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,778
<i>You should've seen their faces.</i>

117
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:21,780
<i>They didn't know what to think.</i>

118
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,365
Especially when
I made them hold the bag.

119
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,700
- You tried it out?
- I sure as hell did.

120
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:32,249
- I'm sorry I lashed out at you, Frank.
- No. I was disrespectful,

121
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:35,627
- and that was uncalled for. - My temper's
gotten away from me these days.

122
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:39,631
I need to be jolted back
into reality sometimes.

123
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:44,677
- It was a... a kind gesture.
- Just some good ol' fun.

124
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:47,346
Tricia tells me we're having
dinner, later this week.

125
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:49,182
Yes, Claire tells me the same.

126
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:53,102
Well, it'll be good to get out
of this place for a few hours.

127
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:06,239
It's been here since Kennedy.
It was painted the same year he was born.

128
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:09,910
It depicts, I think,
a World War I parade.

129
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,622
Well, I should know
every painting.

130
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:16,416
Well, you seem to
know quite a lot, at least about this one.

131
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:21,212
I try to soak it all in
while I can. All the history.

132
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:25,007
Presidents who obsess over
history obsess about their place in it,

133
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:29,304
- instead of forging it.
- Who said that?

134
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:32,515
I did... just now.

135
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,812
The White House.
All day long it's buzzing,

136
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:42,233
and at this hour
it's so... desolate.

137
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:45,986
The presidency is a great
and precious thing.

138
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,865
Loneliness is the price.

139
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:50,866
Let's assume...

140
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:57,039
...in one of these chairs,
staring at this wall,

141
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,500
is where Truman decided
to drop the bomb,

142
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,253
and see if we feel anything.

143
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,892
Nothing. You?

144
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,688
No, nothing.

145
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,032
Sorry, it's a mess.

146
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,327
- You don't have to clean up for me.
- Yes, I do.

147
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:43,375
Wouldn't want you seeing these.

148
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,170
I wore 'em last night.

149
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:54,011
You like these, or you want the ones
I'm wearing now?

150
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:11,194
- How long you been working in the casino?
- Too long.

151
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:16,449
- Bet you've seen a lot.
- Oh, yeah. I've seen everything.

152
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,301
- I should get going, got an early meeting.
- OK.

153
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,224
You want me to stay?

154
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,478
I wasn't planning
on sleeping here.

155
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:53,485
So... another one-night stand,
then.

156
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:58,865
- Is that OK?
- Not really my thing.

157
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:02,618
- Come on, you must play the field.
- No, I don't.

158
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:06,956
- But you are such a flirt.
- I flirt, yes.

159
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:10,334
But I only sleep with
someone if I'm into them.

160
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:11,836
And I prefer to stick around.

161
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:15,047
Remy Danton, serial monogamist.

162
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:16,882
Is this a joke?

163
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:22,179
I'm sorry. I didn't...

164
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,598
Sorry.

165
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:32,773
This doesn't happen again
unless it's leading somewhere.

166
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:37,652
I'm upfront about what I want.
In all things, not just politics.

167
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:48,204
Three or four times a year, they fly in
about a dozen Chinese guys, money to burn.

168
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:50,706
They got a whole floor of the
casino reserved just for them.

169
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:52,625
<i>Word is they
throw away millions.</i>

170
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,627
That doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

171
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:56,629
The Chinese love to gamble,
especially the rich ones.

172
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,798
<i>Yeah, in Vegas.
This is Missouri.</i>

173
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:03,677
<i>- It's a much longer flight.
- I wanna find out...</i>

174
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:06,096
I want to find out where these
planes are coming from.

175
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:09,057
<i>- Who do we know in the FAA?
-  I don't know anyone, but Doyle does.</i>

176
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:12,353
<i>I already got him on it.
I'll text you when I hear back from Doyle.</i>

177
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:13,562
I gotta go.

178
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:16,982
You leaving?

179
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,989
Yeah. Thanks for last night.

180
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:28,201
- I had fun.
- No, you didn't.

181
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,453
You were thinking
of somebody else.

182
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,467
I got that one after ten years.

183
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,180
Hope it brings you some luck.

184
00:13:57,062 --> 00:14:01,483
Elaine Brooks will be sponsoring and the
First Lady has approved the early draft.

185
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,361
Jackie, take a look at the board.
Get a sense of who might cosponsor,

186
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:08,615
- besides yourself. - Absolutely. I'm sure
we can lock down a lot of heavyweights.

187
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,200
Lorrie and I will
get right on it.

188
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,201
We should talk
about a media plan.

189
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,288
- It's premature for that.
- Don't we want to get this out,

190
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,289
start building support
as soon as possible?

191
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,875
- Events, interviews?
- I want what's most effective.

192
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,836
A media blitz is the wrong way to go.
You want a single long lead

193
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:24,380
that coincides with the introduction
of the bill. Something classy.

194
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,966
- But you want broad support, to hit...
- A blanket strategy will

195
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,634
galvanize as many detractors
as supporters.

196
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,386
Not if the message is framed...

197
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,388
We want a key demographic
to get on board, and then...

198
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,932
- Let me finish, please.
- Then we let it percolate.

199
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:36,476
<i>I suggest Matt Bai,
The New York Times Magazine.</i>

200
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,644
I like that idea.
I like that very much.

201
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,648
So do I. Can you speak to Matt?
No promises. Just test the waters.

202
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,067
- Happy to do that. - I've got a
good relationship. I'll call him.

203
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:48,653
Great. Seth, you keep me posted
and let's all get together later this week.

204
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:49,779
Thanks, Jackie.

205
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,752
I want you to read the bill
and write me a summary.

206
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:07,255
Do not, under any circumstances,
share it with anyone until we've spoken.

207
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:11,509
- Don't want to go over the board first...
- No. Not yet.

208
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,393
Anything on the abortion?

209
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:22,645
Nothing.
It all checks out.

210
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:25,689
- One hundred percent?
- I turned over every stone.

211
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,941
- Mrs. Underwood was telling the truth.
- We need something.

212
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:31,862
- This is taking too long.
- The Underwoods are careful.

213
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:34,031
If they have skeletons,
they're buried deep.

214
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,826
Not a question of "if." Somebody like
Frank is gonna have skeletons.

215
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,703
Then I'll find them.

216
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:43,582
If you don't deliver, that means
I don't deliver. And I always deliver.

217
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:47,002
You gave me an assignment
with high expectations. I will meet them.

218
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:51,089
But it's not gonna happen overnight.
So don't fuck with me.

219
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,177
I'm a hired gun.
Not one that you own.

220
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:58,221
As long as you hit the target.

221
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,306
Then I need a favor.

222
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,809
- Connor Ellis.
- What about him?

223
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,770
I'll have more access
if he isn't around.

224
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,564
Arrange a cushy job offer
for him somewhere.

225
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:13,527
- Private or public sector?
- Private. Lots of money.

226
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,322
Something he can't turn down.

227
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:18,282
I'll see what I can do.

228
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,539
Here, this is half.

229
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,125
You can pay me when I've gotten
you what you want.

230
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,419
I don't take half pay
for a job half done.

231
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:46,726
- It's an interesting proposal.
- What we're missing is a unified theme.

232
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:49,937
If we coordinate on national ad-buys,
organize crossover events,

233
00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:52,648
develop fund-raising apps,
I think it would go a long way...

234
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:54,567
Maybe, but I doubt the
leadership will go for it.

235
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,986
Which is why I'd like your
support. I set up a meeting.

236
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,072
If you came, and you
supported my position...

237
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:01,949
I just think they're gonna end up saying
we can't be thinning out our funds

238
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:05,536
on a national strategy. This is about
fieldwork, getting out the vote.

239
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,538
Right, but isn't it worth
at least some consideration?

240
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:11,458
Well, you know me, Linda,
I mean, I'm all for bold ideas.

241
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,420
But Birch and Womack, why,
they're... set in their ways.

242
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,882
I doubt very seriously that...

243
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:23,595
Listen, Frank, all I'm asking is that you
play devil's advocate with them.

244
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:25,180
Sorry, excuse me for a moment.
This is important.

245
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,765
I don't want
to short-shrift this.

246
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:28,725
No, I know, but I just
have to send this text.

247
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:30,476
I am busy too.

248
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,283
- Make sure that's an aisle seat.
- Of course.

249
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:47,076
I don't feel as if you're
taking this very seriously.

250
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:49,870
Linda, I apologize. I am sorry.

251
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,748
You are absolutely right,
I did not mean to sound curt.

252
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:55,876
And you are right,
this is important.

253
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,545
You and I should
go through your proposal

254
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,964
and discuss it right
down to the last detail.

255
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:02,591
I am not asking you to go
through it page by page,

256
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:05,094
just to help me initiate
some meaningful dialogue.

257
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:08,472
- You can count on my help, Linda.
- Thank you.

258
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:13,351
- I will have my scheduler
reach out to yours. - Thank you, Linda.

259
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,895
Get me a secure line, please.

260
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,317
The vice president
is on the line.

261
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,489
Mr. Vice President.

262
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:30,493
Normally, I would ignore your call,
but I am in a good mood today.

263
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:34,163
<i>- Not even you could ruin it.
- Are you funneling
money to the Republicans?</i>

264
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,415
What on earth
are you talking about?

265
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,960
<i>About 20 million
in GOP Super PACs.</i>

266
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,712
You know I never make
political contributions.

267
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,798
That's the fastest way
to upset my investors.

268
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,799
I know the money is coming
from a casino in Missouri,

269
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,718
and I know
it's coming from Feng.

270
00:18:47,718 --> 00:18:50,512
<i>Mr. Feng and I have
one co-venture together,</i>

271
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:51,888
<i>and it has nothing
to do with gambling.</i>

272
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:53,098
A plane that he owns

273
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,933
<i>flies to Lanagin's casino</i>

274
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,353
<i>- on a regular basis.
- What he does on his own time</i>

275
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,773
- is no business of mine. - Are you trying
to create chaos in the ranks?

276
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:05,819
The Republicans appear to be doing
a fine job of that without my help.

277
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,030
Well, it's not gonna work, Raymond.
It'll bind the Democrats together,

278
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,367
- not pull us apart. - What has bound them
together the past decade has been

279
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,286
the means to achieve a majority.

280
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:18,832
<i>- If I had to guess...
- He stacked Congress.</i>

281
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:22,168
The majority I whipped.

282
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,339
So it's been you,
Raymond, all along,

283
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,759
<i>even when Lanagin's money
was coming to us.</i>

284
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:33,804
You keep making assumptions
that I have denied.

285
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:36,139
Once the quarterly filings come
out, anybody with a laptop

286
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:39,143
- is gonna see what's going on.
- The end of September.

287
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:44,189
<i>That's a long way off.
But I look forward to seeing the reports.</i>

288
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:49,778
Should make for some very interesting
reading two weeks before the midterms.

289
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:52,447
You cannot bully your way back
to the table, Raymond,

290
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,866
just as you cannot
buy the keys to Congress.

291
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:58,954
Best of luck keeping your
majority in the House.

292
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:01,706
I know how much it means to you.

293
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,293
When the money's
coming your way,

294
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:07,795
you don't ask any questions.

295
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:11,549
But now it's clear. Lanagin's
never been anything but a front.

296
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,386
Do I tell the president? No.

297
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,721
He'll wonder why I didn't know,
which makes me look uninformed.

298
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:22,101
Or he'll blame the messenger for involving
him, which makes me look careless.

299
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:25,980
I know it's a trap.
I must keep this to myself.

300
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,108
He wants to know who
you are buying on behalf of.

301
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,527
It's a hedge fund named
Mercury Capital. It's unlisted.

302
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:42,246
They need the names
of the principal investors.

303
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:44,498
Tell him I have
to protect identities.

304
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:51,462
The broker needs more.
He wants a full investor list.

305
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:54,006
Say, um...

306
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:57,051
Say that the principal investor
has strong ties to the White House.

307
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:05,601
And they want to know
if you represent Clayton West.

308
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:07,645
Clayton West?

309
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,236
- He's waiting.
- One second.

310
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,120
- What does it say?
- It's about a refinery in China

311
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,415
for rare earth elements.

312
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:32,961
Tell him yes. Tell him the principal
investor is Raymond Tusk.

313
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:37,048
...Raymond Tusk.

314
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,809
<i>This is Doug Stamper...</i>

315
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:53,939
- What should we serve the Walkers?
- Cyanide.

316
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,942
Saving that for dessert.
What about a main course?

317
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:01,155
Meat of some sort? Vegetables?

318
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:04,950
I mean, this isn't really
my area of expertise.

319
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,995
I was thinking,
what about Freddy?

320
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:12,040
- Ribs?
- Or is that gauche?

321
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,295
No. I like the idea.

322
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,968
Well, we can do the
nice china, gourmet sides.

323
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,595
But I think the ribs
make it more personal.

324
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,431
I'll make the call.

325
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:32,143
- Any word on the call you're expecting?
- Not yet.

326
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,271
I don't think he's landed.

327
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,649
This is really coming
along, isn't it?

328
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,069
You think it's childish.

329
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,821
I think it's better
than video games.

330
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:05,592
- Do you have my check for $5,000?
- Next time I get a raise.

331
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:09,846
- Bad luck at the casino?
- So Tusk knows I'm here.

332
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:14,017
- Daniel Lanagin knows you're here.
- Is Tusk involved?

333
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:17,311
- Why would I admit that?
- Tusk is in business with you.

334
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,523
You're sending money to Lanagin.
Lanagin's casino is in Tusk's backyard.

335
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:25,028
You didn't fly halfway around
the world just to confirm suspicions.

336
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:28,656
- Tell me what you want. - We want the
money to stop flowing to the Republicans.

337
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:31,575
- And what do I receive?
- I've told you what we want.

338
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:35,079
- Now it's your turn.
- So you can mislead me again?

339
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,166
Things have changed.
We have nothing to gain by misleading you.

340
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,919
Hm...

341
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,547
What do you think of my garden?

342
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:48,175
It's very beautiful.

343
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:52,012
When you only talk business,
you stop appreciating beauty.

344
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:56,099
- I don't have much time for beauty.
- That's a shame.

345
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:00,728
For people like you to smell the
flowers, some of us have to pull the weeds.

346
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:04,441
- When do you plan on leaving?
- I haven't bought my return ticket yet.

347
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:10,446
Good. I'd like to think on this for a
night. And I'm sure you must be exhausted.

348
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,281
Would you do me
the honor of being my guest?

349
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:16,994
- I'd be very grateful.
- Excellent. You can get some rest.

350
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:21,081
And if you like, there are many beautiful
things to enjoy here.

351
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:27,088
Please.

352
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:02,621
- Sir? Mr. Grayson is here.
- Seth.

353
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,667
You and I haven't really
properly had the chance to sit

354
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,418
and have a chat
since you came on board.

355
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,587
Is there anything
I can be doing better, sir?

356
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:12,131
No, no. I'm impressed.

357
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:15,676
You're very smart.
Excellent work ethic.

358
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:20,806
- But more importantly, you're
very observant. - Information is power.

359
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:24,226
It was right here in this room
that my...

360
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:28,647
...wife revealed a great deal of
information to a great number of people.

361
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,525
- Millions of them.
- Sir, if your concern is my knowledge

362
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,360
of any discrepancies,
let me assure you...

363
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,945
Claire and I are private people.

364
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:38,573
I can understand
why you might mistrust me.

365
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:41,784
I'm also observant,
like you, Seth.

366
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:45,705
But I still have my blind spots.

367
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:50,835
It would have never occurred to
me to reach out to Mrs. Marbury.

368
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:55,673
Her husband was dead.
He kept no records.

369
00:25:55,673 --> 00:26:01,428
And yet, there it
was in black in white.

370
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:06,726
I respect the fact that you brought it
to us, that's what got you in the door.

371
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:12,022
But if you wanna stay,
I need more.

372
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:18,320
What exactly are you up to?

373
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:22,740
I was hired by Remy Danton.

374
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,286
He wants anything damaging
that I can find.

375
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,915
- Does he have a copy of the journal?
- No copies.

376
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:33,960
I gave the original to Mrs. Underwood,
and I told him that her story checks out.

377
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,004
- Did you give him anything else?
- I don't have anything else.

378
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:38,547
I wouldn't give it
to him if I did.

379
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,382
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

380
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,551
Well, you're the vice president
of the United States.

381
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:44,386
Remy works for Raymond Tusk.

382
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:47,348
That puts me between two
extremely powerful people.

383
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:50,309
- I had to be careful.
- I'm sure that Remy's offering

384
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,437
- you a great deal of money.
- But that's all he offers.

385
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:57,107
When I saw you push entitlement
reform through the Senate,

386
00:26:57,107 --> 00:27:00,986
it was clear to me where
the real power in the White House is.

387
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:07,284
I want to work for a man like you, not
sail a yacht. Money doesn't interest me.

388
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,165
Do you want me to cease contact
with Remy?

389
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:19,087
No. I want you to find
the blind spots.

390
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:22,673
- Is he free?
- For a few minutes.

391
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:24,842
- Thank you.
- Mexico City,

392
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,303
where you'll meet
President Soto.

393
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:27,887
We can practice your Spanish on
the plane.

394
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:30,848
Hi.

395
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:33,893
- What is that?
- Frank gave it to me.

396
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:36,312
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, is it important?

397
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:38,314
I have a meeting with...
When is it?

398
00:27:38,314 --> 00:27:41,525
- He's already in the waiting room.
- The archbishop of New York.

399
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:44,402
I'm just wondering if we should
bring a gift to dinner tonight.

400
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:46,822
Yeah, well, it's casual.
Maybe a bottle of wine?

401
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:49,783
You know them well. Any idea
what sort of wine they like?

402
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:52,828
Well, not extremely well,
but I'm friendly with their staff...

403
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,413
- I'll figure it out.
- I can make a call.

404
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:55,789
I'm having a conversation

405
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:57,290
with my husband, but thank you.

406
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,959
- OK. I apologize.
- I'll see you at the residence.

407
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,128
Seven-thirty.

408
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:45,545
No. Not now.

409
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:49,550
No. Just... Please go.

410
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:55,805
Get out. Please.

411
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:58,866
Rachel, it's me. I...

412
00:30:00,576 --> 00:30:04,580
You should answer when I call.
I don't like leaving messages.

413
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:09,043
- Seth.
- Ayla.

414
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,878
I get 15 minutes to eat,
on a good day.

415
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:13,214
- Xander Feng.
- Means nothing to me.

416
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:15,132
Connor told me about a
back-channel with China.

417
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:17,384
There was speculation it
was a guy named Xander Feng.

418
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:20,262
- Fourteen minutes, 52 seconds.
- He's in business with Raymond Tusk.

419
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:23,556
They're working on a refinery in China.
Tusk has ties to the White House.

420
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:26,059
- Fourteen minutes, 30 sec...
- One of the wealthiest men in America

421
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:28,437
in business with an off-the-books
Chinese diplomat?

422
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:31,314
Influence in Washington
never been reported?

423
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:33,567
The White House pushes rare earth
subsidies when the energy crisis spiked?

424
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,819
Do you have a specific
question for me?

425
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:37,654
I'd like to ask
the vice president.

426
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:40,531
A specific question for me,
not an interview request.

427
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:43,743
Does the vice president
know Raymond Tusk?

428
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:46,620
- Not to my knowledge.
- You're hiding something, Seth.

429
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,583
I'm not hiding anything.
I'm just a guy with low blood sugar.

430
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,463
- Garrett?
- Hm?

431
00:30:57,631 --> 00:31:02,177
- What is it?
- Christina.

432
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:04,679
She won't leave me alone.

433
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,390
It's like she's trying
too hard to be helpful.

434
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,145
- I'll have Linda talk to her.
- It's not just that.

435
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:15,107
I feel like it's a mask. I feel like
there's something else going on there.

436
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:19,569
- Like what?
- Sometimes, when I walk into your office

437
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,947
and see her talking to you...

438
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,408
...and you've been traveling
together so much.

439
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:29,663
- Jesus, Tricia.
- Oh, not you, her.

440
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:34,083
I think she's attracted to you.
And she does have a history...

441
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:37,461
I can't even believe we're
having this conversation.

442
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:40,422
I want you to relocate her.
Find her another position...

443
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:42,716
- Absolutely not.
- I know it seems overboard...

444
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:45,135
She's a good aide.
She's valuable to Linda,

445
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,220
- valuable to the administration.
- I'm your wife.

446
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,849
- I should be more valuable than them.
- Tricia.

447
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:52,101
I don't understand why you're
fighting me when she bothers me...

448
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:54,520
We're pulling up to Frank's
in two minutes.

449
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:05,321
Really, superb, Freddy.

450
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,699
I can honestly say I have
never had better ribs in life.

451
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:10,786
Well, I'm glad you
liked you them.

452
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:13,580
<i>You know, I read the article in the Sun
about how you go to Freddy's.</i>

453
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,541
I hope you don't mind me speaking
to that reporter, Frank.

454
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,543
- Not at all.
- Shit, I forgot I'm not supposed

455
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:20,545
- to call you that.
- I wouldn't let you call me

456
00:32:20,545 --> 00:32:23,214
"vice president" even if you
tried. And I didn't mind at all.

457
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:24,799
I thought the article was great.

458
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,967
It's been a big bump in business
since it came out.

459
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,219
I'm talking lines
around the block.

460
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:32,515
You're not the only white person
to show up there now.

461
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:36,435
Well, I'm gonna call it a night.
I got a early start in the morning.

462
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:40,689
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. President, Mrs. Walker.

463
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,233
- A pleasure. Truly.
- Thanks, Freddy.

464
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:46,027
Always.

465
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:47,737
Oh, no. None,
none for me, thanks.

466
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:50,031
Mr. President, a slice
of pie is good for the soul.

467
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:53,035
- I'm stuffed.
- You can have a slice of pie.

468
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:55,996
I'm fine, really,
but thank you, Frank.

469
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:58,456
I'll have some.

470
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:01,125
For the two of us, as well.

471
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:05,421
Oh, now she is gonna make me run
another five miles to work off this puppy.

472
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:07,757
Are you crazy?
I can barely keep up with you.

473
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:10,884
- You're so much faster than me.
- You two run together?

474
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:13,388
Yes. It's hard to find the time,
but somehow we find it.

475
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:16,182
We do. And it's something
that's just ours, you know?

476
00:33:16,182 --> 00:33:20,269
Yes. Just ours.
And about eight Secret Service Agents'.

477
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,772
That's so nice
that you have that together.

478
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:26,608
I wish Garrett and I had more
time for things like that.

479
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:28,610
We did take a spinning class
together once.

480
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,071
- Should've seen Garrett hunched over...
- Please.

481
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,244
- Would you like some more wine?
- I would, thank you.

482
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:39,579
- I saw the punching bag you gave him.
- You know what?

483
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:43,249
- I will have a slice of pie.
- Pie, please, for the president.

484
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:47,837
Thank you.

485
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:54,469
I read it front to back. It's good.
It'll cause a shit-storm,

486
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:57,347
- but maybe that's what we need.
- Not during the midterms.

487
00:33:57,347 --> 00:34:01,225
I don't see how we take flack.
We're trying to curtail rape, for godsakes.

488
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,936
Sure, some right-wingers
will do their usual song and dance...

489
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,604
Hold off. I want
to read it myself first.

490
00:34:05,604 --> 00:34:07,940
We promised the vice president
we'd have cosponsors...

491
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,275
I know what we promised,
and we're gonna stall.

492
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,904
- Don't disseminate the draft.
- But you know the gist of the bill.

493
00:34:12,904 --> 00:34:15,239
- I don't see why we can't...
- Lorrie.

494
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,701
All right,
I'll leave it with you.

495
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:21,745
- Anything else?
- No. I think we're good.

496
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:23,872
All right. Then I'm off.

497
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,209
Date night with the husband.
Slit my wrists, please.

498
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,671
Hey, go home at some point, OK?

499
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:35,050
The Capitol will still
be here in the morning.

500
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,891
This is really something.

501
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:30,102
Ways to go yet.

502
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:32,563
Now, who won this battle?
The North or the South?

503
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:36,276
Massive casualties on both
sides. No clear winner.

504
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:38,569
How do you find the time?

505
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,198
I carve out a half hour here
and there. Helps me relax.

506
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,242
I've forgotten the meaning
of that word.

507
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:47,619
Well, that's what the
punching bag is for.

508
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,871
It's very true.

509
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:56,837
Just a little. Trish and
I should get going soon.

510
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,217
You're never gonna make it
through this first term, Mr. President.

511
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:06,054
- How do you mean? - Well, not like this.
Letting the stress creep in.

512
00:36:06,054 --> 00:36:08,806
You need to run the marathon,
not the sprint.

513
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:11,934
You need to enjoy
these little moments of escape.

514
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:17,190
You can pour more than that.

515
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,526
Thank you.

516
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:27,074
- This Union or rebel?
- Union, sir.

517
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:30,661
Enough "sirs" and "Mr. Presidents."
Call me by my name.

518
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:33,622
I respect the office
too much for that.

519
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:35,083
When we're in private, it's OK.

520
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,251
Tonight, I don't have
to be president.

521
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:40,671
I don't mean to get
involved in your personal life.

522
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:44,133
Oh, no. I brought it up.

523
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,803
Is this really about Christina?

524
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:52,140
Or maybe it's just
a symptom of something else?

525
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,769
- Like what?
- I don't know.

526
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,317
I barely see him at all.

527
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:06,487
He's so wound up in everything
that's going on overseas,

528
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:09,448
the elections, the economy.

529
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:12,368
When he was governor,
it wasn't a cakewalk,

530
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:16,164
but it was nothing like this.

531
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:20,585
How do you and Frank do it?
You both seem so close.

532
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:26,131
We're honest with each other.
We don't sweep anything under the rug.

533
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:30,761
Trish, if it's eating at you,
make him talk about it.

534
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:36,016
The White House is finite.
Your marriage... is for life.

535
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,445
- Good morning.
- Morning.

536
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:54,408
- You don't like your soup?
- I'm not good with chopsticks.

537
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:00,039
I think you'll like this soup
more than you liked

538
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:02,333
the two companions
I sent you last night.

539
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:06,462
I was tired.

540
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:09,715
Have you had a chance to think
about what we discussed yesterday?

541
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:15,345
In China, it's polite to refuse a gift the
first time. Maybe I should refuse yours.

542
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:18,307
We can't offer you a gift
if I don't know what you want.

543
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,311
The Port Jefferson Bridge.

544
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:24,938
You pulled it,
during the back-channel.

545
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:28,400
- I changed my mind.
- Why?

546
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,697
I have allies who want the bridge.
Without it, they become my enemies.

547
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:39,119
- I've been put on trial twice.
- Corruption charges.

548
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,164
Everyone in China who works
on this level pays who they need to pay.

549
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:46,250
And they kill who
they need to kill.

550
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,005
People disappear all the time, Mr. Stamper.
I could disappear. You could disappear.

551
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:56,510
Stop the junkets
and we'll get you the bridge.

552
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,429
The bridge comes first.

553
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:00,932
The vice president
has lied to me before.

554
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:05,644
I need proof of his commitment.
Then the money will stop.

555
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:11,942
Please, Mr. Stamper... eat.

556
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,319
You have a long
flight ahead of you.

557
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:22,828
If it's what you
feel you need to do.

558
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:25,288
I've had a great experience
here, Mrs. Underwood,

559
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:27,999
but this is an opportunity
I can't pass up.

560
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,084
- I imagine the pay is substantial.
- It is.

561
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:33,671
But it's not just that.
There's room to grow at SpaceX.

562
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,423
Well, if your mind's made up,
I won't try and convince you to stay.

563
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:40,428
The truth is...
when I first came on board,

564
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:43,222
I thought it was to work
for both you and your husband.

565
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:46,600
Don't get me wrong, it's been
an honor working for you,

566
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,395
but I didn't foresee
having to work with Seth.

567
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:52,231
- You're not very fond of each other.
- No.

568
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,524
Which is fine.
We're professionals.

569
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:57,110
But I think this is
for the best.

570
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,448
Well, the problem with hiring great people
is everyone wants to steal them away.

571
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,450
I appreciate you
being so understanding.

572
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,703
- You'll be missed, Connor.
- Thank you.

573
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:16,629
Seth, it's me. He just left.
Talk to him and put out a press release.

574
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:20,258
Let's make this
as smooth as possible.

575
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:22,886
<i>It's two opportunities
I'm interested in.</i>

576
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:28,599
A family-oriented restaurant chain,
and a retail barbecue sauce.

577
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,892
What would that look like?

578
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:31,227
We give you an upfront payment

579
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:32,937
for the right to use your brand.

580
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:35,397
Either venture fails,
or if they both do,

581
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:40,236
- you still get to keep that money.
- How much money we talking?

582
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:43,572
Ninety-five thousand
as soon as you sign.

583
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:47,826
And then you'd have a share of
the profits if we're successful.

584
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:52,080
- What would the shares be?
- I tell you what.

585
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,792
Let me draw up papers, you look
them over, you show them to your lawyer.

586
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:59,546
- I don't have a lawyer.
- You should get one.

587
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:02,257
I don't want you to feel
like you're being cheated.

588
00:41:03,216 --> 00:41:05,302
You're skeptical.

589
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:09,806
Look...

590
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:13,684
Money usually don't
come through that door,

591
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:16,270
unless it's looking
for a plate of ribs.

592
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,772
And we want to sell
thousands of those plates.

593
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:20,859
Millions, if the
franchise builds.

594
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:24,779
<i>The Sun article
put you on the map.</i>

595
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:28,449
Let's fill up that map
with Freddy's BBQ Joints.

596
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:38,249
- What are you looking at?
- Excuse me?

597
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:43,130
The knives are in the kitchen,
you have a pistol. You can stop staring.

598
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:50,261
Is he in here? Dan!

599
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,430
- How are you?
- Good.

600
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,223
- Care for a drink?
- I'm good.

601
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:56,601
Well, let's go into the
living room. It's more cozy.

602
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:59,353
- I'm just fine where I am.
- All right. Thank you.

603
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:01,147
Yes, sir.

604
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:07,278
I'm sure you've told Raymond
that I asked you here.

605
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:10,197
- Raymond who?
- Oh, you don't have to pretend, Dan.

606
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:13,242
- Feng confirmed what you're up to.
- Name doesn't ring a bell.

607
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:17,120
I have flight records. One of his planes
to Kansas City on multiple occasions.

608
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,206
Do we really have
to play this game?

609
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:22,752
I came here because I thought
you might have something to offer.

610
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:24,795
Why don't we just skip
to that part?

611
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,675
You've been
a loyal contributor, Dan.

612
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:34,637
You've thrown us fund-raisers, there are
pictures of you and I shaking hands.

613
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:38,433
So whatever you've done this
quarter can be forgotten.

614
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:42,062
But I need the money to stop
flowing in the wrong direction.

615
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:46,107
- I'm still waiting for the offer.
- You're a businessman, Dan,

616
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:48,818
- I know your primary concern is profits.
- That's right.

617
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:53,197
But I'm offering you something that's
far more valuable than money:

618
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:57,534
- a direct line to the White House.
- That sounds vague to me.

619
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:01,331
I have influence over the BIA,
over federal gambling legislation.

620
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:05,042
The sort of influence that my
contributions have already bought.

621
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:09,588
Not with my direct involvement
and the president's ear.

622
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:11,673
You know what
I like about money?

623
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:15,844
I can stack it on a table,
like this one.

624
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,430
I can measure it
with a yardstick.

625
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:23,227
I can see it, smell it,
buy things with it.

626
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:28,607
Houses, cars, clothes.
Things that are real.

627
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,651
You're gonna have to show up
with more than beads.

628
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:35,571
Dan, I invited you to my home
because I thought...

629
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,991
- Through the back door.
- Excuse me?

630
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,286
Through the back door,
like a servant.

631
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:44,038
The Secret Service makes
everyone come in that way.
It's a precautionary measure...

632
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,166
Unless you can offer more money
than Tusk, and I don't think

633
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,961
that you can, there's little
left for us to talk about.

634
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:54,590
I am offering you an alliance
with a man who goes to work

635
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,885
everyday at
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue!

636
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:02,181
I don't place my faith
in any white man.

637
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,934
Especially one that works
for the federal government.

638
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,270
I am just like you, Dan.

639
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,189
I know what it means
to start from nothing, to have to fight...

640
00:44:11,189 --> 00:44:14,818
You know nothing about
what it means to be me.

641
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:19,405
Your version of nothing
was light-years ahead of where I started.

642
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:21,324
I respect you, Dan.
I take you seriously...

643
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:25,870
I'll let you know when I give
a fuck about your respect.

644
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:29,749
Holliday! Show Lanagin out.

645
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,085
I know where the back door is.

646
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:41,260
Francis?

647
00:44:49,602 --> 00:44:53,772
It's not broken.
I can fix it.

648
00:44:57,525 --> 00:45:00,111
Leave it.
I'll clean up later.

649
00:45:08,203 --> 00:45:12,916
Let's go for a run.
Burn off some of this steam.

650
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:21,674
Sir?

651
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:24,886
- I'll be out in a moment.
- I'll go ahead. You catch up.

652
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:27,305
Why didn't you reach out,
before you got on a plane?

653
00:45:27,305 --> 00:45:29,599
I was afraid our communication
might be monitored.

654
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,977
- Where are we with Lanagin?
- Nowhere. Where are we with Feng?

655
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:36,647
We might have an option,
but it's gonna be tricky.

656
00:45:54,164 --> 00:48:14,758
