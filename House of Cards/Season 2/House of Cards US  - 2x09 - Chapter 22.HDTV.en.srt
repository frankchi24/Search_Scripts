00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,120
Hey, Freddy! How ya doing?

3
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,330
- Hey.
- All right, that's what I like to hear.

4
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,251
- My man.
- Catch you later, brother.

6
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:52,020
I spoke to everyone
I know at the<i> Daily.</i>

7
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,147
Nobody's naming sources,
but it has to be Remy.

8
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,566
- Is Galloway going on the record?
- He wouldn't.

9
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,152
- Not without speaking to us first.
- Let's be sure about that.

10
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,072
- I'll talk to Adam.
- Maybe it's smarter to avoid contact.

11
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:04,825
Somebody has to respond,
whether it's him, or us, or both.

12
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,702
We have to coordinate,
and do it carefully.

13
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:08,870
Let me take care of this.

14
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,580
Well, let's just
think this through.

15
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,836
- I've got it covered, Francis.
- OK.

16
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:17,629
What should I do?
Head back to the office?

17
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,840
You should work here.
We can't avoid the press if you leave.

18
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,758
- All right. You hold down the fort.
- Yes, sir.

19
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:24,219
- And you follow Claire's lead.
- We'll shut this down, sir.

20
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,805
- There can't be any doubt.
- Let's walk through a timeline.

21
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:29,099
- So you first met him when?
- Whitney Biennial...

22
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,642
This hurts us both.

23
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,853
But it's not my wound to suture.

24
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,438
Claire must be the surgeon.

25
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:36,857
Only she can stop the bleeding.

26
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,486
You know we got
them plates in there.

27
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:43,280
All the changes
you asked for.

28
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,657
Gave you five more points
on the post-recoupment share.

29
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:48,160
Approval over all the
marketing materials.

30
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,371
Approval over the staff hires of the
flagship in Silver Spring.

31
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:55,792
- So, what next?
- You sign.

32
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,837
- And I get my $95,000?
- By the end of the week.

33
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,965
Just have to wire it from our
main account into the LLC,

34
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,925
cut a cashier's check for you.

35
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:06,469
Oh. I want to show you this.

36
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:08,513
It's a mockup of
the bottle design.

37
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:12,392
And we already started
on the concept layouts

38
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:15,312
for the
Silver Spring location.

39
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:22,027
- Why's that linoleum peeling up?
- To make it seem real.

40
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,530
Well, I wanted it
to look nicer than this.

41
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,368
We can scratch the peeling linoleum,
but we don't want it to look too nice.

42
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:33,121
You want them white folks
to feel like they slummin' it.

43
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:37,000
- No, to have an authentic atmosphere.
- And I get to play the nigger.

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,252
Look, Freddy,
you know how this works.

45
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,588
They don't just want the ribs,
they want the experience,

46
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,798
but without having
to leave the suburbs for it.

47
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:46,384
We're not selling
candlelit dinners here.

48
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:50,472
But I promise, nothing gets
built without your signing off.

49
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,816
<i>So,</i>
<i>what do you want me to do?</i>

50
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:05,403
- I need you to deny it.
-<i> The affair?</i>

51
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:09,115
The affair, taking the
photograph, everything.

52
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:12,744
We have a public history.
I donated work for your...

53
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:14,704
<i>You can say we had</i>
<i>a business relationship,</i>

54
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:17,248
<i>but that you didn't</i>
<i>take the picture of me</i>

55
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:19,584
in the bed.

56
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:23,880
It was Photoshopped.
Whatever it is you need to say.

57
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,801
I'm so sorry, Claire.
I only have one print and it's still here.

58
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,054
<i>You have to destroy</i>
<i>it. The digital file also.</i>

59
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:34,224
<i>- But e-mail us a copy first.</i>
- Why?

60
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:38,019
We need to make sure that there's nothing
in the image that links to your studio.

61
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,563
<i>Whatever</i>
<i>you think is best.</i>

62
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,649
Thank you, Adam.

63
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,446
I watched you...

64
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:51,866
<i>...when you did</i>
<i>the CNN interview.</i>

65
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:56,621
<i>I promised myself I wouldn't,</i>
<i>but I couldn't help it.</i>

66
00:06:56,621 --> 00:07:01,459
<i>It's a shame it takes this</i>
<i>for us to talk to one another.</i>

67
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,587
You're well, besides this?

68
00:07:04,587 --> 00:07:08,883
<i>Yeah. I spent three months in Colombia
after you came up here to work,</i>

69
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:11,052
<i>but also to get away.</i>

70
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:14,848
<i>- I met someone.</i>
<i>-</i> Oh.

71
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:18,810
<i>She's from Bogotá.</i>
<i>She's working for an NGO there.</i>

72
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,981
<i>Her name's Inez.</i>
<i>She's living with me now.</i>

73
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:26,693
Wow. That...
Things happened quickly.

74
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:30,238
<i>Yeah. They did.</i>

75
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,116
I should go.

76
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:35,452
So I won't talk to the press

77
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:37,370
until I get instructions.

78
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,123
<i>That's right.</i>

79
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:44,461
- It's good to hear your voice.
- You too.

80
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,635
- You finished?
- Yeah.

81
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:20,622
- Smack, crack, blow.
- No, thanks.

82
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:22,707
Come on, old man.
We got what you need.

83
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,500
I don't need anything.

84
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,794
Gotta buy somethin'
if you want to get inside.

85
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:30,173
- Get out the way.
- What?

86
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:34,594
For real. You need to get
the fuck on outta my way.

87
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:37,722
I'm just fuckin'
with you, nigga.

88
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:41,184
Chill the fuck out.

89
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:03,623
- Who are you?
- Your grandfather.

90
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,583
Open up.

91
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,211
<i>- What's your plan?</i>
- Work from home.

92
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,755
You don't need me dragging
this circus to the White House.

93
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,590
<i>I mean in terms</i>
<i>of a statement.</i>

94
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,842
We're drafting one.
Short and sweet.

95
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:17,387
<i>Forgive me, Frank,</i>
<i>but you know I have to ask.</i>

96
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,555
If it were true,
I would tell you, sir.

97
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,141
<i>Would you like me to go on</i>
<i>record? Say I stand beside--</i>

98
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,769
No, no, no. I appreciate that,
Mr. President, but you shouldn't

99
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,397
dirty your hands
with this sort of garbage.

100
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:33,361
If the press corners you, just tell them
you don't engage in gossip mongering.

101
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:37,031
Sir, it seems Mr. Galloway
is about to appear on television.

102
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:39,158
<i>Go. Let me know if there's</i>
<i>anything I can do.</i>

103
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,910
Thank you, sir.

104
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,579
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>I have very little to say.</i>

105
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,499
<i>Only that I never had any</i>
<i>romantic involvement</i>

106
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,419
<i>with Claire Underwood,</i>
<i>and that I did not take</i>

107
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,713
<i>the photograph printed</i>
<i>in the</i> DC Daily.

108
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,923
<i>I'm sorry that the vice</i>
<i>president and his wife</i>

109
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:56,134
<i>have to go through</i>
<i>this ridiculous ordeal.</i>

110
00:09:56,134 --> 00:10:01,180
<i>And I would ask that the media leave
both my fiancée and me out of it.</i>

111
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,598
<i>Thank you.</i>

112
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:05,560
You'll be ready
in an hour?

113
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,520
- Yes. We'll be ready.
- Uh...

114
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,021
You might want to change
into something more...

115
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:10,940
- Conservative?
- Uh, yes.

116
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,276
I'm gonna go throw
the hounds a bone.

117
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:20,408
- I know it's demeaning...
- Not another word.

118
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:22,452
I should've been
more careful.

119
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:26,330
We'll put this behind us,
just like we've always done.

120
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:32,628
- Part of me wishes...
- What?

121
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:35,506
That you'd be more upset.

122
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:40,178
Tusk came after you
because of me.

123
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,889
It's you who
should be upset.

124
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,978
Wasted energy, isn't it?

125
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,063
For both of us.

126
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:54,859
Shall we rehearse?

127
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:00,406
- I don't need your help.
- This ain't a handout.

128
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:04,118
You have to pay me back
over time. Work for it.

129
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:07,538
Work for you?

130
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,832
I'm gonna get the
house either way.

131
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,959
Whether you choose
to live in it is up to you.

132
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,961
Yeah, just what I need.
You in the easy chair,

133
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:16,047
laying into me every time
I come in and out the door.

134
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:21,511
The place is for you and DeShawn.
I'm gonna be at my own apartment.

135
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,554
You sure this nigga ain't
just sellin' you smoke?

136
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:28,434
Says it right in the contract,
95 Gs no matter what.

137
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:33,356
I don't know, man.

138
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:36,859
I mean, five years I don't see you,
then you come knockin' on the door,

139
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,819
- talking about you got 95 Gs?
- Your choice.

140
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,197
You didn't want me
to visit you no more in jail

141
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:43,491
- and you didn't want to see me after.
- Still don't wanna see you.

142
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:44,992
Well, here I am.

143
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:47,662
Get the fuck outta here,
old man.

144
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:53,125
You listen to me, boy.

145
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,127
I never had nothing
to give you.

146
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:59,298
I didn't have no money,
and you didn't want whatever I had.

147
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:01,759
But we talking
about a house.

148
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,680
DeShawn deserves to live better
than in a place like this.

149
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,267
This ain't about him.
It's about you.

150
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,562
You know where to find me.

151
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,483
See you, kid.

152
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,406
- Less than 30 minutes.
- Are they going to deny?

153
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:25,908
I'm gonna let the vice president
and his wife speak for themselves.

154
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:29,578
- Have they been in contact
with Mr. Galloway? - No, they haven't.

155
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:31,664
Why has it taken them
almost a full day to respond?

156
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:34,667
I'm sure you can understand they
wanted to consult with legal counsel first

157
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,252
regarding defamation
and slander.

158
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:38,337
You're saying they
will deny the affair.

159
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:39,839
I'm saying they'll
be out here in 30 minutes

160
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,507
and you can quote them
instead of me.

161
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:43,050
Thank you all very much
for your patience.

162
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,721
- I hate this.
- What, waiting?

163
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:51,225
No, the affair. It's bullshit.
I feel like a tabloid hack.

164
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:55,563
You'd rather be stuck
at the White House all day?

165
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:58,441
- Fuck this.
- Where are you going?

166
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:01,902
To do something
meaningful with my time.

167
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:07,491
Hey, I need you to book me
a flight to St. Louis.

168
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:10,327
Tonight, if you
can find something.

169
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:24,258
No Q&A, so don't even try.
Behave yourselves, people.

170
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:33,017
I find it very painful
that anyone would suggest

171
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:37,980
I'm capable of being unfaithful to
my husband, whom I love dearly.

172
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,152
<i>I've known Adam Galloway</i>
<i>for years. We both have.</i>

173
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:45,237
<i>When I ran the</i>
<i>Clean Water Initiative,</i>

174
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:47,573
<i>I commissioned him to do</i>
<i>a series of photographs</i>

175
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:50,493
for the marketing campaign.
And he was extremely generous

176
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:53,662
by donating work for our
fund-raising auctions.

177
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:58,292
So I'm not sure why he would
deny taking the photograph.

178
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:04,131
<i>I love Adam's work, so I asked
him to take this portrait.</i>

179
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:09,345
We did it here, at the house. Francis
was there during the shoot.

180
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:13,557
It was a birthday present. Claire asked me
what sort of portrait I wanted,

181
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,518
and I said I want
one of her sleeping,

182
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:19,438
<i>because she's so very beautiful</i>
<i>when she's sleeping.</i>

183
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,857
<i>It hangs in my office</i>
<i>on the second floor.</i>

184
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:24,109
They're fucking lying.

185
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:29,031
<i>So I can only assume that Adam</i>
<i>was intimidated by the media attention,</i>

186
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:32,409
<i>- and he needed to distance himself.</i>
- What?

187
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:35,746
<i>But really, all we have here</i>
<i>is a very talented photographer</i>

188
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:41,168
<i>- and a prized possession. Thank you
all very much.</i> <i>- Thank you.</i>

189
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:44,964
Because it would've seemed too clean
otherwise, like we were--

190
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:48,592
<i>You made me</i>
<i>look like an idiot.</i>

191
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:53,430
If we had the same story, the media
would assume we were coordinating.

192
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,642
- It needed to look messier.
<i>- This was supposed to go away, Claire.</i>

193
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:59,395
I've got twice as much press
outside the building now.

194
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:01,730
<i>- Adam...</i>
- I've gotta keep the lights off

195
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,692
'cause they're on the roof
across the street trying to film us inside.

196
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:08,821
You just need to confirm
that you took the photo for us.

197
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:12,783
Confirm our version.
Say you lied because you were scared.

198
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,786
I don't know why you didn't just tell me
this is what you were intending to do.

199
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:21,333
<i>Because I know you, and you
would've refused. You have too much pride.</i>

200
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,587
- I don't want to speak to the press again.
<i>- Listen.</i>

201
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:28,215
<i>If you say nothing, they're not going</i>
<i>to leave you alone.</i>

202
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:30,426
<i>They will just camp out</i>
<i>for weeks on end--</i>

203
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:33,887
This is... it feels wrong,
Claire. It feels...

204
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,515
I'm sorry I lied.

205
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:39,143
<i>I wasn't trying to be</i>
<i>manipulative--</i>

206
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:44,857
- I have to go.
- Adam? Adam?

207
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,029
I think he'll
do the right thing.

208
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:53,073
I don't know. I hope so.

209
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:59,371
- Cigarette?
- No. I'm gonna turn in.

210
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:01,790
Wake me if he goes on TV.

211
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:14,011
- <i> Sir.</i>

212
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:20,017
- Doug, why don't you and Seth come over?
-<i> Yes, sir.</i>

213
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:22,644
Should we consider a lawsuit
against the paper?

214
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:26,065
- Show we won't tolerate this
sort of gossip? - They won't settle.

215
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:28,692
They'll fight it in the courts because
it'll generate more news.

216
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,028
And what about the president?
He offered to say something.

217
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,072
- Draws attention.
- President isn't a bad idea,

218
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:34,656
if we phrase
a statement for him.

219
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:35,866
He becomes the headline.

220
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,117
We can't control
his press operation.

221
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,619
If we coordinate
with them--

222
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:39,912
Coordination looks bad.

223
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,955
So it's your job
to conceal it.

224
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,458
If Seth doesn't think the president
should make a comment,

225
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,294
we should defer to his judgment.
I'm gonna get another beer.

226
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,588
- I can go grab you one.
- No. I feel like stretching my legs.

227
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,465
- Doug, Diet Coke?
- I'm fine, thank you, sir.

228
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,842
- Seth, a beer?
- I have to drive, but thanks.

229
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:56,011
I'll be right back.

230
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:05,062
- Watch yourself.
- What do you mean?

231
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:09,149
Connor was an easy target,
but I'm not going anywhere.

232
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,109
Look, Doug,
I'm grateful just to be here.

233
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,278
You think I've survived
with the vice president

234
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,823
so long by being blind?

235
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,492
Upward mobility has
a ceiling with the Underwoods.

236
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:23,288
- I'm the ceiling.
- Understood.

237
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:26,500
- What else have you got on them?
- Nothing.

238
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,170
You fork over the journal without a backup
plan for a rainy day? I don't think so.

239
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,173
I had one hand and I played it.
I don't press my luck.

240
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:36,343
- You can't expect me to believe you.
- I don't.

241
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:39,763
I wouldn't if I were you.
But I'm telling the truth.

242
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:47,896
A little sibling rivalry isn't such a bad
thing, especially between adopted boys.

243
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:51,024
They either push each other
to be the best versions of themselves,

244
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:53,360
or one of them gets booted
back to the orphanage.

245
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,573
You're in my house.
You drink if I drink.

246
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:01,285
One Diet Coke for you,
and one beer for you.

247
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:03,120
Thank you, sir.

248
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,873
Oh, darling,
what a mess.

249
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:10,502
Sweetheart.
How are you holding up?

250
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:12,921
The press have been
harassing us the past two days.

251
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:15,716
Yeah, we barely made it out
of the building without being trampled.

252
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,677
- Oh, how awful.
- You said someone was here to see me?

253
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,887
- He's in my office.
- Did he tell you who he was?

254
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:23,390
I didn't want to say over the phone.
You never know, these days.

255
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,727
He says he used
to work for the Underwoods.

256
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,778
- Who?
- Your assistant.

257
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:40,032
- No, she would never--
- She would and she did.

258
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:42,534
- Why are you doing this?
- Not me. The man I work for.

259
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:45,370
- And who is that?
- That doesn't concern you.

260
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,331
This is my life
you're fucking with.

261
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:48,957
You and I are just
pawns, Mr. Galloway.

262
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:52,919
- You should leave.
- We need more...

263
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,213
...to prove the affair happened.
Another photograph.

264
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:56,965
Thirty seconds,
you better be out the door.

265
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,468
I'm not going anywhere.

266
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:04,181
You recognize
the country code?

267
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,518
And the city code is Bogotá.

268
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:15,025
Is it still ringing?

269
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:20,155
- Marshall!
- Hey, Pops.

270
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:27,662
Man, never seen it like this before.
The line's down the block.

271
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:30,373
Something else, ain't it?

272
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,417
Looks like you could
use some help.

273
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:36,880
Got a extra apron
in the back.

274
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,680
Let's go!

275
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,934
<i>She</i>
<i>refuses to leave the lobby.</i>

276
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,602
What's her name?

277
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:53,438
<i>Ayla Sayyad,</i>
Wall Street Telegraph.

278
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:56,525
<i>She's part of the</i>
<i>vice president's press corps.</i>

279
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:00,445
Oh, yeah.

280
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:02,781
Send her up.

281
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:05,700
I appreciate it,
Tricia, but I'm fine.

282
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,371
This whole thing will blow over
in a day or so, and I'll...

283
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:11,665
Can you hold on one second?

284
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:15,961
- The<i> Daily.</i> They called for a comment.
- Did Adam speak with them?

285
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:19,714
Yes, but not what we told him
to say. He sent them this.

286
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:23,260
Tricia, can I call you back?

287
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,012
- Is that you?
- No.

288
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:28,306
Because he's saying it is.

289
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,143
- It might be.
- Mrs. Underwood.

290
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,188
I mean, it could be, yes.

291
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:37,315
It probably is.

292
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:40,402
I asked you about
any vulnerabilities.

293
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:45,699
I didn't know he took this.

294
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:50,328
You have short hair in the picture.
You said it ended over two years ago.

295
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:53,164
Well, I visited
him last fall.

296
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,916
Does anyone else know?
Did anyone see you there?

297
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,502
He had friends over,
to his apartment.

298
00:20:57,502 --> 00:20:59,379
Christ.

299
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,214
But we've said
that he's a friend.

300
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:04,801
There's nothing wrong
with me visiting him, being at a party.

301
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:07,929
There is if this photo
is on the front page of the<i> Daily.</i>

302
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:16,146
Politics and business are intertwined
in China, as I'm sure you know.

303
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:21,901
It's not uncommon to partner with someone
who can ensure Beijing's approval.

304
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:24,237
So you needed his
political influence.

305
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:27,741
All this is moot.
Our venture fell through.

306
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:30,243
Right after the Port Jefferson
Bridge was approved.

307
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:33,246
Well, I had nothing to do
with that project.

308
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:38,376
- Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.
- No, but Wu Bin Yang did.

309
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:41,338
He's Feng's biggest
rival in Beijing.

310
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:45,175
Well, it looks like I shouldn't be schooling
you on Chinese politics.

311
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:48,386
You know far more than I.

312
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:50,221
You used the word "intertwined."

313
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:53,058
That's the sense I'm getting
from all of this.

314
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,644
The samarium subsidy,
the Chinese refinery, the bridge,

315
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:59,022
- your friendship with the president...
- Who sent you?

316
00:21:59,022 --> 00:22:02,442
Who sent me?

317
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:05,487
When you're as rich as I am,
you're always a target.

318
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:11,159
- Nobody sent me.
- You're here... in St. Louis.

319
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,871
Instead of covering
the vice president and his wife.

320
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:19,125
My gut says there's more to
Xander Feng than has been reported.

321
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:23,505
It's a far better use of my time
than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.

322
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:26,257
It's not real news.

323
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:34,724
You miss Tehran. I read some of your
work while you were in the waiting area.

324
00:22:34,724 --> 00:22:37,811
- It started to get too dangerous.
- Ooh! Yeah.

325
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,688
Not the best place to be when you
want to get married and start a family.

326
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:43,650
- Or if you're Jewish.
- That too.

327
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,736
My wife got this for me

328
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:50,907
when she visited there
before the revolution.

329
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:53,493
- It's beautiful.
- Sixteenth century.

330
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:59,290
It, um, broke when it was
being shipped, into a thousand pieces.

331
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:04,129
It took specialists
over a year

332
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:05,839
to restore it.

333
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,676
- Here, I want you to have it.
- I can't accept gifts.

334
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,803
No, no. Not as a gift. No.

335
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:17,517
As a reminder of how hard it can
be to put something back together again

336
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:19,936
once it's been crushed.

337
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:23,857
If you're going to threaten me, you don't
have to go to the trouble of veiling it.

338
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:29,237
I don't usually do interviews
with reporters. They're parasites.

339
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:34,868
Usually interested in just finding
a way to knock me down a peg.

340
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:38,705
Invariably, what
they write is inaccurate.

341
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:43,918
And when that happens,
I have no choice but to retaliate.

342
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:52,677
America can be just
as dangerous as Iran, Ms. Sayyad.

343
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,271
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Tusk.

344
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:06,816
Travel safe back
to Washington.

345
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:18,703
Get Remy on the line.

346
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:24,125
<i>- Remy's on line two.</i>
- Remy.

347
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:29,464
Let's not hold back on the other thing.
Hit 'em again, and hit 'em now.

348
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:32,508
Best day yet.

349
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:34,719
You gotta get
a safe or something.

350
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,388
Or maybe one of those,
uh, pickup services.

351
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,515
That's too much money to be
carrying around at night.

352
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:41,059
I can handle myself.

353
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,770
There ain't nobody can handle
a Glock to the face.

354
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,980
Unless you got
one yourself.

355
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,276
My days of packin'
are long gone.

356
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:58,993
There. Take mine.
I got one at home.

357
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:01,871
What the fuck you doin'
bringin' that thing in here?

358
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:03,831
Oh, it's just
for protection, man.

359
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:05,750
I don't know what you doing
with it anyway.

360
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,168
What about your parole?

361
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:08,628
I'm a lot more worried
about niggas

362
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,880
in my building
than some parole officer.

363
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,340
- All right, sit down.
- See, man?

364
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,342
This is what I'm
talkin' about, man.

365
00:25:14,342 --> 00:25:16,135
You being all righteous
and judgin' me and shit.

366
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:20,264
Do me a favor and just
sit down. Sit down now.

367
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:33,194
Look.

368
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:36,406
We got us a good thing,
potentially.

369
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:40,159
Maybe nothin' comes of it,
but maybe something does.

370
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,663
If the Joint works out,
maybe one day you can be the manager.

371
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:47,083
Shit, if it blows up, you can
run the whole fuckin' franchise.

372
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,336
But that means
you gotta be careful.

373
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,632
That means you cannot
be sent back inside.

374
00:25:54,632 --> 00:26:00,012
We gotta follow the rules.
Hear me?

375
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:05,601
- All right.
- You gonna get rid of that thing?

376
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:11,524
- Yeah.
- All right.

377
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:14,610
Now that's what's being a man.

378
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,077
I'll need you to cut it.

379
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:24,787
How short?

380
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,708
This short.

381
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,085
I have a modeling career.
If I cut it that short--

382
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:32,962
If you actually
had a modeling career,

383
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:35,464
I would be speaking
to your agency,

384
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:37,675
and not sitting
in your apartment.

385
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:41,929
- Do you want this job or not?
- OK, yeah.

386
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:44,515
- I can cut it.
- All right.

387
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:50,313
And before we go to the studio,
I need to see how well-spoken you are.

388
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:52,398
Why does that matter?

389
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:56,903
Because you're gonna be on
every news channel in America.

390
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:59,280
Wait, what's this for?

391
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:02,325
Read this.

392
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:03,993
Those exact words.

393
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:12,043
Read 'em. If you're good,
you'll memorize them.

394
00:27:13,878 --> 00:27:16,756
My name is Stephanie Daldry.

395
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,551
I am a professional model.

396
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,262
"Freddy Hayes
was convicted in 1982

397
00:27:23,262 --> 00:27:26,557
for sticking up a convenience
store in Columbia Heights.

398
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:31,103
During a high-speed pursuit, Hayes lost
control and crashed into another vehicle,

399
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:33,064
killing an elderly couple.

400
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:37,068
He avoided manslaughter charges
by pleading guilty to armed robbery.

401
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:39,195
He served nine years.

402
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:42,698
In 1992, he opened
Freddy's BBQ Joint,

403
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:46,410
a small restaurant
specializing in ribs,

404
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,665
frequented by
Vice President Frank Underwood."

405
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:54,126
- Did you know?
- No, I didn't.

406
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:57,046
- You think it's Tusk?
- Who else?

407
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:03,678
- Who are you texting?
- Seth.

408
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:13,062
All I want to do
is make a short statement.

409
00:28:13,062 --> 00:28:16,941
Freddy did his time, he's been
an upstanding citizen for 20 years.

410
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:20,444
He's a convicted felon
who killed two senior citizens.

411
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:22,780
- By accident.
- That's beside the point.

412
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,490
I'm not gonna
hang him out to dry.

413
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,618
If the Galloway story wasn't
happening, I'd say it's fine.

414
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:29,328
But it's too
risky right now.

415
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,163
Think of how this is shaping up.

416
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:33,165
A vice president whose wife
cheats on him

417
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:36,043
and who is friendly
with a former gangbanger?

418
00:28:36,043 --> 00:28:38,295
There is no way you win,
standing up for this guy.

419
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:40,714
He's about to
start a franchise.

420
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,883
I will not have it jeopardized
because Tusk decided--

421
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:45,636
It's more than just Freddy, sir.
I did some digging.

422
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:49,515
His son did time for
narcotics, trafficking, distribution--

423
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:52,143
- I've never met his son.
- Let's hold off and tackle--

424
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:54,687
No. I want you to organize
a press avail tomorrow morning.

425
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:57,440
Have Freddy brought over here.
Bring him through the back.

426
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,275
Yes, sir.

427
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:04,697
I won't leave one of my own
bleeding on the field.

428
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:11,954
If you're gonna have
the Washington Redskins,

429
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:14,832
then you're gonna have
to have the New York Knickers.

430
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,668
Pops, you ain't
even deep like that.

431
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:20,504
Yo, back off, man. Yo, yo, yo,
yo! Back the fuck off.

432
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:22,882
- Darnell, just ignore them.
- You think I'm fucking around?

433
00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:24,508
Darnell, ignore them!
Ignore 'em.

434
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,343
They can't take our pictures
if we don't want them to.

435
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:28,762
- Sure as hell can.
- What you say?

436
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:29,805
The First fuckin' Amendment.

437
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:31,432
You gonna read me the

438
00:29:31,432 --> 00:29:33,184
Constitution now, motherfucker?

439
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:34,685
- Let's go on inside.
- I ain't done with this asshole.

440
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,020
Hey, don't touch me.

441
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,688
Oh, but you can
get all up in my face

442
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:38,898
but I can't get up in yours?

443
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:40,065
Listen to your daddy
and chill out.

444
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:41,066
- Let's go.
- Don't push me.

445
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:42,735
I will fuck you up.

446
00:29:42,735 --> 00:29:45,070
- You think I'm scared of you?
- You scared of this?

447
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,239
Darnell! Parole!

448
00:29:54,163 --> 00:29:55,956
<i>Can you tell me your</i>
<i>name, please?</i>

449
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:57,499
<i>Stephanie Daldry.</i>

450
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,210
<i>I'm a professional model.</i>

451
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,004
<i>And this is you in this</i>
<i>photo on the right?</i>

452
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:06,008
<i>- Yes, that's correct. - We shot this photo
yesterday with Ms. Daldry.</i>

453
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:09,178
<i>So you're suggesting that</i>
<i>Mr. Galloway's photo is a fake?</i>

454
00:30:09,178 --> 00:30:12,681
<i>I don't know anything about professional
photography, I'm just a flack.</i>

455
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:15,476
<i>But if we can create a fake</i>
<i>in less than 24 hours,</i>

456
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:18,270
<i>I think an expert photographer</i>
<i>like Adam Galloway--</i>

457
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:23,317
<i>Those are serious allegations, especially given
that Mr. Galloway vehemently denies it.</i>

458
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:25,486
<i>I'm not surprised</i>
<i>he's denying.</i>

459
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:27,738
<i>Ultimately, though, it's gonna be</i>
<i>your word against his.</i>

460
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,323
<i>Not my word.</i>

461
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:31,158
<i>The vice president</i>
<i>of the United States'.</i>

462
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:33,452
<i>It's his word versus that</i>
<i>of a potentially troubled man.</i>

463
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:35,496
<i>- Troubled?</i>
<i>- Potentially.</i>

464
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:37,164
<i>Or maybe he has a motive.</i>

465
00:30:37,164 --> 00:30:39,208
<i>What motive</i>
<i>could Mr. Galloway</i>

466
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,627
<i>possibly have</i>
<i>for a fake photo?</i>

467
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:44,129
<i>- What would he get out of it?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

468
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:47,549
<i>My job is to separate fact from
fiction, just like yours is, Candy.</i>

469
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:51,971
<i>But maybe fact and fiction don't matter
as much to the artistic sensibility.</i>

470
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:54,014
<i>Maybe the lines</i>
<i>are blurred for him.</i>

471
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:56,976
<i>This is not a man who</i>
<i>stages fictitious scenarios.</i>

472
00:30:56,976 --> 00:31:01,146
<i>Like I said, the art stuff, it's over
my head. And you may be right.</i>

473
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:03,190
<i>But I would hate</i>
<i>to think that Mr. Galloway</i>

474
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,150
<i>was doing this</i>
<i>just for publicity.</i>

475
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,819
<i>You think it's</i>
<i>a publicity stunt.</i>

476
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:08,487
Come on in.

477
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,406
- Sir?
- Is Freddy on his way?

478
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:12,783
There was an incident
with his son.

479
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:15,327
- What happened?
- He's in custody for threatening

480
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:19,707
- a photographer with a firearm.
- Jesus.

481
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:22,835
- Where is Freddy now?
- He's at home.

482
00:31:22,835 --> 00:31:25,504
- I have to go see him.
- That's the projects, sir.

483
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:28,841
I don't care, you figure it out,
and the press can't know.

484
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,844
Yes, sir.

485
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:34,805
- Francis, you know I love Freddy...
- I'm going.

486
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:37,391
Freddy is dangerous
because you care too much.

487
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:40,853
- When we care too much, it blinds us.
- What Tusk did is cheap.

488
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:43,397
And you're letting it get to you,
which is exactly what he wants.

489
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:46,734
- If I ignore this, if I do nothing--
- It's not nothing.

490
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:49,987
Staying focused
requires strength.

491
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,168
- You want me to make something?
- You go ahead. I'm not hungry.

492
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:07,546
You should eat.

493
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:11,300
I'm sorry. You didn't ask for
this. It's not fair to you.

494
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,263
All I want is to be done with it.
For my father to be all right.

495
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:19,224
If I thought there
was any other way, that...

496
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,268
I didn't want to take
the chance that he would--

497
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:24,146
- I know.
- These people.

498
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:27,566
I always knew they
were ruthless, but...

499
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:32,362
We're caged up in here like animals.
They're painting me as some sort of...

500
00:32:32,362 --> 00:32:36,617
And your family...
It's inhuman.

501
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,535
They're fucking inhuman.

502
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:41,163
Getting worked up isn't
going to change anything.

503
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,128
Let me.

504
00:32:53,717 --> 00:32:54,885
Hello?

505
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:25,374
- Hey, Frank.
- I'm fine.

506
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:28,877
- Thanks for dropping by.
- How you holdin' up?

507
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:31,046
I been better.

508
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,341
Ain't never seen you
without a suit before.

509
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:38,011
We didn't want
to draw too much attention.

510
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:41,181
Well, this is it, my castle.

511
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:44,559
Ain't as big as yours,
but it'll do the job.

512
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,105
- Blind Willie.
- Are you a blues fan?

513
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:51,733
"Dark Was the Night."
Gets me every time.

514
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:54,736
Man, you shoulda
told me that years ago.

515
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:58,532
I can jam, talking about
some blues all day long.

516
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:00,951
Check this out. Original 78.

517
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:04,121
You want something?
Water? Iced tea?

518
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:06,832
I'd like some iced tea,
thank you.

519
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,423
- How's your son?
- They set the bail at 60 grand.

520
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:19,594
- Jesus.
- How's your wife doing?

521
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:22,597
Oh, Claire's got a suit
of armor three inches thick.

522
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,474
We'll get through
all this garbage.

523
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:29,438
- Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
- Appears that way.

524
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:34,109
Whoever it is, they done stepped on
the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.

525
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:39,573
That's why I'm here, Freddy.

526
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:50,417
I have to distance
myself from you.

527
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:54,588
I need to make sure you're not going to
play up what good friends we've been.

528
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:59,009
That you've been to my office,
that you've cooked dinner at my home,

529
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:01,470
or that the president was there.

530
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,765
We can't drag him
into anything.

531
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:10,020
And I won't be coming in
for ribs anymore.

532
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,608
With all that's going on,
we can't add fuel to the fire.

533
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:19,571
You couldn't if you wanted to.

534
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:22,324
I'm selling it.

535
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:25,285
- Selling the Joint?
- That's right.

536
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:29,331
- What are you talking about?
- The franchise thing, with the sauce.

537
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:32,042
My business partner's
pullin' out.

538
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:37,130
Say them white folks down in Silver Spring
don't wanna go to no place run by thugs.

539
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,091
- Why do you have to sell yours?
- Darnell's bail.

540
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:42,761
Well, doesn't that guy have to give
you a hundred grand, regardless?

541
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:48,683
I ain't getting shit.
There's a morality clause in the contract.

542
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:52,687
But he's gonna pay me
45 thou for the storefront.

543
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:56,983
That, with what little I got
saved, I can pay that bond.

544
00:35:56,983 --> 00:36:00,529
- You can't sell Freddy's.
- He's already drawin' up the papers.

545
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,697
- Let me help you with the money.
- Nah, Frank.

546
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:04,282
We'll make it a loan.
You can pay me back.

547
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:06,034
- Not gonna happen.
- Don't be prideful.

548
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,452
- Frank.
- Please, let me help.

549
00:36:07,452 --> 00:36:09,287
I ain't takin' your guilt money.

550
00:36:15,502 --> 00:36:20,590
When I was bangin',
we used to clear 60 Gs a month.

551
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:24,844
I seen guys shot down
execution-style.

552
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:27,013
I didn't give a shit.

553
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:29,432
Then I got caught.

554
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:32,435
Darnell was
born my first year in.

555
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:35,355
Never saw him once,
not even a picture.

556
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:40,902
I can't take
back the bad I done.

557
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:46,116
All I can do is to make my own way,
like I been doin'. You understand.

558
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:50,870
Ain't pride, Frank.

559
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:15,478
If you change your mind,
you let me know.

560
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:17,689
You was a good
customer, that's it.

561
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:22,318
You ain't gotta pretend
to be my friend.

562
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:28,074
- You take care of yourself, Freddy.
- You too, Frank.

563
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,837
Do you think I'm a hypocrite?

564
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:44,799
Well, you should.

565
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:48,219
I wouldn't disagree with you.

566
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:52,807
The road to power is paved
with hypocrisy...

567
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:55,101
...and casualties.

568
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:59,355
Never regret.

569
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:26,216
This way.

570
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:37,310
Have a seat, Adam.

571
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:45,235
You left your phone at home,
as you were asked?

572
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:50,031
- Yeah. - And what did you tell
your fiancée exactly?

573
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,992
That I'd be gone for a while.
She doesn't know where.

574
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:55,954
And what will she say
if someone checks in on her?

575
00:38:55,954 --> 00:38:57,705
- What is this?
- What will she say?

576
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,999
Francis.

577
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:03,169
- We need to work together now.
- I tried. You lied to me.

578
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:05,588
And I explained to you
why that was necessary.

579
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:08,341
You didn't follow
my instructions.

580
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:13,721
Do you know
who Remy Danton is?

581
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:17,183
He approached you?

582
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:20,895
Inez's father is a human
rights activist in Bogotá.

583
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:25,191
The government has charged him
with treason for working with the rebels.

584
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:26,859
They're going
for the death penalty,

585
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:29,737
and Danton said they
have the judge in their pocket.

586
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:32,198
- You should have come to us.
- Well, I said I would.

587
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:35,785
- Danton said you couldn't do anything.
- He's wrong.

588
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:38,496
- I wasn't gonna take any chances.
- Has he done what

589
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,957
- the government's claiming?
- No. They're made-up charges.

590
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:44,669
He's a journalist documenting
atrocities in the Darien Gap.

591
00:39:44,669 --> 00:39:46,838
- I can get the charges dropped.
- Why should I trust you?

592
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:50,133
Because the secretary of state
is a good friend of mine.

593
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:53,886
- And you don't have any other choice.
- We're not your chess pieces.

594
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:55,388
And this isn't a game,
Mr. Galloway.

595
00:39:55,388 --> 00:39:57,181
Then why are you
toying with us?

596
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,558
We are trying to help.

597
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:00,143
That's a fucking joke,
Claire.

598
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:03,479
Do not talk
to my wife that way.

599
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:06,566
Oh, your wife?
What does that even mean to you?

600
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:09,902
Do not mistake any history
you have shared

601
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:13,448
for the slightest understanding
of what our marriage is,

602
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:18,036
or how insignificant
you are in comparison.

603
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:26,377
- Can you give us a few minutes?
- I'm gonna go call Cathy.

604
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,094
Forget my career and my reputation.
I want to marry this woman, Claire.

605
00:40:35,094 --> 00:40:37,138
We're going to make
this disappear.

606
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:39,974
Because of you, I will always be the man
who placed her father in danger.

607
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:42,685
- I can never erase that.
- I'm sorry it's come to this.

608
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:47,273
I'm sorry I ever met you.
All you've ever done is cause me pain.

609
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:49,233
Now you're fucking with my life
and the life of the woman

610
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:51,277
that I love more
than I ever loved you.

611
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,992
You'll be driven
back to New York tonight.

612
00:40:57,992 --> 00:41:00,828
In the morning, you'll make a statement
saying this was a publicity stunt,

613
00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:05,541
and that the value of your work had been
stagnating and you wanted to revive--

614
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:07,668
- No, Claire. I won't do that.
- Yes, you will.

615
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:11,380
- How about I tell the press--
- Adam, shut up!

616
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,300
That you wanted the attention,
then you got cold feet,

617
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,928
denied it, then you
changed your mind again.

618
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:19,847
And that you faked the shower
photo and you're coming clean.

619
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:24,685
- Is that clear?
- I'm not part of this world.

620
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:28,731
I didn't sign up for it.
I have no interest in it.

621
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:31,984
We're giving you an out, Adam.

622
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:35,321
And if you choose
not to take it,

623
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:38,074
I will bury you.

624
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,871
I've never hated anyone before.

625
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,751
Now I know what that feels like.

626
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:55,341
It's a terrible feeling,
isn't it?

627
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:22,577
- End call.
<i>-  Call ended.</i>

628
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,456
Call Raymond Tusk.

629
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:30,084
<i>No answer at his place.</i>

630
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:31,919
Is it a matter of more money?

631
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:34,463
<i>Secretary Durant has already</i>
<i>called President Moreno.</i>

632
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:36,132
So we need to move quickly.

633
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:38,426
<i>The minister of foreign affairs</i>
<i>is involved now.</i>

634
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:41,596
<i>The judge isn't gonna rush a conviction</i>
<i>in less than 12 hours.</i>

635
00:42:41,596 --> 00:42:43,639
Well, who do we know
who has the minister's ear?

636
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:46,350
Nobody who can trump
President Moreno,

637
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,061
and he's very sensitive
to Durant's views on human rights.

638
00:42:49,061 --> 00:42:52,690
- Are you giving up on this?
-<i> No, just being realistic.</i>

639
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,735
- Work on Moreno, then.
- We'll start leaving footprints.

640
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:57,778
<i>- Quiet.</i>
- Excuse me?

641
00:42:57,778 --> 00:43:00,948
- Oh. Not you, my birds.
<i>- I think we need to be prepared</i>

642
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:04,118
<i>for the possibility that we can't follow</i>
<i>through with our threat.</i>

643
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:06,829
I am hearing excuses,
not solutions.

644
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:11,083
My hands are tied. I can't circumvent
the entire US State Department.

645
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,502
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I hired you to destroy Frank.</i>

646
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:15,588
- You're failing.
<i>- Look, Raymond,</i>

647
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:17,757
<i>I'm your lobbyist,</i>
<i>not your henchman.</i>

648
00:43:17,757 --> 00:43:19,133
I don't employ lobbyists.

649
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:20,509
<i>I employ people</i>

650
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:21,969
<i>who can be useful to me.</i>

651
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,680
And you are proving otherwise.
Quiet now.

652
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,224
- I'll figure something out.
-<i> Soon.</i>

653
00:43:41,238 --> 00:43:43,741
OK, that's good.

654
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:46,410
You don't have to do this.

655
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,662
Yeah, I do.

656
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:50,998
The charges are dropped.

657
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:52,958
They lied to you.
You can lie to them.

658
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:56,962
New charges can always be filed.
It's not worth the risk.

659
00:43:58,172 --> 00:43:59,882
OK.

660
00:44:05,304 --> 00:44:07,890
Are you disappointed in me?

661
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:11,102
Let's just get it over with.

662
00:44:18,984 --> 00:44:21,445
OK, go ahead.

663
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:24,448
I'd like to make a statement.

664
00:44:24,448 --> 00:44:26,408
There will be a little cleanup,
some folks who will want

665
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:29,537
to linger on the story, but we're
over the hump, I'd say.

666
00:44:29,537 --> 00:44:31,330
So we can leave the house now?

667
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,666
The sooner you get back to
normal work, the better.

668
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,876
All the meetings I had to cancel, let's
find a way to get them back on the books.

669
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:38,796
- Yes, sir. - I need to push
ahead with the assault bill.

670
00:44:38,796 --> 00:44:40,923
We've got your Matt Bai
interview lined up for tomorrow,

671
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:43,217
- but I think that--
- Maybe we should hold off on Bai

672
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:47,054
- till after things quiet down.
- That's exactly what I was gonna suggest.

673
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:50,683
- Doug is right.
- OK, let's get going.

674
00:44:50,683 --> 00:44:52,685
I'll meet you in the car.

675
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,772
He's done a good job
handling all this.

676
00:44:56,772 --> 00:45:00,067
- Yes, he has.
- Should we have any more concerns?

677
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:03,696
- He claims he doesn't have anything else.
- Do you believe him?

678
00:45:03,696 --> 00:45:05,865
I wouldn't go that far.

679
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:08,534
- Keep an eye on him.
- I plan to.

680
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:12,079
As for Raymond, we have to strike
back hard and fast.

681
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,206
I want him obliterated.

682
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:16,500
More than that.

683
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:20,212
Let's make him suffer.

684
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:24,758
I don't know whether
to be proud or terrified.

685
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:27,720
Perhaps both.

686
00:45:55,164 --> 00:45:58,000
Wish I could do more.

687
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:03,047
- What you gonna do with her?
- I don't know yet.

688
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:07,718
Probably have to knock it down.
It's worth more as an empty lot.

689
00:46:07,718 --> 00:46:11,263
Is there anything else you wanna take?
A memento or something?

690
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,559
Nah.

691
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:18,187
I ain't one
for lookin' back.

692
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:20,564
Eyes ahead.

693
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:22,983
Good luck, Freddy.

694
00:46:44,421 --> 00:49:03,644
