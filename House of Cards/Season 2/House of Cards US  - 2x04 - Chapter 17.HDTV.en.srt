1
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:23,534
Strange not seeing
your name up there.

2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,352
"To improve is to change..."

3
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:27,020
"To perfect
is to change often."

4
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:28,857
You know your Churchill.

5
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,438
Inscribed on the
watch you gave me

6
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,232
- when I left for Glendon Hill.
- Was it?

7
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,818
- Nancy arranges all the gifts.
- She knows you well.

8
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,778
- As much as I'm enjoying this little...
- I got you two more votes.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,823
Partridge and Krauss.

10
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,282
Is this Raymond's way
of extending an olive branch?

11
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:47,411
- It's a start.
- Two votes is a twig. It's not a branch.

12
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:51,288
- Which is why I'm here.
- Well, the vote is at 5:00.

13
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,792
- We have less than three hours.
- Two hours and 49 minutes.

14
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:57,836
- We have made more happen in less.
- Is that the watch?

15
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:03,091
- No, it's nicer. - So why did Raymond
have a change of heart?

16
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,342
If the government grinds
to a halt, that benefits no one.

17
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:09,345
We want the president focused on China,
not distracted by furloughs and protests.

18
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:12,180
You take direction
from Jacqueline.

19
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,681
She's not gonna
like that very much.

20
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,725
- Bossing you around?
- Having me around.

21
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:18,602
I don't blame her.

22
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:20,645
Ashleigh will start
the interview with questions

23
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:23,397
about how you and your husband
met, your early marriage.

24
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,942
- Fine.
- Then she'll move on to more specific

25
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:31,737
- questions about your recent transition.
- All right.

26
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,448
She's gonna ask about you
having no children.

27
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,408
I thought we agreed
to take that off the table.

28
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,659
We did, but they insisted.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,618
Now, I can speak
to Ashleigh directly and...

30
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,620
No, no. It's fine. I've been
asked the question before.

31
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:43,622
- I know how to answer it.
- It'll be quick and painless.

32
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:46,874
I'll confirm that with Ashleigh
when she gets here.

33
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,543
- I like it.
- Maybe something less neutral.

34
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:53,672
I'm sure you'll look good in
whatever you choose. I'll be downstairs.

35
00:01:57,175 --> 00:02:00,176
Disori owes you for the
overpass funding you secured.

36
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,053
- Yes, he does.
- I'll call him.

37
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:03,846
- Where's Doug?
- He's doing the rounds.

38
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,347
Making sure our
hard ones stay hard.

39
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:09,100
Birch and Womack are doing the same.
But we're still 15 short.

40
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:11,435
I've got relationships
with most of these folks.

41
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:14,771
Money's not enough.
I already tried the D-trip route.

42
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,647
Retirement age is
the main sticking point?

43
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:19,275
- Old people vote.
- I'll target the AARP.

44
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:21,943
- That'll take most of the heat off.
- We're wasting time.

45
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:24,695
- I gotta get to work.
- Take Remy with you.

46
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,113
Shouldn't we divide and conquer?

47
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:28,782
It's harder to say no
twice than once.

48
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:29,991
I'll stay out of your way.

49
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:31,492
Like you did
on the watershed act?

50
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:32,993
We're on the same
side of the fence.

51
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:34,535
You're late to the party.

52
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,537
Think of Remy as the guy
who shows up

53
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:39,166
with a six-pack after
the liquor stores close.

54
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,834
- Who's on your plate?
- Donald Blythe.

55
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:44,085
Do you really think that's
the best use of your time?

56
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,045
If I can get him
to turn his people.

57
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,880
A lot of eggs
to put in one basket.

58
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,299
We only have one basket.

59
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,008
Jacqueline,
may I use your office,

60
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:55,846
- for old time's sake? - I serve at the
pleasure of the vice president.

61
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,350
Two hours and 17 minutes.

62
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,313
Normally all I need to sway
Donald Blythe is patience and time,

63
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,648
neither of which
I have right now.

64
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,693
Tick tock.

65
00:03:13,719 --> 00:04:50,715
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

66
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:56,897
- Donald. Good to see you.
- Mr. Vice President.

67
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,107
Please,
it's always Frank to you.

68
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,318
I came because you asked me,
but don't mistake that for false hope.

69
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,195
If you have other people
to lobby, you should.

70
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,487
- Ten minutes.
- It won't change anything.

71
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:08,907
Well, at the very least,
enjoy the free coffee.

72
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,075
- I don't drink caffeine.
- Then decaf.

73
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,911
- Still has caffeine.
- Well, enjoy the free oxygen.

74
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:16,162
It gets stuffy over there
in the Longworth building.

75
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:18,915
- Coffee for me, and...
- Seltzer water, if you have it.

76
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,875
I'm sure we do.

77
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,464
Now, I can understand
if you might hold a grudge.

78
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:32,007
I don't hold grudges, Frank.
I just don't negotiate

79
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:34,343
with people who are
fundamentally deceptive.

80
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:36,010
I never lied to you, Donald.

81
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,679
You promised to seek my counsel,
which you never once did.

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,724
We had to move the education bill in
a direction I knew would make you unhappy.

83
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,268
- I saw no reason to frustrate...
- You eviscerated the unions.

84
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:48,146
- You federalized performance standards.
- If we hadn't done that,

85
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,814
the bill would've
been dead in the water.

86
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,190
Now you want to cut
the pathetic level

87
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:52,732
of funding you
did manage to pass.

88
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:56,026
Isn't some funding better
than none?

89
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:59,154
A flatline will send a louder
message than life support.

90
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:04,158
Look, I'm impressed with the
little coalition you've cobbled together,

91
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,078
- but we...
- Not so little. Twenty-eight votes.

92
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,998
- And you need them all.
- Well, really only half.

93
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:16,168
- Half of zero is still zero.
- I had to pull every trick in the book

94
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,669
to get entitlement through
the Senate. If it fails in the House,

95
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,088
we don't get a round two.
This is a one-time deal.

96
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,632
It should never have passed
the Senate to begin with.

97
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:28,636
Can we start over?
May I offer you an apology?

98
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:31,762
Deaf ears, Frank.

99
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:36,100
I withdrew myself from the education
fight and that is my cross to bear.

100
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:38,893
But I will be damned if I will
make the same mistake twice.

101
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:43,440
This sort of stubbornness
makes you no better than the tea party.

102
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:49,152
- Except for the fact...
- that we happen to be right.

103
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:53,070
Just a few more minutes, Donald.
You haven't even had your seltzer yet.

104
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:55,990
They have seven other data centers
spread across the Northeast.

105
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:58,451
- Those aren't good odds.
- Well, if we can access one,

106
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,910
I should be able to talk to the
other seven. They all look like that.

107
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:03,578
- Fort Knox wrapped in a nuclear bunker.
- How do we get in?

108
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,415
Well, we don't. You do.

109
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:10,626
What...? How?
What's my reason?

110
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:14,087
You're writing a story on cyberterrorism.
It's free publicity.

111
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:16,214
- If they're so secure...
- They give tours all the time.

112
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:19,175
- Mostly to prospective clients.
- Then why haven't you done it yourself?

113
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:22,219
Because I run a white hat firm.

114
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,557
And if I were to show up in the tour logs
before a breach, it would raise alarms.

115
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:31,352
OK. Once I'm in?

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,854
These are what
servers look like.

117
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,189
If you can get inside one of
these cages, you will have this.

118
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,859
You slide it into
the server. Voilà.

119
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,361
- It's that simple?
- Yeah. Well, your part, not mine.

120
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:47,322
- Code's extremely complex.
- How do I do it without them noticing?

121
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:51,868
You get good at anything.
Practice makes perfect.

122
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,090
We've got a problem.

123
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:18,388
Everyone, stop what you're doing, head
into the nearest office and shut the door.

124
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,475
You, stay exactly where you are.

125
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:30,313
Retirement age is a done deal.

126
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:32,482
I might be able to
redistribute some appropriations...

127
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:36,651
That's not what I'm after. You can't fix
a wrecked car with new hubcaps.

128
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:39,737
How about a sister bill?
One that focuses entirely on education.

129
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:42,656
My coalition is fighting
for the integrity of the party.

130
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:44,657
We're not just
focused on education...

131
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,617
I'm sorry, Donald.
Excuse me.

132
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:49,912
Nancy, I said no interrup...

133
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:51,705
When?

134
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,541
But the vote is in
less than an hour. I...

135
00:08:54,542 --> 00:09:00,169
I don't care what protocol... Quarantine.
There's white powder in the mail.

136
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,672
- We're locked in?
- Sir! Close the door now!

137
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:07,051
- Look, I have to...
- Now, sir! Please!

138
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:12,430
- I should call my wife.
- And I should call Claire.

139
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:16,349
- Should I tell Connor?
<i>- No. It's better the press doesn't know.</i>

140
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,851
Field tests should come in before the vote.
Soon as the tally's in,

141
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:21,061
- I'll come home.
<i>- How's it looking?</i>

142
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,439
Shaky. We may lose this one.

143
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,982
That could make
for a tough interview.

144
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,109
<i>Well, I didn't want</i>
<i>to do it in the first place.</i>

145
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,901
Well, we're committed now.

146
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,571
<i>I better get</i>
<i>back to the holy crusader.</i>

147
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,863
Let me know as soon
as the tests have cleared.

148
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,532
If we're lucky,
it'll be anthrax.

149
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,242
I won't live long enough
to see the bill fail.

150
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,244
- Don't say that.
<i>- We're gonna be fine.</i>

151
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,621
<i>How many of these quarantines</i>
<i>we been through?</i>

152
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:46,372
- I've lost count.
- <i> Wish me luck with Donald.</i>

153
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,833
Heels crossed.

154
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,294
- It's ripping the caucus apart.
- Of course.

155
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:54,045
We took a united stand
on our version of the bill.

156
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:57,632
- Some of us have to stay on our feet.
- This is about party unity.

157
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:01,384
- It's about abandoning our base.
- No. That's what the freeze is.

158
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,261
Our base doesn't benefit
from sword rattling.

159
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:05,262
It gets left
bleeding on the field.

160
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:08,182
My district has the third largest number
of seniors in the country.

161
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,809
If we raise the age
of retirement, the AARP will raise hell.

162
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,353
I spoke with the president
of the AARP this morning.

163
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:17,271
They'll be receiving
a 45 million dollar endowment next week.

164
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,273
Voters will still revolt.

165
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,359
The midterms are gonna be ugly.

166
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Many, and I can speak
for myself...

167
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,655
The choice is between immediate
discontinuation of services

168
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:29,114
and an age bump
five years from now.

169
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:33,284
You're comparing theoretical
discomfort to imminent pain.

170
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,911
I just feel like we're losing
touch with our core values.

171
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:38,288
The education bill
was a good example.

172
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:40,666
We all followed Frank's lead,
hoping it would buy us

173
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,461
- traction with the Republicans.
- Would you excuse me? Just one moment.

174
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,756
- Does the press know?
- Not yet.

175
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:52,675
Can you keep in touch with him?

176
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,968
I need to pummel our lunch
guests into submission.

177
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:59,304
You got 'em close,
but relax. Listen more.

178
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:02,848
They want their hands held,
not someone in their face.

179
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,934
I know how to whip votes.

180
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:08,062
Best caviar in DC,
ladies and gentlemen.

181
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:10,146
- We can't let you pay for that.
- Then don't eat it.

182
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:13,691
But if you do,
I won't tell anyone.

183
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:16,318
You were saying
about the education bill...

184
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:34,708
No, Marjory, honey. Remember,
we just talked about it.

185
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,167
I was telling you...

186
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,421
Right. Nothing to worry about.

187
00:11:41,046 --> 00:11:43,172
If you have any questions,
ask Molly.

188
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:45,299
She knows what's going on.

189
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:50,303
I will call as soon
as I know anything.

190
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,140
I love you.

191
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,893
How's Marjory?

192
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,526
- She's OK.
- Long call.

193
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:13,405
You know, she... gets emotional.

194
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:16,197
Molly took a semester off
to be at home.

195
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:18,324
I told her she needs
to head back in the spring.

196
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:21,827
I don't want her mother
dragging her down.

197
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,414
- Must be hard on you.
- Harder on the girls, I think.

198
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:29,292
- Is she lucid?
- About half the time.

199
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:33,587
Just enough to be aware
of how quickly she's going.

200
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:35,715
It's awful.

201
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:46,012
I feel terrible saying it, but part of me
is looking forward to her not being lucid.

202
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:49,391
At least then she won't
realize what's happening.

203
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,268
I should have thought
of this before.

204
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,105
Appeal to the heart,
not the brain.

205
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,690
Forgive my ignorance, but...

206
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:03,485
...has there been any
progress with research?

207
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:09,406
Some. Genetic testing,
vascular manipulation. But it's slow.

208
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:12,451
They won't come up with
anything in time for Marjory.

209
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:16,495
We're focusing on quality of life.
Look, I know you have work to do, so...

210
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:18,789
I'm no longer the whip.
That's Jacqueline's job.

211
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,458
I just agreed to meet with you
because we have a history.

212
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,459
She would be tougher
to say no to.

213
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,585
But it still
would've been a "no."

214
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:29,963
- Yes.
- I admire your convictions, Donald.

215
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:31,923
You're a rare breed nowadays.

216
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,550
It didn't sound that way when
you were comparing us to the tea party.

217
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:39,137
I was being unfair. You're not
a reactionary. You're a progressive.

218
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:44,351
- I see where this is going.
- How do you mean?

219
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:49,521
When you've been in the
wasteland as long as I have,
you become immune to flattery.

220
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:52,731
I know you think I'm
fundamentally deceptive,

221
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,442
but I am capable
of a genuine compliment.

222
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,736
Then I will take it as one,
but it won't soften my resolve.

223
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,782
If it did, you wouldn't deserve
the compliment in the first place.

224
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:05,367
If you vote no,
I won't hold it against you.

225
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:08,285
We are all in this together
through the midterms.

226
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:14,415
But, if you stick with me,
we can show both the Republicans

227
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,001
and the American people that
we are capable of more than stagnation.

228
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:21,296
And that's worth something,
even if it hurts.

229
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,842
Who can I count on?

230
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,317
Copy that.

231
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:59,576
The fact that there's still
a door between us, I take as a bad sign.

232
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,993
One tested negative,
one inconclusive, sir.

233
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,120
That means we have to take
the samples to the lab.

234
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:06,955
- So how much longer?
- Another three or four hours.

235
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:10,792
We have an important vote going to the
floor. I have to be talking to my people.

236
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:14,545
The vote is delayed, sir.
We're evacuating this side of the Capitol.

237
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,547
- So no vote?
- Not until we get the all-clear.

238
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:20,508
- Good things happen to good people.
- Another thing, sir.

239
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,636
All cell phone service, WiFi,
land lines, we'll be blocking them,

240
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:26,804
in case there's
a legitimate security threat.

241
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:30,307
- I need to be able to call my wife!
- I apologize, sir.

242
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:33,476
- We can have someone notify her.
- No, it needs to be me.

243
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:35,854
She gets very anxious
if she doesn't recognize the voice.

244
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:37,979
Congressman, I have
strict instructions not...

245
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,816
Figure it out, unless you want me
to get the White House involved.

246
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,528
I'll find a way, sir.

247
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,365
There are advantages
to being vice president.

248
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,494
Ma'am, we'll have to ask you
to remain up here for a little while.

249
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,246
- Is it the quarantine?
- The Capitol is being evacuated.

250
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:04,125
We expect everything to be fine.
It's just standard procedure.

251
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:07,086
You won't be able to get through.
Communication's being jammed.

252
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:10,213
- You mean I can't even speak to Francis?
- Not until the all-clear.

253
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,882
- How long?
- - Four hours is the estimate right now.

254
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:16,636
- We're supposed to tape in 25 minutes.
- - Nothing we can do.

255
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:20,639
- You OK?
- Yes.

256
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,350
I'll go talk to Emma.

257
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,686
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

258
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:33,273
Em.

259
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:35,733
- So we might have a problem.
- It's all over the news.

260
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,610
- Yeah, it could be a while.
- Can we get audio from the vice president?

261
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,363
Communications are being
jammed until the evacuation's over.

262
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,864
- Have you spoken to Ashleigh?
- She thinks we should get

263
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,491
a sat truck down here
and wait and go live.

264
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:46,700
I can't guarantee
when that'll be.

265
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,495
The vice president is quarantined
in the Capitol and we have an exclusive.

266
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:51,913
The network will broadcast
whenever the hell we tell them to.

267
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:54,123
<i>They're</i>
<i>holding off until you get here.</i>

268
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:56,374
You should do the
interview solo.

269
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,710
<i>- I'd rather wait.</i>
- Who knows whether we'll win the vote?

270
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:02,212
If we lose, I don't want my face
on national television.

271
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:05,423
- This could be a silver lining.
- <i> I don't know, Francis.</i>

272
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,926
- I'm sure you'll be terrific.
- <i> Let me run it past Connor.</i>

273
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,261
OK.
Thank you, we're done.

274
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:16,265
- Sir, we were able to get Mrs. Blythe.
- Donald.

275
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:18,308
- Marjory?
<i>- Hello?</i>

276
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,519
- Yes, it's me, sweetheart.
- <i> It's hard to hear you.</i>

277
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,815
- We're still stuck inside the office.
- <i> What office?</i>

278
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:29,192
At the Capitol. It's going
to be a little while longer.

279
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:31,652
<i>But why are you there?</i>
<i>It's Sunday.</i>

280
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:34,613
- No, it's Friday, sweetheart.
- <i> Donald?</i>

281
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:37,657
- I'm here.
- <i> Who is this man with me?</i>

282
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:42,786
He's a police officer. They're using
walkie-talkies so we can speak.

283
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,913
<i>- Who am I talking to?
- - It's your husband, ma'am.</i>

284
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:49,040
<i>- I'm not married.</i>
- It's me. It's Donald.

285
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,083
<i>Turn it off.</i>
<i>I don't know that man.</i>

286
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:54,713
- Marjory!
- -<i> She went to the other room, sir.</i>

287
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:59,799
OK, thank you.

288
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,219
- If you could stay with her, please?
- -<i> Yes, sir.</i>

289
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:28,864
Drink?

290
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:34,701
Sure. Why not?

291
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:37,453
For all we know, it could be
midnight before he's out.

292
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,748
- He still needs to manage the vote.
- - We're fine if it's 2am.

293
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,957
When everyone's asleep.

294
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,000
- People would stay up for this.
- The whole point was primetime.

295
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,752
- Then we do it tomorrow.
- We've already set aside

296
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,293
half a day for this.
The vice president can't

297
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,337
rearrange his schedule
for an interview.

298
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:52,799
- I don't see any other options.
- I spoke to Francis over the radio.

299
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,469
- We think I should do it alone.
- Just you?

300
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,596
Mrs. Underwood and Ashleigh,
one-on-one.

301
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,056
Maybe we can
broadcast his voice...

302
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,223
Francis doesn't want
the entire interview

303
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:04,975
to be about the quarantine.

304
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,142
Neither do I.
That's just spectacle.

305
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,020
The quarantine is news.
We have an opportunity...

306
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:11,230
- We're done.
- What?

307
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,356
- Cancel the interview. No reschedule.
- Come on.

308
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:16,652
Please, pack up
everything and leave.

309
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:20,404
OK, let me call Ashleigh.

310
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:28,077
I thought I'd get used to it,
but no. Hurts every time.

311
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:32,747
You spend 30 years with someone and then
they don't have a damn clue who you are.

312
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,292
Oh... I really shouldn't.

313
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:40,294
If we never did anything
we shouldn't do,

314
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,964
we'd never feel good
about doing the things we should.

315
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:46,632
- Excellent point.
- If these are our last moments on Earth,

316
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,551
I don't know about you,
but I'd rather go out with a buzz on.

317
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:53,097
To Marjory.

318
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:58,392
- You love her dearly.
- More than anything.

319
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:05,354
I can't imagine what I'd do
without Claire, or if she...

320
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,732
...didn't remember who I was.

321
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,525
- Hopefully you'll never have to.
- It makes me angry that you do.

322
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:14,155
- That anybody does. - No sense being
angry over what you can't change.

323
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,117
How much funding
does Alzheimer's research get?

324
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,785
Just under 500 million.

325
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,829
Well, I'm no expert, but that
sounds inadequate to me.

326
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,040
It is. For every $100
we allocate to research,

327
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:33,127
- we spend nearly $30,000 on care.
- We oughta change that.

328
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,879
I tried. My bill didn't even
leave committee.

329
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,256
- Who opposed it?
- Howard Webb.

330
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:43,760
- Appropriations.
- He didn't even put it to a vote.

331
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:48,263
- I've never been fond of Howard.
- That makes two of us.

332
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:51,683
- What was his argument?
- He didn't feel he owed me one.

333
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,727
"Fiscally irresponsible,"
is all he said.

334
00:20:54,728 --> 00:21:00,900
Walk me through the
specifics of your bill.

335
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:10,948
- I see what you're doing.
- Doing what?

336
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:13,240
- You're disgusting, Frank.
- Excuse me.

337
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,952
- Using my wife.
- Donald, what are you saying?

338
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:19,579
You think I'll give in on entitlement
if you slap some extra Alzheimer's funding

339
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,873
- on the table?
- I was not suggesting that at all.

340
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:25,167
- Bullshit, Frank.
- You think as little of me as you want,

341
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:26,877
but I do not barter
with people's health.

342
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:29,420
Then why are you trying to raise
the age of retirement?

343
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,255
Medical research we can afford.
Medicare we can't.

344
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:36,134
- There are realities, Donald.
- Don't talk down to me about realities.

345
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:39,137
My wife is dying!
That's a reality!

346
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:42,556
Other people will die, too,
if your package succeeds!

347
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:46,017
That's a reality! Goddamn it,
I wish I wasn't stuck

348
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:48,309
- in this fucking room with you!
- Donald.

349
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,312
I'm done talking!

350
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:53,982
- One more time.
- I've got it.

351
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:56,482
I want it to sound more natural.

352
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:59,861
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

353
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:04,657
And we didn't feel that we could both
do that and be the parents we wanted to be.

354
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,283
And by making that choice,
it allows more time for us

355
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,952
- to be in the service of others.
- Good, that sounds good.

356
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,329
We need you,
Mrs. Underwood.

357
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:21,753
Keep Derek at the Capitol. I want quotes
from evacuees and Homeland Security.

358
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:25,590
And Sarah should be finishing
that history of biohazard scares.

359
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,050
I'll be there soon.

360
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,969
- I have to go.
- No. We're not done yet.

361
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,596
This is a major story.
I'll come back tomorrow.

362
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:36,472
Come here two days in a row
and this is how patterns emerge.

363
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:40,267
The FBI likes patterns. And we do not
give the FBI what the FBI likes.

364
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:42,228
I can't disappear all
day in the middle of...

365
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:47,231
- I have eight reporters out in the field.
- Stop!

366
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:52,569
- Tell me why I purchased Cashew.
- I don't know.

367
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,654
Companionship?

368
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:57,364
Yes.

369
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:02,534
But more importantly,
a reminder that I am never more

370
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:06,705
than one wrong move away
from life in a cage.

371
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:08,497
You stay.

372
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:10,792
I'm gonna walk you through every
line of code I intend to write,

373
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:13,585
every attempt I make to breach
the wall. If we get caught,

374
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:16,212
you don't get to plead
ignorance. We go down together.

375
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,672
I didn't sign up for Bonnie and Clyde.
You need me for this one thing.

376
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:22,300
Just like I need you.
But whatever you've done before me...

377
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:28,723
You know where I live,
and you know who I am.

378
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,606
Sit down. The sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

379
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:46,736
<i>The Capitol is still on lockdown</i>
<i>as hazmat crews continue</i>

380
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,446
<i>a thorough sweep</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

381
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,489
<i>Earlier this morning,</i>
<i>a white powder-like</i>

382
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,741
<i>- substance was found</i>
<i>in a package...</i>

383
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:55,660
<i>...mailed to the office of</i>
<i>Majority Whip Jacqueline Sharp.</i>

384
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:59,079
- Are we free to go?
- Almost, sir. Less than an hour.

385
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,123
- I've got a message from your wife.
- - What is it?

386
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,625
She's doing the
interview live, right now.

387
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:08,795
<i>...Congressman Donald Blythe and 14 of Ms.
Sharp's staff.</i>

388
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:13,507
<i>Mrs. Underwood, I so appreciate</i>
<i>you taking the time to speak with us today</i>

389
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:17,510
<i>in what I am certain</i>
<i>is a very stressful situation.</i>

390
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:21,263
<i>- Thank you, Ashleigh.</i>
<i>- Have you spoken with your husband today?</i>

391
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:24,473
<i>Yes, I did,</i>
<i>and he's in very good spirits,</i>

392
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:26,558
<i>and in good hands</i>
<i>with the Secret Service.</i>

393
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,978
<i>Of course, he's very</i>
<i>disappointed he couldn't be here.</i>

394
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:32,188
<i>Well, our thoughts are with him
and everyone else quarantined</i>

395
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:34,023
<i>- at the Capitol today.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

396
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:37,109
I'd like to begin
with Claire Underwood

397
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,320
before you met your husband,
in Texas.

398
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:43,155
- And I have a couple of pictures.
- Oh, no.

399
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:45,073
Yes.

400
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:48,408
Oh, my goodness.
That was Red.

401
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,745
- An accomplished rider?
- An enthusiast.

402
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:57,415
- This one's from a couple of years later.
- Oh, my goodness.

403
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,294
You like those penny loafers?
Those are won...

404
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:05,007
Those are two very different girls.
Which one are you more comfortable being?

405
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,344
My family's ranch,
that was home for me.

406
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:13,095
You didn't like the prep school?

407
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:16,640
No, I think
I preferred the dirt.

408
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:23,061
You grew up in Dallas,
though. Highland Park.

409
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:27,772
Yes. My father, well, he was
a businessman, so we lived in the city.

410
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:32,526
But we're ranchers. I mean,
we go back three generations, our family.

411
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:35,238
Your parents were very wealthy.

412
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:38,198
We were comfortable, yes.

413
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:41,367
They made sure
I wanted for nothing.

414
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:44,078
It was a very happy childhood.

415
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,497
What is your most vivid
memory from that time?

416
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:53,002
My most vivid memory?
Wow. Um...

417
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,756
Probably, when I was
about nine or ten,

418
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:03,467
my father took me to Dealey
Plaza where Kennedy was shot.

419
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:06,720
And he said, "Claire,
a great man died here."

420
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:11,057
And I remember not
fully comprehending

421
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:13,392
the meaning of death yet.

422
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:17,938
And I asked him how he died
and he told me.

423
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:21,608
And I remember feeling so sad,
so angry.

424
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,984
It seemed so unfair.

425
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:31,031
I started to cry, and my daddy picked
me up and he wrapped his arms around me

426
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:34,866
and he said,
"Don't be sad, sweetheart.

427
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:40,289
He made the world a better place,
but sometimes that comes at a price."

428
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:45,542
I guess that was
the most vivid memory.

429
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,681
- We're only eight votes away.
- I'm sorry, I made up my mind.

430
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:06,392
Me too. I gotta stick
to my guns on this one.

431
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:09,269
You would rather
let the government shut down...

432
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,895
Don't put that on us because
we're on the ass-end of the whip list.

433
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,815
Don't get us wrong.
We have a lot of respect for you, Jackie.

434
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,609
You're doing a fine job since Frank's gone.
Different styles, but a fine job.

435
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,946
Excuse us just a moment.

436
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:25,906
- They're not taking me seriously.
- Because you're not Frank.

437
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:29,701
- You mean because I'm not a man.
- No, I mean Frank.

438
00:27:29,702 --> 00:27:33,121
They're used to being offered something.
Ask them what they want.

439
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:34,956
Paul needs help with the
waste treatment facility.

440
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:38,250
You're being just
as condescending as they are.

441
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:43,212
Take some good advice when you get it.
I was right earlier, wasn't I?

442
00:27:47,842 --> 00:27:52,093
Paul, Remy tells me you
need a waste treatment plant.

443
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:56,055
We've had some trouble
getting matching federal funds.

444
00:27:56,056 --> 00:28:00,058
Ben, you mentioned once
a winery museum in your district.

445
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,352
We are making some
great wines in Long Island these days.

446
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:06,022
I've tried some. It tastes like piss
compared to what we have in Napa.

447
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:09,107
The sort of piss that belongs in Paul's
waste treatment plant.

448
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:11,985
- Jackie...
- We have a possible terror attack,

449
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:14,320
and you're holding out your
plates for more pork?

450
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:16,488
You should be ashamed of
yourselves. In my caucus,

451
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:21,701
people are rewarded for good behavior,
not trading their votes for ransom.

452
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,203
When we walk in there,
I expect the both of you

453
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:28,081
to vote yes without
a moment's hesitation.

454
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,710
Thank you for your
change of heart.

455
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:37,046
Six more to go.

456
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:41,757
<i>You left Texas and spent the</i>
<i>last two years of high school</i>

457
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:43,925
<i>at the prestigious</i>
<i>Phillips Academy.</i>

458
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:48,305
- And then onto Radcliffe.
- Yes.

459
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,639
Where you would meet
the future vice president.

460
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,518
Back then,
just a dashing law student.

461
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,811
I never dreamed he would become
vice president, of course.

462
00:28:57,812 --> 00:29:01,981
Some people think that your marriage may
be a bit more calculated than you let on.

463
00:29:01,982 --> 00:29:05,527
That perhaps he needed
your family's money.

464
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:08,487
- No, that's just not true.
- Your father did contribute an awful lot

465
00:29:08,488 --> 00:29:12,240
- to his campaign. - Yes, he did,
because he believed in Francis.

466
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:16,911
Would he have won that campaign had it
not been for your father's contributions?

467
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:18,828
I don't know.
I mean, it certainly helped.

468
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:21,247
But I like to think
that it was Francis's ideas

469
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:24,917
and leadership that convinced
voters, not just TV commercials.

470
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:28,460
- You've been married 27 years.
- That's right.

471
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:31,671
You were just in school.
I mean, you married so young.

472
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:35,841
We did, but when
you've found the one...

473
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:38,718
Well, Francis was the one.

474
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:43,932
- You call him Francis.
- Back home they call him Frank, still.

475
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,016
But he likes
that I call him Francis.

476
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,810
<i>He said that it makes him</i>
<i>sound more sophisticated.</i>

477
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:55,566
- Is it hard being a politician's wife?
- It's thrilling.

478
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:59,693
- Not without its challenges.
- Always in the background.

479
00:29:59,694 --> 00:30:03,113
Subsuming your goals
for his goals.

480
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:05,197
Well, I don't see it that way.

481
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:11,827
We're two very independent people
who have chosen to live our lives together.

482
00:30:11,828 --> 00:30:13,871
I support him.
He supports me.

483
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:18,125
Which, you know, goes back
to the political partnership.

484
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:22,919
My husband happens to be a politician.
And I happen to do political work.

485
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,340
But our partnership
extends far beyond that.

486
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:33,011
Children.
Was that a sacrifice?

487
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:35,305
Because you haven't had any.

488
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:38,932
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

489
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:42,351
And we didn't feel that we could both do
that and be the parents we wanted to be.

490
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:44,145
So we made the choice.

491
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:47,606
- We've heard that answer before.
- Sorry?

492
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:51,276
You have given the exact same
answer in previous interviews.

493
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:53,444
Because it's the truth.

494
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:58,239
Forgive me,
but career and timing,

495
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,032
those are often
very convenient answers.

496
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:04,660
It is true that whatever it takes
for people to get from "maybe" to "yes"

497
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:08,498
- never arrived for me.
- Never felt the pressure?

498
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,208
No... maternal instinct?

499
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:15,295
- No.
- And it was a choice?

500
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:17,754
It wasn't because
you couldn't have any?

501
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:20,298
Francis and I did
what was right for us.

502
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,925
Because it is unusual,
I mean, even now,

503
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:29,472
for politicians at the
executive level not to have children.

504
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:31,223
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

505
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:34,850
<i>In your husband's</i>
<i>second congressional campaign,</i>

506
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,894
<i>there was a Republican,</i>
<i>a pro-family candidate,</i>

507
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,106
<i>who made some pretty</i>
<i>unsettling accusations.</i>

508
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:45,942
<i>Well, Francis</i>
<i>is a Southern Democrat.</i>

509
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:48,569
<i>We have thick skins.</i>

510
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:53,115
<i>He suggested, in order to keep your
husband's political career on track...</i>

511
00:31:53,116 --> 00:31:56,868
<i>Children are the center</i>
<i>of many people's lives.</i>

512
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:00,162
<i>And I think they just want to make sure
that their representatives will fight</i>

513
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:05,458
<i>for their children's dreams. And Francis
has again and again proven that he will.</i>

514
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:09,169
<i>And he will continue</i>
<i>to do so as vice president.</i>

515
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,547
<i>He claimed that...</i>

516
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:14,675
...you may have been pregnant
during the campaign.

517
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,178
Was there a pregnancy?

518
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:26,307
Have you ever been pregnant?

519
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:29,436
- Break. Now.
- That's not gonna happen.

520
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,567
Yes.

521
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:41,571
- During the campaign?
- Before.

522
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:48,242
- Was it a miscarriage?
- No.

523
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:50,493
Did you...

524
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:53,413
<i>Did you terminate the pregnancy?</i>

525
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:56,788
If I said yes,

526
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:01,668
my husband's political career
would be in jeopardy.

527
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:06,881
My faith would be questioned.
Likely, my life would be threatened.

528
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:12,262
But I won't feel ashamed. Yes, I was
pregnant. And, yes, I had an abortion.

529
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:19,932
- Can you excuse me for one moment?
- Of course.

530
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:24,354
<i>We'll have more of our live interview
with Claire Underwood in a moment.</i>

531
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,817
That took a lot of guts.

532
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:38,740
Yes, it did.

533
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:42,408
No. It'll look like I am ashamed.
I'm not. And I won't.

534
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,160
Nothing you can say
will make this any better.

535
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:46,411
- I'd rather deal with...
- I'm not going to run from this.

536
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:48,872
She's going to ask why
you had the abortion.

537
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:50,624
I haven't had one.
I've had three.

538
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,832
Three? No, you need
to stick to one.

539
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,961
- OK. Fine.
- Tell me what you'll say.

540
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:58,129
Well, I can't
use the real reason.

541
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,339
The first two, I was a
teenager and I was reckless.

542
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,424
What about the third?

543
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:05,218
Well, the article that
she showed, it's right.

544
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:07,803
I was on the pill, it didn't work.
We talked about having the baby,

545
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:10,222
- and then we decided against it.
- Why?

546
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:13,182
- Because we were focused on the campaign.
- How many weeks in?

547
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:18,145
- Sixteen.
- You can't say any of this.

548
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:19,812
Go upstairs.
I'll deal with Ashleigh.

549
00:34:19,814 --> 00:34:22,690
If we're going to continue,
we've got about 20 seconds.

550
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,857
- Connor, I...
- Please trust me.

551
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:26,612
You'll be making a big mistake.

552
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:37,535
Are you willing
to discuss the circumstances...

553
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:41,036
I became pregnant
as a result of a sexual assault.

554
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:45,041
- Are you saying that you... you were...
- Raped.

555
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,212
<i>You've never spoken publicly</i>
<i>about this before.</i>

556
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,172
<i>No one ever asked.</i>

557
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:56,299
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

558
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,760
<i>It was college.</i>
<i>A classmate.</i>

559
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:02,554
We were dating
and it happened on a...

560
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:06,474
We had a fight,
and he forced himself on me.

561
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:09,726
Did you tell anybody about it,
I mean, did he...?

562
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:12,061
- Was he charged?
- No.

563
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:15,356
Because at the time I felt that I was
somehow at fault. I knew I wasn't.

564
00:35:15,357 --> 00:35:18,275
But I just didn't
want to be stared at.

565
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:21,736
I didn't want to be known
as the girl who got raped.

566
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:26,574
And when I became pregnant,
I wasn't gonna drop out of school.

567
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:31,202
I wasn't going to
let this man ruin my life.

568
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:35,079
So I made a choice.
I ended it.

569
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,290
But if you never told
anybody about it,

570
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,666
the assailant could
still be out there.

571
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:42,627
Can you tell us
anything about him?

572
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:47,088
I saw him for the first time in
almost 30 years just a few months ago.

573
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:49,550
<i>Where?</i>

574
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:54,721
<i>At a commissioning</i>
<i>ceremony that Francis and I attended.</i>

575
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:57,597
- Did you speak to him?
- Briefly.

576
00:35:57,598 --> 00:36:01,893
- Francis pinned stars on him.
- He was being commissioned?

577
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,438
General Dalton McGinnis.

578
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:11,983
And for the record, Francis
has always known about the assault,

579
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:13,610
he just didn't know the name.

580
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:19,113
And he's been nothing
but supportive all these years.

581
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:23,284
We're gonna have
to reach out to the general...

582
00:36:23,285 --> 00:36:25,286
...for a response
to what you just said.

583
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:29,873
Would you mind
if we took a quick break?

584
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:32,041
Absolutely.

585
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:36,837
We'll be right back with
Mrs. Claire Underwood.
Take all the time you need.

586
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:45,093
The lab tests
all came back negative, sir.

587
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:47,428
- What was it?
- Talcum powder laced with flour.

588
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:50,222
It was pesticide from the wheat
that gave us the false positive.

589
00:36:50,223 --> 00:36:52,098
- So are we free to go?
- Yes, sir.

590
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,391
- Nancy! Tell them I'm on my way down.
- I already did.

591
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,894
- Mind if I use your phone?
- Of course.

592
00:36:56,895 --> 00:37:01,606
And Donald, I'm gonna get you that research
funding, no matter how the vote goes.

593
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:03,941
It's your call, because I'm
still voting against it.

594
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:08,236
- I understand.
- You have a brave wife, Frank.

595
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:09,821
So do you, Donald.

596
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:16,701
- Frank!
- How did you do?

597
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,660
We're down four.
How about Blythe?

598
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:20,453
- He won't budge.
- What did you offer him?

599
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,413
Alzheimer's research.
He was insulted.

600
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,748
- The vote's in 45 minutes.
- I need to get to Claire.

601
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,250
- Who should I call from the car?
- We have exhausted our options.

602
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,085
It's Blythe's people
or it won't pass.

603
00:37:29,086 --> 00:37:31,962
- They're too loyal to him.
- Hey, go. I'll figure it out.

604
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:35,758
- I can stay if you need me. - No, get to
your wife. I know where to find you.

605
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:40,594
Nancy! I need every
ream of paper you have!

606
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,972
And get me dollies!

607
00:37:58,024 --> 00:38:01,194
Almost done.
Twenty more minutes.

608
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:04,738
I hate lying.

609
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:06,448
- Did he do it?
- Yes.

610
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:10,784
- Then don't feel bad.
- What if he denies it?

611
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:13,662
Then we'll cross that bridge.

612
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:15,788
- Connor?
- Give us one more minute.

613
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:17,998
We have a young woman
on the phone, a private.

614
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:22,209
She says she was also assaulted
by the general. Two years ago.

615
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,879
She wants to share her story,
but she won't give her name.

616
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,590
We can't put her on
if she's anonymous.

617
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,302
- You want me to convince her?
- She's frightened.

618
00:38:33,303 --> 00:38:35,596
Is she still on the phone?

619
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:39,682
<i>I've never told anyone.</i>

620
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:45,270
It took me almost half my life
before I could say anything.

621
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:48,439
But you can say something now.

622
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,440
<i>I don't know.</i>

623
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,735
Just think of how many
others there must have been.

624
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:55,569
<i>But you want me to talk.</i>

625
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,655
Well, would you have called
if you didn't want to?

626
00:38:58,656 --> 00:39:01,239
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>I'd have to use my name.</i>

627
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,910
Listen, I understand
you're afraid of the consequence.

628
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:07,495
<i>I'm a private. He's a general.</i>

629
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:10,956
And my husband is the vice
president of the United States.

630
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:15,169
We will protect you.
I promise you that.

631
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:20,088
What's your name?

632
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:25,719
<i>Private Megan Hennessey.</i>

633
00:39:31,264 --> 00:39:35,767
- What is this?
- The names of every person in America

634
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:38,143
who will lose home care
when the freeze sets in.

635
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:41,230
Who will lose half
their welfare benefits.

636
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:43,147
Who will go on furlough.

637
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:46,234
Who will lose their student
loans, transportation services,

638
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:49,486
post-combat counseling.
Shall I go on?

639
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,488
This is about the big picture,
Jacqueline.

640
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,992
This picture looks
pretty big to me.

641
00:39:57,244 --> 00:39:59,954
I can't vote for the package.

642
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:03,998
Then don't.

643
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,083
Just get four
of your people to do it.

644
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:10,086
And then, work with me
after we avoid the freeze.

645
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm not Frank Underwood.

646
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:18,676
<i>At least two</i>
<i>other girls that same year.</i>

647
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:22,429
<i>If that was true for all</i>
<i>the years he's served...</i>

648
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,473
- It's just staggering.
- <i> And I've felt so helpless.</i>

649
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:31,561
<i>And he keeps rising in the</i>
<i>ranks. The system protects him.</i>

650
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,522
Why do you think
no one has ever reported him?

651
00:40:35,523 --> 00:40:37,440
Do you want to join her?

652
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:39,234
<i>- We know it won't do anything.
</i> - No.

653
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:40,902
<i>Chain of command.</i>

654
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,736
It's inexcusable
that you're willing

655
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:45,154
to put your life on the line
to defend our freedom,

656
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:47,865
and yet you don't feel the
freedom to come forward.

657
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:52,786
<i>I love my country,</i>
<i>and I love serving in the Marines.</i>

658
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,871
<i>But not like this.</i>

659
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:57,497
<i>Private Hennessey,</i>
<i>thank you for your courage</i>

660
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,791
<i>in joining us tonight.</i>

661
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:03,127
<i>It was Mrs. Underwood</i>
<i>who gave me the courage.</i>

662
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,588
<i>Mrs. Underwood,</i>
<i>thank you for your honesty.</i>

663
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,423
Sir, your wife is on the phone.

664
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,925
<i>You've given us</i>
<i>a great deal to think about.</i>

665
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,675
<i>Thank you, Ashleigh.</i>

666
00:41:12,676 --> 00:41:15,971
And that concludes our live
one-on-one exclusive interview

667
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:19,849
with Claire Underwood. You can watch
the entire interview on our website.

668
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,266
And as always, we invite you
to give us your thoughts

669
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:24,518
and your comments
on Facebook and on Twitter.

670
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:27,563
But for now, thanks for watching
and good night.

671
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:29,941
And we're out.

672
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:37,362
This is going to make waves
like you never imagined.

673
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:40,574
Thank you.

674
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:13,264
- Where's Carter?
- You'll be reporting to me now.

675
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:17,352
- And who are you?
- Carter's boss.

676
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:20,855
You're doing good work, Gavin.
But you can't be assaulting the target.

677
00:42:20,856 --> 00:42:23,272
That could compromise us.

678
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:25,607
I don't even know why you're
going after this guy. He's small-time.

679
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:28,652
- That's not your concern. - He couldn't
write a line of code to save his life.

680
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:31,445
He intends to commit an act
of cyberterrorism.

681
00:42:31,446 --> 00:42:34,490
Well, that's intention, not capability.
He's not a real threat.

682
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:37,826
Maybe Carter
talked things out with you.

683
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:39,162
I won't.

684
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:46,666
- How much longer?
- Until what?

685
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:50,378
- Until I can stop.
- You prefer prison?

686
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:54,047
I've given you eight child
pornographers, three botnet masters.

687
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:56,049
But you still haven't
given us AVunit.

688
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,425
I told Carter I don't
know where he is.

689
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:03,179
- Yes, you do.
- I don't. Nobody does.

690
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,224
Then what about your
friends in Dec Sec?

691
00:43:11,562 --> 00:43:14,437
I'm not giving you my friends.

692
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:16,982
Then you can keep doing this.

693
00:43:16,983 --> 00:43:19,150
You're a productive asset,
Gavin.

694
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:22,443
But the moment you stop
being productive,

695
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:24,279
no lawyer can help you.

696
00:43:46,714 --> 00:43:49,966
I wish we had the
real thing right now.

697
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:08,940
- Always prepared.
- Francis.

698
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:25,076
- I've missed this.
- So have I.

699
00:44:25,077 --> 00:44:27,411
Shouldn't you be on the phone
getting your accolades?

700
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:30,081
They can wait till tomorrow.

701
00:44:33,626 --> 00:44:35,834
Sing me something.

702
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:38,670
- What do you want to hear?
- Anything.

703
00:45:32,720 --> 00:47:55,671
