3
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:15,535
Evelyn...

4
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,246
- Mr. Danton.
- Remy.

5
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:22,083
- How are you?
- I'm OK. I'm good.

6
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,336
- Been awhile.
- Yeah, it has.

7
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,385
- Good morning.
- Mr. Vice President.

8
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,803
Chief Whitehall.

9
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,723
Is Andrew Jackson
going to be joining us?

10
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,977
No, I'm sorry, that's a terrible
oversight. Doug, will you... remove that.

11
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,354
Why don't we take
the photograph first.

12
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,862
Thank you.

13
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,488
Please have a seat.

14
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,037
Let's talk federal recognition.

15
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,456
Your tribe has waited
long enough.

16
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,490
Who is it?

17
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,159
It's me.
It's Lisa.

18
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,709
Can I come in?

19
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,296
Temp jobs, mostly.
Clerical work...

20
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,509
Right now I'm doing part-time
at a dentist's office. Reception.

21
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,302
You deserve better.

22
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,137
It is what it is.

23
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,100
This is the first time I've had
Starbucks since I can remember.

24
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,769
It's a luxury for me these days.

25
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,772
Maybe there's something
for you at Glendon Hill.

26
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:11,734
That's nice of you to say, but I'm not
the right fit for a place like that.

27
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,404
Sure you are. Twenty years' experience
in the non-profit sphere,

28
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:17,699
you coordinated all the time
NGOs, you'd be a valuable asset to us.

29
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:23,287
- Claire should've never let you go.
- Yeah.

30
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:26,082
Well... I'll hold my tongue.

31
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,921
She and I don't talk.
We had a falling out.

32
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,465
- Loyalty isn't her thing.
- No, it is not.

33
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:36,884
I don't think
she's loyal to anyone.

34
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:43,683
- Except maybe her husband.
- Maybe... maybe not.

35
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,937
- What do you mean?
- Nothing I know for certain, but...

36
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:51,274
...spend a decade
working for someone...

37
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:59,240
- She threaten you or anything?
- No.

38
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,075
She just wouldn't leave.

39
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,703
It's not like I wanted to call
the cops, she's not a bad person.

40
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,747
- No, no, but...
- I tried to talk to her,

41
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:09,250
then she lit up a pipe.

42
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,085
- Meth.
- Yeah.

43
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,671
When we were roommates
that's all it was.

44
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,132
I used to be really deep
into that.

45
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,635
Heroin too.

46
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:23,055
- And then I found the Fellowship.
- What can I do?

47
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:26,225
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here...
- No, I'm glad you came here.

48
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,269
- I know you're late for work.
- I'll call in sick.

49
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:31,397
- Don't do that, it's not...
- Don't go, stay here.

50
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,691
I mean, don't go back there.

51
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,028
Look...

52
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:41,866
- Are you sure?
- Keys. In case you need to come and go.

53
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,994
- I'll be back around 7:30.
- Thank you.

54
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,537
You don't have to thank me.

55
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,565
All the president has to do is pick up
the phone and the bridge is approved.

56
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,984
If the president had wanted to be involved,
he would've already made that call.

57
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:20,279
- It's his initiative, Linda. - Was his
initiative. We're in a trade war now.

58
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,239
That doesn't mean
we have to abandon good policy.

59
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,991
It's inconsistent
with his current stance...

60
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,661
The committee on foreign
investment has 30 days to approve.

61
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,829
There's only six days left.
They won't act without

62
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,998
a directive from the president
of the United States.

63
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:35,127
I'm confused, you've been the biggest
proponent of our position against China.

64
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:38,506
That is not true. I advocated
the opposite early on.

65
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,258
You seem fixated on this bridge.
Is something else going on here?

66
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:44,303
Unemployment is at
nine-point-two, inflation is skyrocketing,

67
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,222
we're on the verge
of losing our majority.

68
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,516
The president needs to offer
a piece of good news.

69
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:50,726
A bridge? That's a drop
in the bucket.

70
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:53,312
Jobs, infrastructure,
deficit reduction...

71
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,564
You're still not
being straight with me.

72
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:57,692
I have no ulterior motive here,

73
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,404
but if you feel that strongly
and the president feels that strongly,

74
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:05,366
then I'll back off.
I won't mention it again.

75
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:08,744
I think that's a wise decision.
We should be a united front.

76
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:12,164
- I couldn't agree more.
- Thank you.

77
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:14,500
Why does everything
have to be a struggle?

78
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,212
- Can't some people just
say "yes" for once? - Sir.

79
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,631
I need the president's schedule
for the next two days.

80
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:22,633
- She change her mind?
- What do you think?

81
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:25,094
- So what's our next move?
- I'll focus on the bridge,

82
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:26,887
you talk to the Indian affairs.

83
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,306
The sooner that Whitehall's
tribe gets recognized,

84
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:31,517
the sooner they can
break ground on that casino.

85
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,185
Yes sir.

86
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,229
Maybe it will help me, you know?

87
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,399
If I talk about it
more in the open.

88
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,776
I mean that's what
your interview did.

89
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,738
When I called. When I could
say those things out loud.

90
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:46,282
Well, we don't want you
to feel obligated.

91
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:49,201
I know the press
hasn't left you alone.

92
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:53,539
If they're going to keep taking pictures
of me, I should at least say something.

93
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,332
Well, that's only going
to become more intense

94
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,293
when McGinnis gets closer
to his court-marshal.

95
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:00,045
Yeah, I know.
I'm prepared.

96
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:03,757
If you come and speak to the
Armed Services Committee, tell your story,

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,926
I feel confident
we can get it to a vote.

98
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,804
- I'd be too much coverage to ignore it.
- And you think it will pass?

99
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,182
- We need to get it through committee
first. - But let's be clear, Megan,

100
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,808
it's not just the testimony.

101
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,227
We'll need you to do
a media avail after.

102
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,229
Photo ops, a statement.

103
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,482
- OK.
- You won't be alone.

104
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:22,151
- I'll be standing right next to you.
- And so will I.

105
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:24,737
OK.

106
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,326
Do you think we're doing the right thing?
Hauling her in front of the cameras?

107
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,871
We have to trust her
when she says she wants to.

108
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:39,585
But it's very important that
the White House backs us
up on this, not just you.

109
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,422
I'm not sure if Garrett
will get involved publicly.

110
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,591
Well, can you talk to him?

111
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,427
We haven't been doing much
talking about anything lately.

112
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,726
Things haven't
gotten any better?

113
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:59,480
We haven't said a word
to each other in almost a week.

114
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,107
- I've been there, it's awful.
- With Frank?

115
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,401
- Sure.
- What did you do?

116
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,363
We saw someone.

117
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:10,824
You mean a therapist?

118
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:14,119
- Weren't you worried about exposure?
- He was a minister.

119
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:20,167
He wasn't exactly a therapist. It was more
like a spiritual guidance, type thing.

120
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,461
The only difference
was that he had a degree.

121
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,839
I could put you in touch.

122
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,466
It's too risky.

123
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,803
Just a suggestion.

124
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,596
Let me know if
you change your mind.

125
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,182
Thanks.

126
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,143
In the meantime,
can you try to talk to Garrett?

127
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,729
We really need
his support with this.

128
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:42,272
I will.

129
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:52,449
Yes?

130
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,911
Show him in please.

131
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:11,927
- Remy.
- So formal.

132
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:16,974
Would you have a seat?

133
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:19,143
Shouldn't keep
your interns so late.

134
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:21,520
You and I might not
have lives but they do.

135
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,231
When there's work to be done,
we work. They know that.

136
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:29,611
- Why am I here at ten at night?
- Where's the GOP getting their money?

137
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:33,615
- That's a $25 million question isn't it?
- You must have an idea.

138
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:36,910
- What makes you think that?
- Because you know things.

139
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,456
That's why Glendon Hill
made you partner.

140
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:44,334
Most of our clients are Democrats,
I'm just as much in the dark as you are.

141
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,713
I'm losing in my district, Remy.

142
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,048
I wish I could help you.

143
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,926
Even if I pull off
a win, it doesn't matter.

144
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:57,055
The GOP takes the house,
I lose my spot in the leadership,

145
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:59,516
this office, everything
I've worked for.

146
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,518
I feel for you.

147
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:03,979
But you want information
I don't have.

148
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:13,530
Are you upset about
the last time we saw each other?

149
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,117
Not at all. I made myself clear.

150
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,288
Can we talk?
No work, no politics.

151
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,337
We can talk about
whatever you want.

152
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:34,134
I've never... been with anyone
for more than six months.

153
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:38,388
When I was in the army I was
always on the move and, um...

154
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:42,017
Since I've been in Congress,
I just haven't had time.

155
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:47,105
I wasn't asking to marry you.
Just to be more than company for a night.

156
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:49,942
Do you still want that?

157
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,611
I'm here, aren't I?

158
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,907
There would have
to be clear boundaries.

159
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:00,452
Whatever we have privately couldn't
affect our professional relationship.

160
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,087
Then we shouldn't be having this
conversation in your office.

161
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:15,342
I'm glad we had this meeting.

162
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:18,929
If you'd like to have
another, just call me.

163
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:21,390
We can leave the
secretaries out of it.

164
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,321
I'll review this
and have Linda get in touch.

165
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:37,948
Thank you, sir.

166
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:48,709
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Hi, Frank.

167
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:53,422
I left my bourbon at home,
but you have time for some coffee?

168
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,132
I'm fine, you go ahead.

169
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,680
I wanted to talk to you
about the Port Jefferson Bridge.

170
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,765
Linda told me you two spoke.

171
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:05,809
Have you reconsidered?

172
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,812
It's not the right time, Frank.

173
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:14,818
We'll find some other project to showcase
our program once tensions subside.

174
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:17,404
During the campaign,
you repeatedly promised

175
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:19,281
to address critical
infrastructure.

176
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,575
We're well into
your second year.

177
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:25,162
This project is ready to go, you don't
want to have to start from square one.

178
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:27,622
I'm thinking midterms.

179
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:29,791
We have to project consistency.

180
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:35,338
Except people don't vote for consistency,
they vote for concrete progress.

181
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:39,509
Linda mentioned that you seemed
obsessed with this bridge.

182
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,428
I'm beginning to think
she was right.

183
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:44,931
The backstabbing,
vomit-inducing bitch.

184
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,058
Is she right, Frank?

185
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:50,228
Tell me why this bridge
is so important to you.

186
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,525
- I wanted to insulate you from this...
- From what?

187
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:04,367
You asked me to back channel with
the Chinese and I have continued to do so.

188
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:08,330
No, I told you to stop back
channeling and you did anyway?

189
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,292
- Without informing me, Frank...
- I needed to distance you.

190
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:15,003
There are issues that
a president cannot be aware of.

191
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:18,340
- What issues...
- But, what I can tell you...

192
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,467
...is that the building
of this bridge

193
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:24,054
directly affects our ability to
combat the Republicans in the midterms.

194
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:26,723
- Have the Chinese...
- Mr. President, you are asking questions

195
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:29,935
you do not want the answers to.

196
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,229
All right, how much
danger are we in, Frank?

197
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,940
None if we end this
conversation right now.

198
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:41,780
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing control
over my goddamn administration.

199
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,783
You're under pressure, sir,
but you're not losing control.

200
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:49,871
You have people who are
looking out for you: me, Linda, your wife.

201
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:52,123
I might be losing control
of her too.

202
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,169
I shouldn't have said that...

203
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:59,923
Of course she wants
the best for me.

204
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:03,218
Has Claire said anything?
I know they talk.

205
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,556
Not much... just that things
have been a little rocky.

206
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:11,351
Well, that's an understatement.

207
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:17,065
You have the most difficult job on earth.
It would take a toll on any marriage.

208
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:21,069
Which is why I'm urging you
to reconsider your decision on the bridge.

209
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:26,533
And I'd say that not as
your vice president... but as your friend.

210
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,743
Because I care about you.

211
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:39,671
All right, I'll...
I'll have another look at it.

212
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,966
Thank you, Mr...

213
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,304
Thank you, Garrett.

214
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:54,060
- Mr. Frost.
- Morning.

215
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,730
We filed all our paperwork
back in 2006.

216
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,149
We dotted all of our I's
and crossed all of our T's.

217
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,361
There's over 317 applications. Each one
requires at least a year to review.

218
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,822
- You need more researchers.
- It's not just personnel.

219
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:08,658
There's travel, filing,
administration...

220
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:10,910
Name the figure.

221
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,996
Twelve, thirteen million.

222
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,123
That requires an appropriation
from Congress.

223
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:16,750
The vice president
can make that happen.

224
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,627
But first we need you
to recognize the Ugaya tribe.

225
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:23,715
Our policy is first come, first serve.
There are other applications which we...

226
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:26,134
Daniel Lanagin disenrolled us.

227
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:29,137
We lost our right
to BIA benefits.

228
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:30,555
Is this more about
starting a casino?

229
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:32,474
It's about correcting
an injustice.

230
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,768
I can't be getting involved
in inner-tribal conflicts.

231
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:37,687
Yes, you can.
If you want that appropriation.

232
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:42,650
Two months. Maybe less
if all the ancestry holds up.

233
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,778
Lanagin knows.

234
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:46,154
And what did he say?

235
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:49,991
He wants to meet.
But on his turf this time.

236
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:53,453
I need a way to get to Missouri
without attracting any attention.

237
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:56,706
Womack's district is in Kansas City.
It's not far from the casino.

238
00:16:56,706 --> 00:17:00,043
See if he has any events
coming up: rallies fund-raisers...

239
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:07,342
How's it coming with
cosponsors for Claire's bill?

240
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:10,178
Terrific, we're making
great progress.

241
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,438
One speech, it'll send a message to
Congress...

242
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:22,482
And a message to
the joint chiefs that I'm trampling on...

243
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:25,527
Twenty-four thousand assaults
last year, only 3,000 reported because...

244
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,570
- I know the figures.
- Do you know how many suicides

245
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,365
- result from the trauma...
- It's not the question of statistics...

246
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,534
- This bill will save lives.
- Can we discuss this later?

247
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:35,328
- I had to schedule this meeting, Garrett.
- It's the middle of the day.

248
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:39,082
- You know very well...
- Don't make me lobby you when I go home...

249
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:42,001
I'm sorry to interrupt Mr. President.
The secretary general's here.

250
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,503
I got two more minutes.

251
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:46,089
It's 12:30, he was schedule
for 12:15.

252
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:47,674
I'll go.

253
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:53,596
You were supposed to
tell me to stay.

254
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:56,224
But it's nice to know
I'm worth at least two minutes.

255
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,193
Hi, Tricia.

256
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:09,571
No, please,
don't worry about it.

257
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,661
Oh, that's awful.

258
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:21,332
Yes, of course, let me
grab his number for you.

259
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,252
Mm-hm.

260
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:29,799
Right.

261
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:36,222
His name is Dr. Thomas Larkin.

262
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:41,769
At 202-251-6258

263
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:44,188
And if you'd like, I can
give him a call before hand

264
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,316
and let him know
you'll be reaching out.

265
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,779
OK, you let me know
if I can be of any help.

266
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:55,033
Good night, Tricia.

267
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:58,494
What do you think?

268
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,371
We'll see.

269
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:07,253
The idea is to take color theory
and turn it on its head.

270
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,339
Break all the rules.

271
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,259
They're gorgeous.

272
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,553
Who'd you say your client is?

273
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,055
I didn't.

274
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,015
I was just wondering
if maybe I knew them.

275
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:20,808
You don't.

276
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,895
Let's say he's a collector
always on the lookout for new talent.

277
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:28,858
I understand you work
for Adam Galloway.

278
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:32,653
Yeah... it's a way
to pay the bills.

279
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:36,074
I mean, Adam's a good photographer
if you like that kind of thing.

280
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,826
I'm much more
interested in form.

281
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:43,122
- How much for all of them?
- What?

282
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:47,835
I'd like to buy them all.

283
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:50,797
<i>Missouri is the</i>
<i>"Show Me State" for a reason.</i>

284
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:55,802
<i>We need to show the rest of America
that we can keep our leadership intact.</i>

285
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:59,555
It is a pleasure to look out
and see a room full of smiling faces.

286
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,517
That's not something you see
everyday in Washington DC.

287
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:05,144
- What did your editor say?
<i>- Five thousand words.</i>

288
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,354
This should be twice that.

289
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,647
I could probably
get them to eight,

290
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:09,524
but I'm gonna need
the First Lady too.

291
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:10,650
Separate interviews.

292
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,735
Let me talk to Mrs. Underwood.

293
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,654
<i>How come you're coming to me</i>
<i>with this instead of Connor?</i>

294
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:17,657
Between you and me, he's out.
He got a job at SpaceX.

295
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:19,742
<i>His choice or was he pushed out?</i>

296
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:22,453
People don't like working with me, Matt.
You may be the only one.

297
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:25,206
I don't like you either. I might
if you give me the First Lady.

298
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,999
They'll both be speaking
to armed services tomorrow.

299
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,292
<i>Along with Megan Hennessy.</i>

300
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,919
<i>She's</i> the one the general...

301
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,087
That's right.
I'll set up a one-on-one,

302
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:32,630
text you for your piece.

303
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,923
All right, let me know, man.

304
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:35,424
Anything for the<i> Times,</i> man.

305
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:37,301
Anything for the<i> Times,</i> huh?

306
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:39,887
Then we get shut out
of donor meetings.

307
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:41,848
The magazine. And yes.

308
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:44,851
Raymond Tusk. Your boss
went to see him last October.

309
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:47,353
It's in his congressional
travel report.

310
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:49,689
- Before my time.
- You said they didn't communicate.

311
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:51,649
- I said, "not to my knowledge."
- We're in Missouri.

312
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:54,527
- He's not one of the donors.
- I can quote you on that?

313
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,779
If you spell my name right.

314
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,783
Now, normally, I don't quote
Northern writers, but every now and then

315
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,827
one of them says something
that makes a lot of sense,

316
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:06,330
and this Emerson fellow
you probably heard of,

317
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,002
once wrote that the only way
to have a friend is to be one.

318
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:15,381
I think you all know what kind of
a friend Terry has been to this district.

319
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:19,093
So I am proud to introduce him
today and to call him my friend.

320
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:23,472
Would you please welcome, the majority
leader, Representative Terry Womack.

321
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:25,308
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

322
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:32,982
We all set?

323
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:37,111
I told the press you were having some
private meetings with contributors.

324
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:41,782
- Any protests?
- We're good except for Ayala Sayyad.

325
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,785
Thank you. What's going on?

326
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:47,830
- Potential blind spot.
- Tell me on the way to the car.

327
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:21,947
Mr. Vice President.

328
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:23,240
Thank you.

329
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:33,209
Calm down. Now.

330
00:22:34,543 --> 00:22:36,962
Welcome.

331
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:41,133
- What a pleasant surprise, Raymond.
- Mr. Vice President.

332
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,303
I was expecting to see you
privately today, Daniel.

333
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:48,057
When it's a serious matter
I invite all the chiefs to the circle.

334
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:52,812
Nice pool.

335
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:56,065
I've never swum in
it. The chlorine hurts my eyes.

336
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:59,068
You're welcome to take
a dip in it if you'd like.

337
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:01,654
Another time.

338
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:04,240
Raymond tells me
you're a ribs man.

339
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,659
I've got three of the
choicest pieces of meat

340
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,830
you'll ever see in your life coming out.
You do not want to pass on this.

341
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,873
I won't be here long.

342
00:23:12,873 --> 00:23:16,168
So the Ugaya band.

343
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:19,630
Tip of the iceberg.

344
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,716
- They're not a real tribe.
- They're about to be.

345
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:27,304
No, they're a bunch of troublemakers
with too much hope on their hands.

346
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:30,808
Once they get recognized,
they're gonna have their own casino.

347
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,351
In two years... at best?

348
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:34,770
You better enjoy this pool
while you can.

349
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,815
I don't think your casino
can stand that sort of competition.

350
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:44,530
Who do you think Whitehall
called as soon as he left the BIA?

351
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,243
You offer them a casino two years from
now, we offered what they really want.

352
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:53,038
Reenrollment in my tribe.

353
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,166
A tip of your iceberg
is melting, Frank.

354
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:01,463
And you do not have time
on your side so how about this...?

355
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:05,301
You help me repair
my relationship with Garrett,

356
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:09,597
Dan and I here get the money
flowing back in the right direction.

357
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:14,727
How about this...?

358
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:17,771
I get the BIA to investigate
both of you.

359
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:20,024
Connection to Feng, laundering...

360
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:22,484
You could, but you won't.

361
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:24,236
You don't dare.

362
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:27,156
My money has been going
to the Democrats for nine years.

363
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:29,366
You were the whip
for all of them.

364
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,035
You implicate us,
you implicate yourself.

365
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:34,288
And everyone in the leadership.

366
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:36,707
- Ah, here comes the steak.
- Oh...

367
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:40,127
Now you are going to enjoy this,
Frank. There you go.

368
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,212
Thank you.

369
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:45,257
Now dig in, Frank.
Before the flies get to it.

370
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:47,718
- I'll pass, thanks.
- Are you sure?

371
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:51,055
This is soy-fed Matsusaka beef.

372
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:55,392
You know, my ancestors would've
prayed to this heifer to honor her spirit.

373
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:59,938
But at 200 bucks a pound,
I figure... fuck tradition.

374
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:02,274
Come on, live a little, Frank.

375
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,986
Mr. Vice President.

376
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:08,572
Not my vice president.

377
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:11,033
You're on sovereign land.

378
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:26,173
Dogs are so predictable,
aren't they?

379
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,765
Set up a meeting with Walker. Tonight,
if possible. I should be back by six.

380
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,975
- <i> Lanagin didn't budge?</i>
- He reenrolled the Ugaya.

381
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:39,853
<i>- We have to get the bridge approved now.</i>
<i>- </i> I'll call Linda.

382
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:42,523
<i>Bypass her, I don't</i>
<i>want her in the meeting.</i>

383
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:45,067
- I'm on it.
- Thanks.

384
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:49,613
Meechum, get in touch with the plane
have them make ribs for the flight back.

385
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:50,697
Yes sir.

386
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:23,290
Mr. Vice President,
do you have a moment?

387
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,791
I'm sorry, the president
asked to see me.

388
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,878
No he didn't, you requested the meeting
and I took it off the schedule.

389
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,505
- You did what?
- Let's go in your office.

390
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:36,094
You lied, Frank. You said
you would let the bridge go

391
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:38,430
and then you went behind my back
just like you're trying to do now.

392
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,141
- I do not require your permission!
- No, but you should involve me.

393
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:44,269
The president and the vice president
have issues they must discuss privately.

394
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:47,230
When you are secretive it prevents
me from being able to do my job.

395
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,525
And when you cancel meetings it
prevents me from being able to do mine.

396
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:52,653
Which is why I wanted to talk
so we can work things out.

397
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:54,488
- I will not waste my time...
- We should be working together...

398
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:55,989
...inflating your sense
of self-importance!

399
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:58,784
- Excuse me?
- How many elections have you won?!

400
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:01,286
How many congressional
committees have you chaired?!

401
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:02,913
Would you even be working
in the White House

402
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:04,873
if I hadn't recommended you
during the campaign?

403
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:08,335
I returned that favor and then
some. Look where your desk is now!

404
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:09,753
And I'd say we're even.

405
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:11,713
And if you want
to maintain my respect,

406
00:28:11,713 --> 00:28:13,298
you're going about it all wrong.

407
00:28:13,298 --> 00:28:14,883
I asked you in here
to work out a situation...

408
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:16,385
You didn't ask, you demanded!

409
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:17,803
I will not be left out
of the loop,

410
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm the president's
chief of staff.

411
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,059
You call this being chief of staff?
Micromanaging his date book?

412
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,561
I'd say that's more
of a glorified scheduler.

413
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:29,314
The White House would fall off
its rails without me doing my job.

414
00:28:29,314 --> 00:28:31,274
- Are you certain about that?
- Yes, I am.

415
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:33,735
I look out
for the president 24/7.

416
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:36,530
I keep him informed.
I keep his priorities straight.

417
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,782
We did just fine before you
became vice president, Frank.

418
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:40,867
All right, let's go over
to the Oval Office right now

419
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:44,121
and ask the president to choose:
his chief of staff or his vice president.

420
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:46,748
I know what the answer would be.
You wanna go?

421
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,710
I didn't think so.

422
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,589
Now I will see the president
tomorrow morning, schedule or no.

423
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:59,803
And please, turn out the lights
before you leave.

424
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,893
I thought you went home.

425
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:10,772
No, not yet.
Um, do you have a moment?

426
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:12,482
Is there something wrong?

427
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:15,527
I know you are reconsidering
the bridge project and I want...

428
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:17,446
I'm reviewing it.
I'll make my decision soon.

429
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:19,531
But you already
made a decision, sir.

430
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:22,033
I'm concerned that you
are overthinking this one.

431
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:24,244
- If we backtrack...
- Did I not make myself clear?

432
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:26,621
I'm just trying to offer
my advice, sir.

433
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:31,293
Which I've heard. And which I don't
need to hear again but... thank you.

434
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:34,629
I know the vice president spoke
to you yesterday and in fairness...

435
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:36,840
You know I value your input,
Linda,

436
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,384
but when I say I've heard it,
you need to know I mean that.

437
00:29:39,384 --> 00:29:40,886
Of course, sir.

438
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:44,097
- Is there anything else?
- No, sir.

439
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:46,474
- Good night.
- Good night.

440
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,737
You disappointed me.

441
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:00,822
I told you it would take time.

442
00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:02,157
Any leads?

443
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:04,451
I've been going over
his state senate days,

444
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:06,036
it's a slow process.

445
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,454
I have to be thorough.

446
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:09,289
So how is it that
I've found more in two days

447
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:10,874
than you have in two months?

448
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:14,628
- What do you mean?
- I've had to do your job for you.

449
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:16,129
You found something?

450
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:18,673
I'm the one who's supposed
to ask that question.

451
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:21,218
What'd you find?
Maybe I can help.

452
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:25,263
Are you working for Frank?

453
00:30:25,263 --> 00:30:30,518
- Yeah, as his communications director.
- No, are you working for him?

454
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:32,187
Come on.

455
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:34,189
He couldn't pay me a fraction
of what you're offering.

456
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:37,651
- Don't lie to me. - Look, if you've lost
confidence in my ability...

457
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:38,818
Stop fucking around.

458
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:45,659
You made the wrong choice, Seth.

459
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:48,411
I don't think so.

460
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:53,500
You're nothing.
You're a parasite.

461
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,920
So are you Danton.
Just in a nicer suit.

462
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:05,428
Do you know what it might be?

463
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,517
Well, keep your ear
to the ground.

464
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:15,605
That was Seth.

465
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:23,154
He thinks Remy may have
something on us.

466
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:30,245
- What?
- He doesn't know.

467
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:33,790
- Do you think it could be...
- No.

468
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:38,586
If it's anything I'm sure it's innocuous.
Nothing we can't weather.

469
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:42,674
But my bet is they're bluffing.
Just to make us paranoid.

470
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:49,431
But he's a dangerous man,
isn't he? Raymond?

471
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,435
We can be dangerous too.

472
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:55,019
When we need to be.

473
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:42,066
Don't stop.

474
00:32:45,737 --> 00:32:47,739
I used to be a call girl.

475
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:55,371
I had to get away from it
and that's why I came here.

476
00:33:01,503 --> 00:33:03,671
It's a lot of stuff
you don't know about me.

477
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:06,174
You don't have to
say anything you don't want to.

478
00:33:12,263 --> 00:33:14,974
When you tapped on
my shoulder on the bus,

479
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:17,393
there was something...

480
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:26,486
Your eyes.

481
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:29,280
- That sounds really, really dumb.
- No.

482
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:33,409
Um...

483
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:37,330
I don't know, I felt like...
I wanted to tell you everything.

484
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:39,958
Like...

485
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:43,419
...that I could trust you
even though I didn't know you.

486
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:44,587
You can.

487
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,052
I never trusted anyone.

488
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:54,555
Have you ever loved anyone?

489
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,062
No.

490
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:08,861
I've never expected
much from the world. It's ugly.

491
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:10,822
It's not a fair place.

492
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:14,867
I'm happy to have what I have.

493
00:34:17,578 --> 00:34:19,664
I'm glad I have this.

494
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:53,990
I've thought it all out.

495
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,577
And there's a way to do it
so we don't risk any exposure.

496
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:01,122
Do we have to talk
about this now?

497
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:04,375
I'm beat.

498
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,210
My brain is f...

499
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:09,797
Yes, we do.

500
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:13,801
Because it's our marriage.

501
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:18,139
If we're going to survive
the next two years... or six.

502
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:21,392
We need to do something.

503
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:24,395
We should be each others'
support system.

504
00:35:24,395 --> 00:35:28,107
Not cause each other stress.

505
00:35:28,107 --> 00:35:31,527
The foundation of this White
House is not brick and mortar.

506
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:33,571
It's us, Garrett.

507
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,786
This is important to me.

508
00:35:40,786 --> 00:35:43,206
And I want it
to be important to you.

509
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,672
I have to trust
that whatever you're managing,

510
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:55,593
to whatever extent you choose
not to inform me, that I'm neither at risk,

511
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:58,387
nor passively condoning
something blatantly illegal.

512
00:35:58,387 --> 00:36:00,264
Any risk solely falls on me,

513
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:03,309
and you can't be accused of condoning
what you're not aware of.

514
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:05,478
Being not aware,
is just as egregious.

515
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:09,273
Not in this case. I'm steering the
ship away from the rocks, not toward them.

516
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:11,359
Then I'll call the committee
for foreign investments.

517
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,486
You're making
the right decision, sir.

518
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:17,406
I have another difficult
decision to make.

519
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:22,286
Linda submitted her resignation.

520
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:26,958
I was furious with her. That was
a very manipulative move.

521
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:29,418
I can speculate
as to why she made it.

522
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:32,088
Are her complaints valid?

523
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:34,882
I have a very biased view
on that subject.

524
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:37,635
Well, I've heard hers.
Give me yours.

525
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:41,222
Linda and I don't always agree.

526
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:44,976
But she's been very loyal to you,
and a more than competent chief of staff.

527
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:46,852
So you think I should keep her?

528
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:52,066
Do I think she oversteps
sometimes? Yes.

529
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:55,319
Does she wrongly equate
her advice with mine? Often.

530
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:59,490
But... the question that occurs
to me is not about Linda.

531
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,287
Let's say you refuse her resignation,
if this gets out, and it could,

532
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:08,916
won't you be sending a signal
to anybody who works for you that...

533
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:12,378
...you can be leveraged.

534
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:16,924
She offered her resignation.
She's already gone even if she stays.

535
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:32,523
Megan. They're ready.

536
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:35,317
I don't know,
my hands are shaking.

537
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:37,945
You can do this, Megan.
I'll be there.

538
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:40,740
I get panic attacks sometimes.

539
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,867
- You're afraid you'll get one?
- Yeah.

540
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:46,287
OK, why don't we ask for a couple
more minutes, that's not a problem.

541
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:48,664
It's not about that,
they just come.

542
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:50,791
I can't control them.

543
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:54,920
I don't want to do this.

544
00:37:57,423 --> 00:38:01,844
OK, Megan, there's some of the most
senior congressmen and women in the room,

545
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,971
and they press, they've shown up
just to hear from you.

546
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:06,640
- I know.
- OK, I don't want to pressure you,

547
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,894
but a lot of planning
has gone into this.

548
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,938
Please don't make me do this.

549
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,776
We're not making you
do anything.

550
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:18,944
Then can I just go back home?
Back to Chicago?

551
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:20,696
Listen, you have nerves,
that's understandable.

552
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:22,323
I don't wanna fucking do it, OK?

553
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:24,325
I understand, it's OK. But
if you back out now, Megan...

554
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:26,243
- This isn't about me at all, is it?
- ...this is not good for us.

555
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:28,412
It hurts us, it makes us
look unorganized.

556
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:29,830
This is about your
fucking moment to shine.

557
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,415
You don't care if do...

558
00:38:31,415 --> 00:38:34,460
I do care. I do care.

559
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:37,546
It is about me and about you!

560
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:45,095
And for whatever reason, we both
decided to share what happened to us.

561
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:46,764
And it mattered
and people listened

562
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:48,474
so let's go in
and finish what we started.

563
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:50,309
- I can't, I'm not the right person.
- Come on, Megan.

564
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:52,978
You know what I did last night?
I picked up some guy at a bar.

565
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:56,524
A total stranger. I let him
fuck my brains out at the hotel.

566
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:58,150
Night before, same thing.

567
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,152
I can't stop.
It's my only way to fucking...

568
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:03,072
Jesus, I fucking hate this when
my hands shake like this and I...

569
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:12,081
It's OK.
It's OK.

570
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:13,749
I'm not who you want
to be your poster girl.

571
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:15,960
It's OK. You don't have to be.
You don't have to be.

572
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,253
I'm sorry I'm letting you down.

573
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,088
It's OK, you're not
letting me down.

574
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:21,048
It's OK. It's OK.

575
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,841
When will it become official?

576
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,677
<i>President will make</i>
<i>his call this afternoon.</i>

577
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:27,930
<i>Official approval will be</i>
<i>announced in the morning.</i>

578
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,974
No revisions to the agreement?

579
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:33,727
<i>None. Everything is</i>
<i>as spelled out in the proposal.</i>

580
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:36,438
Then I will uphold
my end of the bargain.

581
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,107
<i>The money will be cut off.</i>

582
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:41,360
You required proof.
Now we want some.

583
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,113
- <i> What sort?</i>
- Of your commitment.

584
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,031
You kill your
co-venture with Tusk.

585
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,701
<i>- </i> That was never part of the deal.
<i>- It is now.</i>

586
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:51,996
<i>The refinery can't proceed</i>
<i>while we're in a trade wall.</i>

587
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:56,000
We want you to kill it for good.
And we want you to kill it today.

588
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,876
Make the call to Tusk.

589
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:14,977
<i>It's business hours,</i>
<i>is this a business call?</i>

590
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:16,562
No...

591
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:18,647
<i>I was hoping it wasn't.</i>

592
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:21,483
- What are you doing tonight?
- Just about to get on a plane.

593
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:22,985
<i>Where to?</i>

594
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:25,112
Boundaries, remember?

595
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:27,865
- Work related.
- <i> I don't take vacation.</i>

596
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,535
Can you tell me
when you'll be back?

597
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:33,996
Tomorrow. It's a quick trip.

598
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,581
<i>Do you want to have dinner?</i>

599
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,083
I'd like that.

600
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:42,755
Bring your carry-on.
You can stay over after.

601
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:53,932
- Yes.
- Do you have a moment?

602
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:55,684
Absolutely.

603
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:58,896
The president accepted
my resignation an hour ago.

604
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:00,564
Yes, I know.

605
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:02,399
I almost told him
that I changed my mind,

606
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,151
but I realized
it wouldn't make any difference.

607
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:06,570
For whatever it's worth,
I did bring up your loyalty

608
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,782
and how good you are at your job.
Not that he needed me to remind him.

609
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:12,576
And I will always be grateful
you recommended me.

610
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,369
It has been quite a ride.

611
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:16,622
Shorter than I would've hoped,
but I have a long career ahead.

612
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:19,249
- No doubt.
- And just so you know,

613
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:21,543
I don't plan on making
any fuss in the press.

614
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:24,755
You'll hear nothing but
my praises if I'm asked.

615
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:27,716
I have something for you.
A few weeks ago,

616
00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:30,552
the president told me about
a dinner he had at your house.

617
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:33,180
He went on and on
about your Civil War models.

618
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,766
How much fun he had painting
the toy soldiers with you.

619
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:39,269
This was given to me by the
director of the Smithsonian.

620
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,856
It's the first Medal of Honor
awarded to a Hispanic-American:

621
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:46,318
Corporal Joseph de Castro,
he fought for the Union.

622
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:51,698
Linda, I don't know what to say.

623
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:55,452
It's clear the president sees you
as a friend, I've never been that to him,

624
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:58,705
but his job is bigger
than friendship.

625
00:41:58,705 --> 00:42:00,958
It's bigger than you and me.

626
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,586
I just hope you'll look out for
him the way I've tried to do.

627
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:07,756
I will. And I'll treasure this.

628
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:12,010
Goodbye, Mr. Vice President.

629
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:22,521
I've never thought higher of her
than I do at this moment.

630
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:28,527
She lost...
but she played to win.

631
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:33,031
Underwood got the phone.
The refinery's dead. Grayson played us.

632
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:34,866
We're running out of options.

633
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:38,912
What do you think Jean?

634
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:42,082
Fuck him!

635
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:45,085
Do it.

636
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:07,733
Thank you.

637
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:24,458
Thank you for doing this Sandra.

638
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:28,462
Richard.

639
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,259
How are you, Richard?

640
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:37,721
He has his good days
and his bad.

641
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:39,473
This is a good day.

642
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:41,725
He'd love to spend a few minutes
with you after your meeting.

643
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:42,809
Of course.

644
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:44,519
The reverend's in here.

645
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:49,733
- Mrs. Walker.
- Hello.

646
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:52,361
- Mr. President.
- Reverend.

647
00:43:59,076 --> 00:44:01,286
How can I help?

648
00:44:01,286 --> 00:44:03,872
You need to get
a fan in here, Francis.

649
00:44:03,872 --> 00:44:06,249
Well, the AC is all the way
up to full blast.

650
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:08,668
I mean from the fumes, the glue.

651
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:11,254
Oh, that's half the fun.

652
00:44:16,176 --> 00:44:19,054
Megan Hennessy
bailed on us today.

653
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,431
Why?

654
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:23,350
Her nerves got to her.

655
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,145
And she decided she didn't
want to be in the public eye.

656
00:44:27,145 --> 00:44:30,440
- Well, we can
sympathize with that.

657
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,651
That was Doug.

658
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:34,236
Yes.

659
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,491
Seth.

660
00:44:39,491 --> 00:44:40,826
I'll call you back.

661
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:42,035
When?

662
00:44:54,089 --> 00:47:12,769
