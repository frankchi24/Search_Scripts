1
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:16,178
<i>...a longstanding source...</i>

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,720
<i>Underwood will
speak before the committee</i>

3
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:19,430
<i>today regarding
the allegations...</i>

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,181
<i>While little is being released</i>

5
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,556
<i>to the public, the
vice president's statement...</i>

6
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:25,100
The vice president just entered
the Department of Justice.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,518
We're here with Ayla Sayyad,

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,269
<i>whose
Wall Street Telegraph article</i>

9
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,603
catalyzed the investigation.
Ayla.

10
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:33,647
The issue at stake is whether the
White House was in any way involved.

11
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,815
Was foreign money traded
for political favors?

12
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:38,066
Did it influence
diplomatic relations?

13
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:41,068
Just the act of laundering
Chinese contributions is illegal.

14
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:45,028
If it had a significant impact on
White House policy, that's
a far more serious crime.

15
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:48,697
You've met with Daniel Lanagin
on multiple occasions.

16
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:53,408
We were in the same room, yes,
on 11 occasions since 2003.

17
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:56,743
But we only spoke
on three of those occasions.

18
00:00:56,743 --> 00:01:00,620
- Those instances are highlighted.
- What did you discuss?

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,999
These were fund-raisers.
I speak to dozens of people.

20
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:08,000
Usually about nothing at all.
I'm Southern, Ms. Dunbar.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,460
My mother taught me that conversation
during mealtime is not only polite,

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,712
it aids the digestive process.

23
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:17,297
So you didn't speak to him about
the Adohi Tribe's contributions

24
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,673
- to any of these super PACS?
- Absolutely not.

25
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:24,010
I never discuss super PACs with
any supporters. We both know the law.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,469
During one of these
polite conversations,

27
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,929
do you recall Mr. Lanagin
ever mentioning Xander Feng?

28
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:32,723
- I do not. - Does that name
mean anything to you?

29
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:34,682
Other than being plastered
all over the news?

30
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:37,601
In that regard, it means
as much as Kim Kardashian.

31
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:43,937
Then let me be more specific.
What knowledge do you have

32
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,481
of Mr. Feng's political
activities?

33
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:53,526
- Is this coming from
your husband, or is it...? - From me.

34
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,944
And it's not that I don't
support the bill anymore.

35
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,029
It's just the article.

36
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,281
We've promised
Matt an interview.

37
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:03,949
Maybe in a few weeks, once
the investigation has died down.

38
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:06,242
<i>The New York Times
isn't going to wait for us.</i>

39
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,785
They've already scheduled the cover
for October, based on our timing...

40
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:12,329
Then I can't be a part of it.

41
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:15,122
- It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?
- Claire, come on.

42
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:19,958
It's OK. You can say so.
We're friends.

43
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,084
- It doesn't help.
- You don't actually believe...

44
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:23,836
No.

45
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:26,630
But enough of the
country still does.

46
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,757
And Garrett needs every bit
of support he can get right now.

47
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,259
So there's no convincing you?

48
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:39,929
I'll help you as much
as I can, quietly.

49
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:45,766
<i>There are rumors that you and Mr.
Feng served as back channels</i>

50
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,226
- to the trade summit last May.
- Exactly. Rumors.

51
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:51,810
We have Feng
in the US during the summit.

52
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,021
If he was back-channeling,
and even if I were aware,

53
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,439
any form of diplomatic
communication is usually classified.

54
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,690
Have you ever discussed Feng
with the president?

55
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,275
Any major player in Beijing
is worthy of discussion.

56
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:05,193
- So that's a yes.
- It's a general comment.

57
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:07,361
Did you discuss him
during the energy crisis?

58
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,655
I assume you're alluding
to his refinery co-venture...

59
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,614
- Yes, with Raymond Tusk. - The refinery
was never part of our conversation.

60
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:16,950
We needed an immediate solution.
A refinery would've solved
nothing in the short term.

61
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,118
And it's my understanding
that deal fell through.

62
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:20,994
Correct. But Tusk
did receive a subsidy.

63
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:23,538
As did every other
nuclear energy provider.

64
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,206
But his connection with Feng,
then a subsidy on samarium...

65
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,582
Nobody made any profits off these
subsidies. At best they're breaking even.

66
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,875
In fact, Raymond
fought us on the issue.

67
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:36,545
Then let's back up to
the Port Jefferson Bridge.

68
00:03:39,129 --> 00:05:16,061
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

69
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,271
I don't blame her.
It's a valid concern.

70
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,981
Tell him I won't engage on Galloway,
so there's no point in asking.

71
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:25,358
This is Matt Bai, we can't dictate
what he'll ask. And he will ask.

72
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,401
Then I'll just say I won't
answer tabloid questions.

73
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,903
It's a legitimate question,
how the scandal could affect the vote.

74
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:34,947
Look, I say you pull out too.
We scrap the whole piece.

75
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:38,532
Jackie's fighting us.
The leadership is noncommittal.

76
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:40,909
We need this article
to refocus attention.

77
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,495
But it'll hurt you, both your
personal image and the bill.

78
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:48,789
But if we cut the cord, we schedule
two interviews then we cancel,

79
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,791
won't Matt be furious?
The story will be about pulling out.

80
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,625
We're talking about
the lesser of two evils.

81
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,542
I don't want you to become
the target, to undo all...

82
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,335
Then what if it's not me at all?

83
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:00,754
- You said the First Lady wasn't...
- Not her. Someone else.

84
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:04,422
Was the bridge a trade-off
to prevent additional GOP funding?

85
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:07,925
As far as I know, the bridge
was a delivery on a promise

86
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:11,344
the president had made to the
voters. Are we finished here?

87
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:13,386
Almost.

88
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,263
How many members of Congress have you
interviewed, Ms. Dunbar? About 200?

89
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:19,056
- One hundred ninety-four.
- I want to be of help,

90
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:22,141
but I doubt I can offer any more
than the 194 that preceded me.

91
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:26,227
- I have gotten some useful testimony.
- From who?

92
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:28,561
- A high-ranking House member.
- In the leadership?

93
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,813
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- Bob Birch? Jackie Sharp?

94
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:34,690
This individual says he attended
a meeting, July 14th, in the Oval Office.

95
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,942
She said "he."
So it must have been Birch.

96
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,276
I'm sure Raymond had no trouble
buying him off.

97
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:41,611
You attended that meeting also.

98
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,656
- It appears so. - You recall the
subject of that meeting?

99
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:50,533
A wave of conservative attack
ads. We were being outspent.

100
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,617
It must have been quite
a shock when Lanagin's tribe

101
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,618
shifted contributions
to the other party,

102
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:57,245
when they hadn't given a single
dime to the Republicans before that.

103
00:06:57,245 --> 00:07:00,163
It would've been a shock, but we didn't
know where the money was coming from.

104
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,914
- According to my source...
- Bob Birch.

105
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:05,500
My source says the estimate
was 25 million.

106
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,293
You said, and I quote:
"With this kind of influx,

107
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:12,212
you can be sure somebody
isn't playing by the rules."

108
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:15,423
Sounds like something I might say.
Bob has a better memory than me.

109
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:18,508
The money stopped just after the
Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.

110
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:21,175
Is there a theory here, or are you just
grasping at straws?

111
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,553
The bridge leads to Feng.
Feng gives me Lanagin and Tusk.

112
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:29,222
- Tusk and the President...
- Ms. Dunbar, you want to play
six degrees of separation,

113
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:31,181
you could throw in Jimmy Hoffa
and the pope.

114
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:34,642
How about one degree
of separation.

115
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:36,685
Douglas Stamper,
your chief of staff.

116
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,937
This is him at Lanagin's casino,
July 14th.

117
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:43,480
I used these to get a warrant
for flight records.

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,899
The next day, Mr. Stamper
was on a flight to Beijing.

119
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:52,277
Why was he at the casino?
And why was he in Beijing?

120
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:56,029
- I would like to speak to my client.
- Please.

121
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,449
I work hard.

122
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,868
I keep things simple.
I know what my priorities are.

123
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:11,580
But there's this... this person.

124
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,791
She's not even in my life, except on
the edges making things blurrier.

125
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,919
It doesn't tempt me to drink.
It's more like she...

126
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,130
More like she feels what it was
like when I was drinking.

127
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,882
When I couldn't get enough.

128
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:32,634
No matter how many drinks I had,
I wanted another.

129
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,887
I don't want to be with her.

130
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:42,182
I mean, I do.

131
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:44,224
But...

132
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:49,894
...it's more like
she's my daughter.

133
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:53,813
Or my mother.
I don't know, this is fucked up.

134
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,898
Take your time.

135
00:08:55,898 --> 00:09:01,276
I should cut her off,
the way I did with booze.

136
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,863
That's all. I'm done.

137
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,281
- Thanks for sharing.
- Thanks for sharing.

138
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,407
We'll need time before
responding to your questions.

139
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:14,909
- I can wait as long as necessary.
- It could take a while.

140
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,743
There are national security
matters at stake.

141
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:18,494
The vice president needs to
consult with his advisors.

142
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:20,371
National security?
Are you really going

143
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:21,954
- to play that card, Oliver?
- His answers could entail

144
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:23,538
classified material.

145
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:26,457
- When can we expect a response?
- I'll let you know.

146
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:29,000
- May we hold onto the screen cap?
- Be my guest.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,418
- We'll be in touch soon, Ms. Dunbar.
- Mr. Vice President.

148
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,544
If you think you're insulated, don't.

149
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,004
Our investigation is much
bigger than Douglas Stamper.

150
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:39,798
- That's enough, Ms. Dunbar. - Thank you
for your time, Mr. Vice President.

151
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:42,132
Happy to cooperate.

152
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:51,263
From the lion's den
to a pack of wolves.

153
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:55,891
When you're fresh meat, kill
and throw them something fresher.

154
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,937
Hey, I'm Fitz.

155
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,063
Doug.

156
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,483
You know, you can isolate,
white-knuckle this shit if you want.

157
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:14,402
Or you can ask for help.
You got a sponsor?

158
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:19,071
No, it's been 14 years.
I'm good.

159
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,948
Number's on the back
if you change your mind.

160
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,662
I thought you had a driver.

161
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:38,082
I do, but I didn't want him
overhearing anything.

162
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:42,459
- You shouldn't even be near this state.
- I'm not really here.

163
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,877
Long layover on my way
to California.

164
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:49,255
I've got auditors, federal agents,
in my office going through every file,

165
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:52,007
every document, they're going
through my goddamn trash.

166
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,133
Just stick to the Fifth
if she subpoenas you.

167
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,552
How did they know to look for Stamper?
To search the tapes on that exact day?

168
00:10:57,552 --> 00:11:01,637
- Don't jump to conclusions.
- You're throwing me under the bus.

169
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,722
Underwood's the roadkill,
not you.

170
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,390
They're going to fuck me.

171
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,433
They'll find a way.
You know that.

172
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,143
And if that's the case, you and
your family will be taken care of.

173
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:15,229
They're already
offering me a plea.

174
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,522
You haven't even
been charged yet.

175
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:22,025
- If I cooperate. - You'll do less time.
But your family will have nothing.

176
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,817
They'll still have nothing
when you get out.

177
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,027
You testify against Raymond
and he'll still walk,

178
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:31,614
because all they'll have is your word,
and that doesn't count for much right now.

179
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:33,573
You wouldn't be here
if he wasn't afraid.

180
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:38,868
I'm not here because he's afraid.
I'm here because you are.

181
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,328
And I want to make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

182
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:44,454
After repeated
conversations with Beijing,

183
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,538
they remain intractable
in their position.

184
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,832
This morning I gave orders
for a carrier group

185
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,042
to reposition near Okinawa.

186
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,376
This won't put our ships in direct
confrontation with the Chinese vessels,

187
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:56,544
but it will put them within
reach of air strikes.

188
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:59,630
I'll be informing the Chinese
ambassador later today.

189
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,007
We'll release a statement
in coordination with the Pentagon.

190
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:07,301
Sir, our stockpiles of samarium will only
last another two months at most.

191
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,761
- If we go this route...
- I've heard everyone's concerns,

192
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:13,888
and this is the decision
I've made. Any questions?

193
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,472
OK. Thank you.

194
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:16,848
Frank.

195
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:24,186
My deputy briefed me
on the latest.

196
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,982
How did it go?

197
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:35,400
We have a few follow-up
questions we have to address.

198
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,193
- Like what?
- Nothing major.

199
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:39,361
Just odds and ends,
a few details.

200
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:41,737
I was under the impression
this would be short and sweet.

201
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,697
So was I.
But she's very deliberate.

202
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,533
We need this over, Frank, at least as far
as the White House is concerned.

203
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:51,117
We can't be distracted.
Not with warships on the move.

204
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:52,994
I'm confident we're
in the homestretch.

205
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:55,037
You seem more concerned
than you're letting on.

206
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,454
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- You're fidgeting.

207
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:59,039
Oh...

208
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,667
It's my class ring.
I forget I...

209
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:05,210
- I buried it.
- You what?

210
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,336
I... It's a long story.

211
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,964
I've never seen you
this stressed before, Frank.

212
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:14,674
Well, I've never seen you
this tired before, sir.

213
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,008
You've got rings of your own,
dark ones.

214
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:18,717
They're getting worse,
aren't they?

215
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:21,052
You should take more naps
on those sofas in the Oval.

216
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:24,679
Naps don't cut it these days,
Frank. Not even a dent.

217
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,767
Lie after lie.

218
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:35,310
First to a prosecutor,
then to a president.

219
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,020
I feel exposed,

220
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,023
like the skin where
my ring used to be.

221
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:46,608
Even Achilles was only as strong
as his heel.

222
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,697
Where's Doug?
He's not answering his phone.

223
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:57,282
- He went to a meeting, sir.
- In the middle of the day?

224
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:59,032
I think he's on
his way back now.

225
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:01,534
I want him
back as soon as possible.

226
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:13,416
Sir, this arrived for you.
The watch you gave Remy
when he left for Glendon Hill.

227
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,418
I recognized it from
the quote on the back.

228
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:20,670
- Was there a message?
- No, just the watch.

229
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,964
- Let's find Doug.
- Right away, sir.

230
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:31,759
Forgive the plastic.

231
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,720
Luc Tuymans.
He's the real thing.

232
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,346
Well, I'll take your word.

233
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,390
It's not mine. None of it.
California.

234
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,475
You want to sell your house,
your Realtor decorates it.

235
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:47,561
Well, one room at least.

236
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,437
Where are you moving?

237
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:53,814
Oh, I have a little
ranch in Sonoma.

238
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:57,734
My wife's gone,
my kids won't talk to me,

239
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:59,818
but at least I'll
have my painting.

240
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:03,028
- You paint?
- No, and there's no ranch.

241
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:07,572
But the rest of it, the rest of it's true.
Cheers.

242
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:15,452
- I'm here about Jacqueline Sharp.
- Oh.

243
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:18,162
- We're thinking of hiring her.
- A lobbyist?

244
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:21,706
She could lose her re-elect.
Not a great time to be an incumbent.

245
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:23,832
I know you two were close.

246
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:28,501
So you're looking for what?
A recommendation?

247
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:32,503
We have the lowest turnover of any
shop on K Street. There's a reason.

248
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:36,547
What are you looking
for at Glendon Hill?

249
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:40,800
- A killer instinct.
- Well, she certainly has that.

250
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,596
Forgive me if I'm prying, but...

251
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:50,597
...did she have anything
to do with your...

252
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,641
Departure?

253
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,268
Jackie did what she had to do.
I'll never forgive her,

254
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:01,562
but I understand why she did it.

255
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,481
Did what exactly?

256
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:10,943
I paid cash for my ticket.
I was careful.

257
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:12,568
Clearly not enough.

258
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:18,656
Sir, the casino had cameras everywhere.
There was no way to avoid them.

259
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:21,032
But there had to have been
thousands of hours of footage.

260
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:24,867
- How they found that...
- I have to ask you a question, Doug.

261
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,869
And I'm sorry, but I need you
to be honest.

262
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:32,121
- Are you drinking again?
- God no.

263
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,331
- Truly?
- It's not an option.

264
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:36,916
Because it would explain a lot.

265
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,543
You have every right to be
upset. This was my fault.

266
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:43,336
I'm more concerned than I'm upset.
I need you now, Doug, more than ever.

267
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,840
I know.

268
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,257
We're not young men.

269
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:52,050
If we fail, we'll die in a cage.

270
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:58,929
I haven't been myself lately.

271
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,852
That's what you said
to me 14 years ago.

272
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:13,563
When I gave you a second chance,
it paid off. You got clean, Doug.

273
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,981
Nothing means more to me
than this job, sir.

274
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,607
Nothing.

275
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:21,775
Whatever's going on,
I need to know it can be managed.

276
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,485
And if you need my help,
I'm here to help you.

277
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:29,613
I'm good, sir. I can handle myself.
Things will be different.

278
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:40,786
I've never given
someone a third chance...

279
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:49,041
...until this very moment.

280
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,252
And I'm grateful.

281
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:57,671
You won't regret it.
Please believe that, sir.

282
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:03,258
It was Remy who alerted
them to the footage.

283
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:07,886
His going-away gift.
Read the back.

284
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:13,598
- What do you think he's trying to say?
- I don't know.

285
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:16,932
But track him down
and set up a meeting.

286
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:20,602
- What about Dunbar?
- We can't run from the facts.

287
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:24,353
I'll say whatever you want me to say,
I'll take responsibility for all of it.

288
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,148
- She could indict you.
- That's what having a staff is for.

289
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,275
I have a better solution.
We'll both take responsibility.

290
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,277
- How?
- Set up an interview with Dunbar,

291
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:38,403
day after tomorrow. You and I
need time to do our homework.

292
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:40,280
Yes, sir.

293
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,874
- When did this happen?
- Meechum helped me fix it.

294
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:01,876
They're not gonna let me run,
I have to work out some way.

295
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:06,462
- You carried it all the way up here?
- For privacy. I had help.

296
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:09,713
- Meechum.
- That's right.

297
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:13,174
Jack-of-all-trades.

298
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:17,885
- Handyman, furniture mover.
- Human shield.

299
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:27,599
How bad is it?

300
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:33,727
Bad.

301
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:39,397
They have evidence of Doug being
where he shouldn't have been.

302
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,732
What are you going to do?

303
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:49,153
Tell the truth.

304
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:52,030
- You're not actually going...
- Selectively.

305
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,865
Don't worry.
It's a stumble, not a fall.

306
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:57,991
You aren't like this
when it's just a stumble.

307
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:02,285
- Like how?
- You're scared. I can tell.

308
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,416
Five hundred meters at 139.
That was my best.

309
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,959
Shoot for that.

310
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:09,408
- How have you been?
- OK.

311
00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:12,243
- The meds are helping.
- Oh, that's good to hear.

312
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,078
Have a seat.

313
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:19,414
Those people at the end
of the street, it's intense.

314
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:23,499
They're there 24/7.
Twice as many on the weekends.

315
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:26,460
We're so used to it by now.

316
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:33,672
Can I take off my shoes?

317
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:36,799
I thought I should dress up,
but I am not good with heels.

318
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,259
Yes, of course.

319
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,178
My mom said
they went with the dress.

320
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,346
Much better.

321
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:53,476
Look, Megan, I know the last
six months have been difficult.

322
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:56,894
But I need your help.
We just don't have the support

323
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,687
that we expected
in the leadership.

324
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:01,064
Yeah, I figured this wasn't
just about checking up on me.

325
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:04,106
You changed your mind before,
and I understand why.

326
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:08,984
But now it seems as though
things are more stable with you.

327
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:14,029
- Are you willing? - It's hard to say no
when I'm in your house.

328
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:20,450
You hear those people out there.

329
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,951
They're loud, but I think
we need to be louder.

330
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:28,120
And it can't be my voice
because I'm the "baby killer."

331
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,539
The "cheater." It needs to be
your voice. A clear voice.

332
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:35,166
I'm already testifying
at the court-martial.

333
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:39,002
But that's closed to the media.
It's not enough.

334
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:44,546
There are so many people this has
happened to, why does it have to be me?

335
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:49,217
Because you're
the one who called.

336
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:52,802
Are you gonna try to put it out
before McGinnis gets sentenced?

337
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:57,262
- Seth, you have a minute?
- Matt, I have to call you back.

338
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:05,101
Close the door.

339
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:13,064
When the vice president brought you
on board I advised against it.

340
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:15,856
But I can't deny
you've done a good job.

341
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:17,775
I appreciate you saying that.

342
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,818
I'm very protective
of the vice president.

343
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:21,860
I find it hard to share
that duty with anyone else,

344
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,320
which leaves me open to error.
It's one of my faults.

345
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,031
As I told the vice president, I understand
that trust is something I need to earn.

346
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:31,491
- Given how I got the job...
- If the vice president trusts you,

347
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:34,451
then I trust you.
We're a team now.

348
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:37,369
And the truth
is I can't do this alone.

349
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,997
Anything and everything
you ask of me.

350
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:47,208
It might have nothing
to do with the media.

351
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,585
- Press secretary is just a title.
- Good.

352
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:54,462
We have two tasks.
First, find me Remy Danton.

353
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:56,422
- But be discreet.
- I'll track him down.

354
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:58,923
Second, I need you to go through
the vice president's travel logs.

355
00:23:58,923 --> 00:24:01,383
- Everything in the past ten years.
- What are we looking for?

356
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:04,760
Anything that could hurt us.
I'll work forward, you work backward.

357
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,052
I'm on it.

358
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:08,929
And, Doug, thanks.

359
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:58,417
Nancy, I need you
to order me a new phone.

360
00:25:30,393 --> 00:25:33,103
You said "odds and
ends." The "homestretch."

361
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:35,438
I was presented with this
information just hours ago.

362
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,105
We're talking about
impeachable offenses...

363
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:39,066
- Not at all, sir.
- Your chief of staff...

364
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,192
I had a gut feeling
that the casino was involved.

365
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:42,734
I sent Doug to get
to the bottom of it.

366
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,610
You should've
taken this to the DOJ

367
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,195
- the first inkling you...
- That's what I didn't want.

368
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,363
To create some ruckus
if nothing was going on?

369
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,781
You can't go on conducting
your own investigations, Frank.

370
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,823
Fact-finding, due diligence,
whatever you want to call it.

371
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:56,575
If any laws were being broken,
I wanted to know.

372
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:57,868
That's what you want
to tell Dunbar?

373
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:59,077
That I didn't want to disclose

374
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:00,411
our diplomatic protocols.

375
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:02,204
That I was concerned
about the midterms.

376
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:04,830
And I wanted to protect the
president of the United States.

377
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,207
Maybe what I did was wrong,
but I didn't do anything illegal.

378
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:11,000
- You're certain of that?
- I've discussed this with my lawyers.

379
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,002
Dunbar does not strike me as the
sort of person who will put on the brakes,

380
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:15,920
even if we admit all of this.

381
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,215
If fact, it might encourage
her to dig deeper.

382
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:25,634
You're right. Which is why I want
to hand over all of my travel logs.

383
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:28,761
- And I think you should too.
- Volunteer them?

384
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:32,221
- As a gesture of cooperation.
- Haven't we made enough gestures?

385
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:34,722
It will take the
wind out her sails.

386
00:26:34,722 --> 00:26:39,100
No, I don't...
want her poring

387
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,643
over every one
of my comings and goings.

388
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:45,938
He's worried about his marriage
counseling, as he should be.

389
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,855
If you're worried about your
marriage counseling, you shouldn't be.

390
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:50,816
Imagine the fallout,
if the public were to find out...

391
00:26:50,816 --> 00:26:53,441
A needle in a haystack,
and not a needle Dunbar is looking for.

392
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:55,859
She's interviewed half of Congress.
That woman's after blood.

393
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:58,695
But not for gossip. Even if she
does raise an eyebrow,

394
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:01,238
you were visiting a sick friend,
weren't you?

395
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:06,783
- Ostensibly. - Well, she couldn't
possibly find any fault with that.

396
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:13,370
- I'd like Galich in here.
- I'll let you two talk privately.

397
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,581
- When are you seeing Dunbar?
- Tomorrow, so you have some time.

398
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,039
I'll speak to Bill
and get back to you.

399
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,583
He'll advise you against it,
which is his job.

400
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:24,877
But I would just encourage you
to think politics, and not legalese.

401
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,753
Thank you, sir.

402
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,216
Congresswoman.

403
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:37,759
Why should I vote for you?

404
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,177
It's... it's OK. Good night.

405
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,514
You look tired.

406
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:49,892
Long day on the campaign trail?

407
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,642
What are you doing here?

408
00:27:51,642 --> 00:27:54,978
You never told me
about Havemeyer's daughter.

409
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:58,021
Everyone knows that.
The whole world knows.

410
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:01,732
But not that you visited her.
That you leaked it.

411
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:04,859
You came all the way to
California to ask me about that?

412
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,526
I came to California
to find out about that.

413
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:13,238
I offered to buy Havemeyer's house,
but he told me for nothing.

414
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:17,616
You were right. It has been
a long day on the trail.

415
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:20,242
It's still a close race.

416
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:23,494
But not if the voters
knew how you became whip.

417
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,832
Are you honestly threatening me?

418
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:33,167
Set up a meeting with Frank.

419
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:37,628
I don't care what you talk about,
as long as you're alone and
the meeting is on the books.

420
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:38,920
Then you're gonna
sit down with Dunbar.

421
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,588
I've already done my interview.

422
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,422
Tell her Frank grilled
you on your testimony.

423
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:44,882
- Perjure myself?
- Save your seat.

424
00:28:44,882 --> 00:28:47,800
You know what?
Tell everyone.

425
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,928
- Think how that would play out.
- I don't care.

426
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:54,846
You'd really toss yourself
off a cliff for Frank?

427
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:57,805
I have zero allegiance
to Frank Underwood.

428
00:28:57,805 --> 00:29:01,600
I won't be manipulated by him, and I sure
as fuck won't be manipulated by you.

429
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,101
- I'm not bluffing.
- Then I was right.

430
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:07,478
- About what?
- How little I meant.

431
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:12,397
That has nothing
to do with this.

432
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:15,525
It has everything
to do with this.

433
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:19,401
I should feel disgusted,
but I don't.

434
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:22,362
Just supremely disappointed.

435
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:41,248
We got the call ten minutes ago,
direct from the White House counsel.

436
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,624
The president's
turning over everything?

437
00:29:43,624 --> 00:29:46,042
- From the day he took office.
- We're sure this includes

438
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,168
- the visits to his friend?
- It has to.

439
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:51,796
- It was full-security detail.
- Phenomenal.

440
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:54,548
We have something
we can work with.

441
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:56,882
- Now, as for my logs.
- They're clean.

442
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,801
- You bet your life on that?
- I would.

443
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,177
- Me too, sir.
- We've been through them twice,

444
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,262
- backward and forward.
- My statement?

445
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:08,514
- In your inbox.
- I looked it over. Seth did a nice job.

446
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:17,227
We need to go wide with this
the moment the interview's over

447
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:20,104
so we beat Dunbar to the punch in
case she decides to release something.

448
00:30:20,104 --> 00:30:22,480
I'll be at my computer ready to press
send the moment I hear from Doug.

449
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,482
- Have either of you slept?
- We're awake, fully operational.

450
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:27,483
You take a shower
and put on a fresh suit.

451
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:30,110
Yes, sir.
I'll see you over there.

452
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:36,196
You have at least three hours.

453
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:38,948
Take a nap.
You can use my office.

454
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:41,783
General McGinnis was in the courtroom
when you testified.

455
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:46,786
- Yes. - Had you seen him in person,
I mean, since he assaulted you?

456
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:50,204
- No.
- What was that like?

457
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:54,666
- Not fun.
- Not fun how?

458
00:30:56,917 --> 00:31:00,002
It was hard. Really hard.

459
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:03,129
Look, Megan, I agreed to change
the focus of my piece

460
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:06,882
to focus on you, and, you know,
I know this has gotta be hard,

461
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:09,049
but I need you to help me
out a little bit.

462
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:12,551
I'm sorry, I'm not
very good at this. I'm nervous.

463
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:16,137
You seemed fine when you called
into Mrs. Underwood's interview.

464
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:18,597
She was there with me,
on the phone.

465
00:31:18,597 --> 00:31:23,266
Your nerves, I know that's been
an issue since the assault.

466
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:28,227
The defense brought up what they
called emotional and mental instability.

467
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:30,395
That's what always happens.

468
00:31:30,395 --> 00:31:33,022
The person who was attacked
gets attacked all over again.

469
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:36,148
- How did that make you feel?
- It made me angry.

470
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:40,359
The lawyer kept coming after me about
my panic attacks, my antidepressants.

471
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,319
But I just kept
staring at McGinnis.

472
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,155
I wanted him to see I could
take it. That I was strong.

473
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,656
- I wanted to make him look away first.
- And did he?

474
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:55,117
Yes, when I said he did
more than violate my body.

475
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:58,077
He betrayed his country.

476
00:31:58,077 --> 00:32:00,871
He robbed it of a good Marine.

477
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:03,915
Let's talk about the sexual assault
bill in front of Congress now.

478
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:07,958
It's taken some significant opposition,
most notably from another veteran,

479
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,210
Jacqueline Sharp.

480
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,504
If you ask me, she's
betraying our country too.

481
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:19,799
- Ms. Dunbar.
- Mr. Vice President.

482
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,008
Thank you for giving us
a few extra days.

483
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:25,719
I have no problem being patient
as long as it leads to forthright answers.

484
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:28,221
Well, I won't make you
wait a moment longer.

485
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:34,933
Shall we?

486
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,810
Oh, you found it.

487
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,644
Have a seat, we're just
finishing up here.

488
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:43,229
What do you think, Mr. Tusk?
Keep growing it or have it shaved?

489
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:46,773
- I guess I'll keep growing it.
- No problem. Let me clean up the back.

490
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:51,651
No, Mack, if you'd give me
a couple minutes. Appreciate it.

491
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,779
I had this place built down here
about ten years ago.

492
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,614
I got tired of driving all the
way across town every two weeks.

493
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:04,241
- Now it's just an elevator ride.
- Convenient.

494
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:09,661
You know what isn't convenient?
Cramming eight attorneys in my office.

495
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:14,288
It was not designed for
the entire partnership of my law firm.

496
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:16,790
They're worried about Lanagin.

497
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,251
- He's a little shaky, but he'll hold up.
- Underwood?

498
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:22,710
Birch delivered.

499
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,046
- And did Dunbar bring up Stamper?
- The sessions are closed-door,

500
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,048
but I can't imagine she didn't.

501
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:34,801
And what about poor Havemeyer?
Was he any help to us on Jackie Sharp?

502
00:33:39,595 --> 00:33:44,306
I do not take your hesitation
as a promising sign.

503
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:47,516
I never like disappointing you.

504
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:49,726
- He had nothing?
- No.

505
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:51,310
Hm...

506
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,854
Now, do you think that's
because there's nothing there,

507
00:33:53,854 --> 00:33:57,230
- or because he's protecting her?
- There's nothing there.

508
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,523
- I can go to another congressman.
- No, no, no.

509
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:02,650
It has to be somebody
high-profile,

510
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,776
someone in the leadership
who will make waves.

511
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,611
- Let me get back to Birch.
- It's too obvious,

512
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:10,864
now that he's shown
no sympathy for Frank.

513
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:14,866
This can't look orchestrated.
Multiple fronts, Remy.

514
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:18,701
It has to be
Jackie Sharp. Mack?

515
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:21,286
Let's finish up here.
I gotta get back to work.

516
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:23,704
- You got it, boss.
- You need to get back to work too.

517
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:31,125
And what we discussed...
make it happen.

518
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,002
- You denied being a back channel.
- I did not deny.

519
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:36,712
I chose not to confirm
because it was classified.

520
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:40,005
- But your office has consistently...
- I instructed Doug to do so,

521
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:43,591
along with my communications department.
When a back channel becomes public,

522
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:46,426
- it defeats its purpose.
- An orchestrated deception...

523
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:49,469
If we had refused to comment,
it would've suggested it was true,

524
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,179
which would've endangered the
process. I really had no choice.

525
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,263
- Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.
- I know.

526
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:58,183
He's fleeing corruption charges,
not the first time he's been accused.

527
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:02,143
- And your question?
- I know he laundered the money.

528
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:06,063
It's just a matter of time before
I have the proof to substantiate that.

529
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:09,773
So my question, which I am asking again,
is whether you knew?

530
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:13,483
And I'll repeat my answer.
I did not.

531
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:17,778
I did sense that something was awry.
Doug was aware of my concerns.

532
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:21,488
And I took it upon myself to find out.
The vice president didn't know.

533
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:23,906
You had no knowledge he was
going to the casino?

534
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:28,116
None. But that doesn't mean I don't take
responsibility for my staff's behavior.

535
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:30,659
- The buck stops with me.
- And what did you find?

536
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:33,411
Nothing.
No illegal activity.

537
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:36,789
I don't have the same
resources that you do.

538
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:41,208
If you suspected, why didn't you
go immediately to the NIGC, the BIA,

539
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,668
- the Department...
- You have to understand, we're facing

540
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:46,086
very difficult midterms.
I didn't want to bring attention

541
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,712
to a series of allegations that
may have no basis in fact.

542
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:52,881
Now, that may have been misguided
logic, but that's how I chose to act.

543
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:57,425
The mistake is mine and mine alone.
Not Doug's, certainly not the president's.

544
00:35:57,425 --> 00:36:00,135
It shouldn't surprise you
if I say it feels

545
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:02,553
like I am not getting
the full picture.

546
00:36:02,553 --> 00:36:06,430
Which is why I'm prepared
to give you the full picture. Oliver?

547
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,392
The White House believes
in transparency.

548
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:12,267
All of the vice president's
personal travel logs.

549
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:14,936
And the last ten years
since I became whip.

550
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:18,604
As well as the
president's since inauguration.

551
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:24,066
There should be no doubt
as to whom we met with and when.

552
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:28,276
- I am skeptical about what this contains.
- Which is what we anticipated,

553
00:36:28,276 --> 00:36:31,487
and why Oliver will walk you through
anything you might need to know.

554
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:34,822
It's all there, but if you have any
questions or requests,

555
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:37,532
we'll be happy to facilitate.

556
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,661
I mean, at first,
I was really nervous,

557
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,870
but then, as soon as I
started getting into it,

558
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,622
started speaking from my heart,
all these things poured out,

559
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:53,166
everything I wanted to say,
that I've been wanting to say.

560
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,459
Seth told me that Matt
was very impressed.

561
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:57,711
- I want to do more.
- More interviews?

562
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:01,337
Articles, TV, whatever it takes.

563
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:04,423
- I want to help.
- That's great, Megan.

564
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:07,925
Thank you for making me do this.

565
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:13,011
- It was a big step for me.
- You have a plane to catch.

566
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,263
I can stay longer,
if you need me to do another.

567
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,225
Why don't you head
back to Chicago.

568
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:25,518
And as soon as we've put
a plan together, we can give you a buzz.

569
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:28,645
- Can I get a glass of water?
- Tap is fine, or you want bottled?

570
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:32,023
- I can get it.
- We've got Ms. Hennessey's car ready.

571
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:34,732
Edward.

572
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,359
Did she seem all right when
you picked her up from the airport?

573
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,570
- How do you mean?
- I don't know, normal?

574
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,654
Yes, I'd say so.

575
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:46,780
She's very up and down,
very skittish and manic.

576
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,033
I guess she did seem nervous.
We didn't talk much.

577
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:55,494
- I'll get her.
- I'll be outside.

578
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:02,081
Megan?

579
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,543
I've got it.

580
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:12,879
Really, I'm OK.

581
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:21,468
The car's ready,
whenever you are.

582
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:29,139
- Thank you for everything.
- Have a safe flight. I'll be in touch.

583
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:18,417
I just had a very productive
interview with Ms. Dunbar.

584
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:22,586
- Send out the press release.
- Thank you very much.

585
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:38,763
- You OK, ma'am?
- I'm fine. I just dropped...

586
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:41,472
- Please, let me.
- Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.

587
00:39:41,472 --> 00:39:44,349
- I've got it. You're barefoot.
- Edward, you don't have to. Really.

588
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:47,810
- Oh, no, what happened?
- Damn it.

589
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,936
- Let me get some bandages.
- You don't have to.

590
00:39:50,936 --> 00:39:53,813
No, I want to. Stay here.

591
00:39:53,813 --> 00:39:56,773
The coverage has been
mostly positive so far.

592
00:39:56,773 --> 00:40:00,817
- Dunbar's office? - All they've said is
they look forward to reviewing logs.

593
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,819
- Any heat on Doug?
- Some.

594
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:06,237
I'm getting a lot
of requests for comments.

595
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,948
I acted on my own and will fully cooperate
with the Justice Department.

596
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:13,074
- We can put that out?
- Sir?

597
00:40:13,074 --> 00:40:17,660
- It might generate more interest.
- On me, not the vice president.

598
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,161
- I can handle whatever comes my way.
- Put it out.

599
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:24,164
I'll print you out the most
recent clips too, sir.

600
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:33,962
- Should I find a way to tip off Dunbar?
- Let nature take its course.

601
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:36,421
We got ahold of Remy.
He just got back to town.

602
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:39,256
- Where is he? - I've arranged
everything with your detail.

603
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:44,885
- You've done good work, Doug.
- Thank you, sir.

604
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,463
There, that's much better.

605
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:51,548
Thanks, ma'am.

606
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:57,302
I'm gonna get going.

607
00:41:57,302 --> 00:42:03,013
- I'm sorry, I'm a little drunk.
- It's your house. You can
do whatever you want.

608
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:05,973
You should have a glass of wine.

609
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:07,724
I appreciate that,
ma'am, but I...

610
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:11,060
- You're off your shift, right?
- I am. That's true.

611
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,062
Then I won't
take no for an answer.

612
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:18,856
You shouldn't waste any
of your good stuff on me. I'm...

613
00:42:18,856 --> 00:42:21,732
I don't really know
anything about wine.

614
00:42:21,732 --> 00:42:25,944
Then how about bourbon?
I bet you'd like a little of that.

615
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,820
I definitely don't mind a
bourbon from time to time.

616
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,905
Then bourbon it is.

617
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:50,291
You're a tough man
to track down these days.

618
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:53,501
You got the watch?

619
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,377
"To improve is to change."

620
00:42:55,377 --> 00:42:58,087
"To perfect is
to change often."

621
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:00,004
What sort of change
are you looking for?

622
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:05,633
- Whichever leaves me options.
- Trouble at Glendon Hill?

623
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,343
Paid leave until the
investigation is over.

624
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:10,219
Well, at least
you're being paid.

625
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:13,513
First step in terminating
my partnership.

626
00:43:13,513 --> 00:43:15,389
You know how things go.

627
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:18,516
No matter what happens,
there's a stain I can't wash out.

628
00:43:18,516 --> 00:43:21,892
So you're looking
for career opportunities.

629
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,477
I'm not offering myself
to you wholesale.

630
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,938
I keep fighting you,
but I can fight you less.

631
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:32,941
- And by "less" you mean...
- Enough to hurt, but not finish you.

632
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:36,025
And in return, I have a future
beyond Glendon Hill.

633
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:38,819
- Whatever that might look like.
- So you're offering neutrality.

634
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:42,822
- But you'll go with the victor.
- I figure let the best man win.

635
00:43:42,822 --> 00:43:49,534
And if you go down, it won't be
because of me. That's worth something.

636
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:54,078
- Where's this coming from?
- Insurance, that's all.

637
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,081
Does it have anything to do
with Jackie?

638
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:07,043
That's over.

639
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:09,962
I know you've got Birch
in your pocket. Womack's not an option.

640
00:44:09,962 --> 00:44:13,840
We're too close.
But Jacqueline...

641
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,133
This is about my future,
pure and simple. She's not a part of it.

642
00:44:19,217 --> 00:44:23,720
Keep the watch,
as a token of good faith.

643
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,144
He might deny it,
but he's protecting her.

644
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:37,979
What he doesn't realize
is that I have even less regard

645
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:41,314
for Jackie than Raymond does.
Poor Remy.

646
00:44:41,314 --> 00:44:46,984
The heart can choke the mind
when all its blood flows back unto itself.

647
00:45:40,932 --> 00:45:45,309
He said, "I don't like
brunettes."

648
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:54,565
Looks like
I almost missed the party.

649
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:58,234
- I'm off the clock, sir.
- Oh, relax.

650
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:02,611
Francis, I broke a glass and
Edward cut his hand on a piece of it.

651
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:05,822
- Jesus!
- Oh, wow, it needs a change.

652
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:09,532
Take that off
and I'll get fresh...

653
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:17,745
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I was off duty...

654
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:22,915
- Is she...?
- Drunk? A little.

655
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:29,502
- How many of these have you had?
- A few.

656
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:31,837
More than a few.

657
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:40,675
- May I? Mm.
- Please.

658
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,012
Let me see.

659
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:50,097
It's not too bad.

660
00:46:53,725 --> 00:46:57,935
- There's a lot of blood.
- Looks worse than it is.

661
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:01,729
Ow...

662
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:05,440
- Is it painful?
- The bourbon helps.

663
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,026
You let me know if this hurts.

664
00:47:14,987 --> 00:47:16,571
Not one bit, sir.

665
00:49:55,622 --> 00:49:58,790
- How's your head?
- Fine.

666
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:02,042
I took a couple of aspirin
before I went to sleep.

667
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,460
You?

668
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,337
I slept like a baby.

669
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:10,464
Good.

670
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:12,590
You needed that.

671
00:50:27,266 --> 00:50:29,475
- What is it?
- Something weird.

672
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:31,643
- This one address keeps popping up.
- Underwood?

673
00:50:31,643 --> 00:50:33,728
The president.

674
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:50,613
- Good morning, Meechum.
- Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

675
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:54,573
It's a beautiful day.

676
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
