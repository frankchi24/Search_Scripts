1
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:59,486
We could jump in the car, if...

2
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,404
We'll wait.

3
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:04,532
Did you get the congressman

4
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,534
- anything for his birthday?
- No.

5
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:08,995
I got him cuff links.

6
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,623
- Silver, with his...
- We don't talk about birthdays.

7
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:14,084
- We don't do gifts.
- Why not?

8
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,878
You should return the cuff links.

9
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:18,588
Doug.

10
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:20,715
Tried calling you.

11
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:23,009
- I left my phone in the...
- We need to talk.

12
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:28,765
- What's going on?
- Christina.

13
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,226
- I just spoke to her.
- Did Zoe?

14
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,852
Yeah, and that's not all.

15
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,562
They tracked down Rachel, too.

16
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,105
Francis.

17
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:38,650
Tell me about Rachel.

18
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:39,818
Where is she?

19
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:41,236
I have her under control.

20
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,737
That's not what I asked.

21
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:44,447
I drove her home.

22
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:45,824
We don't have to worry about her.

23
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,826
You said the same about Ms. Skorsky.

24
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:50,912
Anyone else involved?

25
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,330
Just Janine and Zoe.

26
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:53,665
They asked about Russo's arrest,

27
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,250
and they know he went to see Kapeniak.

28
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,252
I assume that's as far as they've gotten.

29
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,878
Assume nothing.

30
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,338
I'll alert Barney Hull.

31
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:03,132
- What do you want me to do about Zoe?
- I'll handle Zoe.

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,426
- Get to work.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,816
I emptied it.

34
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,694
You're another year older on Tuesday.

35
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:25,613
And we can't have a vice
president who smokes.

36
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,710
- Can you finish?
- What?

37
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:41,296
I'm good.

38
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:43,673
What's wrong?

39
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:46,050
Nothing. I just said finish.

40
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:48,469
Well, I don't want to
just... if you're not...

41
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:50,680
Ok, fine.

42
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:51,764
Whatever.

43
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,603
Zoe, did I do something that made you... ?

44
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,395
No.

45
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,231
Zoe, you can't say something like

46
00:05:00,273 --> 00:05:03,026
"just finish" and then shut down.

47
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,244
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.

48
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,379
Good morning, Jackie.

49
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:26,716
Good morning.

50
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,386
Richard Russell?

51
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,889
Civil Rights Act, 1963.

52
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:35,350
Not everyone can be on
the right side of history.

53
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,976
Not even Lyndon for a time,

54
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,562
but he would've never become
majority leader without him.

55
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:42,023
Well, there's no Johnson Senate building.

56
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,901
No, he had to settle for
a presidential library.

57
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,569
So it's been some time

58
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,237
since you and I have
had a chance to catch up.

59
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,239
You've been an outstanding deputy, Jackie.

60
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:52,950
Far more effective than your
more seasoned colleagues.

61
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:54,327
You're a coalition builder,

62
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:55,912
a fighter when you have to be.

63
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,956
Tell me, where do you see yourself headed?

64
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:03,377
I'd like to aim for the
chair of Armed Services.

65
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:04,879
Or Homeland Security.

66
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,507
Have you ever considered
serving in the leadership?

67
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,718
I figure that might be possible eight,

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,677
ten years from now.

69
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,888
What if I suggested that you
could serve in the leadership

70
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,348
this term?

71
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,183
To replace me,

72
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,309
as whip.

73
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:21,938
You're being tapped for VP.

74
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,523
Let's assume that's true.

75
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,316
That makes sense,

76
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:27,193
but me as whip?

77
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:27,985
Yes.

78
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,654
A third-term congresswoman?

79
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,239
A universally admired incumbent

80
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:34,283
who also happens to be a war veteran.

81
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:35,785
Webb is next in line.

82
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,245
Or Buchwalter.

83
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:38,955
Mmm-hmm.

84
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,500
So just consider that for a moment.

85
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,089
They'll draw votes from one another.

86
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:51,092
Oh, I'm not saying you
wouldn't have to fight for it.

87
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,135
But I'd be willing to
give you the ammunition.

88
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:56,889
Come over here.

89
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,313
What is this?

90
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:07,483
My files on Webb and Buchwalter.

91
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,026
Why don't you take a look?

92
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,195
We'll speak in a few days.

93
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,573
Oh, and there's one on you.

94
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,117
You might wanna begin by
reading that one first.

95
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:39,515
What'd Janine say?

96
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:41,309
Strip club's not open yet.

97
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:43,352
You look into Kapeniak?

98
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:45,229
If he's on the grid, I'll find him.

99
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:48,733
Drop me at Metro Center.

100
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,026
Not the office?

101
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,653
I'm gonna talk to Rachel.

102
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:54,155
She'll deny everything,

103
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,406
like she did last night.

104
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:58,492
She can't deny getting into
Stamper's car. You saw her.

105
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:02,413
Maybe you send a version
of the story about her dad.

106
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,415
No one would print it.

107
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:06,751
Rachel doesn't know that.

108
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,878
She said, "Go to town, bitch."

109
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,505
It won't work. I have to get in her face.

110
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,179
Congratulations.

111
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,891
- We're thrilled for you.
- Thank you.

112
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,851
I wanted to fill in Bob
and Terry personally.

113
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:25,394
Now, let's get to it.

114
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,688
- I have to leave for Pittsburgh in what?
- Twenty minutes.

115
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,815
Homestretch with Jim. Whistle-stop tour.

116
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:30,858
Looking good out there.

117
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,735
Very good, but we don't
want to take any chances.

118
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,487
Now, your replacement as whip, Frank.

119
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,280
Bob has already shared some thoughts.

120
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:38,866
- I like Howard Webb.
- Webb is a solid choice.

121
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,326
Have you thought about Wes Buchwalter?

122
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,744
Buchwalter's a hothead.

123
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,579
Well, could you live with Webb, Frank?

124
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,289
Webb is a good tactician,

125
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,582
but he lacks follow-through.

126
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:47,958
The problem with Buchwalter is,

127
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,544
he's too abrasive. No
charm. Lots of enemies.

128
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:51,670
Is there a third option?

129
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,256
They're the two most senior members
in the caucus. It's their turn.

130
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,384
Mr. President, what if
we let the caucus pick?

131
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:57,802
Let it be a wide open race.

132
00:08:57,843 --> 00:08:59,053
Both men are qualified.

133
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:00,805
The leadership should be united in this.

134
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,473
We don't want to be backing
different candidates.

135
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:04,850
So we stay out of it, and
neither of us backs anyone.

136
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:05,518
I like it.

137
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,852
The caucus will respect someone who

138
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:08,229
did it the old-fashioned way.

139
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,815
Well, gentlemen,
it's your call to make.

140
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,233
Figure it out amongst yourselves,

141
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:14,610
- let me know what you decide.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

142
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,905
Put me through to Secretary Lewis.

143
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,242
Frank, I don't want to go
to battle with you on this.

144
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:23,452
- We've been down that road.
- I couldn't agree more.

145
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:24,912
An open race makes me nervous.

146
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,914
Look, it was just a suggestion.

147
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:30,167
- I'll put some thought into it.
- Thank you.

148
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:34,713
You know, let me... let me go work on him.

149
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:36,549
Well, good luck.

150
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,229
What are you doing here?

151
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:52,481
Ask me what I want to order.

152
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:00,447
Have you decided, sir?

153
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:01,782
I need you to quit your job.

154
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:03,409
Tell Leon it's your last day.

155
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:04,869
Why?

156
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:06,662
Act normal.

157
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,459
- Would you want a side with that?
- They found you once.

158
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,169
We can't take the chance
they'll find you again.

159
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:16,839
- What am I supposed to do about money?
- Do as I say.

160
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:18,966
Go home and pack your things.

161
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:20,384
I'll come by around ten.

162
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,386
- I don't get a say in any... ?
- Stop it.

163
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:31,145
One suitcase. That's it.

164
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:33,355
- Can you at least tell me... ?
- I'll take the shepherd's pie

165
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:35,274
with a side of brussels sprouts.

166
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,109
To go.

167
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:40,321
We don't want a trial,

168
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:41,822
her lawyers don't want a trial,

169
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:43,699
but Ms. Cole won't listen to reason.

170
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:45,826
That said, if you give
me a little more time...

171
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:46,702
If she wants to go to court,

172
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:47,786
then let's give her that.

173
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:50,039
Just because she's being
unreasonable now doesn't mean...

174
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,956
- she's...
- I'm done.

175
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,499
That's a knee-jerk reaction.

176
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,586
I've never known you to be a person
who is irrational or impatient.

177
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:56,921
Let me check back with her lawyers...

178
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,048
What's the soonest we can get a trial date?

179
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,966
- Claire.
- Give me a time frame.

180
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:03,344
Six months, at the earliest.

181
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:07,514
Inform her people.

182
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:10,017
Then no more communication.

183
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:12,186
As your counsel, it is my duty

184
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,146
to strongly advise you against this.

185
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,732
I understand and I thank you, Oliver.

186
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,154
Thank you.

187
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:24,365
So?

188
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,784
They wouldn't give me
individual contact info,

189
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,535
but here's every doctor

190
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:31,038
who served in East Africa
during the last three years.

191
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,414
And what about the HMO?

192
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:33,874
You need a consent form.

193
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,209
It's in the packet.

194
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,680
Can I help you?

195
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:50,766
Yeah, I'm looking for Rachel Posner.

196
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:52,684
She's not here.

197
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,270
- Is she coming in later?
- Why?

198
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,189
I know her.

199
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:59,483
Well, your friend really screwed me over.

200
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:00,609
What happened?

201
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:03,112
She took off, middle of her shift.

202
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:05,906
I had to put my hostess on waitstaff duty.

203
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,699
Look, I'm concerned.

204
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,326
Rachel's in real trouble.

205
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:11,286
I don't care what her personal issues are.

206
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:12,746
I need to know where she lives.

207
00:12:12,788 --> 00:12:13,789
I thought you knew her.

208
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:16,667
I do. It's just been a while and...

209
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:20,003
she sent me a text message saying
she wants to hurt herself, and

210
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,214
now she won't answer her phone.

211
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:24,842
She has a history of mental illness.

212
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:27,261
You gotta help me out.

213
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,769
Look, I can't.

214
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:37,604
Her W-2,

215
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:38,814
the address is a PO box.

216
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,357
I'll take whatever I can get.

217
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,611
- Let me see what I got in the office.
- Thank you.

218
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:45,863
If you find her,

219
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:47,739
you tell her not to come back.

220
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:50,826
I don't need some nut case
creating chaos in here.

221
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,038
- Nancy?
- Yes, sir.

222
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:56,957
- Is Doug back yet?
- In his office.

223
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,292
And, sir?

224
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,378
Birthday cards have started
to arrive. A few presents.

225
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,672
Thank-you notes. Inventory the
presents. Anything valuable...

226
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,382
- Goes in the conference room.
- Anything cheap...

227
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:07,593
- Goes to the interns.
- You know what to do with the cards.

228
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:09,261
Yes, sir.

229
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,936
I'm picking her up tonight.

230
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:19,813
I got everything set up for her in Joppa.

231
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:21,732
- Where's that?
- Maryland,

232
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,442
about 30 minutes north of Baltimore.

233
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,902
That's close to home.

234
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:26,153
We want her to disappear,

235
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:27,571
but not on us.

236
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:30,032
- Fine. Do you have the burner?
- Yeah.

237
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,751
Happy birthday.

238
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:44,713
It's pre-paid. All you need
to do is turn it on and dial.

239
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:46,131
We still have the phone history.

240
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:48,550
All the more reason to
be safe going forward.

241
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:51,011
- Where are we with Christina?
- I'm on it.

242
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:52,262
Linda's office.

243
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:54,222
I called her this morning.

244
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,312
Are you Gillian Cole?

245
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:03,148
Yeah. Have we met?

246
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:05,859
No, we haven't met. You know my husband.

247
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:08,445
- Your husband?
- David Applebaum.

248
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:13,325
- So it's true.
- It was a mistake.

249
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,327
You wanna see our kids?

250
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,787
I can show you pictures.

251
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:19,373
- Mrs. Applebaum...
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

252
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:20,457
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,668
You're sorry? I don't think you're sorry.

254
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,211
And don't think for a second

255
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:26,088
you're gonna use that baby
to get money out of us.

256
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,924
- He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.
- But you knew he was married.

257
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:30,634
How could you?

258
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,427
- Did he talk about us?
- No.

259
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:33,762
Lying bitch.

260
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,681
Am I embarrassing you?

261
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,474
Did you think about how you would...

262
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,726
humiliate me and my kids?

263
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,561
Use a condom

264
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,855
the next time you fuck somebody's husband.

265
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,718
It's been less than 24 hours.

266
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,678
She quits her job in the middle of a shift?

267
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,721
She's scared. I'd take off too.

268
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:17,973
It's Underwood.

269
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:19,891
He's moving faster than we are.

270
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,184
What about the stripper?

271
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:23,019
Refuses to talk.

272
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,229
Kapeniak?

273
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,690
No current address.
No siblings. Parents are dead.

274
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:28,775
Rachel's the last loose end.

275
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,318
She must know something else

276
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,820
bigger than the DUI.

277
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,780
Any idea where she went?

278
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:35,615
I got a PO box in Dupont.

279
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:36,992
But none of the clerks have seen her.

280
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,618
I could go stake it out, but...

281
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:40,620
Have you talked to your guy yet?

282
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,788
The next day or two.

283
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:44,624
He's bringing me the police
report on Russo's suicide.

284
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,876
I'll press him for more.

285
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,252
And what's your next move?

286
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,796
Trying to figure out
how to respond to this.

287
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:53,842
I got it a couple hours ago.

288
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:56,803
I think he's setting her up.

289
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,680
I know how to handle him.

290
00:15:58,805 --> 00:16:01,183
- The less he knows, the better.
- We might learn something.

291
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:02,392
Not with him calling the shots.

292
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:03,768
I'm choosing the place.

293
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,854
- As if that makes a difference.
- I'm not gonna fuck him,

294
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,439
just talk to him.

295
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:14,613
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

296
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:17,532
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
- That's ok.

297
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:18,992
No, it's not.

298
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:22,287
- I just don't want you to be careless.
- I won't be.

299
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,706
You want no life?

300
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,045
You want more work than
three people can handle?

301
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:33,465
You want a decent chance that you
could be fired within the first month?

302
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:35,675
If that tempts you,

303
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,511
- we can keep talking.
- None of that intimidates me.

304
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:40,347
I've been running a congressional district

305
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,431
for the past nine weeks

306
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:43,058
with zero assistance.

307
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,727
Nobody elected me. Nobody taught me.

308
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,896
I've done it because somebody had to.

309
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:50,357
What happened was tragic, but

310
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:52,108
you won't get sympathy from me.

311
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,568
I don't have time for it.

312
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,028
I wouldn't be sitting here

313
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,113
if I wanted a shoulder to cry on.

314
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:04,454
Rachel?

315
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:21,513
Leave.

316
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,985
I said leave.

317
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:39,489
- Are you packed?
- I'm not going anywhere.

318
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:42,701
So you didn't quit today.

319
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,328
I did, but I changed my mind.

320
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,164
This isn't your decision to make.

321
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:49,791
I'm keeping my job

322
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,501
and I'm keeping this apartment.

323
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:53,211
No, you're not.

324
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,090
- You promised you'd make this go away.
- And you're starting over...

325
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:59,718
I already started over. I
don't want to start over again.

326
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:02,512
I wish you didn't have to.

327
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,557
Get out.

328
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:08,476
Get out!

329
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:10,145
Lower your voice.

330
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,399
I'll fucking kill you.

331
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:16,359
Go ahead.

332
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:28,788
I am the only one who can
protect you. Don't you see that?

333
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:32,834
You have no idea how much danger you're in.

334
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:50,393
Hey.

335
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,896
Start packing.

336
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,657
You know I ask every year.

337
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,493
Nothing, as usual.

338
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:10,580
I thought we could have dinner.

339
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,832
Only if it's someplace where
nobody will recognize us.

340
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,876
- I don't want anyone...
- I mean at home.

341
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:16,252
I'll cook something.

342
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:18,671
No cake.

343
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:20,089
- No cake.
- No gifts.

344
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,424
No gifts.

345
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,884
I could do that.

346
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:24,344
How's the lawsuit coming?

347
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:25,803
We'll be fine.

348
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,514
We'd like to increase
the size of your detail

349
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:30,934
to full head-of-state
status starting tomorrow.

350
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:33,228
Well, that won't be happening.

351
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:34,812
It's good to get a head start,

352
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:37,148
- so by the time the announcement...
- If these are my last few days

353
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,858
before I never have privacy again.

354
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,527
I intend to savor these
moments for as long as I can.

355
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:42,904
But, sir, in terms of safety...

356
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:44,781
Until I'm confirmed as vice president,

357
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:47,075
security is at my
discretion, is that correct?

358
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,535
- Technically, yes, but...
- Then that's settled.

359
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:51,955
All right, we'll wait
until the announcement.

360
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,123
Now, assuming the
confirmation goes through,

361
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:56,209
we'll need to work out
the logistics of moving you

362
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:57,794
into the Naval Observatory.

363
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,379
That won't be happening either.

364
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,756
The congressman will be
remaining in his town house.

365
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,842
But it doesn't have the
necessary security infrastructure.

366
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:09,180
Then you'll need to build it.

367
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,349
We're talking blast-proofing,

368
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,226
hard-wired communications networks,

369
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:16,354
- 24-hour office space...
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

370
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,691
I'll contact you directly
about setting a plan in motion.

371
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:27,532
Oh, and one last thing before you go.

372
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,576
I'd like to have Edward
Meechum serve on my detail.

373
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:31,953
He's Capitol Police.

374
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,247
For now. You're about to appoint
him to the Secret Service.

375
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:36,582
That would require an
accelerated training program.

376
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,501
Sir, we have plenty of qualified agents,

377
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:40,169
men and women with years of experience.

378
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:41,629
And I look forward to
working with all of them

379
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,673
as long as Edward Meechum is on the detail.

380
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:45,425
Thank you very much for your time.

381
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,051
Thank you, sir.

382
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,525
Nancy, have Meechum bring the car around.

383
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:17,248
You know, last time was the last time.

384
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:19,500
I know, but this is important.

385
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:22,754
You keep selling me that
swampland. I'm done buying.

386
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:24,881
No more.

387
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:25,590
The cover-up.

388
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,300
You said it went as high as Barney Hull.

389
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:28,426
That's not what I said.

390
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:30,511
- When you gave me Rachel Posner's arrest file...
- What I said

391
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:33,431
is that arrests don't disappear
without a big-ass wand.

392
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:34,932
That ain't the same as proof.

393
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,809
We think congressional
leadership took part.

394
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:38,728
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do. I know you do.

395
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,313
No, I really don't.

396
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:41,689
When you helped me expose the drug ring...

397
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:42,648
They were dirty street cops

398
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:45,234
stuffing a few grams in their
pockets. This is different.

399
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:47,862
- Powerful fucking people.
- Dirty cops are dirty cops.

400
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,572
- You want to protect them?
- I have a pension

401
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:51,157
- and a family.
- I understand, but...

402
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,533
Don't contact me again.

403
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,338
- Where's your cell?
- Here.

404
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,965
It's not recording.

405
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,301
I need to ask you to delete
all of our phone history.

406
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,511
Why would I do that?

407
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:55,263
I'm trying to protect both you and I.

408
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,223
I'm not facing prison.

409
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:01,811
You didn't cover up the arrest?

410
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,981
Was it because you
wanted him to be governor?

411
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:08,025
No. He was in trouble so I helped.

412
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,986
And later he expressed a desire to run

413
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:12,238
- and I offered guidance.
- To an alcoholic?

414
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:14,782
To a sober, recovering alcoholic.

415
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:17,410
Did you want him to self-sabotage?

416
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,911
Absolutely not.

417
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:21,247
It got Matthews in the race.

418
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:24,500
I like to back people who want to succeed.

419
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,294
Take yourself as an example.

420
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,212
You just took advantage of the situation.

421
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:31,465
Matthews took advantage. I
didn't seek the nomination.

422
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,720
Russo was in the passenger
seat when he died.

423
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:41,142
That's not entirely accurate.

424
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:42,977
I saw the police report.

425
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,062
And I spoke to the commissioner directly

426
00:23:45,062 --> 00:23:46,480
because I cared about Peter

427
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,941
and I wanted to know the full story.

428
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:51,152
He wasn't in the passenger seat?

429
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:57,283
The passenger door was
open and he was halfway out.

430
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:58,951
They think that...

431
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:02,496
he might have had second thoughts.

432
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:06,375
If I speak to Barney
Hull, he'll confirm that?

433
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:09,628
What are you suggesting, Zoe?

434
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:11,005
Maybe there was foul play.

435
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:12,506
If there was a hint of foul play,

436
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,633
don't you think the police
would have investigated?

437
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:16,594
The same police that buried his DUI?

438
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:18,971
And you think I was involved?

439
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,557
There's a connection between you.

440
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,392
Listen to you. You sound ludicrous.

441
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:24,977
I'm just asking questions.

442
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,146
No, you're connecting
dots that don't exist.

443
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:30,357
You want me to just walk away,
act as if I don't know anything?

444
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,568
Yes, I got Peter out of a jam.

445
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:34,820
Yes, I sent him to speak to Kapeniak.

446
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:36,906
But beyond that, there's nothing to know.

447
00:24:36,947 --> 00:24:39,533
Can you blame me if I find it
difficult to trust you right now?

448
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:40,743
Trust me or not,

449
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:43,662
but I'm about to be confirmed
as the vice president.

450
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:47,208
And our relationship extends
to the Oval Office now.

451
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:50,461
Don't step out of the
sunlight for no reason.

452
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:54,423
Let's start this new
chapter with a clean slate.

453
00:24:56,467 --> 00:25:00,429
Now, you sleep on that
and I'll be in touch.

454
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:09,647
<i>We'll start with
blood and hormone tests.</i>

455
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:11,649
<i>Those results should be
back within a few days.</i>

456
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,776
If they're good, we'll
move onto genetic testing

457
00:25:13,818 --> 00:25:15,277
for both you and your husband.

458
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,112
Have you spoken to him yet?

459
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:20,115
Not yet. I want to do the tests first.

460
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:22,201
We can do those anytime this week.

461
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:24,537
I'll have my office call yours.

462
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:27,748
Oh, I almost forgot. I've
been doing some research

463
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,125
- on the Internet.
- Be careful of the Internet.

464
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:32,962
Well, I was looking into

465
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:35,589
common issues associated
with post-40 pregnancies

466
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:38,467
and this drug came up, but
there wasn't much on it. It's

467
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:41,679
- Cruvenae...
- Cruvenae-tenuestrin.

468
00:25:41,804 --> 00:25:43,222
You probably haven't found much

469
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:45,224
because it's still in the beta stage.

470
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,976
And what does it do?

471
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:49,853
It helps maximize blood
flow to the placenta.

472
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:53,691
Until CVT, there hasn't been
any viable drug for that.

473
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:55,651
The jury's still out.

474
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:59,446
But placental insufficiency
affects women of all ages.

475
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:01,532
I wouldn't worry about it for now.

476
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:04,535
That's putting the cart
way before the horse.

477
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:11,709
<i>- You know,
- Matthews has this locked up,</i>

478
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,627
<i>but conservatives on the Hill are saying</i>

479
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:15,296
<i>he's gonna return to Harrisburg</i>

480
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:18,215
<i>with the same myopic
deficit growing mentality... </i>

481
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,020
<i>As to who's gonna replace
Matthews when he wins... </i>

482
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:35,065
- Can I at least turn off the overhead?
- Of course.

483
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:39,194
Do you want me to go work downstairs?

484
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:42,323
No, that's fine. Just make some room.

485
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:50,873
You haven't said a word.

486
00:26:51,498 --> 00:26:52,958
No.

487
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,127
Where does that leave us?

488
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,797
I'm fully prepared.

489
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:02,092
And I have been for some time.

490
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:14,229
I know you'll do whatever
you think is best.

491
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:19,526
But Underwood confirmed it.

492
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:21,361
He's gonna be tapped for VP.

493
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:22,529
That doesn't get us any closer.

494
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:24,823
We know that Russo cleared
the way for Matthews.

495
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:26,825
It reinforces the theory,
it doesn't give us proof.

496
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:29,203
We can't go after the
guy for playing dirty.

497
00:27:29,203 --> 00:27:31,997
And that's not news. Half the
fuckers in Congress play dirty.

498
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:34,708
He propped up a sham candidate
just to take him down.

499
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,001
Nobody forced Russo to drink that night.

500
00:27:36,043 --> 00:27:38,420
- The guy was an alcoholic.
- We don't know what happened that night,

501
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,131
other than three days
later, he killed himself.

502
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:44,551
Are you gonna contact him again?

503
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:45,886
I don't know.

504
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:48,263
We need to slow down, take
a step back and reevaluate...

505
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:49,556
We already let Rachel slip away.

506
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,141
There's no point until we have more.

507
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,811
- We should keep him guessing, not...
- Have more from where? From who?

508
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:55,813
I don't know. We should exhaust all options

509
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:58,357
before Zoe reaches back out to
Underwood. It looks desperate.

510
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:00,818
We are up against a brick
wall. And unless Under...

511
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:02,611
Zoe.

512
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:05,364
Hey. Hey.

513
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,325
Hey.

514
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,035
I just need to think.

515
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:13,205
- Well, let's think about it together.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

516
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,750
Freddy?

517
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,960
Yeah, Frank?

518
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:19,336
Was there something different

519
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,755
about these ribs this morning?

520
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,341
Better or worse?

521
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:27,177
I didn't think that they
could get any better,

522
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,930
but these were something special.

523
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:31,390
Well,

524
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,518
tried a new butcher.

525
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:36,728
Slow-bleeds his hogs.

526
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:39,815
- It ain't legal, but...
- Well, I won't tell anyone.

527
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:42,359
I don't know if I'm gonna go back to him.

528
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:44,236
Went out to his shop.

529
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:47,656
He's got a room in the back
where he does it. Soundproof.

530
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:50,576
- A whole setup.
- Why soundproof?

531
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,995
'Cause of how they scream.

532
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,330
They can smell it comin'.

533
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:57,833
You stick that pipe in their throat,

534
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,960
next ten minutes is hell.

535
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,420
Bust your fucking eardrums.

536
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:05,090
Now, the humane way to
do it is to make it quick.

537
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:08,635
Bring out a bucket of slop
like it's feeding time,

538
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:13,473
then bam, shovel right
to the base of the head.

539
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:15,601
No screamin'.

540
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:20,856
Now, he's willing to open up the
race, but Birch was very clear:

541
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,649
if he can't endorse
anyone, you can't either.

542
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,026
That's fair.

543
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,611
You really want Buchwalter to win?

544
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:28,572
I want the best man to win.

545
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,450
That sounds like a cagey,
bullshit non-answer to me.

546
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,244
I'm on the sidelines for this one, Terry.

547
00:29:34,536 --> 00:29:36,997
You're never on the sidelines, Frank.

548
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:40,292
I'll see you around.

549
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,437
Claire,

550
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,981
you wouldn't return my calls.

551
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:04,775
I'll be back.

552
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:09,404
My attorney said that I
shouldn't be in contact with you.

553
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:12,824
Blue Cross said my insurance was canceled.

554
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:14,743
Oh?

555
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:17,746
The severance package

556
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:20,415
gave me health coverage for up to a year.

557
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,335
That sounds right.

558
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:26,254
So there must be some kind of mistake.

559
00:30:26,546 --> 00:30:29,299
Well, you'll have to talk
to the insurance company.

560
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,760
I did. They said it was terminated.

561
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:34,054
They can't reinstate it
without the employer's approval.

562
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:36,264
And you want me to get involved?

563
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:39,309
There's medication that I need

564
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:42,187
that I can't get unless
it goes through my HMO.

565
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:43,563
Oh, I'm well aware.

566
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,899
I reviewed your records.

567
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,568
- What?
- You signed a consent form.

568
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:50,737
No, I didn't.

569
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,536
You forged my signature?

570
00:30:57,577 --> 00:31:00,288
Did a Mrs. Applebaum pay you a visit?

571
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,168
You realize

572
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:07,587
- what you're doing is...
- Civil,

573
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:09,673
- not criminal.
- Have you thought this out?

574
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:12,175
- Because when we go to court...
- You mean six months from now?

575
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,553
You're expecting in four, no?

576
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:17,264
That's four months without
the medicine you need.

577
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,602
I'm willing to let your child

578
00:31:22,602 --> 00:31:25,522
wither and die inside you
if that's what's required.

579
00:31:25,647 --> 00:31:27,899
But neither of us wants that.

580
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:32,946
Now tell me, am I really the
sort of enemy you want to make?

581
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:36,533
But here's the alternative:

582
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,203
this office, this staff,

583
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:45,125
The CWI could be yours,

584
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:48,044
and you and me, we wash
our hands of each other.

585
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:50,338
- You're trying to buy me.
- No.

586
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,883
When we first met, I
promised to empower you.

587
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:54,384
I'm fulfilling that promise.

588
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:56,636
- How do I get screwed?
- You don't. I resign.

589
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:58,680
You take my place.

590
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,142
- No strings?
- None.

591
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:04,978
<i>Exit polls have
Jim Matthews winning by anywhere... </i>

592
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:06,897
<i>from a nine to 12
percent margin of victory.</i>

593
00:32:06,897 --> 00:32:09,065
<i>- Swofford is expected to make...
- Hello?</i>

594
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:10,984
<i>- Mrs. Underwood?
- Yes?</i>

595
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:13,361
<i>Hi, I'm calling from Dr. Larson's office</i>

596
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:14,863
<i>to confirm your 10 a.m. tomorrow</i>

597
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:17,240
<i>for the blood and urine tests.</i>

598
00:32:19,868 --> 00:32:21,745
I can't come.

599
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,872
<i>Well, if tomorrow doesn't work,</i>

600
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:25,165
<i>we can reschedule for Thursday,</i>

601
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:28,585
<i>- or even Monday.
- No, I won't be rescheduling.</i>

602
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:31,796
Please tell Dr. Larson I
appreciate all her consultation,

603
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:34,674
but I've put a great
deal of thought into this

604
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:37,552
and I won't be pursuing any further tests.

605
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:39,512
Thank you.

606
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:14,691
Have you thought
about what we discussed?

607
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:18,236
I think you're right. We
should start with a clean state.

608
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:21,739
What about our text messages?

609
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,667
And the contact.

610
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:42,802
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

611
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:45,054
We can put all this
other nonsense behind us

612
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:47,974
and trust one another and
continue to help one another?

613
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:50,310
I'd like that.

614
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:52,604
Then consider the slate clean.

615
00:34:52,729 --> 00:34:54,731
Answer me one thing.

616
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:56,399
The passenger seat?

617
00:34:56,524 --> 00:34:58,359
You said Russo was trying to get out,

618
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,986
but there was nothing abnormal...

619
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:01,613
- I thought we just agreed...
- I want to believe you,

620
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:03,031
But I need details,

621
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:05,033
more than what you're sharing.

622
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:06,200
What's your question?

623
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:07,952
The night Russo fell off the wagon,

624
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,621
he was at a fund-raiser,

625
00:35:09,662 --> 00:35:12,916
- the McNeally Cancer Institute.
- All in the police report.

626
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:18,338
Rachel Posner was at the hotel that night.

627
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:20,465
Who's that?

628
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:22,842
The call girl who was with
Russo when he was arrested.

629
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:24,928
I didn't know her name.

630
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,056
She disappeared, Francis.

631
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:30,016
When?

632
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:31,601
Don't act surprised.

633
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:33,478
I showed the bellmen a photo.

634
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:35,647
One of them remembers seeing her.

635
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:39,233
The girl's a prostitute. I'm
sure she frequents many hotels.

636
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,653
But that hotel on that night?

637
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:44,656
Well, now you sound
like Ms. Skorsky talking.

638
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:47,575
I haven't discussed this with anyone.

639
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,369
I wanted to ask you first.

640
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,704
I have no idea what happened that night

641
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,706
except that Peter started drinking again.

642
00:35:53,748 --> 00:35:57,126
I don't know who was or
wasn't there. I wish I was.

643
00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:58,795
Maybe I could've stopped him.

644
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,922
Do you know where Rachel is?

645
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:04,425
- Listen to what I am saying.
- I'm trying to protect us both.

646
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,219
These are questions anyone could ask.

647
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:08,763
But no one is except you.

648
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:11,265
I can't imagine what you're after.

649
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:13,351
I took a chance,

650
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:16,896
showed up at your house and
placed myself at your feet.

651
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,940
Crossed ethical lines,

652
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:21,901
professionally, physically,

653
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:24,946
and I hold myself accountable for that.

654
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:27,615
Those were my choices
and I can live with them.

655
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:30,493
I'd like to move forward,

656
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:33,955
but I need to know exactly
what I was a part of, that...

657
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:37,750
that I wasn't a part of someone's...

658
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:42,797
Finish your thought.

659
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:47,343
A part of someone's murder.

660
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:48,719
Jesus.

661
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:51,806
I wanna believe you, Francis.

662
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:37,972
Damn.

663
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:39,890
- Come in.
- I've been calling you.

664
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,644
Come here.

665
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:50,860
Come in. Sit down. Um...

666
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:56,824
You want something? Some water or... juice?

667
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:04,707
You going somewhere?

668
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:07,585
Hey. You going somewhere?

669
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:10,004
To my mom's. In Ithaca.

670
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:12,923
- What?
- I'm leaving.

671
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:16,177
No, no. No, no, no. No. No way.

672
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:18,512
- We have nothing.
- Are you giving up on this?

673
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:20,556
There are only three people in the world

674
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:22,933
that know what he has done,
and one of them is gone.

675
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:24,185
If we had anything,

676
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:26,103
Lucas, any hard evidence,

677
00:40:26,145 --> 00:40:27,646
or even a fucking quote

678
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:29,440
from a source that would
go on record for us,

679
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,608
that would be one thing,

680
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:31,942
but we're grasping,

681
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:33,694
and he is not fucking around.

682
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:37,031
You were the one who
told Zoe to pursue this.

683
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:38,407
She told me what you said:

684
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:41,368
"The only stories that mattered were
the ones that scared you to death."

685
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,370
Ok, this isn't just death threats!

686
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:44,914
This is real!

687
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:47,917
He doesn't know about
you, but he knows about me.

688
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,668
These were in my mailbox.

689
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,629
No return address.

690
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,756
- He took these of her?
- Who else?

691
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,299
You can keep them,

692
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:57,176
- but I don't think they're gonna help you.
- We need to stop him.

693
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:59,303
Sick fucking shit.

694
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:03,182
Janine, you cannot run away from this.

695
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:04,975
My entire career,

696
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:07,978
I have always chosen the tough stories.

697
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:10,022
I have been fearless.

698
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:12,983
But you know what?

699
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:16,195
I'm really fucking scared this time.

700
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:18,072
He's got power,

701
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:19,531
he's got a lot to lose,

702
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:21,575
- and right now he is winning.
- Please, I need your help, please...

703
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:24,578
Just wake the fuck up, Lucas!

704
00:41:42,638 --> 00:41:45,766
<i>The incident occurred
at approximately 8 p.m. last night</i>

705
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:47,017
<i>on the northbound tracks</i>

706
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:49,186
<i>of the Cathedral Heights Metro station.</i>

707
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:51,605
<i>DC Police have ruled the death an accident.</i>

708
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:55,317
<i>Zoe Barnes was a senior
contributor at Slugline.com.</i>

709
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,861
<i>Previously, she worked
at the Washington Herald</i>

710
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:00,906
<i>as a metro reporter and
political correspondent.</i>

711
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,117
<i>Barnes broke several major stories,</i>

712
00:42:03,158 --> 00:42:06,912
<i>including an early draft of the
Education Reform and Achievement Act</i>

713
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:08,831
<i>as well as a college newspaper article</i>

714
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:10,958
<i>that derailed Senator Michael Kerns'</i>

715
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,002
<i>nomination for Secretary of State.</i>

716
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:36,859
What did you think of the files?

717
00:42:36,984 --> 00:42:39,862
- There's plenty to work with.
- Did you look at your own?

718
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:42,072
There was nothing there.

719
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:46,577
- Should there be?
- No.

720
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:48,328
Even if you're lying,

721
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,164
the fact I haven't been
able to find anything

722
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:52,207
tells me you're very good
at covering your tracks.

723
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:54,042
That's valuable to me.

724
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:55,461
Here's our battleground.

725
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:57,504
One hundred and 13 votes.

726
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:59,882
You have the skeletons.

727
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:04,386
If I lose,

728
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:07,723
- they'll come after me.
- That's a risk you'll have to take.

729
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:11,059
How do I know you're not just using me?

730
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:13,103
Throwing a wrench into someone else's bid?

731
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:14,605
That's another risk.

732
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:17,691
The alternative is you wait ten years.

733
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,610
You chose me for a reason.

734
00:43:20,402 --> 00:43:22,696
I'd like to know what it is.

735
00:43:23,197 --> 00:43:25,491
All right.

736
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,619
How many missile strikes did you launch?

737
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,455
- But you did it anyway.
- Enough to keep me awake at night.

738
00:43:31,497 --> 00:43:32,414
Yes, I did.

739
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,833
- How many women and children?
- Too many.

740
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,668
And you launched those missiles knowing

741
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:38,003
all those innocent people would die.

742
00:43:38,045 --> 00:43:40,088
I had orders to eliminate the enemy.

743
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,925
Which you carried out
expertly and efficiently.

744
00:43:43,842 --> 00:43:45,761
Have you ever killed anyone?

745
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:48,180
No.

746
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:51,975
I watched. Apartment buildings,
entire villages... gone,

747
00:43:52,017 --> 00:43:53,810
like they were never there.

748
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:56,897
I'd prefer not to talk about
it, if that's all right.

749
00:43:57,356 --> 00:44:02,444
You did what needed to be done
and that's why I chose you, Jackie.

750
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:05,030
Service background,

751
00:44:05,072 --> 00:44:06,573
clean history,

752
00:44:06,615 --> 00:44:08,909
photogenic. The whole package.

753
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:11,620
But more importantly...

754
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:15,874
ruthless pragmatism.

755
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,710
Are we working together or not?

756
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,215
Any public or private
endorsements for Buchwalter,

757
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:24,174
I come out for Webb.

758
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,301
I'll stay out of the
fray. I give you my word.

759
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:27,511
Same goes for you, Terry.

760
00:44:27,552 --> 00:44:29,054
All right.

761
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:35,477
Thank you, Christina.

762
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:39,815
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. President,

763
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:42,109
how was Pennsylvania?

764
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:06,675
You like Indian?

765
00:45:27,446 --> 00:45:29,740
Sir? I've seen the news.

766
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:33,869
I know she was close to you.

767
00:45:36,246 --> 00:45:38,749
Terrible tragedy.

768
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:42,252
I spoke to Special Agent
Rockland today, sir.

769
00:45:42,544 --> 00:45:44,463
I begin my training next week.

770
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:46,590
Very good.

771
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,263
I know it's a day late.

772
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,098
Hope it isn't inappropriate,

773
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,684
but I wanted to give you this.

774
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:03,440
Thank you, Meechum.

775
00:46:13,283 --> 00:46:14,785
That was very nice of Edward.

776
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:17,788
He shouldn't have spent
this sort of money on me.

777
00:46:17,996 --> 00:46:19,706
I've opened some wine downstairs.

778
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:21,833
I'll be down in a minute.

779
00:46:25,462 --> 00:46:28,340
Did you think I'd forgotten you?

780
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:31,134
Perhaps you hoped I had.

781
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:34,012
Don't waste a breath mourning Ms. Barnes.

782
00:46:34,012 --> 00:46:36,264
Every kitten grows up to be a cat.

783
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:38,266
They seem so harmless at first,

784
00:46:38,266 --> 00:46:41,686
small, quiet, lapping
up their saucer of milk.

785
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:43,980
But once their claws get long enough,

786
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:45,774
they draw blood,

787
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:48,485
sometimes from the hand that feeds them.

788
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,613
For those of us climbing to
the top of the food chain,

789
00:46:51,613 --> 00:46:53,573
there can be no mercy.

790
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:55,534
There is but one rule:

791
00:46:55,534 --> 00:46:59,037
hunt or be hunted.

792
00:47:00,413 --> 00:47:02,582
Welcome back.
