1
00:00:00,974 --> 00:00:02,882
What do you think of Darren Jarvis?

2
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:05,823
- At CBS?
- He wants me to be a correspondent.

3
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:08,360
Not worth your time.

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:10,181
What about Greer Fisher at MSNBC?

5
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:12,101
Stick to writing.

6
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:13,934
Do TV on the side.

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,494
You're more than a talking head.

8
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,019
- How about Slugline?
- What's Slugline?

9
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:23,565
If I said Politico wanted
to hire me, what would you say?

10
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:25,977
I would say that that peaks my interest.

11
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:30,151
Six months from now, Slugline will be
what Politico was a year and a half ago.

12
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:33,605
Everyone at Politico reads it, because
Slugline's breaking stories before they are.

13
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,320
I wonder why I've never heard of it.

14
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:37,625
Everyone's a free agent.
They write whatever they want,

15
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:38,777
wherever they are.

16
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,130
Most people write from their phones.

17
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:43,978
Well, if freedom and exposure
are what they're offering,

18
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:46,729
I would say that is a meeting
worth taking.

19
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,091
This Hammerschmidt thing is blowing up.

20
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:51,151
I think he might get fired.

21
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:52,728
There's gotta be 1,000 tweets here.

22
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,293
People defending me, people trashing me.

23
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,881
There's even a hashtag--
"gozoe."

24
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,573
Mmm.

25
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:00,771
Mmm.

26
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,875
Hey!

27
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,919
We mustn't leave any trails.

28
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,491
All of my contacts are in there.

29
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:09,771
Then it's time for you
to get some new contacts.

30
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:15,777
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone.
I'll get you two, in fact.

31
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:18,022
One for work and a burner for play.

32
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:20,374
Expect them this afternoon.

33
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:25,117
Oh, and go, Zoe.

34
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,468
The reporter?

35
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:41,195
Yes.

36
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,581
Just this once?

37
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,411
I'm not sure.

38
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,624
What does she offer us?

39
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,444
A mouthpiece when we need one.

40
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:56,148
She's been very useful so far.

41
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:58,242
- What does she want?
- Access.

42
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:00,072
A seat at the table.

43
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:02,433
Sounds like she's getting
the better side of the bargain.

44
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:05,249
She can be controlled.

45
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,995
Are you sure?

46
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,813
She can.
I promise you.

47
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,778
Okay. If you say so.

48
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:16,115
- The moment you want me to end it--
- I know, Francis.

49
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:21,240
I should get ready for work.

50
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,982
Hey.

51
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,207
Didn't think you'd be in till later.

52
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,822
This is your agenda for the day.

53
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,874
Here's your schedule
for the rest of the week.

54
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,132
These are papers that need
to be approved or signed.

55
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:46,894
Over here are your one-sheets
for committee meetings

56
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,563
and briefs on upcoming
legislative action.

57
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,690
I filled Ashley in. She can cover
until you find a replacement.

58
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:03,564
Christina...

59
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,749
What?

60
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:10,156
Thank you...

61
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:13,470
for getting all this in order.

62
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,949
Ashley can call me if you have any
questions about what's on your desk.

63
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,048
Is he here yet?

64
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:28,625
I put him in your office.

65
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,916
Marty Spinella, head lobbyist
for the teachers' union.

66
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,664
He wants to rip my head off
and peel it like an orange.

67
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:42,418
Why? Because I lied to him.
But what choice did I have

68
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:45,938
when the truth would've ended the
conversation before it began?

69
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,870
- I'll call you back.
- Marty.

70
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,575
You fucking lied, Frank?

71
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,623
No, no. You lied
to my fucking face?

72
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,583
- Marty, I did not lie.
- Did not--

73
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,586
We spent the whole weekend in that room

74
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,375
pouring over this bill line by line,

75
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,849
and nowhere did it say anything
about collective bargaining.

76
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:05,248
Let's calm down and sit down,
and we will discuss this.

77
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:07,392
I will explain everything
that's going on,

78
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:09,816
and we will talk it out
no matter how long it takes.

79
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,810
No, no more. This is
gonna be a very short meeting,

80
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,812
'cause only one of two things
are gonna happen:

81
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,050
Either you assure me right now
that amendment is out,

82
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:20,135
or I'm walking out that door and I'm
gonna start launching missiles.

83
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:22,455
The amendment was never intended
to stay in the bill.

84
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,450
It was just there for leverage,
that's all.

85
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,943
You threatened to cut federal funding
from union school districts?

86
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,850
That's not a poker chip, Frank.
That's a goddamn dirty bomb.

87
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:36,284
Look, the amendment
is not staying in the bill.

88
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,323
I just need you to work with me
on performance standards.

89
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:43,475
Performance standards?
Are you fucking kidding me?

90
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,346
You agreed that they were already out!
You can't just put them back in!

91
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,202
- Marty, look--
- I have a reputation to uphold!

92
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:51,763
I am the one that made the
union reps stay here for you

93
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:54,159
while you were in Gaffney playing
with your fucking Peachoid!

94
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:57,259
- Marty-- - You tell me right now!
Is that amendment in or out?

95
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:00,176
There is a middle ground here, Marty.

96
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,688
We just have to find it.

97
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,178
I take that as a no.

98
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:10,465
Okay.

99
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,999
Marty, do not start a war
you know you're gonna lose.

100
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,976
You fuck me, I fuck back.

101
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,546
Stamper!

102
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,902
Marty and I have
a good working relationship.

103
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:29,067
Or used to.
You can see he has a temper,

104
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:32,131
but I can usually cut through
that and reason with him.

105
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:34,793
But I may have pushed him
too far, which is worrisome.

106
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:37,397
Friends make the worst enemies.

107
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,915
- How'd it go?
- What did you hear?

108
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:44,618
- A lot of "fucks."
- Well, that pretty much says it.

109
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,201
Let's think this through.

110
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:48,296
We've got the D.N.C.
leadership meeting.

111
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,235
- What? - I'd say you could skip it,
but Birch just dumped it on us.

112
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,686
- When?
- It's here in 12 minutes.

113
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,721
Why here and not
the D.N.C. headquarters?

114
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,212
The D.N.C. is doing renovations.

115
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,713
They're gonna be green energy efficient.

116
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:02,089
Oh, that's a charming use
of party funds.

117
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:04,531
We've only been in this space
about three months.

118
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:05,885
It's cool.

119
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,985
Not exactly the Herald, is it?

120
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,901
Have you been to those offices?

121
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:13,268
Yes. Wrist-slitting
was in order.

122
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,095
So, who else is courting you?

123
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,931
- A few people.
- You mean everyone.

124
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:21,257
There were a lot of e-mails
this morning.

125
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,379
That's not surprising.
You're having a moment.

126
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:25,336
People are interested.
I'm one of them.

127
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:28,874
But if eight minutes passes
on anything, I get bored.

128
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:31,781
In eight minutes, I can be bored with
you, unless you keep me interested.

129
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:34,403
I think you can.

130
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:38,223
And I think this is the place for you to
keep the rest of the world interested too.

131
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:40,315
It's your call.
I won't chase you.

132
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,718
I'm definitely tempted.

133
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,818
Take as long as you want to look around.

134
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:47,478
E-mail me your figure. I'll
call you back with a counter.

135
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:54,386
This is our top priority--
Ohio,

136
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,629
Florida, and Pennsylvania.

137
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,222
We need all of them, or Walker's
a one-term president.

138
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,638
Pennsylvania is why he picked
Matthews as a running mate.

139
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,375
But now we have to find a replacement.

140
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,724
The special election is this November.

141
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,528
Patricia Whittaker,
D.N.C. chair.

142
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,195
A rare example of someone
whose head is in the game

143
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,012
instead of up their backside.

144
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:15,444
Competence is such
an exotic bird in these woods

145
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,565
that I appreciate it whenever I see it.

146
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,566
This also affects the house.

147
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,653
The new governor
will oversee redistricting.

148
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:24,507
We lose seats here, that means we could
lose our majority in Washington.

149
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,811
Well, the R.N.C. is backing Jack Swofford,
ex-Mayor of Pittsburgh.

150
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,490
He's got statewide name recognition
and campaign machinery in place.

151
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:34,564
It's been three months,
and we don't have dick.

152
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:36,372
What about the A.G.?
Ben Pluckett?

153
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:39,060
No. Ben's got his eyes
set on the senate in '14.

154
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:42,327
Which he'll lose because he botched
a sex offender sting last year.

155
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,600
- There's always McHolland.
- He's 78.

156
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:47,065
When's the last time he held
office, when Carter was president?

157
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,015
Reagan, but same difference.

158
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,890
He has dignity, he has gravitas.

159
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:53,022
If you need someone
to fill Matthews' shoes--

160
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,576
You can't fill Jim Matthews'
shoes, so we shouldn't even try.

161
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:59,017
- We need a fresh face.
- The state has a weak bench.

162
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:01,542
Let's go through all the
sitting Congressmen one by one

163
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,021
and see if anybody sticks out
from the crowd.

164
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:04,864
All right.
I got the list right here.

165
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:06,487
Okay. Go ahead.

166
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,624
Pennsylvania's first district,
Peter Russo.

167
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:11,603
Cross him off. He's no good.
No experience, no chops.

168
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:14,523
Okay, moving on. Second
district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

169
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:17,742
Nah, Gwen's too controversial.
Very vocal on abortion.

170
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,846
- And Caroline?
- She's good.

171
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,846
- And the boys?
- All fucking four of 'em?

172
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,060
You feed 'em.

173
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,740
You got any pictures on your phone?

174
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:29,281
Come on. Let's cut the shit,
Pete, will ya?

175
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,106
What are we gonna do about the shipyard?

176
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:37,305
BRAC had their hearing.
They slated it for closing.

177
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,622
Yeah, and why didn't you testify?

178
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,958
We're talking 12,000 jobs here.

179
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:44,464
My hands were tied, Paul.
People wanted it closed.

180
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:46,414
- I was under a lot of pressure.
- From who?

181
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,588
People high up the food chain.

182
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:51,225
- There was nothing I could do.
- That's bullshit!

183
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,171
You go back to BRAC.
You talk to the D.O.D.

184
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,431
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy.
You do something.

185
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:56,917
It's not gonna happen.

186
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,441
- Okay. Why not?
- I told you. It's political.

187
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:02,924
So I'm supposed to go back to the shipbuilders'
association and say what now exactly?

188
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:06,207
That they're out of work because
Pete Russo's playing politics?

189
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,481
I mean, Jesus, Pete.

190
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,529
We're the ones who got you fucking
elected in the first place.

191
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:16,213
Now you're gonna turn your back on us?

192
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:18,382
You should go.

193
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,412
Seriously?

194
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:27,038
I just got here.
You're kicking me out now?

195
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:30,275
Hey, I'm fucking talking to you!

196
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:34,054
I thought we grew up together.

197
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:38,697
But this guy
sitting behind his big desk...

198
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:42,092
I don't even know who the fuck he is.

199
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:47,088
Where's the Pete Russo who knew how to throw
a punch when his back was against the wall?

200
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:50,731
That guy was my friend.

201
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,845
Every teacher in the country
a month before school ends?

202
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:06,904
Doesn't need all of them.
15, 20 states, that's all.

203
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,181
The A.F.T. and the N.E.A.
can't agree on anything.

204
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:11,403
You underestimate Marty Spinella.

205
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:15,867
So which one do we target?

206
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:18,024
We have a better chance
with the N.E.A.

207
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,150
You think Chuck Sloan will bite?

208
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:22,916
Cooperate-- we'll give your people
protection and a place at the banquet.

209
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,754
Fight us, we break you. He'll bite.
Get him on the phone.

210
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,355
It's after 2:00.

211
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,748
Spinella is potentially mobilizing

212
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,872
the largest teachers' strike
in United States history.

213
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:35,010
- Nobody's sleeping.
- I'll call him right now.

214
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:38,128
I'm sorry.
Are we being too loud?

215
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,831
A little.

216
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,967
- What are you working on?
- The gala.

217
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,863
There's so much to do.

218
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,527
- Did Nancy send you my list?
- She did.

219
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:52,239
- What'd you think?
- It's a good list.

220
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,626
Thanks for inviting them.

221
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,114
Is something wrong?

222
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:04,265
It's still not anywhere near
what Remy brought to the table.

223
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,752
Sancorp offered 1.5 million,
Francis.

224
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:11,406
I'm adding up the numbers, and
we're only at half a million.

225
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,672
- I got Chuck on the phone.
- In a minute.

226
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:16,947
- I can make more calls.
- Enough to raise a million-five?

227
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:18,581
I can at least get us closer.

228
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:22,417
I'm going to bed.

229
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,763
Don't move any of this around.

230
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:30,110
Claire, we made the decision
to turn Remy down.

231
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,915
No one forced you.
I thought we were okay on this.

232
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,580
You're right.

233
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,097
Good night, Francis.

234
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:25,132
This is Adam. Leave a message.

235
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:27,593
Hi, Adam. It's me.
I know it's late,

236
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:31,588
but, well, I was really just calling

237
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,932
to thank you again for the photographs.

238
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:37,369
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

239
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,824
I hope you're well.

240
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:48,395
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

241
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:51,809
I hope you're well.

242
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:11,400
Right this way,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

243
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,506
He's here.

244
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:22,237
Good afternoon, Tom.

245
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:27,889
Legal?

246
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:31,173
Did you say it, or didn't you?

247
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:37,542
To you and to anyone who asks,
yes, I did.

248
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,373
Do we really need them?

249
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,380
Not unless I should expect a fight.

250
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,040
You shouldn't.

251
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,665
Give us a few moments.

252
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:03,617
It's not what you called her, it's
that you let her leave the building.

253
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:05,954
I know how to run a paper, Margaret.

254
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,908
What I don't know how to do is run a paper
staffed with people I can't control.

255
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,827
Was she really out of control?

256
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:15,322
To my understanding, she simply
turned down a new position.

257
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:18,059
It's her attitude.
It's the way she turned it down.

258
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:20,556
Did you think to ask her
what she'd rather do instead?

259
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:23,816
- Is it my job to pander to all my employees--
- My employees.

260
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:29,766
And if they have something to offer
that you don't, yes, it is your job.

261
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,130
We've been through this, Tom.

262
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:33,526
The paper's operating at a loss.

263
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:34,798
We need people like Zoe.

264
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,432
I'm very aware

265
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:38,526
of how much we're hurting, Margaret.

266
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,868
Staff reductions, dip in circulation.

267
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,438
Each one of those faces

268
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,022
and every subscriber we lose,

269
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,607
they keep me awake at night.

270
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:48,939
Now, I won't argue
the business side of things.

271
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:51,426
It's neither my place
nor my area of expertise,

272
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,843
but know this--

273
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,967
Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs,

274
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,732
enriched media,

275
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:02,975
they're all surface.

276
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,716
They're fads.

277
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,936
They aren't the foundation
this paper was built on,

278
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,085
and they aren't what will keep it alive.

279
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:12,277
We have a core readership

280
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,572
that thirsts for hard news.

281
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:20,574
Those are the people I work
80 hours a week for.

282
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:23,673
And I won't be distracted
by what's fashionable.

283
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,797
That's your resignation letter.

284
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:38,249
Hand it to the lawyers on the way out.

285
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:40,489
I'll give you some privacy.

286
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:45,585
No, no, stay.
It'll be quick.

287
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,656
We'll get a drink.

288
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,695
We're going to launch
right here in Washington.

289
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,356
We'll see how Congress likes it

290
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,513
when the streets are teaming

291
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,192
with unsupervised school kids.

292
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,797
Then we'll phase out
the rest of the country.

293
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:02,105
Everybody hold on for one minute.

294
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,143
What's up?

295
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:04,868
The N.E.A. is out.

296
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:06,024
- Hang on.
- What?

297
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,277
They pulled out.

298
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,315
Why?

299
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,658
He wouldn't say.

300
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:13,250
Hold on for one more minute.

301
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,961
Chuck Sloan-- get him
on the phone right now.

302
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:16,161
I've got him right here.

303
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:17,752
- Is he muted?
- Yes.

304
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:24,770
Hey, Chuck.
It's Marty.

305
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,753
Listen, you can't do this.

306
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,354
If we don't stay united now,
we don't have a--

307
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,366
You hired me to represent
your interests, right?

308
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,622
How can I possibly lobby
for the teachers

309
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:37,066
when Congress sees us splintering

310
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,999
before we even put up
a unite--

311
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:41,928
All right.

312
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:45,252
Did Underwood get to you?

313
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:48,363
Whoa, Frank is dishonest
and manipulative.

314
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,171
You've seen that he's lied
to us already.

315
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,092
Wait-whoa-whoa-whoa, Chuck,
Ch-Ch-Chuck?

316
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,407
Chuck!

317
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:56,825
Son of a bitch!

318
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:01,448
- Where are you?
- I'm at the office.

319
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:02,801
- False.
- You don't believe me?

320
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,158
- Not for a second.
- Where are you?

321
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:07,451
- About to walk into a meeting.
- With who?

322
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:08,978
Someone I have to punish.

323
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,289
- Give me a name.
- No name.

324
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,242
What did this person do wrong?

325
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:14,648
Lie to me.

326
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,748
How will you punish him?

327
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,670
What makes you think it's a him?

328
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:24,966
Hold on.
I have to take this.

329
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,159
Where are you?

330
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:29,751
Me?
I am not at the office.

331
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,885
You're going to give me
a new one of these every week?

332
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,302
Well, I--

333
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,400
I can't continue to--

334
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:41,889
Not without protection.

335
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:44,372
Nobody tells me when to work
and when to play.

336
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,961
I'm not being unreasonable, Zoe.

337
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:50,002
If you can't trust me,
we should be doing this at all.

338
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:57,267
Well, then, how do we
establish our trust?

339
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,211
I have been very discreet.

340
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:01,044
Oh, professional discretion, yes,

341
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:04,667
but this is new territory.

342
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,791
You have a camera on your phone.

343
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:20,501
Pictures...

344
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:23,061
The kind I wouldn't want
my father to see.

345
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,592
Well, I'm going to need more than that.

346
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:56,818
Lie back.

347
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,870
Use your imagination.

348
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:14,680
I want everything packed for tomorrow.

349
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:17,443
- We checked already, dad.
- Oh, did you?

350
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,387
Those are my pink Nikes
on the kitchen counter?

351
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:22,497
And you, Autobot, what is Optimus
Prime doing under my bed?

352
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:24,263
He better transform himself

353
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,887
into your backpack before you
have to leave tomorrow.

354
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,510
Hey, dad?

355
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:34,168
Is Christina coming back?

356
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:37,391
Um, I don't think so, buddy.
No.

357
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,410
Oh, I liked her.

358
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,498
Me, too.
She's cool.

359
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:44,392
Yeah, she is cool.

360
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,505
And you guys gotta brush your teeth

361
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,142
and then check the rooms again,

362
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:50,791
and then it's time for bed.

363
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,331
Got it, pumpkins?

364
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,537
Dad, you know I hate it
when you call us pumpkins.

365
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:58,608
Go before I turn you into a pie.

366
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,515
Peter Russo.

367
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,529
He's a drunk.

368
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:19,091
He is at the moment,
a very functional one.

369
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:20,613
Imagine if he was sober.

370
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:22,455
Even so, you run him for governor,

371
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,035
people are going to dig into his past.

372
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:26,515
Well, we turn that into
an asset, not a liability.

373
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:29,913
Here's who I was.
Here's who I am now.

374
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,758
You saw how they dismissed him
in three seconds

375
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:32,996
at the leadership meeting.

376
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,972
Patty Whittaker
is very open-minded,

377
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:37,157
and I am very persuasive.

378
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,392
You think Russo even wants it?

379
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:43,741
Any kid who's made it
from the streets of South Philly

380
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:46,034
to the Capitol Rotunda is ambitious.

381
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:47,603
We just need to tap into that,

382
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,231
surround him with the best people

383
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:51,540
and then build the machine
and push the go button.

384
00:22:51,644 --> 00:22:53,282
So you think he could win.

385
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:56,335
I think he can be a contender.

386
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:01,146
Okay, let's say we pull off
a miracle and he wins.

387
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,789
What do we gain by it?

388
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:05,396
Isn't it better to be holding
the reins in this race

389
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,129
than watching from the stands?

390
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,455
You wife is on the phone.

391
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,472
Put her through in here.

392
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,176
I understand that Pennsylvania's
important for redistricting--

393
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,909
No, no, no, this isn't just
about this race, Doug.

394
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:16,811
Expand your thinking.

395
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:21,712
Who else is from Pennsylvania?

396
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,184
No, no, no, not in Congress.

397
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,639
The executive branch.

398
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:28,727
The vice president.

399
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:33,985
Hello, my dear. Nancy had my tux
dry-cleaned so I won't embarrass--

400
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,662
The Cotesworth cancelled on us.

401
00:23:38,137 --> 00:23:39,875
I'm leaving right now.
I'll come get you.

402
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,944
I've got to go.

403
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,115
What's going on?

404
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,582
The hotel, for tonight's gala.

405
00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:46,491
They refused to let Claire
into the ballroom

406
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:49,879
because their employees are union.

407
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:51,170
Spinella.

408
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,592
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants,

409
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:54,308
but to go after my wife?

410
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:56,785
No class.
Meet me at the Cotesworth.

411
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:58,524
You got it.

412
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:01,819
Why can't we just move it
to another place?

413
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,442
I looked into that.
Everything's booked.

414
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:05,324
You have to reserve these
things weeks in advance.

415
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:07,798
I've got Stamper online looking
for another venue somewhere.

416
00:24:07,902 --> 00:24:10,173
Francis, the delivery trucks
are already at the Cotesworth.

417
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:12,594
I can't have people showing
up at a different place

418
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:14,076
in case they don't get the email.

419
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,663
This is my fault.
I feel awful.

420
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,120
There's a half a million
on the line here.

421
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:18,963
I realize that.

422
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:20,672
And I can't keep having my work

423
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,125
take these hits on behalf of yours.

424
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,095
It's more than just an inconvenience.

425
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,455
I know.
We'll solve it.

426
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,876
- Hey, I just got your email.
- What did you think?

427
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:38,417
You don't have to send me
things before you post.

428
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:40,237
Oh, I thought you might want
to take a look.

429
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:41,648
The goal here is
for everyone to post things

430
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,449
faster than I have
a chance to read them.

431
00:24:43,553 --> 00:24:46,351
If you're satisfied with the
article, just put it up.

432
00:24:46,455 --> 00:24:48,845
- Okay.
- Are you satisfied?

433
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,942
I think so.

434
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:51,750
Okay, you are or you aren't.

435
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:54,183
Whatever hoops the Herald made
you jump through--

436
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:56,090
- I know.
- ...Let them go.

437
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,307
It's okay to be opinionated, Zoe,

438
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:00,817
and it's okay to go outside
to get your hands dirty.

439
00:25:00,922 --> 00:25:03,747
You're no longer tied to a desk.

440
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:04,962
Or that pillow, for that matter.

441
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:06,384
I'm not going to post it.

442
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,228
Midterm predictions--
they're not news.

443
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:09,339
They're bullshit.

444
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:10,977
Well, I agree.

445
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,474
I can do better.

446
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,148
I think you can.

447
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:18,036
Feel free to blow my mind.

448
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:29,311
If we do this event,
the whole staff walks out.

449
00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:31,002
I've got 300 guests--

450
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,179
You signed a contract with my wife.

451
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,838
We'll refund your wife's organization

452
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:36,804
and pay for whatever the costs
of moving the event

453
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:38,767
to a more appropriate venue.

454
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,493
And we would have to refund a half
a million dollars in donations.

455
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:43,138
Can you pay for that, too?

456
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:45,362
Because I'm pretty sure there's
cause for damages here.

457
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:47,615
I truly apologize, sir.

458
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,099
Who's your boss?

459
00:25:49,203 --> 00:25:50,645
I spoke with the owners,

460
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,359
and they authorized me to do
what I think is best.

461
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,453
And do they realize
that they are shutting the door

462
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:57,007
on 41 members
of the United States Congress?

463
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,253
Yes, sir, they do.

464
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,634
I had to make a very hard judgment call.

465
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:03,926
Well, I seriously question
your judgment.

466
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,094
You know, word travels fast
in this town.

467
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,475
All those luncheons
and conventions and dinners.

468
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,192
It's going to be a shame to
lose all that work. Isn't it?

469
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:13,650
Congressman, you are absolutely right,

470
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:15,215
but if my staff walks out,
I--

471
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,633
Please understand
the predicament I'm in.

472
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:19,838
I got an idea.

473
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:21,473
I know what we're going to do.

474
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:24,592
Honey, they're not going
to let us have it inside.

475
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:27,166
We're going to have it right here
on their front steps, picnic style.

476
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:28,475
What do you need from me?

477
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:30,109
I need your manpower.

478
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,430
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

479
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,174
Okay, everybody, stop what
you're doing, and listen up.

480
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:42,121
Yeah.

481
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,184
Oh, hey, Frank.

482
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,043
- How soon?
- About three hours.

483
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:52,145
- How many people we talking?
- Just 300.

484
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:54,271
The florist is going to send
over whatever he has.

485
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,462
Great.

486
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,055
Francis, where are we with food?

487
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,768
I've got hotdogs, pizzas,
and soul food coming,

488
00:26:58,872 --> 00:27:00,138
maybe something else.

489
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,983
Girls, here's what I want.

490
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,755
I want four bars, two on each level.

491
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:07,338
The food can go there.
The silent auction goes here.

492
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:09,583
Oh, and cancel the string quartet.
Let's get a DJ.

493
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:10,728
Doug, how are we on booze?

494
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,110
- Kegs are on the way now.
- Great.

495
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,998
Oh, and call Denise at the office

496
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:16,684
and have her bring every
donation envelope she can find.

497
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:19,680
Okay, messages, people.

498
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:24,333
Congressman Russo's office.

499
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:27,284
Yes, can you hold one minute?
Thank you.

500
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:29,183
Congressman, people keep
calling about the shipyards.

501
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:30,675
We don't know what to tell them.

502
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,050
We just say we'll give you the message.

503
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:33,682
- Keep saying that.
- Here they are,

504
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,350
the messages and all the emails
we've gotten, too.

505
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,584
You want me to--
Have a good night.

506
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:41,764
Who did we reach?

507
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,082
Herald, The Times, USA Today.

508
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:46,333
All right, I want affiliate
stations and cable news.

509
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:47,606
I want satellite trucks out there.

510
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,730
I want this on live TV.

511
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,069
Okay, I'm on it.

512
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:51,488
You can't do this here.

513
00:27:51,593 --> 00:27:54,953
Zoe, 8:00 P.M. tonight,
Hotel Cotesworth.

514
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:57,392
Benefit for my wife's charity.

515
00:27:57,496 --> 00:28:01,260
No, wash your face
and let your hair down.

516
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:02,882
This is work and play.

517
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:04,464
See you.

518
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:07,136
I can tell you right now
I'm going to need two dozen.

519
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:15,155
Paul, I'm going to need those
by tomorrow, okay?

520
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:17,922
Your guests are your problem,
not mine, Julian.

521
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:21,059
I'll close the gate.

522
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:22,653
You know, I'm no expert in fire code,

523
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:24,662
but I would imagine that
locking your guests in

524
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:27,049
is a bigger violation than
having them walk around us.

525
00:28:27,154 --> 00:28:29,683
This is trespassing on private property.

526
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:30,905
You're breaking the law.

527
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,018
Right, okay.

528
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:36,997
Let me get Barney Hull
on the phone here for you.

529
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:40,132
Here you go.

530
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:41,248
It's ringing.

531
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,630
Who's Barney Hull?

532
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,516
The police commissioner.

533
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,480
No? Okay.

534
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:48,270
You'd rather talk to him
in person, that's great.

535
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,638
He's coming to the party.

536
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:51,653
I'll be sure to introduce him to you.

537
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,532
Thanks for your hospitality.

538
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,194
Bar comes over here.

539
00:28:58,299 --> 00:28:59,776
Put all that booze that way.

540
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:06,630
What do you want me to do?

541
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:09,439
I can't lock the gates, and they've
got the police on their side.

542
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:12,064
Unbelievable.
Hold on.

543
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,371
Cassandra,

544
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:14,536
I need 200 teachers

545
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,940
at the Cotesworth Hotel right now.

546
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:18,252
I need a full picket.

547
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,800
200? I don't know
if we can get that--

548
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:21,642
I don't want to hear it.
Just get it done.

549
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:23,434
I don't give a fuck if they're
teachers or not, frankly.

550
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:25,058
Just get me 200 bodies.

551
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:27,069
You know, call the teamsters.
Maybe they'll help us.

552
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,773
We'll give them glasses if we have to.

553
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:29,929
Tell the guys to look smart.

554
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,523
Charlie, get off the phone.

555
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:33,662
I need signs right now,
at least a hundred.

556
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:35,364
You know what?
Let them set it up.

557
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:37,202
It's actually better for us that way.

558
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:38,995
This way they can't hide from us.

559
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:41,313
You've put me in a terrible situation.

560
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,001
Oh, you did?

561
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:46,319
...British accent.

562
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,698
Thank you very much for all your help.

563
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,225
Much appreciated.

564
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,811
Here, we got
the signs right here.

565
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:06,268
Let's hand them out fast.

566
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,879
Everybody single file
right down the street.

567
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:13,006
This way, that way.
Okay?

568
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:21,722
Well, at least he spelled it right.

569
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:24,334
Teachers protesting

570
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:26,132
the education reform and achievement act

571
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:28,521
have descended upon the Hotel Cotesworth

572
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,784
in Washington, D.C.

573
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:32,709
Union lobbyist Martin Spinella

574
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:34,091
organized the demonstration.

575
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:36,234
Teachers deserve respect!

576
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:37,979
Teachers deserve respect!

577
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:46,401
Now, I knew you'd show up.

578
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,795
You bring that beautiful wife
of yours? Hello...

579
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,236
Pleasure.
Thank you for coming.

580
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,504
Come on in.
The drinks are on the house.

581
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:55,397
Felicity.

582
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:58,360
Spinella got us shut out by the union,

583
00:30:58,464 --> 00:31:00,511
so we had to have the party
out here on the steps.

584
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:02,383
I'll take you up to a bar right now.

585
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:03,578
Thank you for coming.

586
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:05,597
Thank you. Welcome.

587
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:07,693
Teachers, yes!
Unions, yes!

588
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,162
Hi. Great.

589
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:04,754
Thanks again so much for coming.

590
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,762
Adam's here.

591
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:15,968
You came.

592
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:19,790
Looks wonderful.

593
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,513
You're going to have to move over,

594
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:24,756
because I have to serve
this wonderful couple myself.

595
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,263
This is fabulous.

596
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,147
Only Claire could've thought of this.

597
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:30,508
I don't suppose you have
anything single-malt back there.

598
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:35,649
Frank, it's worth every penny
to see you on keg duty.

599
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,409
Well, then don't you think this is
worth just a few extra pennies?

600
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:41,250
Oh, let's break out
the checkbook, Charles.

601
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,948
Did you RSVP?

602
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:45,962
I assumed it didn't matter.

603
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:47,325
It doesn't.

604
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,150
I'm glad you're here.

605
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:52,093
When I heard your message.

606
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:55,331
You know, I shouldn't
have left that, Adam.

607
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:56,620
Why not?

608
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:01,895
Maybe we should talk at some point.

609
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:05,342
Make that check with
a lot of zeroes, won't you?

610
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:07,842
There we are.

611
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:15,575
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

612
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,709
Cheers.

613
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:20,391
I'm going to ask a huge favor
of you since you're here.

614
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:21,653
You want to put me to work.

615
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:23,331
Yes, please.

616
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:27,301
- My pleasure.
- Come.

617
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,092
So these are
some wonderful photographs

618
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:32,163
- by an amazing photographer--
- Gillian.

619
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:35,846
Adam Galloway, nice to meet you.

620
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,342
And this is the photographer himself.

621
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,193
Freddy.

622
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:46,291
I just wanted to thank you so much.

623
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:47,388
Such a success.

624
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,367
My pleasure.
My pleasure.

625
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:50,476
He's the best.

626
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:51,899
I see Adam's here.

627
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:53,531
I didn't know he was coming.

628
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,159
- Well, guess what I got.
- What?

629
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:56,956
Another check from the Holburns

630
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,795
for $60,000.

631
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,694
Come on, praise me like you should.

632
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:08,133
If Frank Underwood and
the United States Congress--

633
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:10,014
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm with Slugline.

634
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:12,488
...Dismantle the
rights of the American teacher?

635
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,503
Unions, yes!
Teachers, yes!

636
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:18,463
Hi.
Why do you protest here?

637
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:20,445
And Congress has to take this seriously.

638
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,575
We're here for the teachers.

639
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,808
We're here.

640
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,485
Thank you.
Thank you.

641
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:28,569
We're not asking for the world,

642
00:34:28,673 --> 00:34:30,849
and Congress needs to step up
and get this done.

643
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:45,978
Excuse me.

644
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:50,152
That dress looks familiar.

645
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:52,871
It's the one I wore to the symphony.

646
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,773
Oh, yes, mutual admiration society.

647
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:56,736
That's right.

648
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,951
So what do you have for me?

649
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,481
What do you mean?

650
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:02,493
Well, you're surrounded
by Washington's elite.

651
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:03,940
Are you saying you've overheard nothing

652
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,700
that could be useful to either of us?

653
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:07,239
I'm covering the protest.

654
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:09,250
The rest of the world
is covering the protest.

655
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:10,783
You may not have noticed,

656
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:12,753
but you're the only journalist
inside the party.

657
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:14,204
I've been feeding you plenty.

658
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:16,983
Information is a two-way street,
Miss Barnes.

659
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:19,396
- Hello.
- Claire, this is Zoe Barnes.

660
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,878
You met her one night at the house.

661
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:21,953
Yes, I remember.

662
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:23,720
You work for the Herald, right?

663
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:24,875
Not anymore.

664
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,299
I actually work at Slugline now.

665
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:27,548
I've heard of it.

666
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,097
You read it, don't you, Francis?

667
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:30,640
Religiously.

668
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:33,718
Well, you seem like a very
ambitious young woman.

669
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:34,888
I like that.

670
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:36,652
Doing my best.

671
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:39,085
It's good to see you again.

672
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:40,568
Please enjoy yourself.

673
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,941
I will. Thank you.

674
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:43,660
Take care, Miss Barnes.

675
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:13,985
...On the steps,

676
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,239
and she looks gorgeous,

677
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:16,831
but really she's thinking,

678
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,632
when can I go the fuck home?

679
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:25,564
- I'm off.
- Already?

680
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:28,157
I've done my duty, I believe.

681
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,551
Oh, you know me.

682
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:32,587
Always have to be the first
to leave a party.

683
00:38:32,692 --> 00:38:33,887
How much did you raise?

684
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:37,223
$750,000.

685
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:38,432
80 of that was your photographs.

686
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:39,940
Fantastic.

687
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:42,036
Write a check for 250,
we'll break a million.

688
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,935
Nice try.

689
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,749
Thank you for coming.

690
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:51,761
And everything that you did.

691
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:59,187
Call me sometime.

692
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,059
I will.

693
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:04,653
So what does a clean water gala

694
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:06,135
have to do with teachers' unions?

695
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,617
Well, we have
over 50 members of Congress

696
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,183
gathered in one place.

697
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:11,938
But the fact that
these members of Congress

698
00:39:12,044 --> 00:39:14,799
are promoting pouring money
out of the country

699
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:16,612
while neglecting their teachers at home

700
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:18,277
is precisely the problem.

701
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:21,309
But this is private money,
not public tax dollars, so...

702
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:23,077
But we're not protesting the cause.

703
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:26,319
We're protesting the Congressmen
and women themselves.

704
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:28,168
Are these even teachers picketing?

705
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:29,449
Well, sure, some of them.

706
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:30,742
And some of them
are people in--

707
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:32,888
Excuse me.

708
00:39:32,993 --> 00:39:34,376
Frank.
What are you--?

709
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:36,772
Don't take the food.
We'll feed you later.

710
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,767
Marty, you know that old saying.

711
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,257
The most dangerous spot in the world

712
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:41,844
is to come between
a teamster and free food.

713
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:44,239
Don't take the food.
We're feeding you later.

714
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,511
- I'll take it.
- She'll take it.

715
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:49,359
Who else is hungry?

716
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:52,429
- There you go.
- Pass it back.

717
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,644
Plenty more coming, guys.

718
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:57,580
I know you've all
been out here for hours.

719
00:39:57,684 --> 00:39:58,986
Thank you, Freddy.

720
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:03,514
The best ribs in D.C.

721
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:04,740
Marty, come on.

722
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:05,863
You said your piece.
You got on the news.

723
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,372
Come and enjoy yourself.

724
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:08,788
I respect you, Claire.
You know I can't do that.

725
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:10,803
Doesn't matter what side you're on.

726
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:12,081
Everybody's got to eat.

727
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:13,247
You can have a plate of ribs.

728
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:14,286
Yes, you can. Come on.

729
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:15,586
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

730
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,922
Thank you, Claire, but I cannot.

731
00:40:17,026 --> 00:40:18,384
You can do it.
Come on, Marty. Come on.

732
00:40:18,488 --> 00:40:20,015
Thank you, I can't.
Thank you. Thank you.

733
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,510
Freddy's.
You should go to Freddy's.

734
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:33,086
Several dozen union sympathizers

735
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,251
led by labor lobbyist Martin Spinella

736
00:40:35,355 --> 00:40:37,037
attempted to disrupt the gala.

737
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:38,874
They need to step up to the plate

738
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,050
and take care of our teachers
and our children.

739
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:43,857
The protest dissipated
when fundraiser attendees

740
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:45,715
offer food and drink to picketers.

741
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,763
Doesn't matter
what side you're on.

742
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:49,083
Everybody's gotta eat.

743
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:50,672
Turn it off.

744
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:53,323
It is unclear whether
the protest will continue.

745
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:55,797
What now?

746
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:05,830
Call the union leadership
and the chapter presidents.

747
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:07,657
See if they're ready
to pull the trigger.

748
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:11,452
If they are, we strike
at midnight tomorrow.

749
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,996
You were extraordinary.

750
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:42,438
Tomorrow, people who weren't there

751
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,346
are gonna lie and say they were.

752
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,772
What are you reading?

753
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,815
She can write.

754
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,936
She can.

755
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:00,156
And you can raise money.

756
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,331
Always for a good cause.

757
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:05,925
Thank you.

758
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:27,811
Wait in the car, please.

759
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:31,586
Hold on.
I know who that is.

760
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:39,581
Hello, Peter.

761
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:45,695
I am starving.
I forgot to eat.

762
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,776
Would you like something, Peter?

763
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:49,605
No. Thanks.

764
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,760
You should eat.

765
00:42:50,864 --> 00:42:52,268
Don't fight. She'll win.

766
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:53,514
I will.

767
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:55,789
Okay. Yes.

768
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:57,104
You want some coffee?

769
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:58,737
Yes. Thanks.

770
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:02,110
Do you have any children?

771
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:07,194
Two.
A son and a daughter.

772
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,962
Married?

773
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:11,734
Divorced.

774
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:13,379
What are their names, your kids?

775
00:43:13,484 --> 00:43:15,602
Um, Sarah, she's 11,

776
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:18,282
and Kevin is eight.

777
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:20,494
Do you have any pictures?

778
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:29,265
Fuck!
I lost my phone.

779
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:31,366
I--sorry. I should--
uh, I gotta go.

780
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:32,515
Peter, sit down.

781
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:34,025
You're gonna enjoy your sandwich,

782
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:36,479
have some coffee, and stay the night.

783
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:42,061
Milk and sugar?

784
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:44,941
Black.

785
00:43:45,046 --> 00:43:46,116
Some fresh towels.

786
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,200
There should be soap and toothpaste,

787
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:50,669
everything you need in the bathroom.

788
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:52,553
Thank you so much for doing this.

789
00:43:52,657 --> 00:43:55,044
Oh, it's nothing.
Sleep well.

790
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:05,976
What's going on, Peter?

791
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:11,176
Talk to me.

792
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,547
You think fresh towels changes anything?

793
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:23,575
Changes what?

794
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,468
The shipyard.

795
00:44:27,572 --> 00:44:29,474
If I was home and you pulled that shit,

796
00:44:29,578 --> 00:44:32,626
I'd beat the fuck out of you.

797
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,266
I would crack your skull
on the pavement.

798
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:37,850
That's why I came over here today,

799
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:41,267
to fuck you up for what you made me do.

800
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:43,110
I don't care how nice
you're being to me.

801
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:44,390
I don't give a shit.

802
00:44:44,494 --> 00:44:47,900
I'm gonna wake up tomorrow...

803
00:44:48,005 --> 00:44:50,489
and all these people...

804
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:59,044
all my friends...

805
00:44:59,148 --> 00:45:02,032
are still fucked.

806
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:05,195
And I'm still fucked.

807
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,257
You fucked all of us.

808
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:13,465
But I'm gonna get blamed for it.

809
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:16,929
So now I have to carry
that weight on my shoulders.

810
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:29,376
You fucked me, Frank.

811
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,821
I shouldn't have let you do it,
but I did.

812
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:53,363
Are you done now?

813
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:57,673
Get up.

814
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:04,007
- No.
- I said get up.

815
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:07,617
And follow me. Now.

816
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:25,320
Get in.

817
00:46:25,425 --> 00:46:28,126
Take off your clothes and get in.

818
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,683
Do it. Now.

819
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,983
There was a D.N.C. meeting
earlier this week.

820
00:46:52,087 --> 00:46:53,544
About the governor's race.

821
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:56,303
Your name came up
as someone we might want to run.

822
00:46:58,236 --> 00:47:00,975
Aspirin. Go ahead.

823
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:06,751
Everyone in that room wanted
to cross you off the list.

824
00:47:06,855 --> 00:47:08,398
I said no.
I stuck up for you.

825
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:11,430
I said, "Peter Russo,
he's got potential.

826
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:15,838
He's young. He's capable.
He's going places."

827
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:18,771
I made them keep you in contention.

828
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,945
You're still on that list.

829
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:25,030
You show up at my house
in the middle of the night,

830
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:29,481
drunk, to whine,
to try to shift the blame on me

831
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:31,303
instead of taking responsibility

832
00:47:31,407 --> 00:47:35,012
for yourself and your own actions.

833
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:37,788
Maybe they were right in that meeting.

834
00:47:37,892 --> 00:47:41,477
Maybe you are worthless.

835
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:46,779
I'm the only person
who believes in you, Peter,

836
00:47:46,883 --> 00:47:50,447
but maybe that's one too many.

837
00:47:50,552 --> 00:47:53,266
The hot water will open up
your capillaries.

838
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,846
The aspirin you just took
will make your blood thinner.

839
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,974
It's up to you, Peter.

840
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:02,353
Oh, and if you do decide
to take the coward's way out,

841
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,726
cut along the tracks, not across them.

842
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,468
That's a rookie mistake.

843
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:27,774
Morning.

844
00:48:27,878 --> 00:48:30,514
Morning.

845
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:31,775
You need a lift to the hill?

846
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,538
I should go home and change my clothes.

847
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:36,015
No, no, we'll drop you.

848
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,058
Want some coffee?

849
00:48:50,113 --> 00:48:51,169
Frank...

850
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:53,744
One month.

851
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,053
Hmm?

852
00:48:55,157 --> 00:48:57,730
One month sober.

853
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,258
I can give you that.

854
00:49:05,363 --> 00:49:08,170
Not for me. For you.

855
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,385
Has the seed been planted?

856
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,492
Only Peter can answer that question.

857
00:49:17,596 --> 00:49:19,514
He has a choice.

858
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:23,219
Will he wither or will he thrive?

859
00:49:23,324 --> 00:49:26,150
Only time will tell.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
