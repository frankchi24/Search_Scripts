00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:35,266
With just one week to go
before the Iowa caucuses,

3
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:40,395
the latest Gallup poll has Dunbar
ahead by six points, 45 to 39,

4
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,232
with 16 percent still undecided.

5
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:46,693
That's a lot of undecideds
so close to election day.

6
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:49,905
Dunbar has incredibly high
favorability numbers here,

7
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:53,826
much higher than President Underwood's,
but I have spoken with many Iowans

8
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,162
who have doubts
about her lack of experience

9
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:59,456
and whether she'll be able
to stand up to a Republican candidate

10
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,958
with a substantial record.

11
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,836
Even so, the fact that she's
still the frontrunner,

12
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:06,713
- having never run for office.
- It's extraordinary.

13
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:08,966
Jackie Sharp's endorsement was a big coup.

14
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:11,302
It really helped her numbers with women.

15
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:14,221
We want you to have a much more
active role during the events.

16
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,931
You'll go first, introduce the president,

17
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,433
stay with him the entire time,
and then participate in the Q and A.

18
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:21,187
I really shouldn't be answering questions.
Francis is the candidate.

19
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,064
Well, the truth is, your favorables
are double what mine are,

20
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:27,359
so let's give the people what they want.

21
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,820
- Well, if you think it will help.
- I know it will.

22
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:31,989
Do you have a speech prepared?
Do you have issue papers?

23
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:35,034
- Everything is in the conference room.
- Let's get started, then.

24
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,041
Have you had a chance
to go over the list...

25
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:43,416
of replacements for Remy?

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,670
Oh, I can't focus on that right now.
I need to get through Iowa first.

27
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:48,922
Well, I have a suggestion,
sir, that's not on the list.

28
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:51,342
- Who?
- Me.

29
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,762
Seth, you're invaluable
as a comm director.

30
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:59,016
Well, that's just it, sir.
You need a media expert at the helm.

31
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,267
We're in an election cycle.

32
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:01,977
- Everything's about perception.
- Seth--

33
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:03,937
I want to integrate the policy
and the press teams.

34
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:05,939
I want to work with cabinet members
and agency heads

35
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,984
on gearing every public statement
towards our platform.

36
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,195
Mobilize our AmWorks allies in Congress.

37
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,155
A commitment list
for futures legislations,

38
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,199
not just simple endorsements.

39
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:18,785
This outlines in detail what I would
like to do as your Chief of Staff.

40
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,122
All I ask is that you consider it.

41
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,291
Well, of course I will.
Thank you, Seth.

42
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,418
I appreciate you putting
so much time into this.

43
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,170
Thank you, sir.

44
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,385
Thank you.

45
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,636
Robert.

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,597
Sorry I'm running late.

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,473
We hit some weather
on the way back from Iowa.

48
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:42,268
I appreciate your coming here in person.

49
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:46,063
Especially during the... final rush.

50
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:48,148
- Anything for you, Robert.
- Have a seat.

51
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:49,566
Oh, thank you.

52
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,861
And, you know, it's good.
I get a few hours with the kids.

53
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:56,531
So how does it feel to be back here?

54
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,908
Oh...

55
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:01,328
I have to admit, I miss it a little.

56
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:04,915
Your dissent on Godfrey v. Kent
was brilliant, by the way.

57
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:10,503
My clerks. They wrote it.

58
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,423
Every word.

59
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,135
So it's time.

60
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:19,805
Ruth says it is,
but I knew before she said anything.

61
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:23,267
- When are you going to announce?
- Soon.

62
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,520
But I'd like you... to say yes first.

63
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,940
- To what?
- Replacing me.

64
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:35,904
This isn't the disease speaking.

65
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,449
I haven't forgotten
you're running for president.

66
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:44,330
But Underwood...
I'm sure he'd nominate you in a heartbeat.

67
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:47,374
I am the frontrunner, Robert.
Why would I drop out?

68
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,252
- Because this position's for life.
- Underwood is going to lose.

69
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:53,046
You think he'll go down easily?

70
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,050
And even if you get the nomination,
the Republicans...

71
00:04:57,134 --> 00:05:00,304
They'll... rip you apart.

72
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,599
I'm the swing vote. My seat is important.

73
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:07,727
You can make a lasting difference here.

74
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,730
That is exactly what he said.

75
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:16,611
His motivations were atrocious, yes,
but his logic was sound.

76
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:21,074
Your mind seems sharp as ever, Robert.

77
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:22,409
Except...

78
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:28,957
Except for the fact that I can't
remember your name right now.

79
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,251
Heather.

80
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:34,713
Heather.

81
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:41,220
Will you continue
to do the work I've done, Heather?

82
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:43,096
I can't.

83
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,725
If I'm honest with myself,
it's that I want this too much.

84
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,810
I didn't realize it
before I started running.

85
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:52,981
It is not that I've changed, Robert,
that ambition has clouded anything.

86
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:57,110
It is that I was blind to this until now,
what I am meant to be.

87
00:05:57,194 --> 00:06:00,364
And I am meant to be
President of the United States.

88
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:32,020
Wouldn't you all like
to hear from Claire first?

89
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:43,574
Thank you!

90
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:46,076
Francis and I so appreciate
you all coming out here

91
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,246
on such a cold day and
welcoming us with such warmth!

92
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:51,748
It's so good to be back in Iowa!

93
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:59,881
And I can feel it,
with your support and enthusiasm,

94
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,842
there is no doubt that we
are gonna take this state!

95
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,350
- Hello.
- Good evening.

96
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,560
Hi.

97
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:14,396
So pleased to have you
staying with us again, Mr. President.

98
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
We always love coming here.

99
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,567
It's our favorite house in all of Iowa.

100
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,153
- If you need anything...
- Thank you very much.

101
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:23,029
- Good night.
- Have a good evening.

102
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:36,502
You were wonderful today.

103
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:38,587
They just adore you.

104
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:41,632
Good night.

105
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,218
Good night.

106
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,166
Yes, connect me with Tom Yates, please.

107
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,545
No, I'll hold.

108
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:02,962
Mr. President?

109
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,090
Where's the rest of it?

110
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:06,841
- Have you read it?
- No, not yet.

111
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,427
Just this first chapter arrived.

112
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,346
Will you please read it first, sir?
And then let's talk.

113
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,306
Are you sick?
You sound hoarse.

114
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,183
Well, no, I'm not sick.

115
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,184
I haven't slept much.

116
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,228
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.

117
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,566
Sir?

118
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,401
Excuse me. Sir?

119
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,529
I forgot why I came in here.

120
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,030
The orange juice.

121
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,411
That'll be two twenty-five.

122
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:37,205
Yeah.

123
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:56,141
"The Fourth of July
means nothing anymore.

124
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:02,147
Overcooked hot dogs and fireworks
that always leave you disappointed.

125
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,733
Bite-size American flags made in China,

126
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:09,446
halfheartedly waved by five-year-olds
who'd rather be playing Minecraft.

127
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,743
But the third of September,
that's a date which matters.

128
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:17,746
It's the day, three decades past,

129
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:22,083
that a redneck from Gaffney
married a debutante from Dallas.

130
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,253
And the Earth's axis tilted that day,

131
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:29,132
though neither they, nor we,
knew it at the time.

132
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:36,640
Here's a woman who describes her vows as
a suicide flirting with a bridge's edge.

133
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:40,477
And a man who wears his wedding ring
as a badge of shame,

134
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,146
for the debutante deserved more.

135
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:47,734
But truly, what more could she desire?

136
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:51,988
Together, they rule
an empire without heirs.

137
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:55,492
Legacy is their only child."

138
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,083
Come in.

139
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,630
He sent you a copy, too?

140
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:14,302
I thought this was
supposed to be about you, not us.

141
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:16,262
The whole thing was a mistake.

142
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,097
We revealed too much, Francis.

143
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,890
I should've never put you
in that position.

144
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,351
I'll put an end to it.

145
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,689
- Do you think he was right?
- About what?

146
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,988
"A cold fusion of two universal elements,
identical in weight, equal in force.

147
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:38,117
United they stand.
A union like none other.

148
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:41,580
The unsplittable atom
of American politics."

149
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,499
Well, he was right about some things.

150
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,919
I should go speak to him
face to face, soften the blow.

151
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,468
She did an event
in Oelwein yesterday

152
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:58,012
and our people say you could
barely hear her with all the cheering.

153
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,264
How badly can she hurt us?

154
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:01,641
They only need a point or two
and he's in the margin of error.

155
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:02,975
So we need to attack her.

156
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,521
The UN stuff slid right off.
We need something new.

157
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,150
Let's talk to Jackie.

158
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,085
Thank you for coming.
How was your trip?

159
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:31,630
Good for me.
A little rough for my mom, though.

160
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:34,340
She's not used to seeing me
more than two days in a row.

161
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:36,008
She actually ran out of questions.

162
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:40,388
I'm jealous. Have a seat.
It's been nonstop here for me.

163
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,391
Full-time job here.

164
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:46,561
Doing surrogate appearances
for Heather in California.

165
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:49,815
We could really use you, Remy.

166
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:53,109
Ah... A recruiting session?

167
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,486
You can't be surprised.

168
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,696
I was hoping you just
wanted to see my face.

169
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,661
We can't offer you
as much as you made at Glendon Hill,

170
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:05,497
but we can offer you a lot more
than you made at the White House.

171
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:08,207
I'm not interested.

172
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:13,129
That was fast. Even for you.

173
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:16,006
- Where'd you land?
- Nowhere.

174
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,927
I'm out, Jackie. No more politics.

175
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,762
You know you don't mean that.
It's who you are.

176
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:22,722
That's what I thought, too,
for a long time.

177
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:25,308
I don't even know if I'll stay in DC.

178
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:30,730
What are you gonna do?

179
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:34,985
That's the best part.
I have no idea.

180
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:46,913
I'll save you the trouble
of trying to convince me.

181
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,250
Claire Underwood.

182
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:54,921
We need to hit her hard.

183
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:58,717
You want dirt. I don't have any.

184
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,177
You must.

185
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,850
If I did, I don't know
if I'd shovel it your way.

186
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:11,229
But I don't.
They never let me in the inner circle.

187
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:19,529
She pressed him, but nothing.

188
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:22,657
I find it hard to believe that we don't
have a single thing we can use.

189
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:24,534
Our oppo team has looked at every article,

190
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,953
every piece of footage
going back 25 years.

191
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:30,206
Researched acquaintances,
family, the works.

192
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:34,210
- If it's out there, we would've found it.
- Wait. There is one thing.

193
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,503
What?

194
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:53,396
Hello?

195
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,023
Doug. It's been a while.

196
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:57,609
- What do you want?
- The journal.

197
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,319
What would it take?

198
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:02,906
You said you would never
do that to another woman.

199
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,033
- How much?
- You're offering money?

200
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,701
If that's what you want.

201
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:11,122
Betrayal doesn't come cheap.

202
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,582
Name a figure.

203
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,091
What do you like to read?

204
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,137
Do you read?

205
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:29,682
Yes, I read.

206
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,107
Oh, thank you, Meechum.

207
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:44,447
- You hate it.
- I didn't say that.

208
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:48,118
You wouldn't fly back from Iowa
just to say, "Good job."

209
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,996
Well, look, you've only
turned in 21 pages,

210
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,999
and the book was
supposed to be finished by now.

211
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:56,918
It took me this long to figure out
what the book is really about.

212
00:15:57,002 --> 00:15:59,963
And what it's about, is the two of you.

213
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,881
We have to start over.

214
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:04,509
Start over?

215
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:07,512
The book was supposed to be
about America Works.

216
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:10,222
Now, you said you wanted
to try a different approach.

217
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:13,184
I was skeptical, but then
I went along with it and now,

218
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:17,271
you've handed over to me
the beginning of a book...

219
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:18,397
about my marriage?

220
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:21,109
Well, do you want it fast,
or do you want it right?

221
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:23,361
I told you I've never written anything
in less than a year.

222
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:26,364
Yeah, and in a month's time, you're gonna
say you've come up with some new idea.

223
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,950
No, this is it.
You and Claire. The marriage.

224
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:32,328
That's the key
that unlocks everything else.

225
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:35,331
If I had wanted an exposé
about my personal life,

226
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:38,710
I would've hired a staff writer
from Us Weekly.

227
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:48,594
Well... hold on a minute.
This is not tabloid bullshit.

228
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:51,347
You said, in this room,
you wanted an original voice.

229
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,141
I am giving it to you.

230
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:54,976
You're not narrow-minded, Mr. President.

231
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,895
I know you can appreciate
what I'm trying to do.

232
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:58,813
Right, but see,
that's the problem right there.

233
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:00,815
This is about what you're trying to do.

234
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,152
What your needs and...
what did you call it?

235
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:05,862
- Your addiction.
- That's not true.

236
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:09,741
No, it is true. I hired you to do a job,
which was to get me votes.

237
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:11,951
Yesterday, not six months from now.

238
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:14,746
Now, look, it's no big deal.
It didn't work out.

239
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,497
But I promise you,
you will be paid in full.

240
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,623
Thank you, Tom.

241
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:20,251
This deserves to be finished,
and it deserves to be read.

242
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:22,670
Well, I just happen to disagree with you.

243
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:27,092
Are you afraid of what I wrote?

244
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,301
Afraid? No.

245
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:31,012
It's just no one's business.

246
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,558
Well, you can't bury it.

247
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:39,062
I won't allow that.

248
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:56,328
You're in an intimate relationship
with Kate Baldwin, isn't that correct?

249
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:59,498
I've never said anything because
I presume that you can separate

250
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:02,210
your personal life
from our professional arrangement.

251
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:05,964
But before you start getting
any reckless ideas,

252
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:09,592
why don't you just remember one thing:
I own this material.

253
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:14,430
And if you attempt to share it with
anybody, and I mean one single word,

254
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:17,767
litigation will be
the least of your worries.

255
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,312
I mean, after all,
I don't think either of us

256
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:26,317
wants any controversy about
the authorship of your first book.

257
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:29,612
Do we?

258
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,457
Meechum, will you please
escort Mr. Yates out?

259
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,042
And good luck to you, Tom.

260
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:49,299
Too bad about the book.

261
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:52,384
- You don't really mean that.
- No, I don't.

262
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,937
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.

263
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:04,772
What was that?

264
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:07,608
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.
He says it's urgent.

265
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,703
He's on line one, sir.

266
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,044
Seth?

267
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:31,757
All right. I better stay in Washington.

268
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:33,592
Let Vaughn know.

269
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,056
Get me Claire.

270
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:40,141
You think the timing is strategic?

271
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:42,768
Well, he and Dunbar are close.

272
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:44,687
Do you have any idea
who you're going to nominate?

273
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,564
We'll go through our master list
in the morning,

274
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,274
but this'll take me
off the campaign trail.

275
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,818
I won't be in Iowa for a day or two.
You're okay to cover me?

276
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:54,030
Yes, of course.
I'll keep waving my pom-poms.

277
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:56,782
Well, you're a saint to do it without me,
but it's probably best.

278
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,993
They like you even better.

279
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:02,538
Did you speak with Tom?

280
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:06,042
I did. He didn't take it well,
but I made it very clear.

281
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:10,421
I read it again. The chapter.

282
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:12,506
Let it go. We're done with him.

283
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,385
Claire?

284
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:19,430
Sorry. Uh, the last event went quite long.

285
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:21,349
I'm fading.

286
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:23,268
Well, you get some sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

287
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,895
Okay. Good night, Francis.

288
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,855
Good night.

289
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,369
Oh. This is a nice surprise.

290
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:43,288
Now a bad time?

291
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:45,748
Not at all.
How did you get in the building?

292
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:47,959
- Nobody called me.
- The receptionist.

293
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:51,587
- Scorpio is her favorite book.
- Of course, it is.

294
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,256
What are you working on?

295
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,967
Covert operation in the Jordan Valley.

296
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,179
Your boy Underwood has refused to confirm
or deny, but take a look at that.

297
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:06,811
That's a letter
to the family of Justin Nix.

298
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:09,814
Navy SEAL who died the same day
as the covert operation.

299
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:11,774
Signed by the president.

300
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,651
Says it was a training exercise.

301
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:16,195
I just got off the phone
with a source in the DOD

302
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,990
and they said there were no
SEAL training exercises that day.

303
00:21:19,073 --> 00:21:23,077
His death is the only military KIA
reported on October eighteenth.

304
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:27,123
Am I shattering your illusions
about the guy?

305
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,750
He fired me.

306
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,877
What? Why?

307
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,465
I didn't want to e-mail it to you.

308
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:38,759
- This is it?
- The first chapter.

309
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:44,598
Justice Jacobs served our nation
with duty and distinction.

310
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:46,434
And when the Court was strongly divided,

311
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:49,103
as it was many times
during his 23 years on the bench,

312
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:54,066
it was his swing vote that created legal
precedents that will last for centuries.

313
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,820
Now, it will not be an easy seat to fill,
but fill it I must.

314
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,365
Sir.

315
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,074
Dunbar's people just reached out to me.

316
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:04,785
She's back in Washington
and she wants to meet with you.

317
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:05,995
What for?

318
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:09,790
- She wants to talk about the nomination.
- She wants to propose someone.

319
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:12,460
Yes. Herself.

320
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:17,507
Find a time.
And find somewhere discreet.

321
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,591
I don't want anyone on staff seeing her.

322
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:41,739
Good morning. I'm Claire Underwood.

323
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:45,826
Uh, I just changed her diaper.
I haven't had a chance to wash my hands.

324
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,539
Oh.
What is her name? She's beautiful.

325
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:52,375
- Kayla.
- Kayla. And what's your name?

326
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,792
- Suzie.
- Hi, Suzie.

327
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,670
Well, I just wanted to thank you
so much for your support.

328
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,714
It means so much to my husband and me.

329
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:03,302
- I don't support him.
- I saw the signs out front.

330
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:07,265
Those are my husband's.
I support Heather Dunbar.

331
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,850
When we vetted the house,
the husband was here.

332
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:13,896
Um, would you ever consider
changing your mind?

333
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:16,399
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood,

334
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:19,402
I don't really want to be
on TV or in the papers.

335
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:20,778
Oh. My apologies about that.

336
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,488
Would you mind if I just came inside?

337
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:23,781
No cameras, just me?

338
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:27,243
I guess so.

339
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,370
We need to do a sweep
of the house first, ma'am.

340
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:31,038
No. And they stay out here.

341
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:51,641
Hello, Heather.

342
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,853
How's Robert?

343
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:56,688
He's sad.

344
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:59,733
But at least he's making his exit
with grace.

345
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:03,237
Those were some very nice things you said
about him during your press conference.

346
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:06,532
Well, what was it you said to me...

347
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,827
about, uh, making things palatable?

348
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,121
- The obscene.
- Ah, yes. The obscene.

349
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:17,667
Well, it is obscene,
a mind like his losing its sharpness.

350
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,921
I didn't expect the Oval,
but this is interesting.

351
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:25,801
This is where Petrov and I
smoked cigars during the summit.

352
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:28,429
That's where he put his out on the wall.

353
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:33,017
So, Seth tells me you want the nomination.

354
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,727
No. I just said that to get in the door.

355
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:38,648
Robert thought you'd say
yes in a heartbeat

356
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,233
if it meant me dropping out of the race.

357
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:44,612
But the decision you have to make
is whether you'll drop out or not.

358
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:47,072
And why would I do that?

359
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:51,910
I know Claire lied about the abortion,
and I have the journal to prove it.

360
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm giving you an opportunity
to bow out gracefully, just like Robert.

361
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:58,250
But you have to do it before the caucus.

362
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:00,586
I'll give you three days.

363
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,923
I have no idea what you're talking about.

364
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,759
The one you asked Doug to destroy.

365
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:11,430
I wouldn't be so certain that he did it.

366
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:14,392
So...

367
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:18,604
you're finally one of us.

368
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:20,439
One of who?

369
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:25,110
The men. In their smoky back rooms.

370
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:30,908
And even if there was a journal...

371
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:33,994
you don't have it in you.

372
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,788
Make whatever assumption you want.

373
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:43,879
Well, Robert was right.
I would offer you the nomination.

374
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,424
You should take the advice of a smart man.

375
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:51,845
Three days, Mr. President.

376
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,431
Think about Claire.

377
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,058
Show me out, please.

378
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:01,647
She can go after me all she wants,
but she goes after Claire,

379
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:04,024
I'll slit her fucking throat
in broad daylight.

380
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,071
Like when he pardoned Walker,
and that other guy, the rich one.

381
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:10,864
- Raymond Tusk.
- Yeah, him.

382
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:13,367
I mean, those were bad people,
and he let them off the hook.

383
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,494
And then he says he's not running
and he does.

384
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:18,788
Well, it's a little more complicated
than the way you're putting it.

385
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:21,791
There's a lot of variables that go
into making decisions like that, and...

386
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:26,046
I can tell you I was right beside him
and he was agonizing.

387
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,797
I'm sorry. She's hungry.

388
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:30,676
I still breastfeed my girl.

389
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,766
- Go outside, please.
- Ma'am?

390
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,269
Just go outside.

391
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:45,524
- I can go out too, if you like.
- No, it's okay.

392
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:47,401
As long as you don't mind
seeing some boob.

393
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,282
Does she have any brothers or sisters?

394
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:55,200
No, this is the only one.

395
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:58,120
James and I have been trying for a while.

396
00:26:58,203 --> 00:26:59,330
Had some trouble getting pregnant.

397
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:02,249
- James is your husband?
- Yeah. He goes by Jim.

398
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,710
But I like James better.

399
00:27:05,753 --> 00:27:08,213
Well, he must trust my husband.
He's supporting him.

400
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:10,758
James doesn't know
what that word means.

401
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,594
- Trust?
- Yeah. The whole town knows it.

402
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:16,263
He runs after anything in a skirt.

403
00:27:16,347 --> 00:27:18,098
Which I don't mind so much, to be honest.

404
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:20,267
I mean, I've had a fling or two myself.

405
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:22,478
What I don't like is how he lies about it.

406
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:27,065
And then, when he asks me if I've been
with someone and I say yes, he flips out.

407
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:28,776
Like there's some kind of double standard.

408
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:31,779
I mean, he wants to dog Christy Mulligan
in the back of her brand new Escalade?

409
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:35,199
Fine. Why shouldn't I be able
to give Kyle Beckenbauer some head

410
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:38,703
for building Kayla's crib?

411
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,078
I'm sorry.

412
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:43,415
This is what happens
when you don't sleep for three months.

413
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:45,917
You two fight?
You and your husband?

414
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,379
Every married couple fights.

415
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:51,089
I mean, really fight.
Like, the cops get called.

416
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:53,634
Or they would, if he wasn't the president.

417
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:58,472
'Cause I mean, the sheriff is practically
a family member at this point.

418
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,683
Now we're fighting
about the damn election.

419
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:03,352
Like those stupid yard signs.

420
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,855
Sometimes, I wish I could just
pull up stakes and leave him.

421
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:08,273
But I can't. Why not?

422
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:10,234
Because of this little one.

423
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:15,364
Last in vitro we did, I said to myself,
if this one doesn't work, I'm outta here.

424
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:18,784
We had to double mortgage
the house to pay for it.

425
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:22,329
But it worked.
And... here I am.

426
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,252
If I was like you...
didn't have a kid...

427
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:32,715
Can I tell you a secret?

428
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,134
No mother will admit this,
but sometimes I fantasize,

429
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:38,470
like, like this pillow here...

430
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:40,681
I mean, and when Kayla was in her crib.

431
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:43,851
Two minutes.
That's all it would take, and I could go.

432
00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:46,395
And I wouldn't be stuck
to a man I want to leave,

433
00:28:46,478 --> 00:28:49,022
rubbing lotion on my nipples,
they're so raw.

434
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,108
I could start over.

435
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:58,783
Of course, I don't mean it.
I mean, I'd never to do that.

436
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,284
But... you have thoughts.

437
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:04,079
You know what, Suzie, I think
I've taken up too much of your time.

438
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:08,208
You know I'm not serious, right?

439
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:11,712
Of course.

440
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:14,381
I'm sorry. I'm just...

441
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:17,593
I'm so tired.

442
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:19,887
You're a really good listener.

443
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,389
I wish you were running for president.

444
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:25,810
Hey, you can tell them I'm
for your husband if you want.

445
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:27,185
I probably won't even caucus.

446
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:30,481
Good luck to you, Suzie.

447
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:38,489
Mrs. Underwood, did she change her mind?

448
00:29:38,572 --> 00:29:39,990
No, she stuck to her guns.

449
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:42,493
But you can't blame a woman
for having conviction.

450
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:47,372
- The president just called for you.
- I'll call him back from the car.

451
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:51,084
Listen to me. What I'm about
to say, I don't want you to panic.

452
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:53,587
What is it?

453
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:59,885
The journal.
Dunbar claims she has it.

454
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:03,597
- But how?
- I don't know.

455
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,265
It looks like it might have been Doug.

456
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:08,310
- He was supposed to--
- I know. It's hard for me to believe.

457
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:10,312
No, Francis. This can't happen.

458
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:13,231
Meechum is tracking him down now.

459
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:15,150
Sweetheart, listen to me.

460
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:16,694
No, the whole thing, it--
The whole thing--

461
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:19,488
All she did was make the threat.
That doesn't mean she actually has it.

462
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:21,740
Whatever you have to do.
Just fix it, Francis.

463
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:23,158
I will, I promise you that.

464
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,410
But in the meantime,
you have to come back here.

465
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:27,746
I need you to get to the plane.
You have to come back.

466
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,791
I don't want you there,
out on the road, if we get blindsided.

467
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,044
Claire? Claire.

468
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:39,675
I'll come home.

469
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:42,803
You go straight to the plane.
We'll say you weren't feeling well.

470
00:30:44,013 --> 00:30:45,430
Okay.

471
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:50,019
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

472
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:52,437
the courage to change the things I can,

473
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:55,232
and the wisdom to know the difference.

474
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:58,569
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.

475
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:21,383
So?

476
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:24,469
You honestly believed he'd go for this?

477
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:27,347
Yeah.

478
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:30,267
The writing is good. And it's honest.

479
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:35,105
But what candidate in their right mind
would want something like this out there?

480
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:39,150
I need you to write about it.
That he's trying to suppress this.

481
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:41,653
- What you need is sleep.
- Do this for me, Kate.

482
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:43,739
- I can't. It's a conflict of interest.
- Come on.

483
00:31:43,822 --> 00:31:46,450
The moment we slept together,
we crossed the line.

484
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:47,952
Fuck the line!

485
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:50,287
I'm not risking my reputation
because your book is dead.

486
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,206
Oh, no. Not dead.

487
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,833
I'm gonna finish it.

488
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:56,794
I'll change the names if I have to,
call it fiction.

489
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:59,046
He's the President of the United States.

490
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:01,757
- So what?
- He crushes people.

491
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,052
Let this go.
Just start something new.

492
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:08,430
"Start something new."

493
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,311
Jesus... Christ, you don't get it.

494
00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:16,313
I do it all the time.

495
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,690
My editor passes on a story,
I move on to the next one.

496
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:21,819
I'm so fucking disappointed
in you right now.

497
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:23,112
Me?

498
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:25,948
I'm the one trying to save you
from your own delusions.

499
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,449
That's exactly what he said.

500
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:29,118
Maybe he's right.

501
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:39,419
I almost felt something for you.

502
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,068
Come in.

503
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:10,742
Let me take your coat.

504
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,417
Can I get you anything?
Something to drink?

505
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,004
No. No, I'm good.
Thanks.

506
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:33,640
I appreciate the home visit,
but I'm not gonna change my mind.

507
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:35,809
No, no. I didn't think you would.

508
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,646
Something wrong?

509
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:44,401
I don't know what to do.

510
00:33:44,484 --> 00:33:46,737
I figured...

511
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,281
When I asked you to join the campaign,
I just assumed you would say yes.

512
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:52,576
That the two of us,
we would be working together.

513
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,036
And...

514
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,542
I... I...

515
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,586
I can't stop thinking about you.

516
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:06,173
You're married, Jackie.

517
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,344
For the wrong reasons.

518
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:14,056
I thought you loved each other.

519
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,933
Not like this.

520
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:20,395
I'm not the person I want to be.

521
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:24,066
You're who you need to be.
Look at what you've achieved.

522
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,943
But you did it.
You gave it all up.

523
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:28,278
In a heartbeat.

524
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,201
We're different people.

525
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,915
You should go.

526
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,211
Put this behind you.

527
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:06,108
I guess it was naive to think
that we could remain close.

528
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:14,241
So this is it?

529
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:17,869
Yeah. It is.

530
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,918
Jackie?

531
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,715
Jackie...

532
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:18,013
She says she has it.

533
00:36:18,096 --> 00:36:19,681
She doesn't.

534
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:23,268
How do I know there aren't other copies?

535
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:29,691
- Where do you keep your cigarettes?
- In the bowl up there.

536
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,414
Why didn't you destroy it
when I first asked you to?

537
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,498
I don't know.

538
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:31,336
Something stopped me.
Maybe I would need it one day.

539
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,631
For you. To prove my loyalty.

540
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:37,675
You told her.
I'd hardly call that loyalty.

541
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:41,596
I had to show her I was serious.
The journal was a way to do that.

542
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,974
I never came close
to putting it in her possession.

543
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:48,312
Anything else I should know?

544
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:51,106
I'm sober. It's been 87 days.

545
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:52,941
I meant in regards to Dunbar.

546
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,278
It is related. This is a tight race.

547
00:37:57,904 --> 00:37:59,364
Make me your Chief of Staff.

548
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:03,368
You promised.

549
00:38:03,452 --> 00:38:05,703
You promised there'd be a place
for me here when I was ready.

550
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:09,291
That was before you fell off the wagon
and walked in here with that journal.

551
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:10,667
I've made mistakes.

552
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,921
I've fallen down more than once, and
you've always been there to pick me up.

553
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:17,757
But you've been falling down
for the past year, too,

554
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:19,884
and you need someone
to pick you up this time.

555
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:23,680
It's not Remy. It's not Seth.

556
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:25,474
It's me, Frank.

557
00:38:31,146 --> 00:38:33,982
And how can I know
I can ever trust you again?

558
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:38,320
Because I just lit
two million dollars on fire.

559
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:44,742
We expect higher than usual turnout,
anywhere from 180 to 220.

560
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:48,121
The higher the turnout, the better.
We're stronger with women and students.

561
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:50,374
- We've got a GOTV--
- Excuse me, I have to take this.

562
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:54,085
- Doug?
- I have an update regarding the journal.

563
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:56,921
- What is it?
- A message from the president.

564
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,394
I have only one thing to say.

565
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:14,022
Go fuck yourself.

566
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:21,112
Christ, that felt good.

567
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:27,369
Start putting together a shortlist
of potential nominees for the court.

568
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:34,209
- You already...?
- I'm on it, sir.

569
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,099
Claire.

570
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:54,479
Want me to have them make you something
from the downstairs kitchen?

571
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:57,941
No, I ate on the plane.
Just feeling a little warm.

572
00:39:58,024 --> 00:39:59,443
It'll pass.

573
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,240
What did Doug say?

574
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,869
It's destroyed.

575
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:12,372
I watched him burn the page myself.

576
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:14,999
- What about copies?
- He says there aren't any.

577
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,543
And you trust him?

578
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:20,213
He had ample opportunity
to do us real damage and he didn't.

579
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:23,258
- But he held onto it for so long--
- I believe him, Claire.

580
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,552
I believe him.

581
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:30,181
And I'm gonna make him my Chief of Staff.

582
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:33,560
Are you out of your mind?

583
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:35,895
We need him, Claire.
We need him now more than ever.

584
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:38,982
He betrayed us, Francis!
He told Dunbar about me.

585
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:41,610
To gain her trust, not betray ours.

586
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:45,238
Look, Doug is the only person
we've ever been able to trust,

587
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:48,575
and he played this very smart.
He never put us in any real danger.

588
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:50,910
The journal is gone.
She can't do anything.

589
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:52,954
Why didn't you ask me
before you brought him back?

590
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:56,207
- Bec-- We're discussing it now.
- After you hired him!

591
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:58,251
I know this must have been
harrowing for you,

592
00:40:58,335 --> 00:40:59,919
- but listen, it is ov--
- No. I don't--

593
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:02,797
I'm starting to question
all of it, Francis.

594
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:07,885
What any of it is worth.
What... what are we doing this for?

595
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:10,347
For this house.

596
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,432
For the presidency.

597
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:16,811
Now, look, if you need to take
a few days off, that's fine.

598
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,980
You do not have to come
with me to Iowa tomorrow.

599
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,569
No. Of course, I'll be there.

600
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:39,167
Welcome back, Doug.
Congratulations.

601
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,461
- Thank you.
- I just wanted to get a heads up

602
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:43,547
on when you'd like to make
the formal announcement.

603
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,755
Let's do it after the caucus.

604
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,217
I don't want to draw any attention
away from the campaign.

605
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,927
You probably shouldn't attend
the press briefing today.

606
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,721
No. I'll take off before then.

607
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:53,348
Here, you should see this.

608
00:41:55,058 --> 00:41:57,394
This just came out ten minutes ago.

609
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:01,481
Have you shown the president?

610
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:04,734
I drafted up some talking points.
I figured you'd want to brief him.

611
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:05,902
I'll be in my office.

612
00:42:07,362 --> 00:42:08,988
Seth.

613
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:12,950
The president told me
you asked for the job.

614
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:17,372
Yeah, I didn't realize
that you were in contention.

615
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:19,416
I don't want you to resent me.

616
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,543
Hey, I'm a professional.

617
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:25,880
Let me know if you want any changes made
to the talking points.

618
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:28,091
I'm sure they're good.

619
00:42:28,174 --> 00:42:29,593
You can share 'em with the president.

620
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:32,762
You don't want to look 'em over first?

621
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:35,973
No. I trust your judgment.

622
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:50,238
I can tell you
that the shortlist is coming along,

623
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:54,701
and it is my intention to nominate someone
within the next two or three weeks.

624
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,078
It's very important
that we do this quickly,

625
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:00,248
so that the Senate has time
for their hearings.

626
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:03,167
And we shouldn't leave that seat
empty too long anyway,

627
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:04,877
while the Court is still in session.

628
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:06,588
- Mr. President?
- Sara.

629
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:09,674
Mr. President, would you comment
on Ms. Baldwin's article

630
00:43:09,758 --> 00:43:11,426
about the Jordan Valley operation?

631
00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:14,429
I think Ms. Baldwin's article is
really nothing more than speculation.

632
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:16,431
- But the evidence...
- I'm sorry?

633
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:18,725
But the evidence she presents
is convincing.

634
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:21,770
Evidence? A letter?

635
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:25,898
Unfortunately, I have to write letters
like that more often than I would like.

636
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:28,401
And I don't think it's proof
of anything more than

637
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:30,820
I reached out to the family of a young man

638
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:35,533
who sacrificed his life for our country
and for which I am eternally grateful.

639
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:36,993
Mr. President?

640
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:39,454
Well, Ms. Baldwin,
it is your article we're discussing.

641
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:42,624
I suppose I'd get hammered
if I didn't allow you to ask a question.

642
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:45,460
Thank you, Mr. President.
My question is very straightforward.

643
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:47,337
You mentioned in the letter
that Lieutenant Nix

644
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,879
died in a training exercise.

645
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,799
You signed this letter with your own hand.

646
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:53,843
Can you tell us in all honesty
that this is how he died?

647
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:57,013
I can tell you that this is exactly
what the Pentagon reported to me.

648
00:43:57,096 --> 00:44:00,308
And beyond that, it's not the policy
of this administration

649
00:44:00,391 --> 00:44:03,144
or the Department of Defense
to discuss any specifics

650
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:04,729
about any Special Forces deaths.

651
00:44:04,813 --> 00:44:05,814
May I ask one more, please?

652
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,982
I believe we're finished
with that subject now.

653
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:09,150
It's about Iowa.

654
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:11,569
Yes, all right. Go ahead.

655
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:13,154
Your wife has been doing a lot of events.

656
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:15,906
Did she resign her post
at the United Nations because you think

657
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,702
she's more valuable as a campaign
asset than an ambassador?

658
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:21,871
Claire has been doing a lot of events,
that is true,

659
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:24,290
as she has in every campaign
that I have ever run.

660
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:27,918
I'm hoping, I suppose my strategy is that
if the American people

661
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:31,214
can see that I was smart enough to
marry an extraordinary woman like Claire,

662
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:34,217
well, they might think I'm smart enough
to be President of the United States.

663
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,179
As for the ambassadorship, that was
entirely her decision, not mine.

664
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:41,224
She enjoys campaigning,
and I'm looking forward to getting back

665
00:44:41,307 --> 00:44:43,017
to Iowa with her a little later today.

666
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,061
Thank you all very much.

667
00:44:49,232 --> 00:44:50,941
We know he's
somewhere near Caracas.

668
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:52,485
I need him back.

669
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:54,278
The Venezuelans
haven't been cooperating.

670
00:44:54,362 --> 00:44:56,072
We have extradition.

671
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:57,948
Doesn't mean they'll enforce.

672
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,620
Then get me a precise location.

673
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:05,039
- Why?
- It doesn't concern you.

674
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:07,250
It does concern me.
There are a lot of people at the agency

675
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,420
who are embarrassed that he crossed
the border without us knowing.

676
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:11,920
That's not my problem.

677
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,675
Was it you? Passport lock?

678
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:19,011
The only other agency
that could've lifted it is Homeland.

679
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:22,682
- I know you have friends there.
- I have friends everywhere.

680
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:24,893
I'm not gonna help you
clean up your mess, Doug.

681
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,520
Not if you helped him escape.

682
00:45:27,604 --> 00:45:29,938
This isn't a request.

683
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm Chief of Staff to the president now.

684
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:35,278
- He hasn't announced anyone.
- He will.

685
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:40,366
And if you want my first official task
to be finding your replacement, so be it.

686
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,993
If not, you tell me where Gavin is.

687
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:53,630
I watched the press conference
this morning.

688
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:55,924
I think the Baldwin article
will blow over.

689
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,301
A non-story. No legs.

690
00:45:58,384 --> 00:46:01,304
You said it was my decision to resign.

691
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:02,680
Well, it was, wasn't it?

692
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:05,391
I mean, at least that's how
we presented it.

693
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:12,189
I spoke with a woman yesterday
in Iowa, who...

694
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:16,402
said she couldn't support us...

695
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:18,488
because she doesn't trust you.

696
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:21,282
Well, I'm not the first politician
that some people don't trust.

697
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,034
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.

698
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:26,120
Of course we have.
Imagine what the voters would think

699
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,164
if we started telling the truth.

700
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,124
Not to them.

701
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,294
To each other.

702
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:45,744
