00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:51,096
Do you renew your commitment to this
woman as your lawful wedded wife,

3
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:55,084
to love her, honor her, comfort her,

4
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:58,051
keep her in sickness and in health,

5
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:02,093
forsaking all others, be true to her,
as long as you both shall live?

6
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,035
I do.

7
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,002
Do you renew
your commitment to this man

8
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,069
as your lawful wedded husband,

9
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:14,027
to love him, honor him, comfort him,

10
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:17,015
keep him in sickness and in health,

11
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:21,095
forsaking all others, be true to him,
as long as you both shall live?

12
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,074
I do.

13
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:28,020
May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other

14
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:31,000
and strengthen your eternal bond.

15
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:48,006
ONE MONTH EARLIER

16
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,035
Francis?

17
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:57,086
No photographs when they unload his body.
Will you promise me that?

18
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:32,031
A lot of people are calling you a hero.

19
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,006
A lot of people aren't.

20
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,034
Francis, I will get this
peacekeeping resolution

21
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,047
passed through the General Assembly.

22
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:08,085
I owe you that.

23
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:16,073
So we have the photograph tomorrow
for the presidential portrait.

24
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:19,031
It's what they're gonna
base the painting on.

25
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,065
I'll be smiling. Will you?

26
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:33,066
What are they doing?

27
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:37,017
Part of a...
cultural exchange, sir, with Tibet.

28
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,004
They'll be here for a month.

29
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,046
A month?

30
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,092
Don't worry,
your handwriting's atrocious.

31
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,059
Couldn't read a thing.

32
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,013
- Tom.
- I know. Kate Baldwin.

33
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,030
I know.

34
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:27,051
Oh. Gold stars for us.

35
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:31,009
It only took two months riding
on the same plane to introduce ourselves.

36
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:32,076
Maybe I'm shy.

37
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:35,035
Oh, no, you're not.
You just don't mingle with the peasants.

38
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,081
If one of us is a peasant,
I think it's me.

39
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,041
I'm sorry I can't stay here
in Gaffney with you.

40
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:55,012
It's okay.

41
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,091
I'll see you tomorrow.

42
00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,021
Maybe tonight, if all goes well.

43
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,042
Feeling optimistic?

44
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,029
I made you a promise.

45
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,059
Well, go on.
You have a plane waiting.

46
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:13,072
Thank you.

47
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:18,056
Tom.

48
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:41,016
The Republicans are introducing
a bill that amends the Stafford Act.

49
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,083
They say that the siphoning
of FEMA funds for America Works

50
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:45,096
- violates the appropriation.
- So let them.

51
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,088
It's got bipartisan support.

52
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:49,092
Dunbar's going to publicly
support the bill.

53
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,097
- What about Jackie?
- She's trying to stay out of it,

54
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,030
but if it goes to a vote,
she's gotta go with the tide.

55
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,039
We don't want her poll numbers to take
a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.

56
00:06:57,047 --> 00:07:00,081
If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.
If they override, I'll refuse to enforce.

57
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:03,048
By the time it gets to the Supreme Court,
we'll have jobs to show,

58
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,044
they'll have nothing but rhetoric.
This is a public relations battle,

59
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,007
- not a legal one.
- Statement?

60
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,015
Just what I just said, less combative.

61
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:13,045
So, how do we want to do this?

62
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,091
I think the First Lady should sit.
You behind her.

63
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,087
Does that work for you,
Mrs. Underwood?

64
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:20,029
Uh, yes, whatever works best.

65
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:22,091
Let me adjust the light for her,
and then I'll place you, sir.

66
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:27,046
The African bloc just added a provision
to the peacekeeping resolution.

67
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,013
What does it say?

68
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:33,013
Requires African command of the forces.
It's a poison pill, Francis.

69
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:36,093
There's no way Israel or Palestine
will get on board with that.

70
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:38,076
You think the Russians are behind it?

71
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:41,072
Probably. Cathy and I are investigating.

72
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:44,052
All right, Mr. President.
Just behind your wife, please.

73
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,086
Do you prefer I not?

74
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:53,099
What?

75
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,082
Where you had your hand is perfect.

76
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,078
Great. All right.
Here we go.

77
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,071
A little more of a smile, please.

78
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,034
Come in.

79
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:19,051
Any luck today?

80
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,093
Moryakov... says it wasn't them.

81
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:26,002
Not that I trust him.

82
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:31,040
So now I just need to see
if I can get Zimbabwe to talk.

83
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:38,020
Today, when we took the photo...

84
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,087
I touched your shoulder.

85
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:44,079
Yes?

86
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:47,066
You flinched.

87
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,038
- What?
- I felt it.

88
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,046
No, I didn't.

89
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:56,063
It was like...

90
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,014
you recoiled.

91
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,048
I think you're reading
too much into something

92
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:09,019
that I don't think actually happened.

93
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,090
All right. Forget I said anything.

94
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,053
Wait.

95
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,032
I just...

96
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:25,087
Never mind.
I don't know what I was gonna say.

97
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,088
Good night.

98
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:29,085
House must've been somewhere out there.

99
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:33,027
Well, if you can call it a house.
It was no bigger than that truck.

100
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:37,040
Nothing left of the farm,
which is for the best.

101
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,040
Peaches didn't want to grow here anyway.

102
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,066
That's what you get for planting on land

103
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:46,095
with solid rock
two feet below the topsoil.

104
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:49,062
You know, that's one of the points
that we should make in the book,

105
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,054
that hard work is only worth it
in the right conditions.

106
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:56,021
We want to set people up for success.

107
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,080
Vocational training,
legitimate career paths.

108
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,056
Welcome back. How was Gaffney?

109
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:12,010
Do we have a time set
for Ambassador Caspi yet?

110
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,094
Her office is stalling.

111
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:15,085
Get her schedule.
We'll go wherever she is.

112
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:17,094
I think she'll be
at the cocktail reception tonight

113
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:20,053
- at the Mexican Consulate.
- I'll call and find out.

114
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,007
What's that?

115
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,086
It came in for you this morning.

116
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:26,024
Francis?

117
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,074
John Pasternak.
Michael Corrigan's husband.

118
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:32,012
The latest pile of interview requests
is on your desk,

119
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,016
most of them Corrigan related.

120
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:37,088
And GLAAD wants you to be a keynote
speaker at their Media Awards Ceremony.

121
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,030
How did he know?

122
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:41,059
About your vows?
It's been in the news.

123
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,047
No, that I liked tulips.

124
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:55,077
- Did your mother work?
- As a maid, mostly.

125
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:58,002
- In high demand, because she was white.
- Mm-hm.

126
00:11:58,011 --> 00:12:01,086
People assumed she wouldn't steal
any valuables, but of course she did.

127
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:03,082
Uh-huh.

128
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:08,037
I remember one night, she came home
with two sapphire earrings.

129
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:11,020
She took them to the pawn shop
in Spartanburg the next day,

130
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,037
but she wore them all night long,
even slept in them.

131
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:18,058
I guess she wanted to know
what it felt like to have real jewelry,

132
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,059
even if it was just for a few hours.

133
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,076
That does not go in the book.

134
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:27,034
Why didn't your parents
have any more kids?

135
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:28,097
That's not relevant to what we're doing.

136
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,081
I'm just trying to get a sense
of your family.

137
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,006
The barn must've been
somewhere right over there.

138
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:36,085
My father used to escape
in there to get away from us.

139
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,090
Usually brought a bottle with him.

140
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:40,077
Did you love your father?

141
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:43,015
He was a good man, down deep.

142
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,082
He cared for us greatly.

143
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,090
Worked hard to put food on the table.

144
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,091
Didn't always succeed,
but that wasn't for a lack of trying.

145
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:52,070
See... that's not an answer.

146
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,008
I asked you if you loved your father,
you don't tell me.

147
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:58,042
You tell me what you want me to write.

148
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,084
Which is what you've done
since the beginning.

149
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:02,088
It's time to start telling the truth.

150
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:05,038
- You think I've been lying?
- I know you have.

151
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:09,047
The only time you haven't
is that one night in the White House.

152
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,022
The worst adventure
I've ever been on. I can promise you...

153
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,077
- I don't get it.
- The game is unwinnable.

154
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,048
- What is the point?
- That is the point.

155
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:23,002
I find it unlikely that we'll ever
progress by starting over and over again.

156
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,015
- But it's got to be better than this.
- Oh, God.

157
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:27,019
Okay, let's give it a shot. Why not?

158
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,041
- Something was very clear.
- It just started over again.

159
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,053
It keeps doing that over and over.

160
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,016
Ignore his instructions,
he sends you back.

161
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,033
What if I follow his instructions?

162
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,079
- Hm... Chaos takes over. Randomness.
- Ah.

163
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:44,080
It's impossible to follow the rules.

164
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:47,055
Another time.
It's too much like my real life.

165
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:49,047
Mm...

166
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:53,051
Besides, we shouldn't be playing games.
You should be asking me questions.

167
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,022
You're getting me drunk.

168
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:58,081
- I won't remember what I asked.
- Mm...

169
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:03,073
The last time I got this drunk,
I broke into a library.

170
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:06,073
- In Charleston, my alma mater.
- Hm...

171
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:08,049
The Sentinel.

172
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,099
I almost puked all over myself.

173
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:12,082
That's Chapter Eight:
"POTUS Blows Chunks."

174
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:18,066
Can you keep it down, please?

175
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:22,012
- Come join us.
- So sorry.

176
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,046
- I was asleep.
- Oh. We'll...

177
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:26,059
- We'll move into the study.
- Thank you.

178
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:47,027
Francis?

179
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:50,019
I'll be right there in a minute.

180
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:55,003
I don't like him being up here.

181
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,083
We'll be more quiet.

182
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:59,095
This is our private space.

183
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:03,025
- He's my guest.
- He's a stranger.

184
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:08,080
All right. After tonight, no more.

185
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,076
I'm not being unreasonable.

186
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,010
I should've...

187
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,093
realized how much noise we were making.

188
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,044
Can I ask you a question?

189
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,032
Well, that's what you're here for,
isn't it?

190
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,082
Why don't you sleep in the same room?

191
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,017
Uh, that just sorta happened over...

192
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:48,029
a few months after we moved in here.

193
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,092
Everything okay?

194
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,030
Between you two?

195
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,059
Oh, you bet.

196
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,039
Well, it's been better.

197
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,023
No, it's not okay.

198
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:09,090
The fight.
Coming back from Moscow.

199
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,049
You heard us?

200
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,078
The yelling. Not what you said.

201
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:19,012
Hm...

202
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:22,066
We don't fight often, but, uh...

203
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:30,004
This one...

204
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,042
scabs keep coming off.

205
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:35,093
Hm.

206
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:39,026
We said things.

207
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:44,093
Things you just can't take back.

208
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:50,036
It's late. We should call it a night.

209
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:05,000
Thomas.

210
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:11,038
I have no interest in salaciousness.

211
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,014
August fourteenth
is the anniversary of the New Deal.

212
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,048
- I'd like to hit 20,000 by that date.
- I believe we can do that, sir.

213
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:29,073
Remy, what's the timeline
on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds?

214
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,069
The Leg office predicts the Senate
version will pass in two to three weeks.

215
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:35,078
Working with friendlies in the House.
Throw some pork on it, slow it down.

216
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,099
That's all the more reason
that we need to accelerate.

217
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,049
If I'm gonna veto this bill,

218
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:43,024
I want it to be because
it's gonna kill 50,000 new jobs.

219
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:45,020
- Jobs that we created.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,041
Cathy?

221
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,037
The Russians remain intransigent
on the Jordan Valley.

222
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:53,021
The ambassador is working hard to push
the peacekeeping resolution to a vote

223
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,021
- by the General Assembly.
- Why the delay?

224
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,071
We're having a hard time
getting the African bloc

225
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,051
to remove the poison pill provision.

226
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,093
We think Israel's behind it.
They got cold feet,

227
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:05,051
convinced the African bloc to sabotage
the resolution so they have an out.

228
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,052
Do I need to speak
to the Prime Minister?

229
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,094
Uh, the Israeli ambassador
has already denied.

230
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,048
I think we need to keep our focus
on the provision itself.

231
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:13,086
All right.

232
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:15,090
The head of the African bloc
is Zimbabwe.

233
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:20,053
And we believe Israel has promised them
a sizable aid package for HIV prevention.

234
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:23,091
The Secretary and I recommend increasing
our relief funds to Zimbabwe.

235
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:25,037
Outspend the Israelis.

236
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:27,049
Well, President Chimbetu
will just pocket the money.

237
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:30,016
Well, we always anticipate
a certain level of graft.

238
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,042
A certain level? He's egregious.
The man's a monster.

239
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,013
Who happens to run the African bloc.

240
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:37,055
Who happens to kill his people
when he's not stealing from them,

241
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,038
which is why I reduced aid to Zimbabwe.

242
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:42,093
If we want him to remove the amendment,
we have to be persuasive.

243
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,039
We are scraping together
every penny we can to save AmWorks.

244
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:48,093
The last thing I want is to be slammed
for giving additional money

245
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,073
to a brutal dictator from USAID just
to persuade him. This is ill-conceived.

246
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,036
You should think before you bring
a proposal such as this.

247
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:59,040
We'll pursue other strategies
and get back to you, Mr. President.

248
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:01,078
Thank you. Robert,
what's the latest on the omnibus?

249
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:04,061
The legislation should go to
the floor in the next couple of months.

250
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,087
The leadership is pushing...

251
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:29,051
Set up calls with both
Lockheed and Northrop.

252
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,027
We'll pay people to get trained
and call it a job.

253
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,023
It isn't a job
unless the union says it is.

254
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:37,090
Well, one step at a time. You set up
the training and I'll speak to the AFL.

255
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,027
Are the AARP here?

256
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:42,032
In the lobby. The chairman told me
they want to support Dunbar.

257
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,074
They're just trying to rattle us.

258
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,078
Dunbar is promising
to save Social Security.

259
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:48,066
Go after Wall Street and government
waste instead of entitlements.

260
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:49,074
Well, get them in here.

261
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,070
You have your call list. Their meeting's
not for another ten minutes.

262
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,000
Start bringing them over. It'll take them
that long to hobble over on their walkers.

263
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:58,038
- Francis?
- I'll go get them.

264
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,009
I only have a few minutes.

265
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,047
You singled me out today on purpose.

266
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:12,098
- What?
- The cabinet meeting.

267
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:14,094
If I'm gonna invite you
to cabinet meetings,

268
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:16,090
there's not gonna be any kid gloves.

269
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:18,069
Don't make it sound like a favor.

270
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:20,061
You wanted to be there. I agreed.

271
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:23,011
Well, so I could be informed
and do my job.

272
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,011
Everyone in that room is judged
by what they bring to the table.

273
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,053
What you brought to the table
was amateurish.

274
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,029
Both Cathy and I proposed that plan.

275
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,025
I fault her as much as you.
You're making this too personal.

276
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:38,017
It is personal. I think you're
punishing me for what happened in Russia.

277
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,079
Oh, come on.

278
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:42,092
Well, you said it on the plane.
Appointing me was a mistake.

279
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:44,092
Yeah, you said far worse things to me.

280
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,009
Yes, and I've gone out of my way
to put that fight behind us.

281
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:50,010
Oh, really? Like with Thomas?

282
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:52,001
When you screamed at us
for waking you up.

283
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,022
- I didn't scream.
- It was embarrassing.

284
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:55,068
Who cares what he thinks?

285
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:57,094
He was our guest
and you walked in there like--

286
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:00,015
I think you're searching for things
that aren't there

287
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,023
and ignoring the things that are,
like this photograph flinching nonsense.

288
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:04,090
Oh, Jesus.

289
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:10,012
- Do you want me to resign, Francis?
- Don't be ridiculous.

290
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,053
Just say it.

291
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,079
You never wanted me to be ambassador.

292
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:16,075
You remember what you
said to me on the plane?

293
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,067
You should have never made me president.

294
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,038
I was upset. I didn't mean it.

295
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,063
You did mean it.
You think you made me.

296
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:25,042
No, I don't.
I think we're a team, actually.

297
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,051
Well, we're not a team at the moment.

298
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,051
I can't believe we've become this.

299
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:37,064
- Become what?
- Like everyone else.

300
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:43,032
You ready, sir?

301
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,053
No, just give me a minute.
Let the smoke clear.

302
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:12,043
Where are we at?

303
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:43,046
Her hair's different.

304
00:22:44,054 --> 00:22:46,009
But I--

305
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,042
- Where was this taken?
- Santa Fe.

306
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,063
I've narrowed the search
to focus just on that city.

307
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:54,026
This is all I have,
but I think it's a good start.

308
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:58,056
- I should go there.
- No. These photos are three weeks old.

309
00:22:58,064 --> 00:23:01,081
- She might have been passing through.
- Or she might still be there.

310
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:05,019
Okay, but if you start asking questions,
you might tip her off.

311
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:07,027
Get me more, then.

312
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:11,019
How's my passport coming?

313
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,024
I'll get the lock lifted
when you find her.

314
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:19,008
I've shown you some progress.

315
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:21,083
I think I should be seeing
progress on your side, too.

316
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:22,087
This isn't enough.

317
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,096
They just arrested
another one of my friends.

318
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,050
- They could charge me at any minute.
- Gavin...

319
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,092
The things that I've had to do
to get this much are fucked up.

320
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:33,034
An exact location.

321
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,043
That was our deal.

322
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,069
Can you get me the camera feed?

323
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:45,027
The system's monitoring it.

324
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:47,002
I want it, too.

325
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:53,015
I'll send you the link.

326
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:29,019
Doug? This is Maurice.

327
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:32,007
He'll be taking over for me.
I'm moving to Seattle.

328
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:36,007
My sister's opening up her own PT center
and she wants me to be a partner.

329
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:39,057
I'm moving all my clients
over to new folks.

330
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:42,045
So I can help the transition.

331
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:44,079
I'll be sad to see you go.

332
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:48,042
I'll go get some bar floats.

333
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,009
Back in a second.

334
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:56,017
Look... I'm having people over
this Thursday.

335
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:59,051
It's a going-away thing at my place.
You should come.

336
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,085
- You ready?
- Yeah.

337
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:03,089
I'll text you the details.

338
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:16,011
I want to go after the big boys.
Not just Wall Street, but Walmart.

339
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,032
I'd be careful with Walmart.
You'll lose a lot of friends in Congress.

340
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:23,008
Let's force them to take sides.
That means Jackie Sharp, too.

341
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:24,058
Introduce legislation.

342
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,096
She either votes for it
or we hit her hard.

343
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:30,029
Any corporation who has more than ten
percent of its employees on food stamps

344
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:33,084
has to increase wages
until they're below ten percent.

345
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,067
Who has the guts
to sponsor something like that?

346
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:49,006
Doug?

347
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,044
Yeah, I'll put a list together. You'll
have something by the end of the week.

348
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,069
Okay. Talk to you then.

349
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:29,052
- You made it.
- Yeah.

350
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,027
- How long have you been here?
- Ten minutes.

351
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:36,002
Come on.
We need to get people dancing.

352
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,019
Actually, I was thinking
that I should go.

353
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,078
I just came over to say goodbye.

354
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:44,041
Uh-uh. No. You are not going anywhere.

355
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:49,033
You don't have to dance,
but you can't leave.

356
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:06,030
Last man standing.

357
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,077
- You have recycling?
- Just leave 'em on the counter.

358
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:13,090
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

359
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:20,057
You really don't have to help.

360
00:27:20,065 --> 00:27:22,020
I don't mind.

361
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,091
You're such a gentleman.

362
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:29,004
I don't know about that.

363
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:31,033
Oh, you're not a gentleman?

364
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:35,071
Because... that could be interesting.

365
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,038
I made you a café au lait.

366
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:19,034
Oh...

367
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,068
How is it?

368
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,072
- Need sugar?
- No.

369
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,039
It's perfect.

370
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,089
When are the movers coming by?

371
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:39,002
Not for a couple hours.

372
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:42,048
You need any help?
Packing the rest up?

373
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:44,057
No. You just relax.

374
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:51,012
You seemed a little sad last night.

375
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,070
No, just tired.

376
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,096
Was that it?
You were just tired?

377
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,084
Someone I haven't heard from
in a long time.

378
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,001
She reached out. It was--

379
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,076
It was a little hard.

380
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:16,027
Last night wasn't 'cause
you felt sorry for me, was it?

381
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:18,039
No.

382
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:22,048
Last night was because
I'm getting on a plane today,

383
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:25,040
and I'll probably never see you again.

384
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:27,024
Why not?

385
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,025
You know it rains a lot in Seattle, right?

386
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,078
Are you gonna come with me
to the memorial today?

387
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,037
Do I need to be there?

388
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,087
No.

389
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:23,088
I'm buried right now.

390
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:25,042
Fine.

391
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:05,038
Why has Tom Yates been
hanging around so much?

392
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,017
Is he writing a book on the president?

393
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:09,055
We've all asked him and he won't say.

394
00:31:09,063 --> 00:31:11,067
Ballsy move if it's true.

395
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:14,018
Yeah. I can't stand his writing.

396
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,081
Are you an idiot?

397
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,072
I'm an idiot for having an opinion?

398
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:21,035
There's no opinions to be had.
His writing is gorgeous.

399
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:23,069
Well, in my opinion, it isn't.

400
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:25,073
Said the guy who can't write
a grocery list.

401
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:28,044
- Shh, shh...
- Ready whenever you are, sir.

402
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:35,078
Today marks the 80th Anniversary
of the Social Security Act.

403
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:39,074
It has survived longer
than many of its beneficiaries.

404
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:43,062
We should all be so lucky
to live as long as it has.

405
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:48,013
But by the time the human body
has circled the sun 80 times,

406
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:50,071
its youth and vigor are gone.

407
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,001
Joints ache,
bones and muscles are weaker,

408
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:57,080
the heart doesn't beat
with the same power it once did.

409
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:00,093
All of us must face this truth eventually.

410
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,019
And when we do,
we must hand the baton to the young.

411
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:09,015
To those who have the strength
to carry on our work when we are gone.

412
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:13,074
Here's another truth:
Social Security is dying.

413
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:16,016
Now in its 80th year, it must give way

414
00:32:16,024 --> 00:32:20,033
to a new, younger,
stronger plan for the future.

415
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:23,000
That plan is America Works.

416
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,075
In Washington DC alone,
we've managed to reduce unemployment

417
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:31,067
by over a third
and put 25,000 people to work.

418
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:36,001
If we can accomplish so much
in so little time here in Washington,

419
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:40,051
imagine what we could accomplish if
Congress funded America Works nationwide.

420
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,097
We wouldn't be talking
about thousands of jobs.

421
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:46,044
We'd be talking about millions.

422
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:51,040
Later this afternoon, I will visit FDR's
memorial to pay my respects to the man

423
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:55,011
who ushered in Social Security
80 years ago.

424
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:58,091
We honor the dead for giving us
the world we inherited.

425
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:05,054
However, we must recognize we are doomed
if we allow the dead to govern us.

426
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:10,017
Thank you, and God bless
the United States of America.

427
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:12,092
From NBC News in Washington,

428
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,022
this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.

429
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,059
Good morning and welcome
to Meet the Press.

430
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:21,064
I have with me Congresswoman Huntley
and Congressman Greer.

431
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:24,097
Congresswoman, let me start with you.
In the President's radio address today,

432
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:29,031
he said the model here in Washington
is a model for the nation.

433
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
- Do you agree?
- I do, Chuck.

434
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:33,044
I was skeptical at first.

435
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,090
Both my parents benefited
from Social Security.

436
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:38,057
And I've always
counted on it for myself.

437
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:41,099
But, when I think about my kids,
and my grandkids--

438
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:44,024
Rebecca raises a good point,
one that we've been making

439
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:45,087
in the Republican Party for decades.

440
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:48,025
And yet, while you support America Works,

441
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:50,046
most members of your party do not.

442
00:33:50,054 --> 00:33:52,088
Chuck, I've never been
a big fan of Frank Underwood.

443
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:56,092
But the park near my house here
in Washington has never been cleaner.

444
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:00,018
The dry cleaners I go to just hired
two new people this month.

445
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:03,030
The daycare I drop my kids off at
doubled their staff

446
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,072
so the children can get
more individual attention.

447
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:08,094
The president may have overstepped
in taking FEMA money,

448
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:12,098
but when something works, it works.
And America Works works.

449
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,063
Hello.

450
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:29,034
Promise the money.

451
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:33,072
Whatever you need to turn him around.
I'll approve the USAID funds.

452
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:38,010
What made you change your mind?

453
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:44,011
Today... at the memorial.

454
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:49,003
You know what struck me the most?

455
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,099
Eleanor.

456
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,016
She was off by herself.

457
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,004
Alone.

458
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:04,005
And so was Franklin. He was alone.

459
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:09,072
And there was a wall between them.

460
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,068
The monks.

461
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:19,014
They've been here for weeks.
We haven't even discussed them once.

462
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,077
It's beautiful, isn't it?
What they're doing?

463
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:24,040
It is.

464
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:32,041
Francis, I watched them
for over an hour today.

465
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:36,074
And all I was thinking was, why aren't
you and I sharing this together?

466
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,001
We have to do something, Claire.

467
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:52,063
I know.

468
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,006
What are you thinking?

469
00:38:58,014 --> 00:39:01,081
My natural color.
Like when I first met Francis.

470
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:05,069
- This color?
- Yes. Exactly.

471
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,032
Okay. Have a seat.

472
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:27,096
I want to take up the sleeves a touch.

473
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:30,051
Oh, I think they're perfect.
Thank you.

474
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:38,039
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.

475
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:05,012
We have gathered today to renew
the vows between Francis J. Underwood

476
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:08,071
and Claire Hale Underwood.

477
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,018
It was here, in this church,

478
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:18,085
28 years ago, before God,

479
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:22,031
that you two first committed
yourselves to one another.

480
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:32,044
May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other,

481
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:35,003
and strengthen your eternal bond.

482
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:20,016
Claire's father bought us this house.

483
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:23,074
I wanted to pay for it myself.
That's always bothered me.

484
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:26,066
You weren't bothered to let him pay
for your first campaign?

485
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:30,067
Well, that's politics. It's different.
You take money wherever you can get it.

486
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:32,092
No, this was our first home.

487
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:36,059
- Was it a happy home?
- Oh, please.

488
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:41,035
I thought you brought me here because
we were gonna cut through the bullshit.

489
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:43,035
This book is supposed to be
about America Works.

490
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,072
There is no book
without you at the center of it.

491
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:49,073
Do you trust me? Or don't you?

492
00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:51,086
Because if you don't,
get someone else to write it.

493
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,094
Or write it yourself.

494
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:56,040
You don't know what it's like to go
through life looking over your shoulder.

495
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:58,082
Having secrets no one would understand.

496
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,078
I didn't write my first book.

497
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,020
My friend.

498
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:09,033
- The one who died.
- He wrote it?

499
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:12,021
The first half.
He didn't show it to anyone except me.

500
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,071
In the hospital, he asked me destroy it.

501
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,059
I told him I would.

502
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:22,001
It was too good.

503
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,031
It needed to be finished.
So I finished it.

504
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:29,018
- And took all the credit.
- Oh, yeah. It's my part, the ending.

505
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,081
That's what people remember.

506
00:42:32,002 --> 00:42:33,077
But the book...

507
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:37,044
My entire career...

508
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:41,041
It's all based on a lie.

509
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:44,024
You don't have a monopoly on secrets.

510
00:42:57,063 --> 00:42:59,067
There's tulips buried under here.

511
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:03,043
Claire planted them.

512
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,060
I've always...

513
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:13,085
from day one...

514
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:19,023
been ashamed she said yes
when I asked her to marry me.

515
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:20,090
Why?

516
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:25,032
I didn't think I deserved her.

517
00:43:28,012 --> 00:43:31,058
I can tell you this, though, there would
have been no White House without Claire.

518
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,021
I was half the man before I met her.

519
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,092
But still, I've been selfish...

520
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:40,080
feeding off her the way I have.

521
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:42,084
She knew what she was getting into.

522
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:48,072
Probably. She knows me
better than I know myself.

523
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:52,035
Sir? We're scheduled to fly out at 6:15.

524
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:54,040
Should probably leave
in the next few minutes.

525
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,040
Thank you, Meechum.

526
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:02,086
Scribble away.

527
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:15,075
So, what'd he tell you
in front of the house?

528
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,042
Mm...

529
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,004
Nothing much.

530
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:21,013
Well, it looked intense,
whatever it was.

531
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:25,030
See? This is why I don't ride in the van.

532
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,030
You did this time.

533
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:32,027
Sometimes you just need
to leave someone alone.

534
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:35,052
All right, I got the hint.

535
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,057
I meant him. Not me.

536
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:07,047
Where are they?

537
00:45:07,055 --> 00:45:10,035
- Who?
- The monks.

538
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:12,085
Oh, they finished earlier today, sir.

539
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:15,056
So it's gone?

540
00:45:15,064 --> 00:45:17,094
I believe so.

541
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:20,015
I didn't get a chance to see it.

542
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:22,007
I'm sure they took a photo.

543
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:26,074
Will you ask someone to get me a copy?

544
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:28,082
Right away, sir.

545
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:33,018
Thank you.

546
00:46:38,031 --> 00:46:41,023
Claire.
I almost didn't recognize you.

547
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,094
Yes,
I decided it was time for a change.

548
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,086
It's very fetching.

549
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,007
I hope you don't mind me
crashing your party.

550
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:51,032
Oh, of course not.
My staff said you'd be out of town.

551
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:55,008
Would you mind if I borrowed
Ambassador Caspi for a moment?

552
00:46:55,016 --> 00:46:56,016
Of course.

553
00:46:59,012 --> 00:47:02,067
- You've been avoiding me for three weeks.
- I had a trip to Jerusalem.

554
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:06,038
You promised Zimbabwe 35 million

555
00:47:06,046 --> 00:47:09,017
so they'd introduce
the poison pill amendment.

556
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,055
- For purely humanitarian reasons.
- No.

557
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:15,035
This is the first time
you've ever sent aid to Zimbabwe.

558
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:18,010
Don't draw connections that don't exist.

559
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:21,056
We would never try
to sabotage the resolution.

560
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:25,040
- The United States is our ally.
- That's right, we are.

561
00:47:25,048 --> 00:47:29,007
- So act like it.
- Excuse me?

562
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:33,045
My husband formally approved our own
humanitarian package for eighty million.

563
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:38,016
Zimbabwe will be withdrawing
the amendment tomorrow.

564
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:40,033
And when the resolution goes to a vote,

565
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:43,083
I expect Israel to support it
like the loyal ally she is.

566
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:45,088
Not lie to us.

567
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:48,021
That's not the way to solicit our support.

568
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,063
I'm not soliciting. I'm demanding.

569
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:54,038
I feel sorry for you, Claire.

570
00:47:54,047 --> 00:47:57,064
Your husband sends you to talk tough.

571
00:47:57,072 --> 00:48:00,056
But as soon as things go wrong
in the Jordan Valley,

572
00:48:00,064 --> 00:48:03,048
he'll turn his back and leave Israel
to clean up the mess.

573
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:05,002
He doesn't have the muscle.

574
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,019
He can't even get Congress
to work with him.

575
00:48:07,027 --> 00:48:09,048
Or back you up after you call out Petrov.

576
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:12,061
He turned his back on you
just like he will on us.

577
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:19,016
My husband is the bravest
and most resolute man I know.

578
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:20,066
He will succeed in this plan.

579
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:22,045
Brave?

580
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:24,037
I served in Jordan Valley.

581
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:27,008
As did the President
and the Foreign Minister. Has he?

582
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:32,051
You held a gun and somebody
told you where to stand.

583
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:37,043
Don't confuse that with the burden
the Commander in Chief faces.

584
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:39,018
Francis has given the order to kill.

585
00:48:39,026 --> 00:48:41,072
He's buried soldiers
he's put into harm's way.

586
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:44,064
And every day,
he wakes up bearing responsibilities

587
00:48:44,073 --> 00:48:46,081
you can't possibly imagine.

588
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,048
They would crush you
if they fell on your shoulders.

589
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:51,065
So you talk to your superiors.

590
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:55,024
And when the amendment
is withdrawn tomorrow,

591
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:59,016
you will commit
to supporting the resolution.

592
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:44,020
Oh...

593
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:38,075
