2
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,889
And where are you from,
Mr. Brown?

3
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:54,976
Sheldon, sir.
I'm a retired police officer.

4
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,269
Well, then I can only imagine
that Sheldon must be

5
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,271
one of the safest places in this state.

6
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:02,608
We do our best.

7
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:06,487
But my son, he's a marine,
stationed at Camp Dwyer.

8
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:09,074
He keeps our country safer than I do.

9
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:10,533
Me and my wife were wondering,

10
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:14,704
if he got sent over to the Jordan
Valley, will that really keep us safer?

11
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:18,541
Because it sure seems like
the whole peacekeeping mission

12
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:20,501
is only making things more dangerous.

13
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:22,754
Thank you for that. May I?

14
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:29,177
Well, first of all, let me say how
grateful I am for your son's service.

15
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,804
I know we all feel exactly the same way.

16
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:39,229
And now, uh, let me try
to answer your question.

17
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:42,607
Have we run into some difficulties
with the Russians?

18
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,358
Yes, we have.

19
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:47,904
Is there tension between
the Israelis and the Palestinians?

20
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:49,321
Absolutely.

21
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:54,035
But, that is the very reason
that this mission is so important.

22
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:58,539
We have gathered together
a coalition of seven nations

23
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:01,251
to bring stability to a region

24
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,921
that has suffered
from unrest for decades.

25
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:07,006
It will take time.

26
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,968
And there may be lives
that will be lost.

27
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:13,512
But this is not just important
for the Middle East's security,

28
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:17,767
it's important for the security of the
United States and the rest of the world.

29
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,228
And I hope that I've
answered your question.

30
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,688
Now, who was next?

31
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:25,233
Uh, let's see here.

32
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,652
Well, how about
this young woman right here?

33
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:30,738
Now, I'll give you my microphone,
but only if you promise to give it back.

34
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:32,531
He seemed to want to hang
onto it for a while.

35
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:37,245
- There you are.
- Um, my name is Annie Wietz,

36
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:41,124
and I'm also worried
about what the officer was just saying.

37
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:44,127
- I want a safe world for my grandkids--
- Give me back the mic

38
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,838
- and I'll answer your question.
- I haven't asked my question yet.

39
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:48,422
Oh!

40
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,341
Apologies. I'm ahead of myself.
Go ahead.

41
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:54,512
The covert operation, the one
that caused the Israelis to invade.

42
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:59,225
Was that us? Because that really
seemed to make a mess of everything.

43
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:00,559
- May I?
- Please.

44
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,270
Thank you. Now, Annie?

45
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:03,521
- Is that your name, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

46
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:06,107
Now, I have said this
on this matter before,

47
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,985
and I know it may be frustrating,
but it is the truth.

48
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:13,072
When it comes to covert operations
by any nation,

49
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:17,451
or matters of intelligence,
for security purposes,

50
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,370
including the security
of our own soldiers,

51
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:22,123
I simply cannot comment on these issues.

52
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:26,002
But, sir, I'm sorry, but what is
the point of having us ask questions

53
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:29,797
- if you won't answer them?
- Well, she's got me there. Uh...

54
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:32,050
I can answer any question but that one.

55
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,969
In fact, I hope that we can
ask some questions

56
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:38,181
about how we're gonna focus
on things right here at home.

57
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:39,724
How about someone up there
in the cheap seats?

58
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,184
Anyone have a question there?

59
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:47,065
The situation in Jordan Valley,
it threatens to bleed across the border.

60
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:52,444
We already have refugees
requesting to enter Jordan.

61
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,488
Forgive me, Prince Ryad.
You may be dealing with

62
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:57,158
a few hundred refugees,
but we are facing mortar attacks.

63
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,244
Fourteen in the last two weeks.

64
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:00,745
None of your people have died yet.

65
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:03,331
The last one came
within 50 meters of a school.

66
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:05,917
Your troops have killed over
a dozen Palestinians in house raids.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,794
- You expect us not to fight back?
- We need the violence to stop.

68
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:12,757
If it continues, the peacekeeping
mission will fall apart.

69
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,177
And it's our best hope
for long-term stability.

70
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:19,680
Can you speak to Hamas and Hezbollah?
Get them to agree to a cease-fire?

71
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:22,433
Israel has twice as many troops
in the region

72
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:24,394
as before the peacekeeping
mission began.

73
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,400
No, it is we who are defending ourselves.

74
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,026
You agreed to remove
two thousand troops.

75
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,613
If there's a cessation of mortar
attacks, and if the Russians leave.

76
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,407
A one-third troop reduction.

77
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:39,867
That should be enough
to convince your people, no?

78
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:42,995
Once the troops leave,
I engage them, but not before.

79
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,374
Show some goodwill.
You'll still have 4,000 troops there.

80
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:49,210
Because we cannot accomplish anything

81
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:52,046
unless we have proof
of de-escalation on both sides.

82
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,881
What about Russia?

83
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,134
That's a separate issue.
We will tackle that another time.

84
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:58,928
Can you convey to Jerusalem
the importance of this troop reduction?

85
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:00,763
Yes, but no promises.

86
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,560
All right. Thank you, everyone.

87
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,021
We'll meet again tomorrow morning.

88
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,356
Thank you, madam.

89
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:16,195
Eliana.

90
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,614
We need to discuss the no-fly zone.

91
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:22,201
It's only for the Russians,
not the peacekeepers.

92
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:25,371
They can't stay
if they have nothing to eat.

93
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:28,498
What are you going to do,
shoot down a supply plane?

94
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:30,793
We hope they won't make us
face that choice.

95
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,420
They'll ignore it.

96
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,964
And you're just going
to antagonize Moscow.

97
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,675
I'm sorry, but the no-fly zone
is above my pay grade.

98
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:40,345
Perhaps your husband can talk
to the prime minister.

99
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,096
When are we looking at?

100
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,640
Could be tomorrow, could be a week.

101
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:47,310
I'm not a part of those
conversations anymore.

102
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:49,103
We could vet the questions.

103
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,563
That doesn't work in Iowa.
It'll piss people off.

104
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,232
Even if we did,
it wouldn't make a difference.

105
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:56,486
The country is preoccupied with
the Jordan Valley. We're off message.

106
00:06:56,568 --> 00:07:00,198
In the meantime, we can put the town
halls on hold. Just do the stump.

107
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:01,782
I think we should also
postpone the debate.

108
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,826
Dunbar'll hit you hard for that.
Say you're dodging.

109
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:05,411
Have Jackie request
the postponement.

110
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:07,038
- What's her reason?
- I don't care.

111
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:10,166
Just as long as it isn't coming from us.
Talk to her. Thank you, gentlemen.

112
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,335
What's next?

113
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:17,923
Uh, you're slated for fundraising calls
until 4:15, then a DOD briefing.

114
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:21,093
Also, your friend
from The Sentinel called, Tim Corbet.

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,263
Thank you.

116
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,406
You know, I can fold my own clothes.

117
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:43,324
Took me two seconds.

118
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:50,706
You remember when we
shared a room my senior year?

119
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:53,584
And if I left, like, one sock
on the floor, you'd freak?

120
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:57,713
Yeah, I started doing that on purpose,
just to see you flip out.

121
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:00,132
Yeah. I remember.

122
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,356
Come on, leave it.
Be a rebel.

123
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:23,364
Hey, sweetie.

124
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,202
Well, tell her if it wiggles,
it means it's gonna fall out.

125
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:33,499
Okay. Let me talk to her.

126
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:38,546
Hi!

127
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:42,883
Uh, now, listen to me. You--

128
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,510
I know your mom
doesn't want you playing with it,

129
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:46,304
so you have to do what she says.

130
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:51,267
Well, because the tooth fairy
doesn't want fingerprints all over it.

131
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:55,396
Okay, I'll do it,
but you have to promise me

132
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,940
that you and your brother
will stop playing with your tooth.

133
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,152
Okay, you ready?

134
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,028
Are you super ready?

135
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,575
Boogala, boogala, boogala,
boogala, boogala.

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,121
Okay. Put your mom back on.

137
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,749
How much of a postponement?

138
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,793
Until we get this crisis resolved.

139
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,504
Dunbar will see right through that.

140
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:21,297
Not if it's coming from you.

141
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,300
Say you want to focus on meeting people
face to face, not a televised debate.

142
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:25,843
We'll back you up.

143
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,678
All right, I'll talk to my staff.

144
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,888
We'll draft some language
and I'll run it past you.

145
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,974
Jackie?

146
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:36,437
I want to talk to you about
what happened a couple weeks ago.

147
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:39,106
- I crossed a line.
- Remy, you don't have to.

148
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,233
I want to. I want to explain myself.

149
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:49,074
I still have strong feelings,
I'm not gonna deny that.

150
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:55,247
Maybe a different job...
a different time, different place.

151
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:56,666
But, uh...

152
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,377
Look...

153
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:03,922
I've loved people before,
and I've learned to let 'em go.

154
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,427
I'm not gonna put you
in that position again.

155
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:17,061
It's been hard for me, too.

156
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:25,736
Hm...

157
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:30,324
You've got work.

158
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:43,379
I'm glad you said something.

159
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:32,886
Hello?

160
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,180
Tim, it's Frank.

161
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:37,224
I'm sorry it took me all day
to get back to you.

162
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:40,227
Ah, no worries.
Your plate must be pretty full.

163
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:42,354
Well, more than I'd like at the moment.

164
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:43,648
Is this a bad time?

165
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:47,735
I think I can spare a few minutes
for the President of the United States.

166
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,570
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

167
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:53,115
Good. Uh, last kid got off to college,

168
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:56,535
so Beth and I are on our own.

169
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:59,913
Finally. Yeah, the business is strong.

170
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:03,375
I'm actually, uh, I'm thinking
of expanding to Glenwood Canyon.

171
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,834
That's great.

172
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:09,632
Listen, I called because that, uh...
that writer reached out to me.

173
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:11,717
You know, the one doing your book.

174
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:15,763
Said, uh, he wanted to talk
about The Sentinel.

175
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:16,972
What'd you say?

176
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:19,266
I said I was in a rush
and I'd call him back later.

177
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,769
I didn't want to say more
without talking to you first.

178
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:23,604
Well, he should've checked
with me beforehand.

179
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:25,356
I don't want him harassing my friends.

180
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,857
He wasn't harassing me at all.
He's a nice guy, actually.

181
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:31,696
I mean, I'm happy to talk with him
if it'll help your book.

182
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,364
Well, the book isn't really
about The Sentinel,

183
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,408
so I don't know why he'd bother, but
I'll talk to him and I'll let you know.

184
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,202
Whatever you need, Mr. President.

185
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,995
Stop that.

186
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,833
Hey, listen, uh, we run a half-price
special for Commanders-in-Chief.

187
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:48,838
So, uh... if you're ever in Colorado
with some time on your hands...

188
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,716
Well, I hope the same goes
for ex-presidents, too.

189
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,010
Nope. Only sittin' ones.
So you better win that damn election.

190
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:58,514
I'll do my best.
Nice talking to you, Tim.

191
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:00,015
You too, Frank.

192
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:11,736
I want to set aside time
for Tom Yates, in person. Tomorrow.

193
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,278
Yes, sir.

194
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:39,012
Yes.

195
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,215
Francis?

196
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:17,217
I just got off the phone with Cathy.

197
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:19,261
The Israelis are
instituting the no-fly zone.

198
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:21,847
I'm scheduled to have a call tomorrow
with the prime minister.

199
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,515
They want to cancel the call.

200
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,016
Let me see if I can get him
on the phone now.

201
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,645
They just sent out a communiqué
to all embassies.

202
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:40,783
Good morning.

203
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,827
As you--

204
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,165
Excuse me.
It's been a long night.

205
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,584
Thank you.

206
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:57,048
Israel instituted a no-fly zone

207
00:14:57,132 --> 00:15:00,845
over the Jordan Valley,
6:00 a.m. today, Israeli time.

208
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,680
And while I disagree with this action,

209
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:07,351
I understand the reason behind it,
and we must stand with our ally.

210
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:10,938
Our chief goal remains
de-escalation in the region.

211
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,773
Ambassador Underwood
and the State Department

212
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:16,318
are working with all interested
parties toward that end.

213
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:20,531
Our utmost priority
is guaranteeing civilian safety.

214
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:25,076
- And Israel has confirmed--
- When are you off to Des Moines?

215
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,372
A couple of hours.
I have to make some donor calls first.

216
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:30,332
You have surgery today?

217
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:33,335
A double bypass.
Triple tomorrow.

218
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:36,129
But nothing scheduled
for almost a week after,

219
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,966
so maybe I can come out
to Iowa and we can--

220
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:41,468
- Russian aircrafts that ignore this...
- What's going on?

221
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,637
...could potentially be subject
to military action...

222
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,056
This Jordan Valley thing's a mess.

223
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,432
He's in big trouble.

224
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:48,726
...any such actions...

225
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,978
And then there's the whole
AmWorks thing.

226
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:52,897
All the baggage from last year.

227
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:57,401
- You having doubts?
- I don't know.

228
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:59,194
Maybe.

229
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:02,823
That sounds serious.

230
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:07,077
If there was an ideal time
to walk away, now is it.

231
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,788
Mm-hm. And then what?

232
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,124
Focus on Congress.

233
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,502
Yeah, but you want more than that.

234
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:18,255
I could spend more time
with you and the kids.

235
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:21,091
Well, I don't want a wife
who's miserable

236
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:23,343
because she turned her back
on the White House.

237
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:29,641
Look...

238
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:33,311
The thing about surgery is,
once you're in, you're in.

239
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:38,191
There's a beating heart in front of you.
Someone's life.

240
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:39,693
There's no room for doubt.

241
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:43,072
So, whatever goes wrong...

242
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:47,451
say hemorrhage or a blood clot,
you deal with it.

243
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,369
You don't get to walk away.

244
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:54,458
But that's life or death.
This isn't.

245
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,003
It is for you.

246
00:16:58,087 --> 00:17:01,131
...to maintain international peace
and security.

247
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:06,762
The United States is committed
to defusing this situation.

248
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,848
We are here for Israel,
we are here for Palestine,

249
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,267
we are here for Russia.

250
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,936
And we are here for--

251
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:18,273
- Ready to go to your meeting?
- Yeah.

252
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:35,833
Come on.

253
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,419
I was thinking...

254
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:43,966
you know how a while back, you mentioned
the kids coming out from Ohio?

255
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,093
You want them to visit?

256
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:48,095
Well, maybe you don't want them
to see me like this?

257
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:51,181
- Doing my 60 days?
- You've been doing great.

258
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:54,018
I'd be thrilled for them to come
out here and meet their uncle,

259
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:55,602
if that's something you want to do.

260
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:58,063
I could hit the couch for a few nights.

261
00:17:58,147 --> 00:18:00,024
You guys can have the bedroom.

262
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:02,818
I'll call Sarah.

263
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:07,906
I say to Israel,
keep your airspace.

264
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,534
Keep your no-fly zone.

265
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:13,912
I will be flying through it, nevertheless.

266
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:17,791
Shoot me down, if you wish,
because nothing can stop me

267
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,127
from standing side by side
with my countrymen.

268
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,505
I will embrace the men
who serve this country,

269
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,841
because I am Russian,

270
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:29,427
and Russians... do not abandon their own.

271
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,390
Russian TV.

272
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:36,810
Forty-five minutes ago.
It could be hot air.

273
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:38,896
Petrov wants the world to see this.

274
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:40,355
He wouldn't put it out there
unless he meant it.

275
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,399
Israel says they're prepared
to enforce the no-fly zone.

276
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:44,526
They'll never shoot down
a head of state.

277
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:46,570
Yeah, which means they'll
lose face and compensate

278
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:48,488
by increasing their ground presence.

279
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:51,075
I got Jerusalem to agree to a pullout.

280
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,160
- Two thousand troops.
- Not if Petrov flies there.

281
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:56,371
If we downplay Petrov's move
as political theatrics,

282
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:59,290
I might be able to convince
the Israelis to follow through.

283
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:02,169
No, we need to respond
to Russia directly,

284
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:04,462
not waste our time with Israel.

285
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:06,882
Israel is our ally.
We're far more likely

286
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:09,009
to have a productive dialogue
with them than with Russia.

287
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,427
What's our main objective here?

288
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,471
To get Russian troops
out of the Jordan Valley.

289
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:17,350
Let's stop poking around from the sides.
We need to tackle this head on.

290
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:30,072
Open up a line of communication
with Moscow.

291
00:19:30,155 --> 00:19:32,407
Tell them I'm coming
to the Jordan Valley myself.

292
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,658
Sir, I--

293
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,786
I'm gonna meet with Petrov face to face,
on the ground.

294
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,704
- Mr. President, the risk factors of--
- I'm well aware.

295
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:40,165
I want to be notified the moment
that Petrov is on his way.

296
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:42,000
You work with the CIA and DOD

297
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,377
to figure out any logistics
and security you have to.

298
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:46,671
Talk to Seth.
Let's start drafting our message.

299
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:49,800
Cathy, I want to sit down with you and
Defense, and work out bargaining chips.

300
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:51,509
Thank you all very much.

301
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,555
I meant now.

302
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:04,773
- I'm not to be disturbed.
- You have a meeting with Mr. Yates.

303
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:06,650
Have him wait and tell him
it might be a while.

304
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,110
Yes, sir.

305
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,994
You're on
with Ambassador Moryakov.

306
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:20,330
- Alexi?
- You're wasting your time, Claire.

307
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:23,458
We can't let Petrov go.

308
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,669
I'm powerless.

309
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:28,463
Then tell me who we can speak to
who can influence him.

310
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:31,967
His mind is made up.
No one would dare challenge him on this.

311
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,594
All right, then I'll come to New York.
Let's meet with Caspi.

312
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:36,596
We'll ease Jerusalem's fears together.

313
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,099
I can't.
I'm on my way to Washington.

314
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:41,977
- What for?
- The embassy sent for me.

315
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,812
I'm being recalled.

316
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,897
- Is it because...?
- I don't know.

317
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,317
Alexi, if you need anything--

318
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:52,403
The ambassador
has ended the call, Mrs. Underwood.

319
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:03,957
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Hello.

320
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:09,254
- Edward?
- Wait here a moment.

321
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:13,550
Yes, ma'am?

322
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,885
What's he doing here?

323
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:17,846
The president wanted to meet with him.
He asked me to have him wait upstairs.

324
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:19,597
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

325
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:26,104
If he wants the same terms
as we had before,

326
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:29,482
I'll smooth it over
with our NATO allies.

327
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:33,070
It's tough to lose Poland,
but I think that we can compensate

328
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:36,240
with anti-missile subs
on patrol here in the Finnish Sea.

329
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:39,409
- Thank you.
- Francis? Do you have a moment?

330
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,203
I'll be right back.

331
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:45,040
Give us a minute.

332
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,169
I think this is a mistake.
You're chasing him.

333
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:52,214
- Let me work with Israel.
- You've been working with Israel.

334
00:21:52,297 --> 00:21:54,632
Now there's a no-fly zone.
One step forward, two steps back.

335
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,260
Diplomacy takes time.

336
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:57,928
Iowa is in two months.

337
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,597
You can't let the campaign drive
our foreign policy.

338
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,850
If I don't win in Iowa,
there is no foreign policy.

339
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:06,228
Excuse us, Mr. President.

340
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,313
Let's not talk out here.

341
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:11,275
If you go to the Jordan Valley,
you have to walk away with a solution.

342
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:14,069
And he knows that,
which means he gets all the leverage.

343
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:17,446
Well, it's not as if we have much
leverage at the moment.

344
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,824
He's going to want
the peacekeeping mission out.

345
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:22,411
That's right.
And the missile defense system, too.

346
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:25,205
And I'm prepared
to give him both if necessary.

347
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:28,417
What are you talking about?
Don't toss the mission aside, Francis.

348
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:31,253
Claire, you're too invested in this.

349
00:22:31,336 --> 00:22:32,921
The mission is dead.

350
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:36,258
It was dead the moment
those troops got blown up.

351
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:39,677
Your plan failed. I'm sorry.

352
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:41,554
It's my fault. I approved it.

353
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:43,681
But now, I have to fix it.

354
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:46,726
Why won't you place faith
in a diplomatic solution?

355
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,353
This is diplomacy.

356
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:51,315
Sometimes it comes down
to two men in a room.

357
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:54,067
I have no faith in the UN anymore.

358
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:57,946
I do have faith in my ability
to negotiate with this man.

359
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,031
Francis, I know you value my opinion.

360
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:02,033
Absolutely, above all others.

361
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:05,578
We have both put a great deal of effort
and thought into how to handle Russia.

362
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:07,956
I'd like for this to be a decision
we make together,

363
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,750
instead of an impulsive response--

364
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,836
- Not right now.
- Petrov's in the air.

365
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:16,881
Get Admiral Dale on the line.

366
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:21,386
Claire, I value your opinion.
I just don't agree with it this time.

367
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,151
Mr. Yates.

368
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:38,362
The president's
gonna have to reschedule.

369
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:51,875
Thomas.

370
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,002
You give us a few moments, Edward?

371
00:23:54,127 --> 00:23:56,254
Yes, ma'am. I'll be by the stairs.

372
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,219
How's the book coming?

373
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:10,060
I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

374
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:11,853
There's a big piece missing.

375
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:14,439
- What is it?
- You.

376
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:19,110
He hasn't... mentioned me at all?

377
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:22,947
Plenty of times, but...
it's not enough.

378
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:25,242
What has he said?

379
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:28,828
You're putting me in an awkward
position, Mrs. Underwood.

380
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:30,830
You don't want to betray his trust.

381
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:32,999
He and I have an agreement.

382
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:37,045
I understand. I shouldn't pry.
I'll leave you be, then.

383
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:39,839
He said he loves you more than anything.

384
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:43,427
That there wouldn't be
a White House without you.

385
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:48,181
He showed me your first house...
in Gaffney.

386
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,310
Where you planted the tulips.

387
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:54,187
And he said he was ashamed.

388
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:56,189
Of what?

389
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:59,025
That you married him.
Because you deserve better.

390
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,488
You should really be in this book,
Mrs. Underwood.

391
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:05,449
I've got a lot of stories
from his perspective.

392
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:07,158
Not a single one from yours.

393
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:10,328
Well, he's the one running
for president, not me.

394
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:12,122
Yeah.

395
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:13,790
I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

396
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:17,626
I think people need
to hear your voice to hear his.

397
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,379
Can we set up a time to meet?

398
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:23,883
Um... I'll think about it.
Thank you, Thomas.

399
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:25,552
Mm-hm.

400
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:34,144
Okay.

401
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:38,064
Seth, this is good,
but downplay expectations even more.

402
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:39,857
There's no telling
what we'll walk away with.

403
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:41,526
- Yes, sir.
- We shouldn't inform the press

404
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,612
until after you land,
for security purposes.

405
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:45,113
Donald...

406
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:48,699
- If anything should happen to me--
- I'm prepared.

407
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:51,536
- But nothing will.
- God help us.

408
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,662
Danton will walk you
through the full brief.

409
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:55,706
Everything's set up in the Situation Room.

410
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,666
- Good luck, Mr. President.
- Thank you. I'll be right back.

411
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:07,051
Now, listen, I know you have
reservations about all this.

412
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:09,887
You're doing what you think is best.

413
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:11,515
Please be careful out there.

414
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:12,681
I will.

415
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:14,851
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

416
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,649
Let's go.

417
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:29,824
Hello?

418
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:31,909
- Hi!
- Hi.

419
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:35,497
Hello! Wow! You guys really look alike!

420
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,874
- Okay.
- Oh...

421
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:40,877
We're a hugging family.

422
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,671
I see.

423
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:44,964
Hi, you must be Francine.

424
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:47,884
- No, I'm not!
- She likes Franke better.

425
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,094
Oh. Nice to meet you, Franke.

426
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:51,429
- No.
- Yep.

427
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:53,722
- I told you!
- Careful.

428
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:56,393
It's your Uncle Doug.

429
00:26:56,476 --> 00:26:57,894
Do you want to give
your Uncle Doug a hug?

430
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,770
Come here, you.

431
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,651
We'll land in Tel Aviv,

432
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:08,405
then take a special forces convoy from
there to the perimeter of the valley.

433
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:11,199
The Israelis will provide air support
until we get to the valley,

434
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:12,950
then our helos will take over.

435
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:16,496
Once we get to the camp,
the Russians insist on ground units only.

436
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,249
- We'll pass through a checkpoint--
- How secure is this location?

437
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:21,585
The position is not fortified
to our liking.

438
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:23,169
It's not blast-proof.

439
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:26,923
Sir, we're going to ask that
you wear your Kevlar and helmet.

440
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:30,343
- Sir?
- Mary.

441
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:33,513
- Why were no press allowed to go?
- Given the security situation,

442
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,390
we didn't want to put any press
in harm's way,

443
00:27:35,473 --> 00:27:38,602
or risk any hostile elements
knowing in advance.

444
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:40,311
So the president has already landed?

445
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:42,689
About 90 minutes ago.

446
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:43,898
Mark.

447
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:46,443
What exactly does the president
hope to achieve?

448
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:49,446
Ideally, we'd like the Russians
to vacate the region.

449
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:51,072
We can't promise that they will.

450
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:54,701
But the president hopes that we can
make progress toward a withdrawal.

451
00:27:54,783 --> 00:27:55,952
Kate.

452
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:57,662
This could be seen as an election stunt.

453
00:27:57,746 --> 00:28:00,164
He's trailing Dunbar in the polls,
so he wants to save the day.

454
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:01,750
I guarantee you this is no stunt.

455
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:04,793
The president is taking extraordinary
measures to end this crisis.

456
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:18,326
Mr. President.

457
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,794
You can take your vest off now,
Mr. President.

458
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:31,047
- We're safe here.
- You trust these walls?

459
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,007
If you're frightened,
you shouldn't have come.

460
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:38,638
When I was in the KGB,
I spent six months in Afghanistan.

461
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:42,225
This place is a palace compared
to the hole in the ground I lived in.

462
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:47,856
Here. You should stay hydrated.

463
00:29:47,938 --> 00:29:49,899
I brought a shipment of water

464
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:50,983
- in on my plane.
- Thank you.

465
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:54,237
So much for the Israelis
stopping our resupply.

466
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:59,367
I wish we were in the fertile part
of the valley, though.

467
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,703
I hear it's quite green and beautiful.

468
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:04,080
Well, this is better for pictures.

469
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:05,248
How do you mean?

470
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:09,293
Well, if you flew into a paradise,
wouldn't be as effective, now, would it?

471
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:11,546
You do have a flair for the theatrical.

472
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:15,633
I can say the same about you,
showing up on my doorstep like this.

473
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:19,136
This isn't your doorstep.
You're squatting where you shouldn't be.

474
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,014
I don't think my men
will see it like that.

475
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:25,685
Do your men know that you're
responsible for killing their comrades?

476
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:28,145
Accusations.

477
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,899
That's how you plan to convince me?

478
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:36,237
What do you require
to pull out of the valley?

479
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,617
That your troops leave as well,
and the entire peacekeeping operation.

480
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,869
Well, as soon as your troops withdraw,

481
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:45,538
I'll make sure the UN
forces do exactly the same.

482
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:49,250
Hm. And you scale back missile defense.

483
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,836
As we agreed to twice already.

484
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,505
That's when we were making
an entirely different deal.

485
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:58,802
The main difference now is that
we're both standing in the desert,

486
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:03,180
and you can't leave with nothing
to show but sand in your shoes.

487
00:31:03,264 --> 00:31:05,600
I'll agree to the scale-back.
Same terms as before.

488
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:08,102
How soon can you mobilize a withdrawal?

489
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:11,355
Well, the moment UN forces begin
to pull out, we will do the same.

490
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:14,734
I've had the Pentagon come up with
an exit plan that we can put into effect

491
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:17,069
as early as tomorrow.
As for the rest of the UN forces,

492
00:31:17,153 --> 00:31:19,989
I can reach out to
the Secretary General immediately.

493
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:23,493
You or... your wife?

494
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,703
Well, yes, she would probably
make the call on my behalf.

495
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:27,580
I don't think she should.

496
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:29,415
You think I should make the call?

497
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,041
More than that.

498
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,461
I think she should be gone.

499
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:37,799
Gone in what way?
Gone from these negotiations?

500
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:40,134
As ambassador.

501
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:41,970
My final condition.

502
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:47,809
That cannot be on the table.

503
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:51,646
It is. And it's non-negotiable.

504
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:00,279
Ms. Dempsey.
I'm a friend of Lisa's.

505
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:02,699
- Uh, Max?
- That's right.

506
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:05,451
Yes, she told me to tell you
she's running a few minutes behind.

507
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:07,077
Okay, I'll just wait outside.
Thank you.

508
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,621
No, it's... chilly.

509
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:10,540
You can come on up to her room.

510
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:13,417
Okay.

511
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:16,337
I just want you to know...
I'm so sorry.

512
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:20,216
Lisa told us and our prayers
are with you.

513
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:24,721
Thank you so much.

514
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:29,141
She said you and your husband
were like parents to her. I see why.

515
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:31,519
Come on in.

516
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:37,608
Max, hey.

517
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,109
Sorry I'm late.

518
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:40,945
Here, I want you to take that back.

519
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:42,530
No, no, no, that money's yours.

520
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:44,032
No, I can't. I can't take it.

521
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:45,867
Everyone at the fellowship pitched in.

522
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,369
- Just give it back to 'em.
- I can't.

523
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:51,205
You said that you needed the money
for the medicine.

524
00:32:54,124 --> 00:32:55,543
Yeah, sit down.

525
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,128
Sorry, please.

526
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:01,632
Okay.

527
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,227
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound fucked up,

528
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,940
but just hear me out
before you say anything, all right?

529
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:19,984
Okay.

530
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:25,031
I'm leaving.

531
00:33:25,114 --> 00:33:27,324
And I'm not coming back.

532
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:31,120
And... I have to leave
because I'm in danger.

533
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:35,666
My name isn't Max.

534
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,461
I don't have AIDS.

535
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:41,047
- Wait. Hold on.
- Let me finish, please.

536
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,050
I want to explain everything to you,
but I can't.

537
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:45,843
The less you know, the better.

538
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,637
But listen to me.

539
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,848
If the FBI comes here,
you can't say anything.

540
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,642
You have to tell them you don't know me.

541
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,477
- The FBI?
- Yes, and if they do,

542
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,647
I want you to contact this man.
His name is Doug Stamper.

543
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,317
- And he can help you.
- Max. This is crazy.

544
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,611
It's not my name.

545
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:05,738
I made it up.
I made up everything.

546
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,531
The name, the girlfriend, the clinic.

547
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,158
No, I was there with you.

548
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:11,577
I faked it. I had to.

549
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:21,004
If you're not Max... then who are you?

550
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:28,594
Take this. He will help you.

551
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:30,680
- Oh...
- He can protect you.

552
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:34,475
Please. I know it's not fair.

553
00:34:34,558 --> 00:34:36,019
- Please leave.
- Let me leave this with you.

554
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:37,520
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

555
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:39,605
Please, just take it with you.

556
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:43,192
Please leave.

557
00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:45,153
You're a good person, Lisa.

558
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:48,031
I'm just not.

559
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:51,283
And I'm sorry.

560
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:04,088
What can I offer you instead of her?

561
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:06,090
Nothing.

562
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:10,553
What about a humanitarian relief fund,
for your allies in Africa?

563
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:12,972
You can distribute it
any way you see fit.

564
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,141
A few billion dollars?
I'm not that easily bought.

565
00:35:15,224 --> 00:35:18,895
All right, let's say that we
re-examine our base in Izmir.

566
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:20,396
Congress would never let you.

567
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:24,608
And realistically, you're willing
to barter major strategic airfields

568
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:26,276
on account of your wife?

569
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,529
You can't make this about her.

570
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,698
She was never equipped
to be an ambassador.

571
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,242
You know that.

572
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,161
I understand.

573
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:38,581
How could you say no to your own wife?

574
00:35:38,664 --> 00:35:40,374
But she's blinding you.

575
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:43,460
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You are being petty.

576
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,257
The SEAL team you sent.

577
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,052
Look how easily we manipulated her.

578
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:55,514
Moryakov didn't have to work too hard.

579
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:59,643
Did we blow up our own men?

580
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:01,520
Maybe we did.

581
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,482
Maybe we didn't.

582
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:07,902
But we made her believe that we did.

583
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:09,486
And she convinced you.

584
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,907
Now, wouldn't you call that blindness?

585
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,624
You want to kill me now. I can see it.

586
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:29,006
I read an amusing article about, um...

587
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:33,677
a Civil War re-enactor,

588
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:37,181
who said that your
great-great-grandfather

589
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:40,101
killed a Yankee soldier
with his bare hands.

590
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:47,316
When I was in Afghanistan,
we were ambushed by the Mujahideen.

591
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:51,195
And the man who shot me here and here,

592
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:54,240
he stabbed me when his rifle jammed.

593
00:36:54,323 --> 00:36:56,742
I pulled the knife away
and slit his throat.

594
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:59,120
Yes, I know, you've told that story
dozens of times to the press.

595
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:03,499
The part I don't tell is that after
I slit his throat, I kept going.

596
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:09,880
We strapped his head to a donkey so
it would carry it back to his village.

597
00:37:11,674 --> 00:37:14,051
I've killed a man with my bare hands.

598
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,639
It wasn't make-believe.

599
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:23,227
Do you think you're capable?

600
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:33,112
I think you are.

601
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:37,825
You're ruthless.

602
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:41,745
Like me.

603
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:48,544
Sometimes we must be ruthless
with those who hate us.

604
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,674
And sometimes we must be ruthless
with those we love.

605
00:37:57,636 --> 00:38:01,224
I don't see why Claire
means so much to you.

606
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:04,727
Because she means so much to you.

607
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:11,942
And if you do this,
I will know you're serious.

608
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:35,674
Your wife is on the line, sir.

609
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:37,093
Tell her I'll call her back.

610
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:38,386
I've told her that twice now.

611
00:38:38,468 --> 00:38:40,512
- Tell her again.
- Yes, sir.

612
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:49,272
- You don't have to do that, Sarah.
- I don't mind. It doesn't take long.

613
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:51,107
No, no. Let us do it.
You go relax.

614
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,192
I'll move the monsters in a few minutes.

615
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:54,818
- Okay.
- All right.

616
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,822
See you in bed.

617
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,241
See you tomorrow.

618
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:17,674
I wish I could sleep like that.

619
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:22,471
You ever think of settling down?

620
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:25,224
Gettin' a couple of these for yourself?

621
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:26,850
Hasn't ever crossed my mind.

622
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,437
Never?

623
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,772
It's not for me. A life like that.

624
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:35,359
You mean a life like mine?

625
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:38,446
- That's not what I said.
- I know you've always felt that way.

626
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:44,160
A mortgage, nine to five,
wife, two kids, a dog.

627
00:39:44,243 --> 00:39:45,577
No.

628
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:47,413
It's just my freedom's important to me.

629
00:39:47,496 --> 00:39:50,333
I'm freer than you are, pal.

630
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:56,546
I stayed in Columbus because I liked it,
not because anybody made me.

631
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,215
I chose to put down roots.

632
00:39:58,299 --> 00:39:59,883
You've always been running
from something.

633
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,969
Hey, I don't judge you.
Don't judge me.

634
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,553
Listen to your big brother
for a second.

635
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,264
No, last thing I need
is a lecture right now.

636
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:11,645
During your whole recovery, all you kept
talking about was getting back to work.

637
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:13,481
Over a month I've been here,

638
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:15,691
using all my vacation time
and then some.

639
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:18,361
If you don't want to be here,
then maybe you should go home.

640
00:40:18,444 --> 00:40:20,904
It's not about that, Doug.

641
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:23,782
I'm here because you're family.

642
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:26,369
Because you're more important than work.

643
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:32,166
Hey... If I lost my job because of you,
I'd find another one.

644
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:34,126
What do you have?

645
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,296
Frank Underwood?
You don't even have that.

646
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,510
You got two pictures
on your fridge,

647
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:44,928
and they're of my kids.

648
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:46,514
That's not freedom.

649
00:41:08,952 --> 00:41:12,373
Petrov wants a diplomatic change.

650
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:14,500
At the UN.

651
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:18,921
- Me.
- It was non-negotiable.

652
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:25,635
Clearly, you didn't say no.

653
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:29,098
I wanted to discuss it with you first.

654
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:34,853
I called more than once.

655
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,569
I wanted to convince myself
to refuse what he asked.

656
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:43,571
But... I couldn't do that.

657
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:46,365
I told you it was
a mistake to go, Francis.

658
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:49,243
And the resolution was a mistake.
And Corrigan was a mistake.

659
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:52,580
We could tally up all our mistakes,
but we are where we are.

660
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:56,166
I need to concentrate
on what's in front of me right now.

661
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,586
I am. I'm in front of you.

662
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:05,259
The Russians need to leave.
It's as simple as that.

663
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:07,636
You want me to say this is okay.

664
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,012
No.

665
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:12,308
Francis, I would've preferred if you had
walked in and just told me I was fired.

666
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:15,519
They played you, Claire.

667
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:18,730
Moryakov was not having
some crisis of conscience.

668
00:42:18,814 --> 00:42:22,692
It was all so that we would
send our SEAL team in.

669
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:25,279
So that we would provoke the Israelis.

670
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:29,116
And I didn't see it,
because I trusted you too much.

671
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,660
I didn't look at it objectively...

672
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:35,080
because you're my wife.

673
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,668
- Petrov told you that?
- Yes.

674
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:42,630
- And you believe him?
- I do.

675
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:49,345
I'll resign.

676
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:52,973
I wish it didn't have to come to this.

677
00:42:54,642 --> 00:42:56,977
What do we say to the press?

678
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:04,568
That you want to focus on the campaign,
that that was your plan all along.

679
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:07,404
That I want to see
this crisis through, first.

680
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:09,365
No one will question that.

681
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:13,661
Tell Petrov.

682
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:15,078
And I will...

683
00:43:16,913 --> 00:43:19,291
make the announcement
whenever you want me to.

684
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,585
Claire.

685
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:25,255
You were right.
I shouldn't have gone.

686
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:29,426
It was your decision to make.
Not mine.

687
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:32,888
Good night.

688
00:43:38,977 --> 00:43:40,646
My decision.

689
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:48,362
Sometimes I think the presidency...

690
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,949
is the illusion of choice.

691
00:44:17,974 --> 00:44:19,268
What is it?

692
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:21,144
I have to go to the White House.

693
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:23,188
It's the middle of the night.

694
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:24,898
He's the president.

695
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,169
Thank you, Meechum.

696
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:50,132
Have a seat.

697
00:44:57,013 --> 00:44:58,432
I wake you up?

698
00:44:59,516 --> 00:45:00,892
It's fine.

699
00:45:00,976 --> 00:45:03,687
I'm a light sleeper anyway.

700
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:06,898
If it wasn't you, it would've
been a siren or a dump truck.

701
00:45:08,692 --> 00:45:12,404
I get woken up in the middle
of the night all the time.

702
00:45:12,488 --> 00:45:15,031
Some crisis somewhere in the world.

703
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:22,289
Some... situation...
in the Situation Room.

704
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,583
Well, that's better than a dump truck.

705
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,805
You reached out to Tim Corbet.

706
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,683
I did.

707
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:43,059
I spoke to him a few days ago.

708
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:46,062
He called to let me know.

709
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:47,897
So you two are still close.

710
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:49,733
Not anymore.

711
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:51,985
At school we were.

712
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:55,405
I thought he might have some insight
to how you were back then.

713
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,324
Those are formative years.

714
00:45:57,407 --> 00:45:59,785
More formative for you than for me.

715
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:02,788
I learned how to march and shoot a gun,
that's about it.

716
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,044
I would've been better off
in military school.

717
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:10,420
Yeah? Why's that?

718
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:15,967
You go from turning tricks
to being on the bestseller list

719
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:19,346
before you can legally drink,
it messes with you.

720
00:46:20,806 --> 00:46:23,475
You told me your friend
was the one who, uh...

721
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:25,143
I lied.

722
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:30,482
Why? You ashamed?

723
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:41,827
First time I did it,
I was scared out of my mind.

724
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,249
I knock on the door, it opens...

725
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:49,376
guy's in a satin robe.

726
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:50,836
He's fat.

727
00:46:52,504 --> 00:46:55,965
Stringy hair, combed over his bald spot.

728
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:59,553
Beads of sweat
rolling down his cheeks.

729
00:46:59,636 --> 00:47:01,722
I almost ran back to the elevator.

730
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:04,892
But you didn't.

731
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,062
No.

732
00:47:09,145 --> 00:47:10,272
I needed the money.

733
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:15,778
Before I got undressed...

734
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:20,156
he tells me that his wife just died.

735
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:24,119
Car accident.

736
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:29,666
Says they had plans
to visit Tokyo in the spring.

737
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,919
Tells me about his three kids.

738
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:35,255
The one that was born with a cleft palate.

739
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:40,051
Describes his house in Westchester,
with a Juliet balcony in the living room.

740
00:47:41,094 --> 00:47:43,263
Says how beautiful she was.

741
00:47:46,725 --> 00:47:49,102
Tells me he doesn't want to die.

742
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:51,814
Never touched me once.

743
00:47:59,154 --> 00:48:01,490
Sometimes it was just sex.

744
00:48:01,573 --> 00:48:03,700
But a lot of times, it wasn't.

745
00:48:07,078 --> 00:48:09,665
They would tell me everything.

746
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:11,500
These men.

747
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:14,336
That access.

748
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:15,712
Those stories.

749
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:19,883
It was an addiction.

750
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,426
I craved it.

751
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:23,345
I lived for it.

752
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:25,472
And then you wrote about it.

753
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:27,850
When I got famous...

754
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,228
I had to stop.

755
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:34,439
I tried it once, I got recognized.

756
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:40,027
I wasn't invisible anymore.

757
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:41,864
I couldn't escape myself.

758
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:48,203
I wish I could do that sometimes.

759
00:48:51,038 --> 00:48:53,625
Escape myself.

760
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:55,794
Is it Claire?

761
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:59,046
You didn't ask me here
to talk about Tim Corbet.

762
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:04,260
What's in this for you?

763
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:07,472
I'm addicted.

764
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:09,016
To me?

765
00:49:16,773 --> 00:49:18,734
I betrayed her.

766
00:49:18,817 --> 00:49:20,151
How?

767
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:27,701
I'm not asking as your biographer.

768
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:31,038
I'm asking as your friend.

769
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,011
Are we friends?

770
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:50,974
We could pretend to be.

771
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:59,399
This isn't pretend.

772
00:50:04,613 --> 00:50:06,239
I'm real.

773
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:09,701
You're hurting.

774
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:13,830
She's hurting more.

775
00:50:22,672 --> 00:50:24,257
Everyone's hurting.

776
00:50:46,571 --> 00:50:48,448
Go home.

777
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:52,577
You should get some sleep.

778
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:54,245
And so should I.

779
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:10,012
Thirty years is a long time.

780
00:51:11,596 --> 00:51:13,348
You've made it this far.

781
00:51:38,707 --> 00:51:40,167
Okay!

782
00:51:42,752 --> 00:51:43,962
Double!

783
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:53,805
Jesus.

784
00:52:24,419 --> 00:52:26,796
- Hey.
- Hey.

785
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,715
I didn't hear you come back.

786
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:30,257
I didn't want to wake you.

787
00:52:36,806 --> 00:52:38,265
Wow.

788
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:40,769
- What is it?
- Mid-East bureau.

789
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:43,312
They say the Russians
are pulling out their troops.

790
00:52:45,023 --> 00:52:47,150
Whatever he did out there
must have worked.

791
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:52,405
Mm... I wonder what it cost him.

792
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:02,540
We ran the different looks
by a couple of focus groups.

793
00:53:02,624 --> 00:53:04,751
These are the three favorites.

794
00:53:07,963 --> 00:53:10,215
Not this one.

795
00:53:11,298 --> 00:53:13,218
Uh, this one. What do you think?

796
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,719
I like it.

797
00:53:14,803 --> 00:53:17,847
- The hair color as well?
- Do you mind going back to blonde?

798
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:19,975
I'd prefer it dark.

799
00:53:20,058 --> 00:53:24,146
The groups, in Iowa, in particular,
they like the blonde.

800
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:27,523
Fine. We'll go blonde then.

801
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:29,151
You're popular among women.

802
00:53:29,234 --> 00:53:32,946
We want to push those numbers as high
as we can, and every little bit counts.

803
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:35,115
You don't have to explain.
We'll do the color change

804
00:53:35,198 --> 00:53:37,033
after we announce the resignation.

805
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:38,118
Thanks, Abbie.

806
00:53:42,831 --> 00:53:45,000
If you don't want to,
you don't have to do this.

807
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,209
It's fine.

808
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,670
The nomination is not
gonna hinge on your hair.

809
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:51,422
You heard what Abbie said.
Every little bit counts.

810
00:53:52,841 --> 00:53:54,759
We'll do what we have to.

811
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:20,615
