00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,909
When surface temperatures
in the Atlantic rise above 80 degrees,

3
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:41,912
conditions are ideal for a hurricane.

4
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:44,915
Westerly winds kick up condensation,

5
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:49,127
forming cumulonimbus clouds which begin
to revolve around a central axis.

6
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:52,715
On September seventh,
these exact conditions gave birth

7
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:55,050
to Hurricane Faith, currently barreling

8
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,512
toward the Eastern seaboard
of the United States.

9
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:01,557
On November 7th, 1984,

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,976
a different sort
of hurricane swirled into being.

11
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,688
A 25-year-old Harvard Law graduate

12
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:12,192
took South Carolina State
Senate District Fourteen by storm.

13
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:15,446
His name was Francis J. Underwood.

14
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,531
How strong will it be
when it hits?

15
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:20,492
Simulators say Cat Three,
possibly Cat Four.

16
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,912
Major devastation across a dozen states.

17
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:26,164
Yes, but some of these projections
have it turning back to sea.

18
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:29,084
That's highly unlikely, sir.

19
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,420
Sir, FEMA's mission
is to prepare for the worst.

20
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:34,965
First responders,
medical, mass evacuation.

21
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:38,009
I'm worried about the funding.

22
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:40,429
The Disaster Relief Fund
has been depleted by a third

23
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,265
- since you launched AmWorks.
- That still leaves two billion.

24
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:47,018
Well, for this storm,
we need four times that.

25
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,814
I'm about to meet with the leadership
to ask them to replenish the fund,

26
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:51,315
but I can't ask for that much.

27
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:55,486
We need eight billion minimum
for bare-bones preparation.

28
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,655
We shouldn't gamble
with something like this, sir.

29
00:02:57,738 --> 00:03:00,407
Hundreds could die. Maybe thousands.

30
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:03,702
"The impossible made possible.

31
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:08,791
The thing no one else dares to do,
that everyone says can't be done.

32
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:13,671
Imagine a boy standing on the shores
of the Charleston Harbor.

33
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:19,134
Two miles away, a faint line
on the horizon, is Fort Sumter.

34
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:23,388
All the other boys say
it's impossible to swim there.

35
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:26,642
But this one boy thinks it can be done.

36
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:30,729
The others gasp as he kicks off
his shoes, plunges into the water.

37
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:33,858
They watch with shock
as he grows farther from the shore.

38
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:39,571
They whisper to each other solemnly,
'He'll drown. He'll never make it.'

39
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:42,157
'No, he'll turn around
when it gets too hard.'"

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,701
Mr. President.

41
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:46,704
Have a seat. I'll have Jessica
bring in some refreshments.

42
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:49,331
Henry Mitchell,
the new Senate Majority Leader.

43
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,916
What happened to Hector Mendoza?

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,211
Well, you don't declare a couple
of paid speeches as income and boom,

45
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:57,047
you're no longer in Congress,
and certainly not running for president.

46
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,509
You got rid of Ronnie.
Hector loved that painting.

47
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:02,594
He's not gone, just in storage.

48
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:03,971
Just like Hector.

49
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:07,391
My father served under Eisenhower.
Drove his jeep in Normandy.

50
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:09,727
Your father was at D-Day?

51
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,563
Utah Beach. At Bastogne too.

52
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,315
Isn't this just a little love fest.

53
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:19,069
Gentlemen, the hurricane.
I need the DRF replenished.

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,740
The Speaker's calling
for an emergency session tonight.

55
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,950
We're prepared to allocate ten billion.

56
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,869
I was only gonna ask for eight.

57
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:29,872
You sign the bill,
you'll get the ten billion.

58
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:33,834
But no FEMA money
or any other agency funds can be used

59
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,587
for your jobs program again,
under any circumstances.

60
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,296
Don't politicize this.

61
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,050
America Works and the hurricane
are two separate issues.

62
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:43,635
Excuse me, Mr. President,

63
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:46,764
but you're the one that raided
the DRF for political purposes.

64
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,223
We're correcting a wrong.

65
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,768
And jeopardizing
the entire Eastern Seaboard.

66
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:53,020
That's on the White House,
not on us.

67
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:55,981
We're supplying the funds,
the money you took illegally.

68
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:59,192
If you choose not to sign the bill,
we can't be blamed.

69
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:00,318
We stepped up.

70
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:07,785
I thought you might try
to make this about America Works.

71
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:10,245
And look, I admit, I may have overstepped.

72
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:11,956
But let me show you something.

73
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,542
Every day, I ask the Comms office
to give me profiles

74
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:19,630
of ten AmWorks beneficiaries.
These are success stories.

75
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:24,051
This is just a fraction of the 40,000
people that we put back to work.

76
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:27,136
With money that wasn't appropriated
for that purpose.

77
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,640
You don't get
to break the piggy bank

78
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:32,559
then ask us to glue it together
and put in more pennies.

79
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:35,938
I've got over 50 Democrats
and Republicans in both houses

80
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:39,650
that have publicly supported
America Works since its introduction.

81
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:40,901
The tide is turning.

82
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,152
Your own people
are getting behind the program.

83
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:46,573
Then where are they now?
Why aren't we getting calls?

84
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:49,868
Why do they all support
this emergency bill?

85
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:52,329
If you pass it, I'll veto it,
but there's no reason

86
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,414
we have to turn this
into a pissing match.

87
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,959
You know that we have the votes
to override your veto.

88
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:00,045
It passes in ten days
without a signature, regardless.

89
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,009
The only question is whether you're
gonna sign it before that hurricane hits,

90
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:08,428
or watch it become law
after thousands have died.

91
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,348
Henry...

92
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:16,353
I sat with Hector dozens of times
at this very table

93
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:20,983
and we were always able to work out
our differences, to negotiate.

94
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,568
This isn't Hector's office anymore.

95
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:25,236
Or his table.

96
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,740
Gentlemen, is there no room
for a compromise?

97
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,742
- No.
- Bob?

98
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,285
No, Mr. President.

99
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,247
It's going wide in an hour.

100
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:38,291
Seven governors,
all up and down the East Coast.

101
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,251
They're demanding
that you sign the bill.

102
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,379
- Who tipped you off?
- Jim Matthews' flack.

103
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,589
Matthews is turning on us? What's it say?

104
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:47,926
"President Underwood has undermined
the separation of powers

105
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,429
and put the fate of the entire
East Coast in Hurricane Faith's hands.

106
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:54,725
I am joining with the Governors
of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland--"

107
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,601
That's enough.
I don't need to hear any more.

108
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:59,563
See how many governors you can get
on the phone in 30 minutes.

109
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:01,773
- Yes, sir.
- I've got something else for you, sir.

110
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:04,109
The AmWorks case studies.
These are your ten for the day.

111
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:07,029
- I don't have time for that now.
- You should see this top file.

112
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:19,833
Freddy's working as a dishwasher.

113
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,419
He was one of the first people to sign up.

114
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,720
Should I prepare a statement
in response to the governors?

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,724
Sir?

116
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,893
No statement. No. Not yet.

117
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:39,310
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:45,776
- Yes, sir?
- Send a message to the entire cabinet.

119
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:48,028
I want a meeting tomorrow morning,
first thing.

120
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,448
"During his tenure as whip,

121
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:56,203
Underwood was known for employing
intimidation, bravado and fear.

122
00:07:56,286 --> 00:08:00,832
His recent stance against Russia is
a continuation of strong-arm diplomacy,

123
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,502
carried out by his wife,
whom he appointed UN ambassador

124
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:07,338
despite the Senate voting her down.

125
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:11,051
The use of FEMA funds
for America Works shocked many,

126
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:15,597
but it's simply the most recent
in a career's worth of unilateral moves.

127
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,769
Minority Leader Bob Birch said,
'The President consistently demonstrates

128
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:25,023
an utter lack of partnership
coupled with reckless abandon.'"

129
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:29,027
Sir, have you given any thought
to simply signing the bill

130
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,155
that Congress passed last night?

131
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,748
How many of you think
I should sign the bill?

132
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:44,334
Well, surely, some of you think I should.

133
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:50,757
You know, I think too often, the people
in this room are afraid of upsetting me.

134
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,092
And that's my fault.

135
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:56,180
I discourage dissent when it doesn't go
with the things that I want.

136
00:08:56,263 --> 00:09:00,892
So, I want you to be honest with me.
I won't hold it against you.

137
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,520
How many of you think
I should sign the bill?

138
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:33,967
Thank you.

139
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:37,512
You have all worked very hard
to get AmWorks up and running.

140
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,472
I don't want to sign its death warrant

141
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:43,352
until we have exhausted
every resource available to us first.

142
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:45,937
So I need every department
to draft a proposal

143
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,191
of what they could do
in response to the hurricane.

144
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:53,362
And if we still fall short,
I'll sign the bill.

145
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:54,863
Is that okay with everyone?

146
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:58,408
Let's aim for the day after tomorrow.
Thank you all very much.

147
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,914
The starting salary for an employee
at Walmart is below the poverty line.

148
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,626
Now, the American government
subsidizes Walmart

149
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,589
to the tune of 7.8 billion dollars a year,

150
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:17,719
by issuing food stamps
to over one in ten of its workers.

151
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:19,596
But here's the scary part.

152
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,892
Fifteen percent of all food stamps
are actually used at Walmart.

153
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:29,439
Meaning Walmart gets to double dip
into the federal government's coffers.

154
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:32,525
I'm as angry about it as you are.

155
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:37,697
Because Walmart's top executives
have reaped almost 300 million

156
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:42,286
in tax-deductible performance pay
over the last six years.

157
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,788
That needs to stop!

158
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,210
We need to raise the minimum wage!

159
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:59,010
Cut down on corporate greed
by regulating bonuses.

160
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:05,642
It's time to balance the scales.

161
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:15,526
- Can we go through your call sheet?
- Just give me a second to decompress.

162
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,904
We've only got a half hour
until the next event.

163
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:21,532
- Doug called?
- While you were giving your speech.

164
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,785
- What about?
- He wouldn't say.

165
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:53,606
How'd it go in Cedar Rapids?

166
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,651
Well. We got AFSCME on board.
Good turnout. What's up?

167
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:59,154
Sharp has an event in Dubuque tomorrow.

168
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:01,281
You're scheduled to be there too.

169
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,283
- And?
- Meet with her.

170
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,327
- Somewhere discreet.
- Why?

171
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,912
If we assume that Underwood is running,
and we do,

172
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,790
we should also assume
that Sharp is on his team.

173
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,876
That doesn't answer the question.

174
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,296
I'm sure that Cynthia will object.
Hello, Cynthia.

175
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,923
- Hello, Doug.
- Object to what?

176
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,138
You're going to talk to Sharp
about the hurricane.

177
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:28,350
...that are perceived
as helping average citizens

178
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,767
feel more empowered.

179
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:32,521
Who are some
of the bill's key opponents

180
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:35,065
and what are hearing
in their on floor messaging?

181
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:38,276
Well, the White House
would be the most prominent opponent

182
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,862
if they slap the veto threat
on this, saying it's--

183
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:44,032
- Oh. Thank you, Cynthia.
- You usually work out at midnight?

184
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:48,203
My workout is the only time of day
the press corps gives me some privacy.

185
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:52,623
- How did your event go tonight?
- Fine.

186
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:56,753
I called bingo for half an hour
at an old folks' home.

187
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:59,797
Well, that's pretty good.
Something a little different.

188
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:03,592
You gonna steal it the way you stole
my talking points on the FEMA bill?

189
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,303
You made good points.

190
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:08,390
I'm not above agreeing with the opposition
when they're right.

191
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:10,100
Mm...

192
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:14,521
But I'm surprised you've been so critical.
I thought you and Underwood were close.

193
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:17,732
I'm not above disagreeing with an ally
when they're wrong.

194
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,321
In the spirit of what's right, I want you
to know I'm suspending my campaign.

195
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:25,365
When the storm makes landfall,

196
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:28,910
I'm going to ask people
to donate to the Red Cross instead.

197
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,704
And I'll be heading out east to volunteer.

198
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:34,916
That doesn't sound like a suspension.
That sounds like opportunism.

199
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:37,877
No. I'll ask the press to leave me be.

200
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:41,714
I can't force them to,
but we won't offer any logistical support.

201
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:44,801
You want me to suspend as well?

202
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:46,844
We can announce together.

203
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:48,888
That takes the politics out of this.

204
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,768
The cynical side of me
thinks that it benefits you

205
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:56,645
if I stop my fundraising
right when I'm hitting my stride.

206
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,483
Well, I'm not appealing
to the cynical side.

207
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:04,404
I'll leave you to your workout.

208
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:07,698
You have kids now.

209
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,120
- I have a husband. He has kids.
- You don't consider them your own?

210
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:13,788
It's late, Heather.

211
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,707
I bring it up because they ground me.

212
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:22,922
I don't know if you've felt this way
since you got married, but...

213
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:27,260
when I think about my kids
and this hurricane...

214
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:30,597
What if we didn't have the money
and advantages we do?

215
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,349
What if they were in harm's way?

216
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:35,435
What if they needed help
and didn't have it?

217
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,105
Puts everything into perspective for me.

218
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,774
This... campaign seems meaningless.

219
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:45,862
It pales in comparison
to their well-being.

220
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:50,534
Have you felt that at all?

221
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,494
Since you became a mother?

222
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:59,626
"Consulting with state governments"
is way too dry.

223
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:01,336
Put in "working closely."

224
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:03,713
- Don't you think that's disingenuous?
- Why?

225
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:06,257
These seven governors just
publicly condemned the president.

226
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:07,425
"Working closely"?

227
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,845
Well, I condemn you every day
but I still work closely with you.

228
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:14,349
So, I need to take this phone call.

229
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:17,310
Uh... punch it up, bring it back to me.

230
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:21,064
- Doug?
- I have a message for the president.

231
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:22,273
What is it?

232
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:25,235
Tell him Jackie and Dunbar
met in Dubuque tonight.

233
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,362
And tell him I'm the one who told you.

234
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,113
What did they meet about?

235
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:32,492
Suspending their campaigns
after the hurricane hits.

236
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:35,286
- How do you know this?
- Just tell him.

237
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,830
Are you working for Jackie,
under the radar?

238
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:39,874
- No.
- Dunbar?

239
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:42,460
I'm just looking out for the president.

240
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:45,630
Give him the information
and tell him who it came from.

241
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,340
I'll let you know if I learn more.

242
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:58,268
"The water was cold
and the current was strong.

243
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:01,145
With every stroke,
the boy had to fight off chills

244
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:04,148
and battle the tide rushing in
from the sea.

245
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:07,485
Anyone watching him,
as his schoolmates did from the shore,

246
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:11,239
barely making out a tiny speck
moving slowly across the water,

247
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:13,700
would've thought he stood no chance.

248
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:17,078
But that thought never
entered the boy's mind.

249
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:20,624
His muscles ached, his heart pounded,

250
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:23,627
but the water would not defeat him."

251
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:28,506
I want rec centers and town halls,
but the most important thing is schools.

252
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,133
They're the key.

253
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:33,428
Well, every school east of Ohio.

254
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:37,474
You tell the governors that push back,
tell them we'll pay for the shutdown days

255
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:39,601
and overtime with what's left in the DRF.

256
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:43,313
No, we'll figure out how to get people
there through some other department.

257
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,273
Just get me the schools!

258
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:48,610
I keep telling them
to stop bringing those.

259
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:49,986
I know. I got these myself.

260
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,697
Oh, thank you. That's sweet.

261
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,283
- Any progress?
- Some, but not enough.

262
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,789
Did you mean it today,
when you raised your hand?

263
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:01,956
No.

264
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,418
But I knew if I did, the others
who wanted to would be less afraid.

265
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:08,588
Is that it? The bill?

266
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:12,342
Yes. They delivered it
just after the cabinet meeting.

267
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:16,053
Maybe I should just sign the damn thing.

268
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:19,474
The longer I wait,
the bigger target I become.

269
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:21,351
Well, the cabinet's working hard.

270
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:23,936
Stick to your guns
and give them some time.

271
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,857
Well, it could turn. Or dissipate.

272
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,110
Hurricane Humberto was
on the same trajectory as Faith.

273
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:33,988
Everyone thought that was gonna
wipe out seven states,

274
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:38,284
but in the end, it turned south
and never became more than a Cat One.

275
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,373
- How good are the chances?
- Extremely poor.

276
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:47,627
But... there's still some hope.

277
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:49,754
Relax for a minute, Francis.

278
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,803
We should cancel the UN ceremony tomorrow.

279
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:59,055
- What?
- Maybe it sends the wrong message.

280
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:02,433
No, it's a great victory for you. For us.

281
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:04,977
But celebrating in the middle
of a crisis, I don't--

282
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,605
Well, that's exactly
what we should be doing.

283
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,649
You made this resolution happen.

284
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:13,820
It's the one good notch we have on our
belt since we moved into the White House.

285
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:17,948
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let this hurricane rob us of that.

286
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,621
"When Congress refused to support
a peacekeeping mission

287
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:27,291
in the Jordan Valley, the president
deployed troops anyway,

288
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:31,003
stating his authority
as Commander in Chief."

289
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,882
"The ramparts of the fort
were still a mile away.

290
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:36,342
But he had reached
the point of no return.

291
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:40,304
Turning back was no longer an option."

292
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:44,434
"With the world's eyes upon him,
he continues to ignore precedent,

293
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:47,771
convention, and some would say the law."

294
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,940
"Why did he
cross that invisible line?

295
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:54,444
Why risk his life despite
the great odds stacked against him?"

296
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:59,741
"Critics have been harsh.
And yet most have stopped short

297
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:03,160
of naming Underwood what he truly is:
a tyrant."

298
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,749
"What drove Napoleon
to keep marching toward Moscow?

299
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:10,501
Or Hannibal to cross the Alps?"

300
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:14,338
"The warning signs are there.
It's our responsibility to heed them."

301
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:17,842
"What kept a young Frank Underwood
swimming onward?

302
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:20,136
And what kept him from drowning?"

303
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,681
How did Seth learn this?

304
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:26,476
- Jackie's comms director.
- And this happened last night?

305
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,895
- From what I can gather.
- So why am I just hearing about it now?

306
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:31,648
- I didn't hear about it before.
- She was trying to keep it a secret.

307
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,483
But you're supposed to be
keeping tabs on her.

308
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:36,026
The fact that you didn't know,
and only found out from Seth--

309
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,195
I'm not in Iowa, sir.
I'm here running your staff.

310
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,155
Excuse me?

311
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:41,240
Just because Jackie and I
have a personal history

312
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,033
doesn't mean I know her every movement.

313
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:45,244
We are not talking about
your ex-girlfriend.

314
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,330
We're talking about my running mate.

315
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:50,792
And if she can't be trusted, I can't force
her to reveal things she doesn't want to.

316
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,377
You convinced me to make the deal with her
in the first place.

317
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:55,421
We needed information. She had access.

318
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:56,923
And now she's lying to us.

319
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:59,592
Maybe you should speak with her
before we consider this a crisis.

320
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,010
I don't like your tone, Remy.

321
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:03,596
- You're blowing this out of proportion.
- Watch yourself.

322
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,808
When I worked for you in Congress, you
always told me to be straight up with you.

323
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,810
I wasn't the president then.

324
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:11,479
So you just want me to apologize
and be a yes-man?

325
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:14,524
I want you to treat this office
with respect.

326
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,192
You owe your staff that same respect.

327
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:18,778
I gave you a position in the White House
when no one would touch you.

328
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:20,738
I don't owe you a damn thing.

329
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:22,532
How long you gonna hang that over my head?

330
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:26,243
- Oh, it's like you want me to fire you.
- You couldn't, and you know it.

331
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,413
Not right now.

332
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:31,582
Seth and I are the only
two soldiers you have.

333
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,588
- Get Jackie on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:05,533
Sir, Congresswoman Sharp calling for you.

335
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:06,993
I'll take it in here.

336
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:15,668
Sir, we'll gladly polish those for you.

337
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,254
I'm happy to do it myself. Thank you.

338
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:19,756
Yes, sir.

339
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:28,180
- Congresswoman.
- I apologize if you hear chewing.

340
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:31,141
This is the first chance I've gotten
to eat all day. Non-stop events.

341
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:34,311
I'm surprised you have an appetite
after meeting with Dunbar.

342
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,484
Her people asked. I said yes.

343
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:43,320
I thought I'd see what she wanted
before bothering you with it.

344
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:46,824
Suspending your campaigns?
I'm assuming that you told her no.

345
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,870
I told her yes.

346
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:56,125
You realize she's just preying upon
your good nature to stop your fundraising.

347
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,211
Even if that were the case,
the politics work in my favor too.

348
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:02,172
It's insensitive to campaign
during a catastrophe this big.

349
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:03,424
It could backfire on me.

350
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:05,927
We don't know that it's
going to be a catastrophe.

351
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,222
Weathermen can be wrong, Mr. President,
but not every weatherman in the country.

352
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,933
All right, even if that's true,

353
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:15,561
you should attack her for using
the hurricane to score sympathy points.

354
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:18,898
I've discussed it with my staff.

355
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:23,235
This isn't just your campaign, Jackie,
this is our campaign.

356
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:29,325
May I offer you some advice, sir?
Sign the bill.

357
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:34,330
If you don't, and the storm hits,
you and I won't have a campaign.

358
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,624
You should get back to your dinner.

359
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:15,913
Hey, everyone. Let's put down the dishes
for a second. I need to talk to you.

360
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:19,542
Here's the deal.
I hired you three under America Works.

361
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,961
And as much as we can use the manpower,

362
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:25,089
I can't afford it
if the program gets ended.

363
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:28,968
I might be able to afford to keep
two of you if you split shifts,

364
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:30,720
but I can't keep all three.

365
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:37,434
"A storm has been forming
not for weeks, but for decades.

366
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:40,021
Its name is not Faith, it's Francis.

367
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:44,316
The entire nation is in his path,
and if we ignore the warning signs,

368
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,737
- we have no one but ourselves to blame.
- "...no one but ourselves to blame."

369
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:51,032
It's not an article.
It's an opinion piece.

370
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:52,700
I know.

371
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:54,994
The paper can't take
this editorial stance.

372
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:57,621
- It's too speculative.
- I'm aware. Print it as a column.

373
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:00,248
The moment I do that,
you cross over to the other side.

374
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:01,709
We can't keep you on your beat.

375
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,878
So replace me.

376
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:05,796
I want a column. It's time.

377
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,757
Kate, you're on track
to be managing editor.

378
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,843
You toss that out the window the moment
you switch over to being a columnist.

379
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:14,931
I don't want to be editing other people's
words. I want to be writing my own.

380
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:17,474
And not just the news,
I want my ideas out there.

381
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:19,977
You know the Telegraph
will let you do anything you want.

382
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:21,979
But we need you reporting
on the president.

383
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:24,565
- Nobody does it better.
- My bias is clear.

384
00:24:24,648 --> 00:24:27,443
You shouldn't keep me on
as a reporter anyway.

385
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:31,030
I'll tell you what. We can make
this work as an analysis piece.

386
00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:34,366
You tone down the speculation,
stick to the facts and quotes--

387
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,493
- Speculation is the entire point.
- Fine.

388
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:40,206
Just... give me a little something
from the other side, to balance it out.

389
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:41,958
You know they're not gonna
give me a quote.

390
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:45,669
Even if it's a source just tangentially
associated with the administration.

391
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:48,965
You do that, we can print this
and keep you as a reporter.

392
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,761
I got an idea who I can talk to.

393
00:24:56,513 --> 00:25:00,768
"On another day, with warmer water,
with the current carrying him,

394
00:25:00,851 --> 00:25:02,186
he might have made it.

395
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,773
But on this day, he would only make it
halfway before his arms gave out

396
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,276
and the numbness overtook him,
before the coast guard

397
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:11,237
pulled him out of the water
despite his protests.

398
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,116
Was he reckless? Was he foolish?

399
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,284
Possibly.

400
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:19,203
One thing can't be denied, however.

401
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:23,666
What others saw as impossible,
he refused to believe as such.

402
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:27,503
The water proved him wrong.
He fell far short of the other shore.

403
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,546
And yet he made the attempt.

404
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,675
And that... is everything."

405
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,432
That's just the prologue.

406
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,148
You don't mention America Works once.

407
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:49,192
On purpose.

408
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:53,361
That is what the book
is supposed to be about, isn't it?

409
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:55,239
You don't like it?

410
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:59,660
I do like it.
I just wonder if I...

411
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:05,373
Well, maybe I don't...
understand what you're trying to do.

412
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:10,378
Nobody cares about an idea.

413
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:13,674
They might care
about a man with an idea.

414
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:16,635
I only care about the man.

415
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:21,473
The whole book will be like this...
these vignettes.

416
00:26:21,557 --> 00:26:24,852
Like a collection of short stories.

417
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:28,272
Do you mention AmWorks anywhere?

418
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:29,690
Nope.

419
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:32,235
Not once.

420
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,698
Well...

421
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:43,620
I did want the book to be different,
but I... It just seems that that might--

422
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:47,375
I think it might be the best thing
I've written in years.

423
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:50,418
It could also be utter and complete shit.

424
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:53,881
But when I can't tell the difference,
it's usually a good sign.

425
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:59,427
I just don't want to lose sight
of the bigger goal.

426
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:01,597
I don't know any other way to write it.

427
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:07,186
If you want something different,
now's the time to find somebody else.

428
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,272
No, I want you to finish it.

429
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,691
Even though I have...

430
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,029
no idea if it will end up
being relevant if I end up...

431
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:20,283
signing this bill.

432
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:21,742
Are you going to?

433
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:25,413
I don't know yet.

434
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:30,960
If I do, of course, I'll pay you in full
if the book becomes unnecessary.

435
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:34,380
I'm not doing this for the paycheck.

436
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:39,302
What do you think?

437
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:41,804
Should I sign it?

438
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,931
Well, I have skin in the game.

439
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,225
So the selfish part of me says no.

440
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,229
But...

441
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:52,940
honestly?

442
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,818
No book is worth people
losing their lives.

443
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:58,195
Yes, but it's not just about the book.

444
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:01,073
It's about putting people back to work.

445
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:03,326
People can't work if they're dead.

446
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:10,458
Well, I'm gonna obviously
be very occupied

447
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,294
by this hurricane
for the foreseeable future.

448
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:14,795
Let me think on this for...

449
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:21,344
You'd better not fuck him over.

450
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:24,180
- Excuse me?
- With what you're writing.

451
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:25,889
I don't intend to.

452
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:28,225
- The part about being foolish?
- You eavesdropping?

453
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,686
- He's not foolish.
- That wasn't my point.

454
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:32,855
I wouldn't take a bullet
for a man who was.

455
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,318
Let's go, your car's waiting.

456
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:44,241
As of tomorrow, Congresswoman Sharp
and I are suspending our campaigns.

457
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:47,536
We will be traveling to areas
affected by Hurricane Faith,

458
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:50,789
along with our campaign staff,
in order to volunteer

459
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:53,709
in whatever capacity is most helpful.

460
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,086
We're also suspending any donations,

461
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,839
and urge our supporters
to donate to the Red Cross

462
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:01,300
and other hurricane relief agencies.

463
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:05,637
In times of suffering,
it's important to suspend politics

464
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:08,265
and do what's best for the country.

465
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,476
We look forward to resuming our campaigns

466
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,979
when the storm has cleared
and the people of the east coast are safe.

467
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:19,026
Freddy?

468
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:25,115
The President would
like to see you, Mr. Hayes.

469
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,576
I still got two hours left on my shift.

470
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,953
It's fine, Freddy. You can go.

471
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:33,665
Do you mind if I bring my grandson?

472
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:36,752
Daycare got shut down 'cause of the storm.

473
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:38,837
Of course. We got a car waiting.

474
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,007
Come on, DeShawn.

475
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,845
We going to see the president.

476
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,518
Freddy.

477
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:58,524
- It's good to see you, Frank.
- Thank you for coming.

478
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:02,403
And this must be DeShawn.
How are you, sir?

479
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:05,864
Oh. That is a firm handshake you have.

480
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:08,409
Well, you want to go over
and sit at the desk?

481
00:30:09,118 --> 00:30:10,411
Go ahead.

482
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:22,089
Yeah, I do that too, sometimes.

483
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,052
That desk might be yours one day.

484
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:29,179
Would you like to be the president?

485
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:31,223
Yeah.

486
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:34,602
Well, to be president,
you have to get good grades in school.

487
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:37,313
Now, I see you brought
some of your schoolwork with you.

488
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:39,607
I have an office
just around the corner in here,

489
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:41,775
maybe you'd like
to go do your work in there.

490
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:46,113
Or we also have a PlayStation
if you'd rather play that.

491
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:48,240
- What games you got?
- Oh, we have plenty of games.

492
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:49,908
Meechum will show you.

493
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:02,004
What can I get for you?
Coffee, a soda, a beer?

494
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,340
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- Please sit down.

495
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,055
- You signed up for America Works.
- I did.

496
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:15,976
I've got 40,000 case studies
just like yours.

497
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:20,564
And I also have a bill on my desk that's
gonna cut the funding for all 40,000.

498
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:22,483
Yeah, I been following on the news.

499
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,109
I'm gonna sign it.

500
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:26,820
There's too many lives at stake
with this storm.

501
00:31:26,903 --> 00:31:28,614
Sounds like the right thing to do.

502
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:33,076
Freddy, you deserve a job, and Congress
is forcing me to take it away.

503
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,120
I've spoken to our head of operations,

504
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:37,623
and if you want it,
there's a job for you here.

505
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:40,543
- Now, it's not charity, but--
- What's the pay?

506
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:42,419
Well, I don't know the exact figures,

507
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:45,005
but I figure somewhere around
three grand a month.

508
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:47,550
- I know that's not great, but I--
- Healthcare?

509
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,593
Well, yes, of course. That's included.

510
00:31:49,677 --> 00:31:52,888
- For DeShawn, too?
- That's right. All dependents.

511
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:55,474
- What's the job?
- The kitchen.

512
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:57,476
Helping prep food for the chefs.

513
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,937
Well, as long as it's, you know,
above 2,800 a month.

514
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:04,441
That's what I need to make my rent and
make sure DeShawn has everything he needs.

515
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:07,277
I'll put you in touch
with the head chef right away.

516
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:10,698
I was wondering...
if you had anything else?

517
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,783
- Besides the kitchen.
- Well, I just assumed that--

518
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:16,161
I've been working in kitchens
my whole life.

519
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:19,456
Just 'cause I owned a rib joint
don't mean I like working in 'em.

520
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,251
Well, what would you rather do?

521
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,211
You got groundskeepers out there.

522
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:28,757
I noticed 'em choppin' branches when
we were driving in, for the hurricane.

523
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,093
You'd prefer that?

524
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:33,512
Always wanted to work outside.

525
00:32:33,596 --> 00:32:36,348
Well, I'm sure that something
can be arranged.

526
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:40,977
I want to be president one day.

527
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:44,231
- Well, that's never gonna happen.
- But he said I could be.

528
00:32:44,314 --> 00:32:47,067
Listen up, boy. He lied to you.

529
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,986
The truth is,
you ain't never gonna be president.

530
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,865
It's just like them basketball players
you got posters of.

531
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:56,868
They say you can do anything,
be a superstar, too.

532
00:32:56,952 --> 00:33:00,289
But they were born to be seven feet tall
and if they wasn't,

533
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:02,040
tell me what would they have?

534
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,292
Nothing.

535
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,420
Half of them can't even read a damn book.

536
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:08,964
No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.

537
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:13,552
It's good to have dreams,
just so long as they're not fantasies.

538
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:16,430
You let anybody sell you that shit,
it's your own damn fault.

539
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:18,724
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you, Pop.

540
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,577
I'll get it to the House right away.

541
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:40,996
- Green light on the release?
- Yes.

542
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:51,047
I don't remember giving you
my phone number.

543
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:55,218
You didn't. Your publisher did.
He wants me to write a book.

544
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:57,721
I'm surprised you never have.

545
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:01,475
I'm sure any book you wrote
would do ten times what mine do.

546
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:03,935
Not as much as Scorpio.

547
00:34:05,604 --> 00:34:07,564
As any I've written since.

548
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:09,566
I read it in college.

549
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,068
Did it change your life?

550
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,903
That's what you hear
all day long, isn't it?

551
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:17,073
If I still got recognized on the street,
which I don't.

552
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:20,828
Mostly at book signings, which I don't
recommend if you write your book.

553
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,830
I didn't ask you here
to discuss my book.

554
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:24,956
- No?
- I want to discuss yours.

555
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,124
Oh...

556
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,545
I'm working on a piece,
and it won't go to print

557
00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:32,047
unless I get a comment
from the White House.

558
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,590
I'm not a part of the White House.

559
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:38,053
Doesn't even have to be a quote, just
something... that I can paraphrase, like,

560
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:41,056
"According to someone
close to the administration..."

561
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,726
- Doesn't have to be on the record.
- I'm not commenting on the book.

562
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:46,144
Tom, you got access no one else has.

563
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:50,106
For a reason. 'Cause he knows
I won't talk. Especially to you.

564
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:54,862
Well, can I buy you a drink?

565
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:56,446
Getting me drunk won't work.

566
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,449
You came out to meet me here.
I owe you one.

567
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:02,285
Why don't I buy you a drink?

568
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,248
How about we have a few?

569
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,251
A few.

570
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:10,960
I can live with that.

571
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,220
I'm so sorry, Francis.
I know how hard this is.

572
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:23,223
It was out of my hands.
I can't control the weather.

573
00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:25,434
Still.

574
00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:30,606
What frustrates me more than anything
is we were starting to turn the ship.

575
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:33,483
I was getting support in Congress.
A few more months...

576
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:37,279
and the leadership would've had no choice
but to support America Works.

577
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,618
Well, if it's any solace,
Cathy just called.

578
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:45,495
The Russians are willing
to contribute troops.

579
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,122
To the peacekeeping force?

580
00:35:47,205 --> 00:35:49,374
They don't want to be left out.

581
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,126
No catch, no conditions?

582
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:54,087
None. There's too much pressure
on them in the UN.

583
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,131
So the isolation worked.

584
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:58,675
They're sending 300 troops.

585
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:00,636
That's incredible.

586
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,807
- We did it.
- Oh, no, not we. It was all you.

587
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,183
- Join me for dinner?
- I'm gonna turn in.

588
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,268
This early, huh?

589
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:11,062
I'm gonna be up three straight days
once this hurricane hits.

590
00:36:11,146 --> 00:36:12,981
I need to get all the sleep I can.

591
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:16,151
That's a good idea.
I'll leave you be.

592
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:23,826
Have one of the stewards wake me
when it hits the coast.

593
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:45,221
Francis.

594
00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:48,350
Francis?

595
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:54,606
Where did it make landfall?

596
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,108
- It didn't.
- What?

597
00:36:57,192 --> 00:36:58,694
The hurricane turned.

598
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:05,659
It's due east now.
It might hit Bermuda.

599
00:37:05,742 --> 00:37:09,621
But it'll, uh, dissipate quickly
now that it's reaching colder water.

600
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:12,123
It looks like we dodged a bullet,
Mr. President.

601
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:15,418
I barely got the money in time
for a halfway decent response.

602
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,179
How do we pull back on the bill?

603
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:28,264
Already delivered to Congress,
we put out a release.

604
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:31,351
There must be some parliamentary procedure
that will nullify my signature.

605
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:32,978
I checked with the White House counsel.

606
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:36,231
The bill is officially law
and the money's already been appropriated.

607
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:45,991
FEMA is assisting thousands
of evacuees returning to their homes.

608
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:49,745
With the exception of moderate flooding in
Georgia due to rain from the outer bands,

609
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:53,623
the rest of the Eastern Seaboard
was left virtually untouched

610
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:57,126
by the hurricane everyone expected
to be the storm of the century.

611
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,547
The biggest casualty to Faith
was not life or property, however,

612
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,551
but rather President Underwood's
controversial America Works plan,

613
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:07,345
which Congress defunded
in order to free up resources

614
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:09,389
for storm-related disaster relief.

615
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:12,976
The president himself signed
the emergency appropriation into law

616
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,064
after facing immense pressure
from both parties and the media.

617
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:21,359
So you're out of a job, I guess.

618
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:26,239
Probably. Wouldn't be the first time.

619
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:31,703
If it makes you feel any better, there's
no way my story'll get printed now.

620
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:34,205
Why? Because I wouldn't give you a quote?

621
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:38,001
- No, it was a whole hurricane metaphor.
- Hm...

622
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:41,046
Kind of takes the wind out of the sails
if there's no hurricane.

623
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:43,423
Well...

624
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,427
at least you got laid.

625
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,098
Yep. That... that's poetic.

626
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,559
Yeah. I'm a writer.

627
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:56,144
Yeah.

628
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:08,698
- What is it?
- I gotta go.

629
00:39:08,782 --> 00:39:10,867
Is that your way of getting rid of me?

630
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:13,369
No. It's the president.

631
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:22,629
I'm gonna need the shirt back.

632
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:35,642
If you asked me over to let me go,
it wasn't necessary.

633
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:38,436
- But I appreciate the thoughtfulness.
- I'm not letting you go.

634
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,271
This book is more important now than ever.

635
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:42,691
But... America Works is done.

636
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:45,527
Well, there's only one way
to get it back on track.

637
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,030
I'm announcing my candidacy for 2016.

638
00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:49,865
- Wow.
- I couldn't run before.

639
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:52,534
I didn't have the money and I didn't
have the leadership's backing.

640
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:54,911
But now that I've proven
what AmWorks can do,

641
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:57,413
the money and the support will be there.

642
00:39:57,497 --> 00:40:00,876
A vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works.

643
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,419
- You were right.
- How was I right?

644
00:40:04,462 --> 00:40:06,798
Come over here,
take a look out the window.

645
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:14,181
- You see that man working over there?
- Mm-hm.

646
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:16,641
- That's Freddy Hayes.
- The ribs guy?

647
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:20,645
- He's a groundskeeper now.
- That's generous of you.

648
00:40:20,729 --> 00:40:23,065
No, it wasn't. It's my job.

649
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:26,735
You wrote that I refuse to see
the impossible as impossible.

650
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:28,611
Freddy is one job.

651
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:30,947
I have ten million more to go.

652
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:34,076
That's my story
and that's why you were right.

653
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,536
So you wanna get back to work?

654
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,121
I'm in.

655
00:40:38,872 --> 00:40:41,917
Now? I don't have my notebook.

656
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:44,836
Oh, um...

657
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:51,509
The pen I signed the bill with.

658
00:40:54,096 --> 00:40:56,139
All right. Let's do it.

659
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:58,516
I never tried to swim to Fort Sumter.

660
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,895
Thomas probably knows I made it up,
but he wrote about it anyway

661
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:04,231
because he understands the greater truth:

662
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:07,692
imagination is its own form of courage.

663
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:11,279
Let's talk more about that swim.

664
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:14,157
I really did come
this close to drowning.

665
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,902
