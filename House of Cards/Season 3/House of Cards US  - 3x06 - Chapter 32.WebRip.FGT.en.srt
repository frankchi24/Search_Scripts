2
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,623
More water, ma'am?

3
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,333
Yes, please.

4
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,502
How much longer, Ben?

5
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,546
Estimated four hours and 16 minutes.

6
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,424
Some breakfast, maybe? The usual?

7
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,926
That would be wonderful. Thank you.

8
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,177
Only about an hour until sunrise.

9
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,931
Last chance for those Northern Lights.

10
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,983
I could tell you about working
at a movie theater, some paper route.

11
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,026
Riding my bicycle five miles

12
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,446
to deliver seven papers
for ten dollars a month, but...

13
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,448
the truth is,
I didn't have a bicycle,

14
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,118
and I spent more time sneaking
into the movie theater

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,662
- than tearing tickets.
- So what was it, then?

16
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:43,790
My first job?
Oh, that can't go in the book.

17
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,667
Why not?

18
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,878
I worked for a man
who grew cannabis in the back woods.

19
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,047
A weed dealer?

20
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:52,674
No, a farmer. Uncle Henry.

21
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:55,135
He wasn't my uncle, but that's
just what everybody called him.

22
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,846
- What did you do for Uncle Henry?
- I packaged the product.

23
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,848
For some reason,
he trusted me with the scales.

24
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,892
Mm. And did you...
partake of the product?

25
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:05,020
No. Good old Uncle Henry,

26
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:08,397
he fertilized his crop
from his own septic tank.

27
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:09,482
Oh...

28
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,068
But it was a good job, though.
I saved up a lot of money.

29
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:15,279
It's how I bought all my books
my entire four years at The Sentinel.

30
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,700
Tell me about The Sentinel.

31
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,955
What was your first job?

32
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:27,709
No, no. Book's not about me.

33
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,797
The hustler in Scorpio.

34
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,758
That was you, wasn't it?

35
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,426
What makes you think that?

36
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,888
Don't writers write what they know?

37
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,642
The hustler's based on a friend of mine.

38
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,352
I didn't turn tricks.

39
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,065
I just... waited in the hotel lobbies
in case he got into trouble.

40
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,817
Tough life for a teenager.

41
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,153
Better than digging around in Dumpsters.

42
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,822
What happened to him? Your friend?

43
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,490
He died.

44
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,826
Was it AIDS, like in the book?

45
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,870
Suicide.

46
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,415
Why didn't you write it that way?

47
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,584
Because it was fiction.

48
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,879
Because... suicide is too selfish.

49
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,092
Let's talk later.

50
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,177
I have a few things
I gotta run over with Claire.

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,803
Sure.

52
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,432
It's a tight schedule, so we may not
be able to speak until the flight back.

53
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,227
No worries. First time in Moscow.

54
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,562
I've got a date with Gorky Park
and Swan Lake.

55
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,985
How's it going?

56
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,071
Cathy emailed me the statement.

57
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,490
We got the Kremlin
to tone down the language.

58
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,750
Do you think Corrigan will say it?

59
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,461
I'm sure he'll hate every word,
but if it means coming home...

60
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,504
The only reason that
Petrov is considering this

61
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,548
is because we have leverage in the UN.

62
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:01,302
You're both confident
that this is rock solid?

63
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,805
If Petrov doesn't cooperate,
the Secretary-General

64
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,557
will call an emergency session
the moment we land in the States.

65
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,851
Let's hope we don't
have to play that card.

66
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,604
Just don't give too much away.

67
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,982
Oh, listen, he's been marginalized
in the Security Council,

68
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,818
he's detaining an American citizen,
he wants to wash his hands of.

69
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,487
I think we'll find that we're dealing
with a much more reasonable man

70
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,405
than the one that visited Washington.

71
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,075
We fly back with a peacekeeping deal
and Corrigan.

72
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,827
Lemons to lemonade.

73
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,538
I think we should give Corrigan
our suite on the way back,

74
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,415
give him some privacy from the press.

75
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,875
Yeah, that's a good idea.

76
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,211
- Have you slept at all?
- No.

77
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,255
- Eaten anything?
- Not yet.

78
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,215
Here.

79
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:43,761
Come see this.

80
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,275
Isn't it the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

81
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,004
Earth to Max.

82
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,883
- Hey.
- You seem distracted.

83
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,885
Yeah, maybe a little.

84
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,178
Is it Kara?

85
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,680
Kara? What?

86
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,474
You should ask her out.
I know she'd say yes.

87
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,853
It'd be good for you.
Meet new people.

88
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,938
I can't. I don't trust myself yet.

89
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,566
What do you mean?

90
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,947
Hey, Max. Tell me.

91
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,616
You promise you won't judge?

92
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,409
I won't, I promise.

93
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,622
Well, after she left,

94
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:57,210
there were a lot of nights
of drugs and women.

95
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:00,046
And some of the women,
I don't even remember.

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,882
And Kara's a nice girl, so...

97
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,927
- But you're not that person anymore.
- There were some dangerous situations.

98
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,470
It was all really fucked up
and I wasn't always safe.

99
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,933
- Well, have you gotten tested?
- No.

100
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,601
Well, then you need to be tested.

101
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,186
I know, but it scares
the shit out of me.

102
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,021
Well, sure.
Do you want me to go with you?

103
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:18,398
No, I don't.

104
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,691
There's a clinic in Towson.
Plenty of my friends go there.

105
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,861
- You just walk--
- I get it! I get it.

106
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,114
I could go with you tomorrow
if you want me to.

107
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,491
- I don't need a mother.
- Hey, I'm not trying to mother you.

108
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,620
I just-- I care about you
and I want you to be safe.

109
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,664
Just--

110
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:37,292
Max.

111
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,626
Max!

112
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:06,695
Oh...

113
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,545
Thank you for releasing Mr.
Corrigan. It means a great deal to us.

114
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,048
And I'm sure a great deal
to his loved ones.

115
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:29,177
We all want the same things.
This is just a first step.

116
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,431
Mr. Litsky, my chief of staff,
will escort you to the facilities.

117
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,392
- Shall we?
- Mr. President.

118
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,519
- Thank you.
- After you.

119
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,162
So... we start over.

120
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,290
As though we meet
for the first time. Hm?

121
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,709
Please.

122
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:13,346
- Promise him a prison.
- A prison?

123
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,556
A brand new federal
corrections facility.

124
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,142
Why would his constituents
want convicts in their backyard?

125
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,644
They don't.
They do want jobs in their backyard.

126
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,232
He's been trying to get federal funding
for years. Birch has fought him on it.

127
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,942
Tell him you'll get Birch
to come around. If that doesn't work,

128
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:30,154
hint there might be a place for him
as Transportation Secretary.

129
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,156
He's owned by the auto industry.

130
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,117
His stance on carbon emissions
is deplorable.

131
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,661
Then balance him out
with whoever you have running the EPA.

132
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,789
I am not ready to make
cabinet commitments this early on.

133
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,209
It's not a commitment.
You're just open to considering him.

134
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,045
Doug? We should get started.

135
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:49,631
Use the auto industry to your advantage.
Whoever Winkowski supports,

136
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,968
every superdelegate backed
by Ford and Chrysler follows.

137
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,636
And if that doesn't work,

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,849
tell him you're considering Dick Butler
for Transportation. He hates Butler.

139
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,185
I gotta go.
Let me know what he says.

140
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,897
You're here to work on your body,
not work on your work.

141
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,732
When the boss calls...

142
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,651
Well, while you're on my turf,
I'm the boss.

143
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,904
Let's get in there
and lie down on the mat.

144
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,489
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,056
- Michael.
- Mrs. Underwood.

146
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,475
Claire.

147
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,822
You've been treated well?

148
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,283
Very well, as you can see.

149
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,659
Thank you, Mr. Litsky,

150
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,828
but I'd like to hear it
from Mr. Corrigan.

151
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,831
Yes, they've treated me well.

152
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,835
- You've seen a doctor?
- I have. Yesterday.

153
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,630
- You look thin.
- I've always been thin.

154
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:16,511
The president asked me to see you
in person to share the good news.

155
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,846
The terms of your release
have been finalized.

156
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,432
We'll be bringing you home
with us tomorrow.

157
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,435
I thought you'd be pleased.

158
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,521
What are the terms?

159
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,398
There will be a joint press conference.

160
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:34,028
- With Petrov?
- Yes, both presidents.

161
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,948
The agreement asks
that you make a brief statement.

162
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:43,663
I'm sorry, um, the type
is too small and I don't have glasses.

163
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,625
- We offered glasses to Mr. Corrigan--
- They did.

164
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,126
Mine broke during the arrest.

165
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,547
The other inmates don't get glasses.
I didn't want special treatment.

166
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,758
We provide glasses to anyone
who needs them, Russian or American.

167
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,844
That is a lie.

168
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,680
I will read it.

169
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,933
It says, "I, Michael Corrigan,
apologize to the citizens

170
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,853
of the Russian Federation
for breaking your laws.

171
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:12,567
I regret my part in exposing minors
to nontraditional sexual attitudes.

172
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:18,072
I am grateful to President Petrov
for the clemency my release demonstrates,

173
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:22,243
and for allowing me to return
to the United States."

174
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,743
Who wrote it?

175
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,663
It's the result of extended negotiations

176
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,873
between representatives
of the State Department

177
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,501
and the Russian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.

178
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,378
I'm sorry, I can't say it.

179
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,214
I know it's far from ideal, Michael.

180
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,343
There is no ideal.
Other than repealing the law.

181
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,890
May we have a moment?

182
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,019
President Petrov asked me
to remain with you.

183
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,146
And I'm asking you to give us a moment.

184
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,450
Mr. Litsky?
I'm assuming this cell is bugged?

185
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,536
I know nothing about the facilities.

186
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,038
- Where is it?
- Mrs. Underwood.

187
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,668
If Mr. Corrigan and I
are to speak privately,

188
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:15,879
I would like to be assured
that it is truly private.

189
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,381
Show me where the bug is.

190
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,779
Thank you.

191
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,168
They're not going to repeal the law.

192
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,504
The statement is a prerequisite
for your release.

193
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,714
There are no negotiations here, Michael.

194
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,591
That part already happened.

195
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:04,052
- What about the 27 others?
- They're not American.

196
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,639
Well, if they're not gonna be released,
neither should I.

197
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,517
There's nothing we can do for them.

198
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,646
You're the First Lady,
and the ambassador to the United Nations.

199
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,939
And you're telling me there's
nothing you can do?

200
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,566
I refuse to believe that.

201
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,736
Michael, it was hard enough
to negotiate just for your release.

202
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,489
You'll have to drag me out of here
because I'm not giving that statement.

203
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,157
It's just words.

204
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,661
Words you can disown
the moment you're back on US soil.

205
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:32,873
Petrov's gay propaganda law?
That's just words, too.

206
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,294
So, command and control rotation.

207
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:40,756
Semi-annually, after the first year.
We pushed for immediate rotation,

208
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,966
- but the Israelis have--
- No, of course.

209
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,677
We need to earn their trust.

210
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,970
But we would never make
any major decisions

211
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,930
without consulting your generals first.

212
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,851
As long as there is transparency
and communication.

213
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,769
Well, that's the key
to this entire enterprise.

214
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:57,815
Mm-hm. Then after the first year
is fine and, uh...

215
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,609
troop numbers look agreeable,

216
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,904
are you sure you can procure
this many on your end?

217
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,073
Yes. I don't need Congress for that.

218
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,659
No, but the funding.

219
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:11,203
It comes out of the DOD budget
like any regular deployment.

220
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:15,249
Now, infrastructure
and logistical supplies for your troops,

221
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,627
well, we can add that expense
as ancillary support.

222
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,003
Hm. We can pitch in.

223
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,923
Well, whatever you could spare
would certainly be welcome.

224
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,927
Hm. But... that brings us
to the elephant in the room.

225
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,346
- Missile defense.
- Mm-hm.

226
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,807
Now, I can accept
a partial scale-back in Poland.

227
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:34,226
And it doesn't have to be... announced.

228
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,271
But we need to consider
the Czech Republic.

229
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,774
Tell me your concerns.

230
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,384
Your wife values privacy.

231
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,177
Excuse me?

232
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,932
We were talking missile defense.

233
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,975
Why did you bring up Claire?

234
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,270
She's... talking privately to Corrigan.

235
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,816
- It's no matter.
- Is there something wrong?

236
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,525
I hope not.

237
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:28,155
Now, missile defense.

238
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,616
A statement
for the Russian media.

239
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,202
- That's all it is.
- Let me ask you something.

240
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:37,122
Would you read that statement
if you were me?

241
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,999
Yes, I would.

242
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,878
You'd thank a man who says
you're dangerous to children?

243
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:47,215
You don't have to mean it.
You just have to say it.

244
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:56,433
I went on a hunger strike for six days.

245
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,520
Then I stopped.

246
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,399
Too hungry.
I couldn't go on.

247
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:08,696
One of the others that, uh,
I was arrested with, Sergei,

248
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,281
hung in there for 28 days.

249
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,410
They decided to force-feed him,

250
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,372
and they finally agreed
to let his mother visit.

251
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:22,042
Turns out it was too late,
on both counts.

252
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,211
Lots of news stories about me.

253
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,964
None about Sergei.

254
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,300
A man dies
and it's like nothing happened.

255
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,178
Because he's Russian.

256
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,850
I can't abandon the others in here.

257
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,144
Or the millions of people out there

258
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,272
who are told the way
they are born is wrong.

259
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,651
But back home,
you can share Sergei's story.

260
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,029
That doesn't do anything
for him or the others.

261
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,336
We will drag you out if necessary.
You don't have any power over that.

262
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,382
But the one thing I do have power over
is not making that statement.

263
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,759
Okay.

264
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,347
What if I can get them
to change the line

265
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,558
about nontraditional sexual attitudes?

266
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,227
- That's what bothers you most, right?
- You can't parse this.

267
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,230
- It's all or nothing.
- That's not how politics works.

268
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,233
But it's how revolution works!

269
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,987
How are things going?

270
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,033
May I speak with you for a moment?

271
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,640
- What are you up to?
- What do you mean?

272
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,058
Corrigan.

273
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,895
- Tell me what's wrong.
- You wanted him to refuse.

274
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,314
To embarrass me. Your wife told him
not to make the statement.

275
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,943
- That is ludicrous.
- You came here with false intentions.

276
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,779
No. Viktor, we knew
that he might be stubborn.

277
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,239
But this is a man with strong beliefs.

278
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,246
This statement is important to me.

279
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,500
Well, if anything, Claire
is trying to convince him to make it.

280
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,670
Then why did she ask for the
surveillance audio to be removed?

281
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,297
I don't know.

282
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,299
Perhaps so he wouldn't feel on the spot.

283
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,802
But, look, I wouldn't worry
about this just yet.

284
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,720
Claire is very persuasive.

285
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,555
Let me be very clear.

286
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,350
If there is no statement,
there is no deal on any front.

287
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,811
Not between us. Not for him.

288
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,522
He gets tried, convicted, sentenced.

289
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,945
Now, I asked Mr. Litsky
to inform them both.

290
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,656
I have complete confidence in my wife.

291
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,368
And Viktor, you must know,
this isn't part of any plan.

292
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,412
That's it.

293
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,678
There's no flexibility
with regard to the statement.

294
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,847
You don't cooperate, you go to trial.

295
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,766
Good. They can't keep me
from speaking in court.

296
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,269
What about your husband?

297
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,773
You've spoken to John?

298
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,775
I let him know we were hopeful.

299
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,572
How is he?

300
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,365
He's worried about you.

301
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,789
He wanted to come with us, but that
wasn't possible, for obvious reasons.

302
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:51,418
I promised to call after I saw you.

303
00:20:55,338 --> 00:21:00,427
I was thinking... you'd call instead.
From Air Force One.

304
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,387
He'll understand.

305
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,224
He misses you, Michael.

306
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,894
I miss him. I miss a lot of things.

307
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,521
My parents. My friends. My dog.

308
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,108
More than two square feet of sunlight.

309
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:17,694
But it's the life we chose.
It's what our bond is built on.

310
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,448
John has been very vocal back home.
All he talks about is your release.

311
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,787
You're causing him pain.
And you don't have to.

312
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,706
And he didn't have to marry me.

313
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,002
- That's selfish.
- Maybe.

314
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:37,589
But so is contradicting everything
I believe in just to get out of this cell.

315
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:41,551
I think what you're doing
is more selfish. It's about ego.

316
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,387
Proving something to yourself.

317
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,348
And a man back home
is hurting because of it.

318
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,310
John is weak.
He'd say the statement in a heartbeat

319
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,187
if he spent more
than a few days in here,

320
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,022
which is why I'm here and he's not.

321
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,066
If he thinks I'm being selfish, so what?

322
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,069
Either he accepts it or he doesn't.
Isn't that what marriage is about?

323
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:02,906
Accepting your partner's selfishness?
You of all people should understand.

324
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,950
You know nothing about marriage.

325
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,203
You think it's about... sacrifice?

326
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:12,582
I think it's about respect.

327
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,960
And you're not respecting his pain.

328
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,921
- His pain doesn't matter.
- How can you say that?

329
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,547
Because mine doesn't either.

330
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,718
You know what I've been asking myself
ever since the hunger strike?

331
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,014
Am I truly willing to die for this?

332
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,683
I don't know the answer
to that question.

333
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,019
But at least I have something
that I care enough about

334
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,687
to even ask the question.

335
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,732
Have you asked that of yourself?

336
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,194
What are you willing to die for?

337
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,158
Are you ready yet, Mrs. Underwood?

338
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,161
Not yet.

339
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,496
How much longer, if I might?

340
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,457
Please inform the president

341
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,461
I won't be leaving
until Mr. Corrigan comes with me.

342
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:02,049
- You can't stay here, Mrs. Underwood--
- Pass along the message, would you?

343
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,925
We can't have the First Lady staying--

344
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,678
You're not going to forcibly remove me.

345
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,805
So, please, do as I ask.

346
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,230
What are you doing?
Viktor is beside himself.

347
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,732
You need to convince him
to let go of the statement.

348
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,984
Look, you have to assume
we're being overheard.

349
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,485
This is not a secure line.

350
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,364
Anything I'm saying, I'd say
to Petrov himself if he were here.

351
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,407
I thought you were convincing Corrigan
to make the statement.

352
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:32,537
Francis, I'm doing my best, but we need
to come at this from both sides.

353
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,290
Well, he's adamant. He's not gonna
back down and I don't blame him.

354
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,833
Corrigan's adamant, too.

355
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,211
The entire deal hinges on this.

356
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,255
Now, Viktor made it very clear
what his needs are,

357
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,758
- and we made promises before we--
- I'm trying to salvage the situation.

358
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:48,095
There isn't much time. We're scheduled
to get back on the plane tomorrow

359
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,930
and the press expects Michael
to get on with us.

360
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,598
Viktor, if you're listening to this,

361
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,600
please know I'm advocating
on your behalf.

362
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,353
But you might want
to consider letting the statement go.

363
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,437
He's not gonna do it, Claire.

364
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,731
Just talk to him, Francis.

365
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,359
If he won't let it go,
see if he'll tone it down some more.

366
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,694
He doesn't want all of this
to fall apart either.

367
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,030
All right. I'll see what I can do.

368
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,656
I'll keep you posted.

369
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:17,749
- Oh, this is great. Thank you.
- Uh-huh. If I could have a receipt...

370
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,171
- Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.
- I appreciate it.

371
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,673
Hey, Max.

372
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,384
I'm here at the clinic.

373
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,593
Are you okay? You sound--

374
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,596
I'm scared. They're about to take
the blood sample. Can you come?

375
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,223
Please, I'm really scared, Lisa.

376
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,977
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

377
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,271
Yeah. Just hold tight.

378
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,901
Hey, um, I need to go.
Do you mind taking care of all this?

379
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,070
- Mm-hm.
- Okay, thank you.

380
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,490
Good news, Mr. Orsay.
You're negative on all fronts.

381
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,618
There are the results, for your records.

382
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,246
I've got some literature if you like,
on protection,

383
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,499
preventative strategies,
how to avoid high-risk encounters.

384
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,003
No, thank you, I'm... I'm good.

385
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,759
Yeah, actually, I will take those.

386
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,218
I'm positive.

387
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:05,065
I just I can't--
I can't be alone right now.

388
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,068
Come with me. Come with me.

389
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,444
Okay?

390
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,830
- Stamper.
- You're good.

391
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:21,956
He said yes?

392
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,876
Took a couple of hours,
but he's on board.

393
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,337
Did you have to bring up Butler?

394
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,506
- The prison was enough.
- Great.

395
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,009
- Who's your next target?
- Willis Morrison, Twelfth District.

396
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,345
Ohio. I have his file at home.

397
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,013
I'll call you in an hour.

398
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,559
Surprise, surprise.
You're on the phone again.

399
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,562
I'm on my time now, not yours.

400
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,979
You outta here?

401
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,107
Yeah, you were my last appointment.

402
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,775
Did that work today help?

403
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,777
It did. I feel great.

404
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,446
Well, you're making great progress.

405
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,364
And when you're fully recovered,
you know,

406
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,783
we'll have that cell phone
surgically removed from your ear.

407
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,911
See you later.

408
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:11,172
But isn't it even more powerful
coming from me?

409
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,841
It would ring hollow.
The words must come from him.

410
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,136
But no one will believe
he means them, anyway.

411
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,845
Whether he means them doesn't matter.

412
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:20,848
The fact that he says them
shows respect for our laws.

413
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:25,353
I wish he'd make the damn statement too,
and maybe he will. But if he doesn't,

414
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:29,149
you're willing to let all the work we've
accomplished today go down the drain

415
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,734
because of one loud-mouth protester

416
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:35,029
over a law you can't
possibly believe in?

417
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,491
No, you're right.
I don't believe in it.

418
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,784
Two of my cabinet ministers are gay.

419
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,911
My ex-wife's nephew is gay,

420
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,331
the one who is basically
like a son to me.

421
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,873
Personally, I don't care.

422
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:50,462
So if you don't care, let's haul him out
and put him on the plane.

423
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:54,799
Look, I don't want our deal
to fall apart any more than you do.

424
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,717
Your wife was right on the phone.

425
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:01,806
But there is more than just our deal
for me to consider.

426
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,517
I need to show strength.

427
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,852
No one's going to see this as a weakness.

428
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:09,356
On the contrary,
you'll be applauded for letting him go.

429
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,774
By who? Hm? The West?

430
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,402
You don't understand Russia,
Mr. President.

431
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:18,739
If people don't like the job you're
doing, they vote you out of office.

432
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:21,660
If they don't like the job I'm doing,
they topple statues.

433
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,911
Blood is spilled.
Chaos takes over.

434
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,665
Is the gay propaganda law barbaric? Yes.

435
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,208
Of course it is.

436
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,337
But religion, tradition,

437
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,798
for most of my people,
it's in their bones.

438
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,426
This law was passed for them.

439
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:43,264
I have to represent my people
the same way you do.

440
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,725
And if there is no cost
to Corrigan's actions,

441
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,436
many of my people will feel betrayed.

442
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,107
There won't be a revolution
because you freed one man.

443
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:57,862
Revolution sneaks up on you,
one small step at a time.

444
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:03,660
I don't take chances,
even with the smallest of steps.

445
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:16,673
No stone left unturned
when the First Lady's in town.

446
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,094
Can I ask you something?

447
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,803
If you pass the salt.

448
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,435
How did Michael Corrigan
become Michael Corrigan?

449
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:31,187
- Gay?
- An activist.

450
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,398
I'm sure you got a briefing
from the FBI.

451
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:36,192
Yes, but I would like
to hear it from you.

452
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,573
A friend of mine,
and this is in the early '90s,

453
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:45,577
she invited me to go with her
to a community organizing meeting.

454
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,496
I had nothing better to do,
so I said okay.

455
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,916
We get there and there's maybe
12 people in the room, tops.

456
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,501
It was pretty sad, actually.

457
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:58,339
And the guy speaking
is talking about garbage.

458
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,675
- Garbage?
- Recycling.

459
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,304
And the guy is putting
all 12 of us to sleep.

460
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:08,725
What he was saying made sense,
but... zero charisma.

461
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,103
It was worse: anti-charisma.

462
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,773
But I noticed
he had this habit of, uh...

463
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,693
tilting his head when he was
making an important point.

464
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:22,113
It was...
it was so endearing.

465
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,199
It was like this.

466
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,286
Like...

467
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,871
I couldn't help it. I fell in love
with him right then and there.

468
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,582
This was John?

469
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:37,837
A long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away.

470
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,089
Well, he's pretty charismatic on TV.

471
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:42,967
He learned charisma.
I learned how to think.

472
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,679
We rubbed off on each other well.

473
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,597
I didn't know you'd been
together so long.

474
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,015
Twenty-one years.

475
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:52,852
Only been married for five
because, well, we couldn't earlier.

476
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,815
Francis and I just celebrated 28.

477
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,608
Over half your life.

478
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,321
That's true.
I haven't even thought about that.

479
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,782
You were young.

480
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,450
Twenty-two.

481
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,370
You ever regret it?

482
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:14,999
No. No. I love Francis.

483
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,376
Now more than ever.

484
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,378
I regret it.

485
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,549
Committing to someone
before I even knew who I was.

486
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:26,511
We didn't take legal vows,
but we had our own version.

487
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:29,305
- Stupid.
- Why?

488
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,059
Because all I've ever done is hurt him.

489
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:37,772
Um, kept him in my shadow,
cheated on him, you name it.

490
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:41,901
Well, it's the history that counts,
not the other things, right?

491
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,571
That's true. No substitute for history.

492
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,408
But it's unfair to him.

493
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,078
I don't believe in fairness.

494
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,373
I don't think you do either,
even though you fight for it.

495
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,958
And I don't believe
you love your husband more than ever.

496
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,795
- How could you possibly know?
- Takes one to know one.

497
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:07,218
John and I haven't slept with each other
in almost two years.

498
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,554
We don't even sleep in the same bedroom.

499
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:13,057
We've talked about separating,
but we never follow through.

500
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,687
It seems wrong to fight this hard for
marriage equality and then get divorced.

501
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,231
Bad for business.

502
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:23,693
Honestly, I don't think
it's how humans are built.

503
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,863
To be with each other for 50 years.

504
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,199
You don't have that option either,
do you?

505
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:31,451
How do you mean?

506
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:35,705
Well, if you wanted something else,
that would be really bad for business.

507
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,375
You should eat.

508
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,252
Said the snake to Eve.

509
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,963
Eat your apple.
The world won't end.

510
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,599
You need to get on the phone
and tell her to leave.

511
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,559
She wouldn't listen to me even if I did.

512
00:32:56,643 --> 00:33:00,229
She's dead set on convincing this guy
for your benefit.

513
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:03,232
I'll have the guards escort her out
if necessary.

514
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,902
They will not lay a finger on my wife.

515
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,989
You'd actually prefer that,
wouldn't you?

516
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,618
So you could tell the world
we dragged the First Lady out by her hair.

517
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:17,246
I'm finding it more and more difficult
to tolerate your paranoia.

518
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,666
I could say the same of your lies.

519
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:23,837
When I lie to you, you'll never know it,
and it will be for a good reason.

520
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,798
Corrigan doesn't fall
into that category.

521
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,972
I should never have invited you here.

522
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:38,017
You and I can work together.
This afternoon is proof.

523
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,227
I would've been better off
holding my ground.

524
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,146
And forcing us to pass the resolution?

525
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,565
The United Nations?
They mean nothing to me.

526
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:47,527
If they meant nothing to you,
you would have held your ground.

527
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,113
But you want to be respected abroad
as much as you are at home.

528
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,868
And I came here out of respect, Viktor.

529
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,203
And I sympathize
with the situation you're in.

530
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,913
That we're both in.

531
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:04,752
Let's not let Michael Corrigan
dictate the course of nations.

532
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:14,512
Can we at least discuss
what a statement from me might look like?

533
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,350
You look exhausted.

534
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:23,187
I didn't sleep much on the plane, so...

535
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,023
You should go back.

536
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,650
There's no reason for you
to be in here with me.

537
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:29,819
I'm not leaving.

538
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:33,614
You're more stubborn than I am.

539
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,992
Why won't you let me help you?

540
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,077
I've made my demands clear.

541
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,916
Michael, let me tell you
what's going to happen

542
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,001
if you refuse to make this statement.

543
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,377
You'll help no one.

544
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,965
In fact, life will get worse
for the others you were arrested with.

545
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,384
Petrov will feel embarrassed.
He will arrest more people.

546
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,469
He will pass worse laws.

547
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:59,891
He's not going to let some American
homosexual dictate his policy.

548
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,476
This man is ruthless.

549
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,855
You think he's gonna become reasonable
suddenly when all of this falls apart?

550
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,481
You're being naive!

551
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,777
And you're letting other people suffer
because of it.

552
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,572
Don't undo what you've
fought so hard for.

553
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:17,491
You think you can shame me.
But you can't.

554
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:21,287
I'm giving you the truth.
I don't care how that makes you feel.

555
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,748
But do yourself the favor
of hearing what I said.

556
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:26,584
- I heard you.
- I hope so.

557
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,795
I can't betray myself.
What would I be then?

558
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,838
You'd be a politician.
And that's what you are.

559
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,966
Let the others do
all the yelling and screaming.

560
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,217
You want change?
Then learn how to compromise.

561
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:39,722
- Be a fucking adult about this, Michael.
- I need to think. Okay? I need time.

562
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,810
The plane leaves tomorrow.

563
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,395
You should go back.
I need time to think alone.

564
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,732
- Clear my head.
- I'm not leaving here without you.

565
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:50,817
I need time!

566
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,780
Just... lie down for a little bit.

567
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,782
Just get some rest.

568
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,660
- I just can't talk anymore.
- Okay.

569
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,829
Okay, I will.

570
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,082
For a few minutes.

571
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:47,540
Thanks.

572
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,763
There's treatment now.

573
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:07,060
The thing that angers me the most
is that I let her do this to me.

574
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:17,361
Did you feel that way about your ex?
The pain that just consumes you?

575
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,321
Oh. For a while, yeah.

576
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:22,742
Still, on bad days.

577
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,124
Mm...

578
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,751
What was she like?

579
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,004
Sorry, you don't have to...

580
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,630
No, I don't mind.

581
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,299
She was...

582
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,471
She'd had a tough life.

583
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,391
She had a lot of baggage.
Which I did, too.

584
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:52,855
We started out as friends
and then we moved in together.

585
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,110
And then it just happened.

586
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,485
We fell in love.

587
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,530
And I don't know, I guess...

588
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:06,244
I felt stronger with her.

589
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,287
And I think she felt the same way.

590
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,458
And I guess maybe it was naive,

591
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,045
but I thought that together,
we could let go of all that baggage.

592
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,132
Then we'd just be us.

593
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:24,053
Well, why did she leave?

594
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,682
She said everything
was happening too quickly.

595
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,689
Have you spoken to her... since?

596
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:41,528
Nope. She stopped coming
to the fellowship.

597
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,533
I stopped by her apartment once,
her landlord said she was gone.

598
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:50,079
Just no idea where she is?

599
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,172
We used to lie in bed
and fantasize about where we'd go

600
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:03,509
if we could go anywhere.
Paris, Australia, Timbuktu.

601
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:09,640
That was Rachel, the far-off places.
I didn't need that.

602
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,482
Where would you go?

603
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,571
The Jimenez Trail.

604
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:25,906
Where is that?

605
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,408
- New Mexico.
- Oh.

606
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:34,040
Cuts across the whole state.
It's got hot springs and waterfalls.

607
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:38,252
We used to say we'd go there, hike it,

608
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:41,839
find a good spot, build a cabin.

609
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,139
I'm sorry, we shouldn't
be talking about me.

610
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:52,183
I asked.

611
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,393
That tea smells good.

612
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,603
I think I'll have some, too.

613
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,383
This looks good.

614
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,509
- You say every word.
- Of course.

615
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,428
And then you take him
directly to the plane.

616
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,139
Viktor... thank you.

617
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,685
Hm... But the Czech Republic,

618
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,521
I want all the missiles gone,
not just a scale-back.

619
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,358
You can keep something in Poland
for show, but that's it.

620
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,945
- Agreed.
- So, we have a deal?

621
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,406
Including everything we discussed
about the Jordan Valley.

622
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:52,243
- Yes, of course.
- Then we have a deal.

623
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,987
Come, Mrs. Underwood.

624
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,866
Please. You shouldn't be here.

625
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:42,335
Mrs. Underwood.

626
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,185
I'm sorry.

627
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:07,609
Would you like to lie down for a bit?
Change your clothes?

628
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,070
- No, I can do that on the plane.
- Well, you go straight there.

629
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:12,823
- We have the press conference to do.
- I should be with you, Francis.

630
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,450
We have that handled.

631
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:19,746
I'd like to say something.
A few warm words to his family.

632
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,541
Yes. Yes, of course.

633
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,752
I'll echo your sympathy and then...

634
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:29,173
then say that I was planning
on releasing him today.

635
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:34,470
I'll thank you for your...
your generosity.

636
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,139
How tragic this has been.

637
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:41,018
And then a few words
about the Jordan Valley,

638
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,396
or if you'd prefer
to announce our agreement.

639
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:45,523
No, no, it's fine if you do.

640
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:50,777
Would you... mind if your people
showed me a draft of your remarks?

641
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:53,406
Yes, I'll have them
draft something right now.

642
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:56,575
And yours, too, Mrs. Underwood?

643
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,786
Yes. It's fine. Whatever you want.

644
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:21,308
Ladies and gentlemen...

645
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,520
Good morning.

646
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:30,234
Mrs. Underwood would like to start
by saying a few words.

647
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:39,368
As you all know, Michael Corrigan
was found dead in his cell this morning.

648
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:42,413
He had hung himself.

649
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:44,915
Michael and I spoke briefly yesterday.

650
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:48,961
He was being treated well
and was grateful to President Petrov

651
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:51,797
for granting his imminent release.

652
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,510
We don't know why...
Michael chose to do what he did.

653
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:01,014
We all wanted nothing more
than for Michael to come home today

654
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:06,228
and we offer our heartfelt condolences
to his family and his loved ones.

655
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:07,729
Thank you.

656
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,815
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.

657
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:23,496
Mrs. Underwood?

658
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,917
I didn't just speak to him yesterday,
I was there when it happened, asleep.

659
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:32,505
He hung himself with my scarf.

660
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:36,800
I do know why Michael
decided to take his own life:

661
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,136
because he didn't want to lie.

662
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:42,931
And I can't dishonor him
by telling a lie now.

663
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,266
Claire...

664
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:49,687
I was trying to convince him
to say that he broke the law,

665
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,524
to thank President Petrov.

666
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:55,861
But he refused, because he didn't want
to leave until the law was repealed.

667
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,865
Until the Russians who were arrested
for the same crime were also released.

668
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:02,660
Michael was willing to die
for what he believed in.

669
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,204
- Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.
- He was brave.

670
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:09,707
- And his voice deserves to be heard.
- That's enough.

671
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,044
If it weren't for this unjust law,

672
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,255
and ignorance and intolerance
of your government,

673
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,049
Michael would still be with us.

674
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,052
Shame on you, Mr. President.

675
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,104
My wife has been under a...

676
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:35,234
great amount of stress
these past 24 hours.

677
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:37,611
She's clearly in shock.

678
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:42,282
My apologies to President Petrov
and to the Russian people.

679
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,660
If you'll excuse me,
I need to be with her now.

680
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:35,085
- Claire.
- Don't, Francis.

681
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,140
It's imperative that I speak to him.

682
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:49,683
Well, keep trying, Cathy.

683
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:53,646
If Petrov won't get on the phone
with me, then I'll speak to Bugayev.

684
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,981
Whoever will get on the phone
with me, then.

685
00:46:57,149 --> 00:46:58,900
All right. Thank you.

686
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:02,904
Your coffee, sir.

687
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:07,660
Thank you, Ben.

688
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,178
- Mr. President.
- Later.

689
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:33,893
I just got off the phone with Cathy.
The deal's off.

690
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:37,272
Everything we negotiated.
We have to discuss the next move.

691
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:40,317
I know what I did. It seemed impulsive,

692
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,569
- but it wasn't--
- It happened. Let's move on.

693
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:45,071
If you have something
you would like to say, Francis...

694
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:47,825
I just want to minimize the damage.
If Petrov won't come around,

695
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,452
we have to move forward
with the resolution at the UN.

696
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:51,745
We're prepared for that.

697
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,831
Good. Thank you.
Try to get some sleep.

698
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,721
Shouldn't you be in the back,
with the press?

699
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:11,931
- I'm not press.
- You're not staff either.

700
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,267
My apologies.

701
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:18,063
Mrs. Underwood?

702
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:20,482
You did the right thing.

703
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,913
I know you're angry.

704
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,666
You should be.

705
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,376
But I had to do it.

706
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,963
Is this some sort of apology, or you
need to get something off your chest?

707
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:45,883
I want you to try and understand.

708
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,760
Understand?

709
00:48:48,594 --> 00:48:50,804
- What you did was beyond--
- I know.

710
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:55,559
You're not only the First Lady,
and an ambassador,

711
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,269
you're also my wife.

712
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,855
- In what order?
- Oh, come on, Claire.

713
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,900
I said what I said for him.

714
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:06,152
Not for myself, not for us.

715
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:08,864
I felt we owed him more
than a few false words.

716
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,948
So you want me to forgive you?
To say that it was okay?

717
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,576
- No.
- Because I can't do that.

718
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,037
- I'm not asking you to.
- Then why are we even discussing it?!

719
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:20,834
- Because I want you to know why.
- I don't care why.

720
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:22,586
I don't care what your reasons are.

721
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,422
There is no reason
that can possibly convince me

722
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:29,384
that you should have sabotaged
a peace plan we spent months on!

723
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:31,511
It was a political mistake.

724
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:34,222
Yes, I admit that.
But if I had said nothing,

725
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:37,684
- his death would have meant nothing.
- No. Not death. Don't give him that.

726
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:40,729
- Suicide.
- No. Something undeniable.

727
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:42,314
I was not gonna try and deny it.

728
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,733
- I don't even understand that.
- If you'd give me a chance.

729
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:47,861
I gave you a chance with the recess
appointment, with the resolution,

730
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:49,321
with handling Corrigan.

731
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,782
He didn't have a choice, Francis.
We cornered him.

732
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:54,534
- He did have a choice.
- Not in his mind.

733
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:57,329
No one forced him to protest in Moscow.

734
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:02,250
And we sure as hell didn't ask him
to tie your scarf around his neck!

735
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,002
If you had spoken to him...

736
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,799
and heard what he had to say--

737
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:10,676
Oh, what, I would have
had some moral epiphany?

738
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,469
- Yes, you would have.
- I don't think so.

739
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:14,847
Because I'm the President
of the United States

740
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,725
and I can separate the big
from the small.

741
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:20,226
He wasn't small.

742
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,146
He was a coward and I'm glad he's dead.

743
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,440
He had more courage than you'll ever have.

744
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,782
Do you really want
to discuss courage, Claire?

745
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:37,369
Because anyone can commit suicide,

746
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:40,622
or spout their mouth
in front of a camera.

747
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:44,041
But you wanna know
what takes real courage?

748
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:48,755
Keeping your mouth shut,
no matter what you might be feeling.

749
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:53,468
Holding it all together
when the stakes are this high.

750
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:57,597
We're murderers, Francis.

751
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,312
No, we're not. We're survivors.

752
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:07,524
If we can't show some respect
for one brave man

753
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,693
and still accomplish
what we set out to do,

754
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:13,405
- then I'm disappointed in both of us.
- I should've never made you ambassador.

755
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,658
I should've never made you president.

756
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:25,709
What are you looking at?

757
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:35,973
