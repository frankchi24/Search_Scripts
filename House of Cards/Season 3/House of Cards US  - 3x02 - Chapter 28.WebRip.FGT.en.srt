00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,916
I'm glad you
brought up nepotism, Senator.

3
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,419
Um, if this were an outright
appointment, that would be one thing,

4
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:53,505
but in this case,
the president can only nominate.

5
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,883
It's the Senate that deems me worthy.

6
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,385
I'm here to convince you that I am.

7
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,181
Although, I must admit, my husband never
remembers to put the toilet seat down,

8
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:04,600
so he could be trying
to make it up to me.

9
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:08,812
My larger concern is your experience.
You have very little.

10
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,316
Well, a decade ago,
I founded a small nonprofit

11
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,985
and I built it into
a major global player.

12
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,781
I shepherded a number of bills
through Congress on its behalf.

13
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:22,701
And over the last year, I've dedicated
myself to sexual assault reform,

14
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,037
and have made meaningful strides.

15
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,040
Now, while this
may not qualify as statecraft,

16
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:30,376
it does illustrate my effectiveness,

17
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,587
the same effectiveness I plan
on bringing to the United Nations.

18
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:37,174
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.
I yield the remainder of my time.

19
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:42,221
Uh, Mrs. Wallace of North Dakota,
you have eight minutes.

20
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,265
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

21
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:47,559
Mrs. Underwood,
allow me to get specific.

22
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:51,105
What is your take
on UN Resolution 9214,

23
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:54,441
the imposition of sanctions
on the Congo for the--

24
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:57,361
The illegal mining and smuggling
of mineral resources.

25
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,572
Yes. The United States voted
against this resolution.

26
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:04,326
The DRC is already wracked
with economic hardship,

27
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,120
compounded by an unstable government.

28
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:10,290
It ranks 192 out of 194
in GDP per capita.

29
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,918
I think we need
to encourage foreign investment

30
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,129
and develop new forms of economic growth

31
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,757
rather than make one of the world's
poorest countries even poorer.

32
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,843
From a national security perspective,

33
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:24,596
the United States maintains a strong
interest in the success of the DRC.

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,849
- We want a stable nation...
- They're here.

35
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,601
...that can help us
in combating the spread

36
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:32,813
of Islamic radicalism
throughout the continent.

37
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,858
And in order to achieve that,
we need to work as its ally,

38
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:37,484
not its disciplinarian.

39
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:41,864
Good morning.

40
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:42,865
Mr. President.

41
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:48,454
Jackie. Terry.

42
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:50,039
Shall we?

43
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:53,167
Now you all have the, uh... overview.
But what we have here today

44
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,669
- is the comprehensive breakdown--
- Sir, before we begin--

45
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:58,464
Look, Bob, I know you have some
serious doubts about this program.

46
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,342
But just let me flesh it out first,
and then I promise

47
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,886
we can address any questions
that you might have.

48
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:06,305
- Uh, Mr. President--
- Ten million jobs.

49
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:09,141
Can we all agree that that's
a good thing for this country?

50
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,893
Universal employment.

51
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,854
It's the key for our keeping
the White House in 2016.

52
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:16,982
It's the only chance we have
of winning back majorities in Congress.

53
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:19,026
Now, the election's
only 18 months away.

54
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,154
We need to do something bold,
something decisive.

55
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,114
We need to redefine our party.

56
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,408
Actually, that's what
we wanted to discuss.

57
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:28,285
You're right, we do need
to redefine the party.

58
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,828
We need to do it
with a fresh face.

59
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,331
2016. We don't want you to run.

60
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:34,917
You weren't even elected
to the office in the first place.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,628
The pardons hurt you.
Approvals are low.

62
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,004
We're not casting blame, sir.

63
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:42,132
We just believe that this
is best for the party.

64
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,561
I suspected this was coming,
but months from now.

65
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:57,481
I was hoping by then I'd have something
to show for my efforts,

66
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,234
that I could preempt their doubts
with progress.

67
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:03,028
They're nervous.
They're being impulsive.

68
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:06,031
It's a bit early
to be deciding something like this.

69
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:08,617
Shouldn't we revisit this
when we're closer to the primaries?

70
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,160
What do you think, Terry?

71
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,579
Like you said, sir, we only
have 18 months until the general.

72
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:13,956
Less than half of that to Iowa.

73
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,833
We would want to settle
on a candidate soon.

74
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,501
Someone who the whole party
can get behind

75
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,420
like the Republicans
are getting behind Mendoza.

76
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:20,671
And who would that be?

77
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,464
We haven't had
a discussion on that yet.

78
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:24,591
We came to you first, out of respect.

79
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:27,845
- Well, there must be a shortlist.
- No, not yet.

80
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,264
It'll be a process
to find the right person.

81
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,933
And we were hoping that
you would be a part of that process.

82
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,561
Obviously, this is a request,
Mr. President.

83
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:37,062
It's your decision.

84
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:40,399
But if you do run, sir,
you won't have our support.

85
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,318
Jackie?

86
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:47,698
I stand by the rest of the leadership.

87
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,328
Well, this is certainly a lot
to think about.

88
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:56,331
Let's table our discussion
on America Works for another time,

89
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:58,250
but thank you all
for being so forthright.

90
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,586
I'll get back to you
on this issue a little later on.

91
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,629
Would you like us
to stick around for a while?

92
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,923
We wouldn't want the press
to think we came all the way here

93
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,092
- for a five-minute meeting.
- That's a very good idea.

94
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:08,427
No raised eyebrows.

95
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,180
I'll have some refreshments sent
for you into the Map Room.

96
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:12,514
Wonderful.

97
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,057
Thank you, Mr. President.

98
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,904
As a vocal proponent for the
Sexual Assault Bill last session,

99
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,406
are you concerned about
your relationship with the US military?

100
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,949
No, I'm not, Senator.

101
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,410
I worked closely
with the Joint Chiefs on that bill.

102
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,538
What if there were a peacekeeping
mission in, say, Burma,

103
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:41,668
to quell civil unrest, and the United
Nations asked us to contribute troops,

104
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:44,379
to put our servicemen
and women's lives in peril.

105
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:46,381
If you're using Myanmar
as a hypothetical,

106
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:48,592
I think we're a long way from that,
but as Ambassador--

107
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,595
My question concerns
the use of US military.

108
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,514
The US military is irrelevant.
The current situation--

109
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,101
Excuse me, Mrs. Underwood.
The US military is irrelevant?

110
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,145
Well, I-- That's not what I said.

111
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:03,190
You said verbatim:
"The US military is irrelevant."

112
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:08,153
Well, in the, in the context of--
I meant... uh, that there are plenty--

113
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:12,658
I have the utmost respect
and appreciation for our troops, sir.

114
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,326
Not with statements
like that, you don't.

115
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,036
Senator,
if I may, I can explain.

116
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,080
How do we explain
to the men and women who serve,

117
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,498
who put their lives on the line,

118
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,959
that our ambassador
thinks they're irrelevant?

119
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,212
I think that's an unfair
characterization of what I intended--

120
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:28,298
I am not characterizing anything,
Mrs. Underwood, you said the words.

121
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,425
And now you're trying
to backpedal your way out of it.

122
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,177
- You're trying to take my words--
- Don't interrupt me.

123
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,012
If you will stop interrupting me,
I can explain--

124
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:36,181
No, you see, we ask the questions,
you answer them.

125
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:38,684
You're not allowing me
to answer the questions, Senator.

126
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,562
If you could maybe listen
instead of grandstanding.

127
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,483
The position
you're being considered for

128
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,694
requires calm, cool diplomacy.

129
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:54,408
What concerns me even more than
the military comment is your demeanor.

130
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,120
Is this what we're to expect
from our ambassador?

131
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,746
A hothead?

132
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,918
Go ahead, Mrs. Underwood, I'm listening.

133
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,338
Maybe it's leverage for another play.

134
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,424
Scare the wits out of me
and then come with the big ask.

135
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:13,427
- You sure there is one?
- America Works. They want to kill it.

136
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,555
Or soften me up to consider
another VP candidate for the ticket.

137
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,265
They're no fans of Blythe.

138
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,100
Could be anything,
any combination of things.

139
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:21,977
- What?
- You saw it?

140
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,479
- Saw what?
- The First Lady, sir.

141
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:33,280
- Jesus. I better call her.
- She's still in the hearing, sir.

142
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:36,283
I need to see this whole thing.
Let's get ahead of it if we can.

143
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,118
- The Solicitor General is here.
- Cancel it.

144
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,203
- You've already postponed twice.
- Postpone it again.

145
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,288
We can't put it off, sir.

146
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,248
It goes to the Supreme Court
in less than a month.

147
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,458
We have bigger fish to fry.

148
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,835
An American citizen was injured
by a drone strike.

149
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,420
That Walker authorized, not me.

150
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:50,505
But you're
the sitting president.

151
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,591
If we lose this,
it undermines your authority.

152
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:53,967
The media is all over it.

153
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,303
We need our rhetoric in line
with the Solicitor General's.

154
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,971
All right. Christ!
Send her in.

155
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,432
I'll put this clip on your computer,
for when you're done.

156
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:04,394
Terry Womack. Today. Privately.

157
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:22,871
Ms. Dunbar.

158
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:29,169
Before we begin,
I'd like to clear the air.

159
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:33,632
Your report.
You did good work, necessary work,

160
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:35,967
and I admire you for it.

161
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,719
I appreciate you saying that, sir.

162
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:40,389
And you understand the position
I was in with the pardons.

163
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:43,016
That's politics, sir.
Not my expertise.

164
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,851
What's past is past?

165
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,771
My focus is the argument
I'll present to the court.

166
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,985
She sees me as the bank robber
who made it to the county line.

167
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:57,531
But she's smart enough
to leave her badge at the door.

168
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,658
So, the case.

169
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:02,786
As you know, sir, we think
the State secret defense is strong.

170
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,705
When I consulted with the CIA on the--

171
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:08,625
I'm wondering if State secrets
is the best tactic.

172
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,002
Both of Mahmoud's legs were amputated.

173
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:13,797
He will be in the gallery,
in his wheelchair.

174
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,674
That's a powerful image.

175
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:18,510
Even Supreme Court Justices have hearts.

176
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,429
We need to stay in their heads.

177
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:22,514
A procedural route is clearly--

178
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,224
Excuse me.

179
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,145
Yes?

180
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,896
Uh, tell her I need to watch something

181
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,274
and I'll call her back
from my study in two minutes.

182
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,526
- It's my wife. I'm sorry.
- Please.

183
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:47,956
- ...you answer them.
- You're not allowing me

184
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,333
to answer questions, Senator.
Maybe you would benefit more

185
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,002
from listening than grandstanding.

186
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,133
I just watched.
How can I help?

187
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:02,012
I'm calling Senators. I think it would
be heavy-handed if you did too.

188
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,930
Well, I don't blame you
for getting upset.

189
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,224
- You didn't deserve that.
- I'm a target now.

190
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:09,936
- That's the price of admission.
- We both are.

191
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,939
The leadership,
they don't want me to run.

192
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,608
- What?
- Yeah, that's what they said

193
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,568
before I could even present the program.

194
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:19,571
- This soon?
- Yeah, that's what surprised me.

195
00:11:19,654 --> 00:11:23,700
- The entire leadership?
- All of them, including Jackie.

196
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:30,290
- That woman has no sense of loyalty.
- Well, we'll see.

197
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,709
I'm gonna meet with Womack.
Turn him around.

198
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,794
They only have strength in numbers.

199
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,430
Continue, please.

200
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:49,142
As I was saying, we think
our procedural defense is strong.

201
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:52,020
State secrets prohibit
the introduction of evidence.

202
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,189
Assuming they won't dismiss outright,

203
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:57,567
the argument will focus
on deference to the executive.

204
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:01,112
Separation between the courts
and foreign policy.

205
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:03,949
They simply don't
have the security intelligence

206
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,535
to second-guess covert operations

207
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:10,080
while we're facing threats
on multiple fronts.

208
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,877
Sir?

209
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,880
- I can't do this now.
- Excuse me, sir?

210
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:22,509
My office will be in touch. Apologies.
Thank you very much.

211
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,098
Maybe you would benefit more
from listening than grandstanding.

212
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,599
Joining me now from Capitol Hill,

213
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,810
CNN's Chief Congressional
Correspondent, Dana Bash.

214
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:34,688
- Dana, what is the mood at the Capitol?
- Right, I understand, but...

215
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:36,565
We already have several
Senators publicly saying

216
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:39,651
that they're gonna vote against
Mrs. Underwood because of her comments.

217
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,529
A number of others I've spoken to
have gone from supporting her...

218
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:44,197
- Right.
- ...to being on the fence.

219
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:48,201
But, Dana, she's correct, isn't she?
Mendoza was grandstanding.

220
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,704
Maybe. But even so,
if you look at the numbers here,

221
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,038
this is doing real damage.

222
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,999
The vote was always going to be close...

223
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:55,250
Yes.

224
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,377
...things aren't looking good
for the First Lady.

225
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,130
- No, I understand, but--
- Could her military remark be...

226
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,215
- It's Mendoza.
- ...a slip of the tongue?

227
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:05,844
I appreciate your time, Senator.
I hope you'll reconsider.

228
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,262
- He's on now?
- Yes.

229
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,014
Turn that off?

230
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,934
Senator, hi.
Thank you for returning my call.

231
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:16,104
Sorry it took so long.
I had a ton of interview requests.

232
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:20,275
I just wanted to apologize if I came
across as disrespectful in any way.

233
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,485
- That was wrong of me.
- I know you didn't mean it, Claire.

234
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,655
It's just unfortunate
how things are playing out.

235
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,950
I realize you can't
vote for me yourself,

236
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:32,537
but I was hoping that maybe you
would say something to the effect to--

237
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,581
What, to the press?

238
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,709
- Or even privately, to your colleagues.
- I can't do that.

239
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:40,337
Senator, the vote should
center on my merits,

240
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,631
not a few moments
where you and I took the gloves off.

241
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,257
Well, I think that was telling,
don't you?

242
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,926
How you behaved under pressure?

243
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,263
Senator, you know you were
taking out of context what I said.

244
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:52,390
Of course I was.
I was trying to rile you up.

245
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:53,725
And I succeeded.

246
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:56,478
I wish I hadn't, because it's gonna
make things really tough for you.

247
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:01,274
But, if you can convince my colleagues
to change their minds despite that...

248
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,276
why, you'd make a great Ambassador.

249
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,488
- Thank you for your time, Senator.
- Good luck, Claire.

250
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,283
He's a son of a bitch.

251
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,910
Let's try Peterson next.

252
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:14,996
Approvals go up and down.

253
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,999
We can't allow ourselves
to be held hostage by public opinion.

254
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,085
We're being held hostage
by the Republicans.

255
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:22,879
We can't beat them with you
as the face of the party. Period.

256
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,923
Have you all really
thought this through?

257
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,216
I'm a sitting president.

258
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,884
But not an elected one.

259
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,928
But still, to abandon the incumbent,

260
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:32,055
and all the advantages
that that entails?

261
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,350
Which is the problem.
We don't see any advantages.

262
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,769
And if you were to come on board with us,

263
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,980
if you were to announce
that you're not running,

264
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:42,107
it wouldn't seem
as if we're abandoning you.

265
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,692
The party looks unified.

266
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,444
Bob Birch has been trying to do me in

267
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,947
since I forced the Education Bill
down his throat.

268
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,658
I think he's using shaky logic
to get you all on board

269
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,911
so he can carry out
some personal vendetta.

270
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,538
It was my idea.

271
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,499
Not Bob's.

272
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,338
I hope you work with us.

273
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,258
We meant it when we said it.

274
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:12,095
We would like for you
to be a part of the conversation.

275
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,861
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

276
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,654
Hey.

277
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:32,032
- I can't hear you.
- Hang on a second.

278
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,373
- Seth?
- Yeah.

279
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,667
I was just calling to check in.
See how things are going.

280
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:46,212
Good. Things are going really good.
Hey, hold on one quick second.

281
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:56,973
Hey. Listen, uh, I know you're
rolling out the AmWorks program soon.

282
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:00,518
I'm sure Remy has a plan in place,
but I've been putting together a list.

283
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:03,772
Some key representatives and what they
might want in exchange for support.

284
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:05,899
Skeletons in the closet,
that kind of thing.

285
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:07,901
Yeah, that's on hold for the moment.

286
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:11,988
- You're not rolling it out?
- It's just on hold.

287
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:15,658
- Is something up?
- No, everything's fine.

288
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,620
We're focused on the summit
next month with Russia.

289
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:21,039
But you're good?
You getting stronger?

290
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:23,625
- Yeah.
- In good spirits?

291
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,418
Never been better.

292
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,921
I'll email you my ideas.
Let me know what he says.

293
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:30,048
- Will do.
- Thanks.

294
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:36,179
Senator, when we met
in your office last week,

295
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,972
we had a long,
productive conversation.

296
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:41,184
I can't imagine ten seconds
during the hearing would--

297
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,145
Senator, may I call you back
in five minutes?

298
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:45,730
Thank you.

299
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,656
- Francis?
- No luck. It was his idea.

300
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,325
What are you going to do?

301
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,661
Top 50 bundlers from last cycle.

302
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,704
I don't need the leadership
if I can get the money.

303
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,623
- You?
- Too early to tell.

304
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,208
Well, I'm here if you need me.

305
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:12,048
I've always said that power
is more important than money.

306
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,844
But when it comes to elections,
money gives power...

307
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,179
well, a run for its money.

308
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,765
It's Francis Underwood.

309
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,068
I thought you said he was handsome.

310
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,654
Sorry to interrupt.

311
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:38,408
Well, if she doesn't receive
a text with the word "urgent,"

312
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,326
it's not an official date.

313
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,828
How are you? Alan Cooke.

314
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:43,705
- Remy Danton.
- Nice to meet you.

315
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,083
I'm just gonna go, uh...
take a few calls.

316
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,669
There's an espresso coming
with your name on it, okay?

317
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,254
Nice meeting you.

318
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:58,094
So here we are.

319
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,055
I wasn't part of the decision.
They told me ten minutes before.

320
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,391
Who are they talking to? About running?

321
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,268
No one yet,
as far as I can tell.

322
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,271
There has to at least be a list.
Even a mental one.

323
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,148
Some ideas.

324
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:12,942
We need you to find out.

325
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:16,404
You know, when Walker resigned,

326
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:19,032
Frank's president,
you're Chief of Staff.

327
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,701
- But me?
- You're still in the leadership.

328
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,454
- Assistant Whip.
- It's a bullshit title.

329
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,748
I'm out of the inner circle.

330
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,793
What do you want?

331
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:34,672
I want to be on the ticket.
His VP.

332
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,593
All we want is a little information.

333
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:42,347
What you're asking is...
disproportionate.

334
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,558
It's repaying a debt.

335
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,354
A big one.
I whipped the votes for impeachment.

336
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:51,272
I should get to cash in on that.

337
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:52,815
There's no way he'll go for this.

338
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,569
Then there's no reason
for me to be your eyes and ears.

339
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,659
I'll get back to you.

340
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,619
During business hours.

341
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:26,182
No, Mark, we ran it in the White
House screening room and I swear to God,

342
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,143
when those jets crashed
into one of our Seawolf subs,

343
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:32,021
the Joint Chiefs screamed.

344
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,482
No, they didn't want you to use it
and certainly not for free.

345
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,192
David, I'm not just
asking you for money,

346
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,444
I'm asking you to be one
of my campaign chairmen.

347
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:40,697
That buys you a lot more
than a night in the Lincoln Bedroom.

348
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:45,326
Claire Underwood for Senator Hylbrook.

349
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,246
I agree. We can never rely solely
upon Security Counsel support.

350
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,747
Scott, we're 18 months out.

351
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,374
Now, if you wanna be
on the ground floor,

352
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,209
you got to shit or get off the pot.

353
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,962
The key is to provide leadership,
to lead by example.

354
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:59,757
I was hoping we could
hit Maidstone for a quick eighteen.

355
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:01,801
No, I'm a terrible golfer.

356
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,262
Exactly, you'd have the pleasure
of beating a president.

357
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:05,888
Now wouldn't that be
a good cocktail story?

358
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,808
I've spoken to almost every Republican
in your committee, sir.

359
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,519
Yes, they're taking their cue from you.

360
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,441
Is there another number
where I can reach him?

361
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:18,818
It's important
that we speak this evening.

362
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,947
Yes, anytime, no matter how late.

363
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,700
A little faith, Tom.
That's all I'm asking.

364
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:30,163
Oh, yes! I know, I don't
like being called "ma'am" either.

365
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:32,498
If I made every decision based
on what makes people feel good,

366
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,167
I'd be a talk show host,
not the president.

367
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,669
Well, I know Admiral Jennings
is a good friend of yours,

368
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:39,047
- I can call him personally.
- Don't let fear drive you.

369
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,757
That's not how you
run your business, is it?

370
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,634
I know you've been in my shoes,
and sound bites are not who we are.

371
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,971
- Penny-wise and pound-foolish.
- I'm so sorry, Senator, did I wake you?

372
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:49,807
Yes, no, I'll try back again tomorrow.

373
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:51,726
I can't fault you
for being shortsighted.

374
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,771
I hope you won't fault me
for having a long memory.

375
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,980
Good night!

376
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:03,071
I'm waking people up now.
I'll start again in the morning.

377
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:08,242
- How's it looking?
- I had to flip a coin? I don't know.

378
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,913
- You?
- Not a single backer yet.

379
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:14,082
- Not one?
- California's still awake.

380
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:15,833
Maybe I'll have better luck out west.

381
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,127
I'm going for a run.
I need to do something.

382
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,879
- It's late.
- Well, I'm too restless.

383
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:23,299
Well, I'll be here,
singing for my supper.

384
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,600
It's humiliating to have to beg
from some kid who was on Facebook

385
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:34,811
before his testicles descended,
but that's--

386
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,855
Derrick, Francis Underwood.
Do you have a few minutes?

387
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,984
I'll be running along the Mall tonight.

388
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,694
That requires a full detail.

389
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:45,571
How soon can you be ready?

390
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:47,490
We'd far prefer you ran on the track.

391
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,534
I'll be running along the Mall.

392
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:52,745
Yes, ma'am. We're going to need
the First Lady's detail, ASAP.

393
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,626
- This is off the record.
- Agreed.

394
00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:03,506
You've called my office every day for
the last six months with one question.

395
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,842
I call everyone in the leadership.

396
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,219
I get the same non-answer
from all of you:

397
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:10,096
"Frank Underwood is our president..."

398
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:12,390
He has our undivided support.

399
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:15,393
Birch slipped up once. He said
"unwavering" instead of "undivided."

400
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,979
I wanted to drug-test him.

401
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:21,065
There was a meeting this morning
in the White House.

402
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,151
I was there on Pebble Beach
when you came out.

403
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,236
It lasted four and a half minutes.

404
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,322
- You were in there for an hour.
- We were inside for an hour.

405
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,741
Doesn't mean the meeting
lasted that long.

406
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:32,660
What happened? Why so short?

407
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,790
You're the Pulitzer finalist.

408
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:39,458
America Works?

409
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,920
Is that why the president went
to the Capitol this afternoon?

410
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:45,173
No one from the White House would say.

411
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,596
Have a good night.

412
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:56,475
You chose me.
What's your play?

413
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,520
When you write about presidents,
people pay attention.

414
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,588
Oh...

415
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:57,805
Oh!

416
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:00,516
Ah...

417
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:16,449
It'll come down to the wire.

418
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:19,660
I'm confident, but I don't
want to leave anything to chance.

419
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:25,207
Well, according to Erikson,
I have 47 votes as of this morning.

420
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,169
Well, I know, Senator,
but that's not enough.

421
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:29,712
I need yours.

422
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:43,684
I have every intention
of running for president.

423
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:45,644
I need to know you two are with me.

424
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,230
If you have any doubts,
now's the time to let me know.

425
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:59,033
Nancy, wipe the schedule clean.

426
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:01,285
Yes, everything.

427
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:03,579
We don't leave this office
until we have a plan.

428
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:09,418
Ma'am? The Easter Egg Roll
we were scheduled for?

429
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:10,961
- Right.
- If this is a bad time...

430
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,047
No, that's fine.
Please, come in.

431
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:14,924
Hello?

432
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,718
Yes... Claire Underwood.
He's expecting my call.

433
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:21,263
Hi, Sheila.
They're beautiful.

434
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:24,058
Would you mind setting them up, please?
I have a couple more calls to make.

435
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:29,313
Hello, Senator.
Yes, I'm well. How are you?

436
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,692
The nomination of Claire Underwood,
of Washington DC,

437
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:38,114
to be the Representative of the United
States of America to the United Nations.

438
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:41,951
Yeas and nays have been ordered
and the clerk will call the roll.

439
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,911
- Mr. Abner.
- Yea.

440
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,664
Mr. Braun.

441
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:48,833
Mr. Bray.

442
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,878
- This one's a little too pink.
- Girls like pink.

443
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:55,339
This is more than pink.
It's neon.

444
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,592
- Uh, I'm choosing four?
- Yes, ma'am.

445
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:01,429
- Willa?
- Up by two: 48 to 46.

446
00:27:01,512 --> 00:27:03,597
- Ma'am, we can finish up later.
- No.

447
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,975
- Uh, what's next?
- The commemoratives.

448
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,685
These are really special.

449
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:09,145
A black egg?

450
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,981
- Yes, with patriotic tipping.
- It's still a black egg.

451
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,442
Engraved with POTUS
and FLOTUS signatures.

452
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:17,445
Ma'am? Final tally: 52 to 48.

453
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:18,904
Against.

454
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:27,955
- The press?
- In the briefing room.

455
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,793
I'll just be a few minutes.
Would you mind waiting?

456
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,628
Not at all, ma'am.

457
00:27:45,222 --> 00:27:46,307
Hey.

458
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:48,476
I just heard.

459
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,812
I'm so sorry.

460
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:53,230
The press is waiting.

461
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:54,815
Well, they can wait.

462
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:58,402
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No. I just want to get it over with.

463
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,199
Claire. You--

464
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:15,461
Good morning.
Naturally, I'm disappointed

465
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:19,340
that the Senate did not confirm
my nomination today.

466
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:22,718
But I'm very grateful to have been
afforded the opportunity.

467
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,095
I'd be remiss
if I did not thank my husband

468
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:27,973
for all the faith and trust
he placed in me.

469
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:31,018
He's always supported me
in achieving my goals.

470
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:35,940
I look forward to continued service
as First Lady.

471
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,818
Thank you.

472
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:56,710
Um, let's go with the...
green, the blue, and the cream.

473
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:59,797
And for the rare one?
The Golden Ticket, so to speak?

474
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,801
Red. That one's beautiful.

475
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:06,011
Thank you.
Excuse me, please?

476
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,037
You ever try to do this?

477
00:29:33,497 --> 00:29:34,915
Balance an egg?

478
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:39,044
We used to do this as kids.

479
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:51,056
You can't change
the laws of physics, can you?

480
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:07,573
I was wrong. It's too hard.

481
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:08,991
Sir?

482
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,410
Fighting the leadership, raising money.

483
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,163
We can't get them to do
what they're dead set against doing.

484
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,541
We'd need six months
just to get them back to square one.

485
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:30,471
We have to reverse our thinking.

486
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:38,812
When the wind's blowing at gale force,
there's no point in sailing against it.

487
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,776
What do you have in mind?

488
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,015
The White House
Counsel's office, please.

489
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,893
I don't care about their schedules.
If not today, tomorrow morning.

490
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,144
Should I invite Jackie, too?

491
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:20,854
Well, she qualifies as leadership.

492
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:23,190
- What about her ask?
- Stall her for now.

493
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:25,192
Let's see how the meeting goes.

494
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:27,361
I want you to write the speech,
every word.

495
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:28,862
- Yes, sir.
- And no leaks.

496
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:31,365
You'll have a draft in three hours.

497
00:31:31,448 --> 00:31:35,369
And, sir... Doug emailed me
a lobbying strategy for AmWorks.

498
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:37,413
- Do you want to look at it?
- Of his own accord?

499
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,373
- You didn't tell him?
- No, I didn't say a word.

500
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:41,375
It must be what he gathered
from watching the news.

501
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:44,044
- How is he?
- Uh, Doug seems fine.

502
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,380
I've been calling him, like you asked.

503
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:48,716
- But he seems all right?
- Well, he tells me things are good,

504
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,677
although I don't think
he'd admit it if they weren't.

505
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,346
Why don't you stop by
from time to time, since I can't.

506
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,889
- See him in person.
- Yes, sir.

507
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:57,474
And send me his email.

508
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:09,403
Claire?

509
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,784
I'll be in my study if you need me.

510
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:24,418
What're you working on?

511
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:27,046
- Brought you a coffee.
- My savior.

512
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:29,048
The leadership meeting
yesterday morning.

513
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:31,133
It lasted four and a half minutes.

514
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,384
Where'd you hear that?

515
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:35,637
That's not long enough
to reject a major domestic agenda.

516
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:38,265
I wasn't in the meeting.
I don't know how long it lasted.

517
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:41,477
- Something went down.
- If you say so.

518
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,395
Uh, I didn't hear anything about it.

519
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,606
Could've been the president
was called away.

520
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:49,068
- That happens all the time.
- Not this time.

521
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:50,569
How do you know?

522
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:53,322
Clearly, I have a source
that knows more than you.

523
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,825
Most sources do.
At least they pretend they do.

524
00:32:58,202 --> 00:32:59,912
Thanks for the coffee.

525
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:04,374
Two sugars next time.
I'll remember that.

526
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:13,342
You talked to Ayla Sayyad.

527
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,178
I can either be an asset or a liability.

528
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,930
You think this puts you
on the ticket now?

529
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:19,431
Not if you tell him.

530
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,850
But the smart move would
be to advocate on my behalf.

531
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,268
Don't strong-arm me, Jackie.

532
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:25,562
You're the man in the middle.
Who else would I strong-arm?

533
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:27,481
I want to be on your team, Remy.

534
00:33:27,564 --> 00:33:30,025
We do well when we're on the same team.

535
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,031
You have more calls?

536
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:39,743
No. I'm done.

537
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,872
- Who spoke to her?
- I have no idea, sir.

538
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:46,416
- Well, it's your job to know.
- Things are moving fast.

539
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,918
I'm just trying to stay ahead of them.

540
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,254
Well, we need to move faster.
Has the meeting been set?

541
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:52,840
Eight a.m. tomorrow.
I just heard back from Birch's office.

542
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:54,883
Good. Let's have the networks
ready to go live by nine.

543
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,970
One more thing. Jackie.

544
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:00,222
I think you should decide
sooner rather than later.

545
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,432
If we're gonna go this route,
we need every ally we can get.

546
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:04,434
After the meeting. We'll discuss then.

547
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:18,574
You've emerged.

548
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,368
Hi.

549
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,538
I took a nap.
Last night was...

550
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:26,248
I didn't get much sleep.

551
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,791
Me, neither.

552
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:30,919
We're gonna find something for you.

553
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:35,299
Some other position, or something
as First Lady, I promise.

554
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:37,384
I know.

555
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:40,804
- What are you doing up?
- I've got to go over my speech.

556
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:42,931
It's happening tomorrow night.

557
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,766
What speech?

558
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:58,238
It's premature, isn't it?

559
00:34:58,322 --> 00:34:59,865
Read on.

560
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,743
Yes?

561
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,955
Yes.

562
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:54,002
Thank you. Please.

563
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:03,595
I put a great deal of thought
into what you've all asked of me.

564
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,848
I challenged myself
to keep an open mind.

565
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:11,228
And my decision is:
I will not run for president.

566
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,982
Look, they're thinking
it's too good to be true, and it is.

567
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,692
I lied in the Oval Office before.

568
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,360
I didn't want to take
the chance this time.

569
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,237
It's too big a deal to jinx myself.

570
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:24,533
At nine o'clock tonight, I will
announce to the nation my decision.

571
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:25,742
What's the catch?

572
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:31,707
I wanted us to meet here
in this room for a reason.

573
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,375
For the past five months,

574
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,045
my team has sat at this very table,
developing America Works.

575
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,131
You know how much
the program means to me,

576
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:40,632
and I want it to mean as much to you.

577
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:43,885
- So there is a catch.
- No, an opportunity.

578
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,637
Look, we all know the--

579
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:49,349
All right, let's just say for...
argument's sake

580
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:53,603
that this table here represents
the next year and a half, all right?

581
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:55,647
So, this is us right now.

582
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:57,858
And down there at the end,
that's the election.

583
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:01,778
Now, if I did run, I'd spend
the next few months fundraising.

584
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:05,198
And then somewhere around here,
I'd formally announce.

585
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:08,327
And then even if I did win the nomination,
say, somewhere around here,

586
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,539
I'd start to have to face off with
a Republican challenger, probably Mendoza.

587
00:37:12,622 --> 00:37:14,624
And then things would get brutal.

588
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,044
Daily, daily events.

589
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:18,628
Fending off attacks.

590
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:20,297
Launching my own.

591
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,050
And... you're right.

592
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:24,760
In the end...

593
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:27,012
...I'd probably lose.

594
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:31,600
I would spend 18 months campaigning,

595
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,770
which would leave no time to govern.

596
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,649
But you have opened my eyes.

597
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,985
I feel liberated.

598
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:46,490
I want to spend these next 18 months
dedicated to one thing:

599
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,493
America Works.
But I need your help to do it.

600
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:52,704
You're putting an awfully big price tag
on this, Mr. President.

601
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:55,082
No, you've put an awfully big
price tag on this.

602
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:59,544
You're asking me to be a placeholder
for 18 months and I intend to govern.

603
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:01,838
And if America Works succeeds,

604
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:05,384
then whoever you choose to run in 2016
not only has the backing

605
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:08,678
of a united party,
but a formidable legacy.

606
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:12,474
But Social Security?
Benefits. Entitlements.

607
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,811
We don't want to present a fresh face
only to shoot ourselves in the foot.

608
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,271
Then let's not pretend
to unite the party,

609
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:21,024
let's unite the party
behind this legislation.

610
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,734
We'll never get it past the Republicans.

611
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:24,611
We are not here to negotiate!

612
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:28,115
You want forward-thinking, Bob?
Then think forward.

613
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:31,618
You want a fresh face for 2016?
You wanna work together?

614
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,995
Then present my program to Congress.

615
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,289
And if it dies there, so be it.

616
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:40,085
But I want us to fucking try!

617
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,388
I am prepared to vacate this chair.

618
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,474
Meet me halfway.

619
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:55,892
Any moment now,

620
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,728
the president will be addressing
the nation live from the East Room.

621
00:38:58,812 --> 00:39:02,357
The White House has remained silent on
the subject of the president's speech,

622
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:06,027
but sources in Congress say it
will focus on the jobs initiative

623
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,363
he's been planning
to unveil for several months.

624
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,574
The program, dubbed America Works,

625
00:39:10,657 --> 00:39:14,661
was developed in secret. Any details
are the by-product of speculation,

626
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:17,038
but sources suggest
it will have elements

627
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,291
from both liberal
and conservative agendas.

628
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:23,128
What remains to be seen is whether
a Republican-controlled Congress

629
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:25,547
will cooperate in pushing
the program forward.

630
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,384
The White House has faced
significant opposition from the GOP

631
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,428
since Congress began
its current session,

632
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:35,056
and many speculate that the president's
liberal application of veto power

633
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,309
may leave congressional
leaders disinclined

634
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:39,186
to support this new jobs program.

635
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,689
Additionally, many Democratic
supporters of President Underwood,

636
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:47,152
from his days as House Majority Whip,
were voted out of office in November,

637
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:50,280
diminishing his personal influence
over legislators.

638
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,075
Low approval ratings
are a continuing concern

639
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,785
for the Underwood administration.

640
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:59,372
And congressional sources suggest
the choice to tackle unemployment

641
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:02,834
may be part of a campaign strategy
for 2016.

642
00:40:04,127 --> 00:40:07,797
Recent polls indicate that less than one
third of all Americans say they would

643
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:09,799
consider voting for
President Underwood...

644
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:29,819
...job growth has remained a popular
platform in national elections,

645
00:40:29,903 --> 00:40:33,281
and if today's announcement
is received well,

646
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:37,494
President Underwood's campaign
certainly has an opportunity to benefit.

647
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:42,749
Thank you.

648
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:44,960
Sir, we're ready for you
in five seconds.

649
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:52,551
Good evening.

650
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:55,762
For too long, we in Washington
have been lying to you.

651
00:40:55,845 --> 00:41:00,767
We say we're here to serve you,
when in fact, we're serving ourselves.

652
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:05,438
And why? We are driven
by our own desire to get reelected.

653
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:09,943
Our need to stay in power
eclipses our duty to govern.

654
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:12,320
That ends tonight.

655
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:16,199
Tonight, I give you the truth.

656
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:21,580
And the truth is this:
The American dream has failed you.

657
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:26,376
Work hard? Play by the rules?
You aren't guaranteed success.

658
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:30,005
Your children will not have
a better life than you did.

659
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:35,176
Ten million of you can't even get a job,
even though you desperately want one.

660
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,723
We've been crippled
by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,

661
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:42,684
by welfare, by entitlements.

662
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:47,522
And that is the root
of the problem: entitlements.

663
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:52,986
Let me be clear.
You are entitled to nothing.

664
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:59,451
You are entitled to nothing.

665
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:02,704
America was built
on the spirit of industry.

666
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:06,207
You build your future.
It isn't handed to you.

667
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,959
And the problem with Washington

668
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:10,795
is that we haven't given you
the tools to build it.

669
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:16,551
The only way for us to serve you is
to give you the means to serve yourselves.

670
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:19,429
Well, that's exactly
what I intend to do.

671
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:21,806
Not handouts. Jobs.

672
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,143
Real paying jobs.

673
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:27,646
In the next few weeks,
the Democratic leadership

674
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:30,940
will introduce a program
called "America Works."

675
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:33,276
Its goal is simple:

676
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,530
to put the ten million Americans
who are unemployed to work.

677
00:42:37,614 --> 00:42:42,160
All of them.
If you want a job, you get one.

678
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:45,830
The cost
is five hundred billion dollars.

679
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:47,666
Now, that's a lot of money.

680
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:50,752
To pay for it, we'll need
to rethink Social Security,

681
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:53,838
healthcare and benefits
from the ground up.

682
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:57,634
We can't maintain
the welfare state as we know it.

683
00:42:58,426 --> 00:43:00,762
Now, that's not a popular thing to say.

684
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:04,015
Anyone running for office
wouldn't dare utter those words.

685
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:06,434
Every advisor and consultant
and staff member

686
00:43:06,518 --> 00:43:09,562
would beg a presidential candidate
not to say them.

687
00:43:09,646 --> 00:43:12,065
But I can say them.

688
00:43:12,148 --> 00:43:17,404
Because I will not be seeking
the Democratic nomination in 2016.

689
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,492
Candidates are cautious.

690
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:25,453
They must equivocate.
They dodge and tiptoe.

691
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:29,958
But I'd rather leave this office having
accomplished something of value

692
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:34,087
than secure another four years
having done nothing at all.

693
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:38,633
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
ushered in an era of hope and progress

694
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:40,844
when he proposed the New Deal.

695
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,639
And at the time,
his reforms were considered radical.

696
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:51,104
But he once said, "This country demands
bold, persistent experimentation.

697
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:54,774
It is common sense
to take a method and try it.

698
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:58,278
And if it fails,
admit it frankly and try another.

699
00:43:58,361 --> 00:44:01,698
But above all, try something."

700
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,033
Roosevelt would have
understood better than anyone

701
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:06,911
the necessity
for trying something different.

702
00:44:06,995 --> 00:44:09,622
The New Deal succeeded for many years,

703
00:44:09,706 --> 00:44:13,710
but we must now try something newer
before it fails us.

704
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:19,215
If America Works succeeds,
we will reinvent the American dream.

705
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:21,134
If we fail in our attempt,

706
00:44:21,217 --> 00:44:24,095
we will admit it frankly
and try another.

707
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:29,267
But above all, we must try something.

708
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:33,188
Thank you, and God Bless
the United States of America.

709
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,330
Hey.

710
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:51,789
It's two in the morning.

711
00:44:51,873 --> 00:44:53,958
Yeah, I just left the White House.

712
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,835
The press conference,
phone calls, emails,

713
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:57,420
the rest can wait until tomorrow.

714
00:44:57,504 --> 00:45:00,048
- Were you asleep?
- No.

715
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,384
This is a cool place.

716
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:05,678
How much is your rent?

717
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:09,724
I thought you said AmWorks was on hold.

718
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,684
Well, it was and then it wasn't.

719
00:45:12,352 --> 00:45:14,687
The leadership didn't want him to run.

720
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:15,813
Who told you that?

721
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:18,775
Nobody. But I figure it's the only
reason he'd make that speech.

722
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:20,276
Hm...

723
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,196
- He's still gonna run though, isn't he?
- He says he's not.

724
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:25,865
I know him better
than you ever will, Seth.

725
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:27,992
There's no way he doesn't run.

726
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:33,957
Is that why you're here?
Because he needs my help now?

727
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,627
No, I just-- I wanted to check up
with you in person this time.

728
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:43,007
- He asked you to.
- Yes.

729
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,053
I did send him your email, though.

730
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:49,973
- What did he say?
- I'm not sure if he's read it.

731
00:45:57,272 --> 00:45:59,482
You should probably get some sleep, huh?

732
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:03,778
Big day for the press team tomorrow.

733
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,534
You can report back. Alive and well.

734
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:13,371
Is it okay if I stop by now and then?

735
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:15,582
Do I have a choice?

736
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:18,876
I don't, but I can't force you
to open the door.

737
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:23,506
- Whatever you want.
- Thanks.

738
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:26,593
I'll see you soon.

739
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:21,356
Ms. Dunbar.

740
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:22,440
Mr. President.

741
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:25,777
I had a lot on my mind
when we last spoke.

742
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,321
- The speech last night, it was--
- Yes, it was a big decision

743
00:47:28,404 --> 00:47:30,448
and I apologize if I was distracted.

744
00:47:30,531 --> 00:47:33,451
- Not at all, sir.
- So, the drone strike case.

745
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:35,745
You've been pursuing
the State secrets defense.

746
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:38,164
Yes, sir.

747
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:41,918
- Heather-- May I call you Heather?
- Please.

748
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:43,961
The American people are sick of secrets.

749
00:47:44,045 --> 00:47:46,756
That's the point I was
trying to make last night.

750
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:49,425
I promised the truth,
and now we're going to deliver.

751
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:51,594
What truth is that, sir?

752
00:47:51,678 --> 00:47:54,013
A man had his legs blown off.
An American citizen.

753
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:55,556
We're going to own up to that.

754
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,267
We're going to admit that
the CIA conducted the drone strike

755
00:47:58,351 --> 00:48:01,646
- and explain the reasons why.
- That information is classified.

756
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:05,566
Not anymore. You have my permission
to make the classified brief public.

757
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:09,696
Sir, that is not a sound legal approach.

758
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:12,323
- But it's what the country needs.
- We're not appealing to the country.

759
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:14,575
- We're appealing to nine justices.
- Wrong.

760
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:17,370
We're appealing to both
by taking responsibility.

761
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:21,040
Yes, a man was maimed,
his family members were killed.

762
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:24,752
But hundreds, perhaps thousands
of lives were saved as a result.

763
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:26,504
I understand the emotional logic,

764
00:48:26,587 --> 00:48:28,798
- but we can't--
- You sat right there and told me

765
00:48:28,881 --> 00:48:32,343
- even Supreme Court justices have hearts.
- Yes, but--

766
00:48:32,427 --> 00:48:34,595
Far be it from me to tell you
how to do your job.

767
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,723
I've never practiced law
a day in my life.

768
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:38,850
But I have written them.

769
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:42,854
And occupying this office,
I know what the country needs.

770
00:48:42,937 --> 00:48:44,397
It needs closure.

771
00:48:47,817 --> 00:48:50,111
Let me work on a new argument.

772
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:52,739
- Thank you, Heather.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

773
00:49:00,246 --> 00:49:03,374
- Where do you want these, ma'am?
- Anywhere. Just not in here.

774
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,876
Okay.

775
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,921
- Scott?
- Yes?

776
00:49:09,005 --> 00:49:10,548
Here's a couple more.

777
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:44,373
Hey. You want a peanut butter and jelly?

778
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:46,042
No, thanks.

779
00:49:52,173 --> 00:49:54,008
Is everything all right?

780
00:49:58,221 --> 00:50:00,515
I want the UN job, Francis.

781
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:05,019
The Senate goes home in two weeks.
I want a recess appointment.

782
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:08,356
I prepared for it. I can do this.
And after it's all over,

783
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:11,359
if I've done the job I know I can do,
I'll be positioned

784
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,611
- for anything I want.
- Claire--

785
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:15,321
Now, I checked
with the White House Counsel.

786
00:50:15,404 --> 00:50:19,242
There is precedent for a recess
appointment after a rejected nomination.

787
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:21,035
Only once,
but you wouldn't be the first.

788
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,204
And I know
you'll take a hit politically.

789
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,414
And I know people
will think I don't deserve it.

790
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:30,670
They'll have doubts in me.
But what if... this is as far as we get?

791
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:33,548
What if it's all over in 18 months?

792
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:36,968
I don't want to wait,
or settle for something else,

793
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:40,179
- when I've put all this work into--
- Okay.

794
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:43,015
I'll do it.

795
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:48,437
- You sure you don't want half?
- I'm not hungry.

796
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:50,106
I'll be in my study.

797
00:52:08,198 --> 00:52:15,660
