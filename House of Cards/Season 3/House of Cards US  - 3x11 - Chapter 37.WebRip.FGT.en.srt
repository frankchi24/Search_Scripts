1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:01,970
Over 20 years?

2
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:05,368
Thirty?

3
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:07,120
Forty?

4
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:10,248
- How about fifty?
- Fifty-five.

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,625
Fifty-five years. Wow.

6
00:00:14,544 --> 00:00:16,754
And what is your name, ma'am?

7
00:00:16,837 --> 00:00:19,299
- Agnes.
- Yeah, I think you mean Saint Agnes.

8
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:21,801
Yes. Yes, I do.

9
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:24,262
Well, Francis and I
are only halfway there,

10
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,598
but I bet you know your husband
as well as you know yourself.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,182
- Am I right?
- Yes, I do.

12
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:31,436
Well, I know Francis Underwood.

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,522
I know what keeps him up at night.

14
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:37,649
And I'm sure it's the same thing
that keeps your husbands up, too.

15
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,988
The future. How can I ensure
a better future for my family?

16
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:45,866
Except... Francis, as President...

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,787
his focus is on the progress
of all American families.

18
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,289
You know what he said to me last night?

19
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:55,668
He said, "Claire, my entire presidential
agenda, it's very simple.

20
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:59,380
I want to be able to look
every single American in the eye,

21
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:01,757
and know that I have made
their lives better."

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,594
Yes.

23
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:08,264
I have to say, Mrs. Underwood,
I find you very charming.

24
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:10,600
And you seem quite honest.

25
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:15,355
But I have trouble believing that your
husband truly cares about people.

26
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,983
Well, Francis Underwood is a good man.

27
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,693
He's dedicated and generous.

28
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,322
And I have 28 years of proof.

29
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:27,492
And I can honestly say,
even if I wasn't married to him,

30
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:29,327
he would definitely have my vote.

31
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,329
Thank you.

32
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:34,748
Negligence. Nepotism.

33
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:37,043
Misappropriation of federal funds.

34
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:41,631
A foreign policy fiasco
and loose with the truth.

35
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,508
What do these five fingers
have in common?

36
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,468
Francis J. Underwood.

37
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:47,345
Mr. King, I would
like to respond to that.

38
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:50,515
This is a man who believes
in the rule of law-ish.

39
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:54,894
The legislative process-ish.
The Constitution-ish.

40
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,479
Is this the man who should be president?

41
00:01:56,563 --> 00:02:01,526
Ms. Dunbar, like any good lawyer,
you have a knack for rhetoric-ish.

42
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:04,028
But the American people
are tired of words.

43
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:06,739
What they crave is action.

44
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:09,283
My concern about focusing
on the word, "action,"

45
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:12,245
is that she'll just
come back with failed actions.

46
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,954
America Works, the UN mission.

47
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,041
"Action" performed well
with key demos in our last poll.

48
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:19,335
Yes, but doesn't this
take us off message?

49
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:23,214
We have been saying, "A vote for Frank
Underwood is a vote for America Works."

50
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:24,882
That's what we've been running on.

51
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,510
You need a word
that goes beyond America Works.

52
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:30,680
- Something that can be used for anything.
- Remy, what do you think?

53
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:34,141
- Uh...
- We're talking about the word, "action."

54
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:37,353
Sorry, I was, uh... My mind was
on the foreign policy argument.

55
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:40,106
- I was just thinking ahead.
- What about "vision"?

56
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,941
Isn't that too generic?

57
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:44,277
That's what we want.
I mean, the more generic, the better.

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,029
People can project anything
they want on "vision."

59
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:50,324
I'll get it polled before tomorrow.
We should work on Sharp next.

60
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,743
You want me to play her?

61
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:54,454
Thank you for taking your role
so seriously, Donald.

62
00:02:54,537 --> 00:02:56,788
You should consider
a career on the stage.

63
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,959
Because he sure as hell
isn't gonna be on my ticket.

64
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:06,507
You're good at this.
They loved you.

65
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:09,385
Three decades of campaigns,
you learn how to read an audience.

66
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,513
Self-promotion gives me hives.
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.

67
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:14,724
I'm promoting my husband, not myself.

68
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:17,310
That's a convenient way to spin it,
don't you think?

69
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,687
Are you always this blunt?

70
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:22,356
I only have two days to tag along.

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,234
Mind if I ride with you,
since we have so little time?

72
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:28,279
I need to make some calls.
Maybe we'll find some time later.

73
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,336
Remy, you were distracted earlier.
What's going on?

74
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,421
Oh. Nothing. Everything's good.

75
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:47,047
I need you on your A-game, Remy.

76
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:49,425
This debate could make us
the front-runner.

77
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,178
It's just between the campaign
and managing the White House,

78
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:54,388
- I'm a little burnt out.
- We still have months to go.

79
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:57,558
- A year before the general.
- It's temporary. I'll get past it.

80
00:03:57,642 --> 00:03:59,310
If you can do it, I can.

81
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:43,813
Gavin?

82
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:46,482
- Hello, Douglas.
- What do you want?

83
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,443
You still can't believe she's dead,
can you?

84
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:54,031
Well, you shouldn't.
'Cause she's not.

85
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,701
She's alive,
and I know exactly where she is.

86
00:04:58,285 --> 00:04:59,620
I've known for a while.

87
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,455
- What?
- Look on your laptop.

88
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,597
No, you...
you showed me the picture.

89
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,224
- Of her body.
- That wasn't her.

90
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:23,310
I forged it all so you'd
lift my passport lock.

91
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,439
Well, I'm out now, Doug.

92
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:29,817
And I'm safe. But my friend isn't.

93
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,444
Talk to Green.

94
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,530
Get him the same deal you got me,
all charges dropped.

95
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,700
You do that,
and I'll tell you where she is.

96
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:45,957
Ah!

97
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:16,740

98
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,134
- Hey, Meechum.
- Sir.

99
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,385
Mr. President.

100
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,930
Thank you for coming
all the way to Andrews.

101
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:49,182
Did Remy walk you
through the broad strokes?

102
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,769
No matter the policy question,
foreign or domestic,

103
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:53,646
we hammer Dunbar's lack of experience.

104
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:58,150
We bludgeon it. We cannot say
"lack of experience" enough.

105
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,653
And no doubt, she'll bring up
Claire's recess appointment,

106
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:03,572
where I can't take the bait,
so I leave that entirely to you.

107
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:05,992
This was one of the things
that I was hoping to discuss.

108
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,660
Oh, you don't want to call her "sexist"?

109
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:10,579
- The argument doesn't hold.
- It does hold.

110
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,706
She says that Claire was unqualified.

111
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,709
You say she wouldn't say that
about a man with the same CV.

112
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:17,169
I'm not sure that's true.

113
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,880
And calling another woman sexist
when there's a man on the stage--

114
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:23,926
And who else is better but you to call
her out on what she's done for women,

115
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,552
which is absolutely nothing?

116
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:29,682
Whereas gender-equality legislation
is one of your hallmarks.

117
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,684
But it could hurt me
more than it hurts her.

118
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,687
I thought we had an understanding.

119
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,189
You were gonna play pit bull
while I play presidential.

120
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,650
Will you get a little bloody?
Yes, probably.

121
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,527
But that's what people want
in their debates.

122
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,530
And then you and I together,
we bury her.

123
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:47,658
You drop out next week,
endorse me and the race is over.

124
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,743
I have no problem being forceful.

125
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,788
But this sexism thing,
and the whole school argument, I--

126
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:55,708
- Oh. You mean her kids.
- I really don't want to involve them.

127
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,627
We have two things we want
the American people to hear:

128
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:02,297
she lacks experience and she was born
with a silver spoon in her mouth.

129
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:03,799
But there has to be another way.

130
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,259
She wants to trumpet
an equal playing field?

131
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:09,013
Then why does she send her own kids
to private school?

132
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:13,266
That is a clear and simple argument that
everyone can get their heads around.

133
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,812
And it doesn't hurt that Iowa's biggest
employer is the public school system.

134
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:19,190
Alan sends his kids to private school.

135
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:21,817
Yeah, but they're not your kids.

136
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,070
They're my step-kids.
And that makes me a hypocrite.

137
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,950
Is that really
what you're concerned about?

138
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,869
Being a hypocrite?

139
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,330
It's my family.

140
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:39,376
Oh, trust me, they'll understand
the moment they step into the White House.

141
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,628
Jackie, I really
shouldn't have to convince you

142
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:44,173
to do what it takes to get a set of keys.

143
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,761
I'll be the pit bull, Mr. President.

144
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:50,429
Thank you, Jackie.

145
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,475
- Are we all clear?
- The press has boarded, sir.

146
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,477
- All right, make sure no one sees her.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,980
Flight time to
Des Moines today will be two hours...

148
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:05,027
Such a pity how much ruthless pragmatism
gets weighed down by family values.

149
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,362
Without her doctor
and his pimply-faced brood,

150
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:09,782
she could soar as high as this plane.

151
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:13,452
Oh, I know, the marriage was my idea.
Don't remind me.

152
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:25,547
- Doug.
- Hey.

153
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,883
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

154
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,677
What, did you get
locked out or something?

155
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:34,140
I felt the need to drink.

156
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:36,600
I got this far and I stopped myself.

157
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:40,229
Okay.

158
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:42,022
I wanted you to see it.

159
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:44,191
That I could control it.

160
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:50,072
You wanna go back up?

161
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:51,865
Yeah.

162
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:10,217
I know it looks crazy.

163
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,886
But I had to do it.

164
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,387
Why?

165
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:19,726
There was this girl...
before the injury.

166
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:24,606
She left me.
So I started drinking.

167
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:27,818
I tried to shut her out,

168
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:31,488
but I just kept checking my e-mails,
my text messages.

169
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:36,367
It needed to stop.

170
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,162
Who was she?

171
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:43,834
You know what? That's okay.

172
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,294
Doesn't matter.

173
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:50,674
What matters is that you got pushed
to the edge today and you didn't fall off.

174
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,593
You did what you had to do.

175
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:56,722
I don't judge you for it.

176
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,309
And I don't think it's crazy.

177
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:30,505
We could've met somewhere
a little warmer.

178
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,550
Walmart wanted to knock this down,
build a store here.

179
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,844
- But the community put a stop to it.
- I know.

180
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:39,723
Because they wouldn't give a tax credit
unless entry-level wages were higher.

181
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:41,850
So which is better?
A shitty job, or no job?

182
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,561
- Well, I think I know your answer.
- Don't be so sure.

183
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:49,482
Jackie, you have repeatedly opposed
the minimum-wage and CEO salary bill

184
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:53,362
- I asked the leadership to introduce.
- I've put a lot of thought into it.

185
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,947
This community took a stand.

186
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,950
If enough of them do, Congress
won't have a choice but to act.

187
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,701
Are we here to talk about legislation?

188
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,453
Because we both
have a debate in six hours.

189
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,874
I want to endorse you.

190
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:10,296
I'll lay off you tonight.
You and I attack Underwood.

191
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,757
In three days,
I'll drop out and endorse.

192
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,843
- We haven't even had the first caucus.
- You two are neck-and-neck.

193
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,763
I have 14 points in Iowa,
twelve in New Hampshire.

194
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:24,017
You get my people,
you have a clear win in both states.

195
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,979
My endorsement is valuable.

196
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,521
How much does Underwood value it?

197
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,482
- Highly.
- What did he offer you?

198
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,155
I'm more interested
in what you have to offer.

199
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:38,740
Did he promise a cabinet position?

200
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:43,203
More than that?

201
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,417
He offered to put you
on the ticket, didn't he?

202
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,585
I wouldn't expect to be
on your ticket, Heather.

203
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:53,005
You need a Southerner with a penis.

204
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,882
I was thinking Secretary of Defense,
given my war record.

205
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,302
But I'd be open to other ideas.

206
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:04,308
I would love your support, Jackie,
but I offer you nothing.

207
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,687
But... this is an easy win.

208
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,939
I'm not gonna start
selling off cabinet positions

209
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,774
before I've won the White House.

210
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:16,069
Those decisions will be
based purely on merit.

211
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:21,367
If I'm gonna lock up this nomination
for you, I deserve to be compensated.

212
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,120
I plan on winning, Jackie.
Just... not your way.

213
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:28,123
And with or without your support.

214
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:30,209
Then I'm sticking with Underwood.

215
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,336
You do what you have to do.

216
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:53,482
Is Jackie in here?

217
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,234
Hi, Bob.

218
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:56,693
- Hi.
- Hi.

219
00:15:56,776 --> 00:15:58,111
Sorry I'm late.

220
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:00,364
- How did your surgery go?
- Terrible.

221
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,657
The patient almost didn't make it.

222
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,951
- But he's alive?
- She. And yeah.

223
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,912
- Stable condition.
- Oh...

224
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,955
It means so much to me that you came.

225
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,541
All done.

226
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:12,959
- Do you like?
- It's good. Thank you.

227
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:18,840
- So, how'd it go with--?
- Thanks.

228
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:26,265
- What'd she offer?
- Nothing.

229
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:29,059
- Nothing at all?
- I know, I was surprised, too.

230
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,977
It's foolish. She could lock this up.

231
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:35,190
I have to say,
I almost... respect it.

232
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,484
Anyway, you were right.

233
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,652
Stick with the devil you know.

234
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,657
Are the kids watching tonight?

235
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:47,619
Yeah. They've got all their friends
over at the house.

236
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,956
Listen, the ki--

237
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,583
What?

238
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,670
Nothing. How do I look?

239
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:01,883
I'd throw you on that bed right now
if it wouldn't mess up your hair.

240
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,512
Mm...

241
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,598
Watch me prep.

242
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,767
You can mess up my hair all you want
after the debate.

243
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:19,901
- She's here.
- There she is.

244
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,038
Quiet, guys. Quiet, guys.
Here she comes.

245
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:36,042
Quiet, quiet!

246
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,260
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, everyone!

247
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:49,264
Thank all of you so very much

248
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,933
for working so hard to make sure
we take New Hampshire.

249
00:17:55,145 --> 00:17:57,856
It is field offices like this
that win primaries,

250
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:01,109
and the president wants you to know
how much your dedication means to us.

251
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,902
Thank you so much. Thank you.

252
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:07,115
- Now, who's ready to watch a debate?
- Yeah!

253
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,535
There is a large crowd here
in Sioux City tonight.

254
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:12,704
I would say potential voters,
but of course, here in Iowa,

255
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:16,124
citizens caucus instead of vote,
and many of the people here in this room

256
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,336
will be doing just that on January 15th.

257
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:23,423
A CNN ORC poll has it as a tight race
between the two front-runners.

258
00:18:23,507 --> 00:18:26,092
Heather Dunbar at 32 percent.

259
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:28,428
President Frank Underwood at 30 percent.

260
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:32,474
Congresswoman Jackie Sharp trails
in third at 14 percent.

261
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,101
Twenty-two percent remain undecided.

262
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,978
You can switch it.

263
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,480
Really?

264
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,191
- Unless you want to watch.
- No, I thought you would.

265
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:43,443
It's your last night here.

266
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,364
I want to spend it with my brother,
not Frank Underwood.

267
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,449
What do you want to watch instead?

268
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,202
Anything. Whatever you want.

269
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:55,455
...promising universal employment,
and on Israeli Palestinian relations...

270
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,958
Oh, shit.
Have you ever seen Contagion?

271
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,502
No.

272
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:03,296
If you're a clean freak, this'll
definitely make you a germ freak.

273
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,174
- I love this movie.
- Go for it.

274
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:17,852
Welcome to the first Democratic
nomination debate hosted by CNN.

275
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:21,773
Our candidates tonight: Frank Underwood,
Jackie Sharp, and Heather Dunbar.

276
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,025
I'm John King and
I'll be your moderator tonight.

277
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:25,860
Our debate will be divided in two parts,

278
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:28,614
the first part focusing
on foreign policy,

279
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:30,990
part two focusing
on the domestic agenda.

280
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:35,704
And our format will be as follows:
I will ask one candidate a question.

281
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:37,997
That candidate will have
one minute to answer.

282
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:41,042
After that, all of our candidates
can engage in an open conversation

283
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:44,296
lasting for five minutes.
We begin, though, with opening statements.

284
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:47,633
And by lottery, it was decided
that President Underwood goes first.

285
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:50,051
- Mr. President.
- Thank you. And good evening, John,

286
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:54,431
good evening to my fellow candidates,
and to the good people of Sioux City.

287
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:58,143
This nomination comes down
to one word: vision.

288
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:01,647
I believe that I have shown
a clear vision to this country

289
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,275
with America Works,
the most comprehensive jobs program

290
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:07,026
in nearly a century.

291
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,696
We showed it could work
in Washington DC.

292
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,784
We need now to take what we did there
and spread it nationwide,

293
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:17,537
so that the American dream
can become the American reality.

294
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:21,500
But that vision isn't enough on its own.

295
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,295
You need someone
with experience to make it happen.

296
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:28,298
And between my time in Congress
and now at the White House,

297
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:32,218
I have more experience than
both of my opponents combined.

298
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:34,805
And, uh, when you hire someone for a job,

299
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:37,349
are you gonna hire someone
with 30 years' experience,

300
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:41,394
or someone with less than ten
or someone with no experience at all?

301
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:45,816
Where I come from down south, we call
that as clear as a glass of moonshine.

302
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:51,988
Former Solicitor General
Dunbar is next.

303
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:54,324
- Your opening statement, please.
- Thank you, John.

304
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:56,117
And thank you Iowa.

305
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:59,705
Well, I agree with the president.

306
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:03,792
Vision and experience
are exactly what America needs.

307
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:08,296
Unfortunately, he has the wrong vision
and horrendous experience.

308
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,467
You can call America Works visionary,
but in truth,

309
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:16,638
it is just an ultra-conservative agenda
that's been around for decades.

310
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:20,141
Dismantle the safety net
and hang people out to dry.

311
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:23,729
As for the president's experience,
he was in the leadership

312
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:27,858
during one of the most ineffective
decades in Congressional history.

313
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,985
As president, he has failed
at everything he's done.

314
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:36,282
America Works was illegal in the minds
of many legal experts, myself included.

315
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:39,118
His Jordan Valley plan was a disaster.

316
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:41,204
If that's what you call experience,

317
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:45,375
you're not just padding the résumé,
you are fabricating it.

318
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,379
President Underwood
isn't presenting us with a vision,

319
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:53,132
he is convincing himself
of his own delusion.

320
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:57,387
Now, my vision
is to tackle corporate greed,

321
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,639
raise pay for those who need it most,

322
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:02,559
and create jobs by growing the economy,

323
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:05,854
not robbing people
of their retirement and health care.

324
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:11,192
My experience is 20 years
defending the Constitution.

325
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:16,364
You know when I take my presidential
oath, I will mean every word of it.

326
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,621
Ms. Dunbar, thank you.
Congresswoman Sharp,

327
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:24,915
- your opening statement, please.
- Thank you.

328
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:28,334
As many of you know,
I am a US Army veteran.

329
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:32,213
Now, I've seen firsthand
the great sacrifices

330
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:35,884
my fellow servicemen and women
have made defending this country.

331
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:40,096
But how can we ask them
to protect a system

332
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,140
that isn't protecting us?

333
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:43,516
Take women, for example.

334
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,394
There are two women
at this debate running for president.

335
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:50,231
That's extraordinary.
But out in the general workforce?

336
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:54,778
Women earn 77 cents
on the dollar compared to men.

337
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:59,783
Even worse is minority women
earning 67 cents on the dollar.

338
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:04,162
Now, Ms. Dunbar can talk
about balancing the scales,

339
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:07,791
but she inherited
a multi-billion-dollar fortune

340
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:11,252
and never had to earn
any cents on the dollar.

341
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:15,173
Now, I don't agree with everything
that President Underwood has done

342
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:19,135
or proposes, but at least he knows
what it means to work for a living.

343
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:21,554
I can give you even better than that.

344
00:23:21,638 --> 00:23:24,724
I know what it means
to fight for a living.

345
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:28,269
And I will fight
for fairness here at home

346
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:31,439
just as fiercely as
I fought our enemies overseas.

347
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,692
Thank you.

348
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:36,695
Thank you, Congresswoman.
Let's move to part one: foreign policy.

349
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:38,905
And the first question
is for you, Mr. President.

350
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:42,200
Given the recent volatile events
in the Jordan Valley, do you still believe

351
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:45,495
it was correct to assemble the United
Nations coalition and to intervene,

352
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:48,414
or is it time now
to call that intervention a mistake?

353
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:51,376
Well, I will answer that question, John,
but I'd like to address first

354
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,712
something Ms. Dunbar said
a few moments ago.

355
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:57,340
America Works is not some stale,
old, conservative agenda.

356
00:23:57,423 --> 00:24:01,594
You name me one Republican
who has suggested using federal funds

357
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:07,017
to guarantee jobs for every American
who wants one and I will eat my hat.

358
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,519
This isn't about dismantling government.
It is about--

359
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:12,605
Aren't we supposed to be talking
about foreign policy?

360
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:15,191
Yeah, I will.
But first, I'd like to correct--

361
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:17,527
Because it's easier
to talk about America Works

362
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,571
than to defend your
indefensible UN mission.

363
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,531
At least I have a record
to defend, Ms. Dunbar.

364
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:23,408
Speaking of your record, Mr. President,

365
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:26,661
you went on record saying
you wouldn't run for president.

366
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,580
- And yet here you are.
- John, it seems that

367
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,665
your very thoughtful rules
have gone out the window.

368
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:32,584
You have no respect for rules,
Mr. President.

369
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,335
Take FEMA, for example.

370
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,963
Oh, you want to talk about FEMA now
instead of foreign policy.

371
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:38,757
I am just following your lead, sir.

372
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,052
See what a mess we get into when
we follow your brand of leadership?

373
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:47,390
Well, I must admit that Ms. Dunbar
does have many years of experience

374
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:50,100
making rhetorical arguments in court.

375
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,896
You've just seen proof of that today.

376
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:56,315
But serving the American people
is not about what you say,

377
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:57,984
it's about what you do.

378
00:24:58,068 --> 00:25:00,946
And I would ask:
what have you ever done?

379
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,908
I have to agree that Ms. Dunbar's
lack of experience is a concern.

380
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:07,035
I find it ironic
that the president talks about

381
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:09,370
the importance of experience,
given the fact

382
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,706
that he appointed his wife
UN ambassador

383
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,543
- despite her utter lack of credentials.
- That's a sexist comment.

384
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:17,503
Excuse me?

385
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:19,129
You wouldn't be making that argument

386
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:22,258
if a female president
had appointed her husband.

387
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:25,177
A husband with the same lack
of international affairs experience

388
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:27,179
as Claire Underwood?
Yes, I would.

389
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:30,725
In fact, it makes me question
your advocacy for women in general.

390
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,351
Well, that's ridiculous.

391
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,729
What have you done
to further gender equality?

392
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:37,523
What have you done
to balance the scales?

393
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:41,778
That's your slogan, and yet you've left
half of the population out of the mix.

394
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,321
But that is simply not true.

395
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,573
Can, can you name one specific thing?

396
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:48,994
Yes, I can. Being a woman,
who has served as Solicitor General,

397
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:51,370
one of the few
in the history of the court.

398
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:53,039
Well, that advanced your interests,

399
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:56,334
but what did that do
for 150 million women out there?

400
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,377
The very fact that a woman
can hold that position--

401
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:01,714
- So you are a symbol.
- In a way, yes, I suppose I am.

402
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,009
Me and many other women,
including yourself--

403
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:08,096
Okay, but how does that get us
from 77 cents on the dollar to 100?

404
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:09,931
Real cents. Not symbolic cents.

405
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:12,308
Well, now you're just
aping the president's rhetoric.

406
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:14,144
Another sexist comment.

407
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:16,228
How could you possibly
misconstrue my words?

408
00:26:16,312 --> 00:26:18,606
I speak for myself.

409
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,526
I am not aping the president
or any other man.

410
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,111
I'm sorry, I won't engage with this--

411
00:26:23,193 --> 00:26:26,031
You know, when things get tough
on the battlefield, we never say,

412
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:30,994
"Sorry, I won't engage."
We engage, Ms. Dunbar.

413
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:36,582
And you need to confront the fact

414
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:40,003
that you do not have
women's best interests at heart.

415
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:42,088
John, this is getting out of hand.

416
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:44,507
All right, then let's move on
to the next question.

417
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,759
We are in the foreign policy portion
of this debate.

418
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:50,096
Ms. Dunbar, let me bring this question
to you. You're critical of the president.

419
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,724
You say it's indefensible,
what he has done in the Jordan Valley.

420
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:54,767
But specifically,
what would you do differently?

421
00:26:54,851 --> 00:26:58,396
Well, John, I'm glad you asked that.
Sending troops into the Jordan Valley...

422
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:01,231
- I need to go back to the hotel.
- ...isn't what I call diplomacy.

423
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:05,111
Everybody, Mrs. Underwood
needs to leave us now.

424
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:09,074
I really wish I could stay,
but I have a very full day tomorrow.

425
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:11,283
I should rest up.
But again, I want to thank you all

426
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,828
for your hospitality
and all of your hard work.

427
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,164
Thank you so much.

428
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,041
Good night, everyone.

429
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:28,300
His trickle-down diplomacy
is another example of delusion.

430
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,302
Mrs. Underwood.

431
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:33,932
Oh, you should go back inside
with the volunteers

432
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:36,101
and have the full
campaign experience.

433
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:39,145
I didn't come to New Hampshire for that.
I came to speak with you.

434
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:42,190
Tomorrow, maybe.
My brain is a bit fried.

435
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:45,026
Is it what Sharp said?
Why you don't want to watch anymore?

436
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,071
- The sexist comment?
- Oh, I honestly don't care.

437
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:49,906
It's all spectacle.

438
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:51,950
Who can get the most points, right?

439
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:53,451
Good night.

440
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:58,206
Now for part two of our debate:
the domestic agenda.

441
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,541
And the first question goes to you,
Congresswoman.

442
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,376
The President speaks of America Works.

443
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,005
Ms. Dunbar wants to raise minimum wage.
Talks about regulating executive pay.

444
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,967
But a lot of people aren't quite clear
about your economic policy.

445
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,301
What specifically,
I underscore "specifically,"

446
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,054
would you do if elected president?

447
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:16,641
Well, I plan to do a lot.
And we talked about this earlier.

448
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:22,438
First and foremost, I want to press for
gender equality and close the salary gap.

449
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:26,067
If half of the working population
has more money in their pockets,

450
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:29,737
that will catalyze spending,
which will grow the economy,

451
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,198
which will, in turn, create more jobs.

452
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:34,159
Mr. President,
what do you think of that?

453
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:37,536
Oh, I agree. I think that
gender equality is very important.

454
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,708
And under my AmWorks program, there will
be a provision that all AmWorks jobs,

455
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:45,795
there can be no discrepancy in pay
between men and women.

456
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:49,299
AmWorks jobs, that's the government.
What about the rest of the private sector?

457
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,634
We have to start by leading by example,
then we introduce--

458
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:54,262
Leading by example? If America Works
is how you lead by example...

459
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:55,972
I'm sorry, please let me finish my point.

460
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:58,599
If that is how you lead by example,
then are we to assume

461
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:02,353
that everyone should illegally raid funds
that they have no right to use?

462
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:05,898
Everyone should start robbing banks?
Holding up liquor stores?

463
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:09,610
Now, Ms. Dunbar, with all due respect,
you can criticize my programs

464
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:12,613
as much as you want,
but to accuse me of illegal activity--

465
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:15,533
One thing you can't deny
is that I am much more of an authority

466
00:29:15,616 --> 00:29:17,994
on the Constitution than you are,
Mr. President.

467
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:25,626
Ms. Dunbar, all three of us on this
stage have taken oaths of office.

468
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,672
I would have to say that we
have all defended the Constitution.

469
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:33,009
You don't have some special claim
on the Constitution.

470
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:35,386
The Constitution belongs
to everyone in this room

471
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,388
and every citizen in the United States.

472
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:46,522
But I would ask Ms. Sharp, you voted
in favor of dismantling America Works.

473
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:51,069
Was that because you thought it was
in fact, as Ms. Dunbar says, illegal?

474
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:54,697
I voted for dismantlement
because I wanted to make sure

475
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,157
we were prepared for the hurricane,

476
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:59,952
not because I thought your reading
of the Stafford Act was illegal per se.

477
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:03,414
Honestly, you think the president
had a right to do what he did?

478
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,375
It's an appropriations issue,
not a legal one.

479
00:30:05,457 --> 00:30:06,667
What about his character?

480
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,794
He basically walked into FEMA and said,

481
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:10,838
"Stick 'em up and show me
where the vault is."

482
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:13,383
So now I'm a bank robber.
Six Gun Underwood,

483
00:30:13,465 --> 00:30:16,510
what they call me in South Carolina.

484
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:21,599
I'm sorry, but I do not find this funny.

485
00:30:21,682 --> 00:30:25,103
I say you are a hypocrite.

486
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:28,522
You claim to care about
the ten million people out of work,

487
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:31,525
but you will steal
their disaster relief fund...

488
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:34,946
- This is an appropriations issue.
- ...Social Security and health care.

489
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:37,073
We put 50,000 people to work
in Washington DC.

490
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:41,452
Heather Dunbar wants to balance
the scales to fix a broken system.

491
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:45,206
And yet she sends her own kids
to private school.

492
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,459
With money she never earned,
but which she inherited.

493
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,587
Now, it is easy to talk
about the problems of the poor

494
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,215
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

495
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,805
Am I well-off? Absolutely.

496
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:03,891
So was FDR when
he developed the New Deal.

497
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:07,353
Since when does one's income
determine one's amount of empathy?

498
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,147
Would you send your kids to public school?

499
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,523
Let's keep our children out of this.

500
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,734
You want your kids to have a head start,

501
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:16,487
to have an advantage
over the kids in public schools.

502
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,656
Lots of Americans,
of all ranges of income,

503
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:21,617
choose to send their children
to private or parochial schools.

504
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,329
But isn't it true
that you want your children

505
00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:26,747
to have a leg up on everyone else?

506
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:30,668
Is that balancing the scales?
Or is that hypocrisy?

507
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:33,587
Or maybe it's that you
didn't want to raise them yourself

508
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:35,714
so you sent them to boarding school.

509
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,469
Wow.

510
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:41,512
You must really want to be president.

511
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,808
I would never in a million years
bring up your children in a debate.

512
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:48,853
The way you choose to raise them
is your business.

513
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:52,398
Do I want the best for my kids?
Yes, I do.

514
00:31:52,482 --> 00:31:54,317
I imagine you're the same way.

515
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,943
I hope you are.

516
00:31:57,487 --> 00:32:00,281
Well, I'm sure you're
both excellent mothers.

517
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:02,033
But perhaps we should get back to some--

518
00:32:02,116 --> 00:32:05,036
Congresswoman Sharp raised
the issue of sexism earlier.

519
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,080
Now, it is an important point,
and we need to address it.

520
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:11,125
Sexism is wrong.
The Congresswoman is correct

521
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,836
in saying that all aspects of it
should be illegal.

522
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,216
And then, she accused me of being sexist
for criticizing Claire Underwood.

523
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,801
But wouldn't that same logic
hold true for you, Ms. Sharp?

524
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:23,846
Would you have come after my kids
if I were a man?

525
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:26,932
Aren't you trying to paint the picture
that I'm a bad mother,

526
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:29,435
shipping my kids off
to some far-flung place?

527
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,397
Because you know if you can
make me seem like a bad mother,

528
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,317
then how could anyone
possibly support me?

529
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:40,112
That's not hardball,
that is just disgusting.

530
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:49,163
Well, I have to say I do think
Ms. Dunbar has a point.

531
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:50,456
I mean, speaking of hypocrisy,

532
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,001
don't you send your own kids
to private school, Congresswoman?

533
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:01,384
- Well, that wasn't my point. I--
- What was your point?

534
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:06,680
Well, I was, um...

535
00:33:06,764 --> 00:33:09,308
My... My point....

536
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:16,899
Um...

537
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:21,446
John, I think I've said
all I need to say on this subject.

538
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:25,241
All right, fair enough, Congresswoman.
Next question goes to you, Ms. Dunbar.

539
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,621
Okay, guys, first poll is coming in.

540
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:33,499
Most of them give
Frank Underwood the win. Not by a lot.

541
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,835
But did he do enough to overtake Dunbar,
become the front-runner?

542
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,089
George, I don't think it's so much what
Underwood did, but what he didn't do.

543
00:33:40,172 --> 00:33:41,507
He remained presidential.

544
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:44,594
And when the attacks came his way,
he held the high ground.

545
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:48,306
Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out
swinging, and I think it hurt them both.

546
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:51,559
Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.
She's 20 points behind the other two.

547
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:54,061
But the sexism thing?
And going after Dunbar's kids?

548
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:56,814
- It seemed quite desperate.
- She did do some damage to Dunbar.

549
00:33:56,897 --> 00:34:00,109
I don't know about that.
Dunbar could've fared far worse.

550
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:04,113
She took it on the chin, held her own,
and in my opinion, it was a tie.

551
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:06,698
But bottom line,
does this debate change anything?

552
00:34:06,782 --> 00:34:09,619
Does it affect the caucus, does it
affect the primary in New Hampshire?

553
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:11,621
We're still over a month out.

554
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:13,414
And so a lot could change
in this process,

555
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:16,208
but I do think the momentum
could shift in Underwood's favor.

556
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:19,545
Let's not forget that it's remarkable
that a sitting president

557
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:21,672
isn't considered
the front-runner to begin with.

558
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:25,343
That's an excellent point. No incumbent
has ever had to fight back from this far--

559
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:34,477
- Yes?
- He said she's not picking up, sir.

560
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,604
Would you like me to have him
knock on her door?

561
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:38,189
No, that's all right. Thank you.

562
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:54,913
You haven't said a word.

563
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,836
Well, you've been prepping for days.

564
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,255
I thought you might want
a break from talking.

565
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,510
You're disappointed in me.

566
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:10,429
That the kids got mentioned.

567
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:14,183
They're teenagers. They'll be fine.

568
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:18,396
Probably thrilled...
that they got mentioned at all.

569
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:24,652
If I'm disappointed in anyone, it's him,
for throwing you under the bus.

570
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:34,078
I gotta fly back with you tonight.

571
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:35,871
Don't you have events tomorrow?

572
00:35:35,954 --> 00:35:37,623
This is more important.

573
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,501
What is?

574
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:07,278
Thank you all for coming in.

575
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:09,321
If you want to head
out this door right here.

576
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:11,907
Thank you very much.

577
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:17,580
All right, I'll give you some privacy.
This should only take 15 minutes.

578
00:36:17,663 --> 00:36:20,291
- So just holler out if you need anything.
- Thank you.

579
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,170
Pull up a chair.
We can talk while this finishes up.

580
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,426
I should be doing this, too.

581
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,139
I'm sure we could
get another lawn chair in here.

582
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:37,849
I can't.
I was a junkie once upon a time.

583
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:44,523
What would you call this color?
Scarlet isn't right.

584
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:46,191
It's not crimson or maroon.

585
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,402
- Carmine.
- Carmine?

586
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:50,946
- You must be a writer.
- Oh...

587
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:53,907
No, I know that.
But you know she always tells everyone

588
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:56,327
she bakes them herself
and I know she doesn't.

589
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,371
That's local.

590
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:01,873
Thank you for your support.
I'll see you when I get there.

591
00:37:01,957 --> 00:37:04,876
Is there some reason
we couldn't do this by phone?

592
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,378
This needed to be in person.

593
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:08,297
Yes, but you canceled all your events.

594
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,923
I want to talk about the debate.

595
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:12,968
You know, it wasn't the home run
we hoped for, but you did great, Jackie.

596
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:15,262
She spent half the debate
on the defensive.

597
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:18,474
- I humiliated myself.
- You got a little beat up, that's all.

598
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:21,852
- And you threw the biggest punch.
- Oh, you mean the thing about your kids?

599
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,270
That wasn't what we discussed.

600
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:25,523
I had to hit you hard so she wouldn't.

601
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:28,233
And besides,
we had to dispel any suspicion

602
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:29,610
that you and I might be in concert.

603
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:32,863
I'm not comfortable
with the dynamic we've established.

604
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:37,702
What dynamic is that?

605
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:39,911
The leash you have me on.

606
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:43,624
How I'm supposed to roll over
and do any trick you want.

607
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,876
You're taking me for granted.

608
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:49,129
What, am I supposed to be, uh...

609
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:52,508
appreciative of your
lackluster enthusiasm?

610
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:58,723
How fortunate I am
to have you "sort of" on my team?

611
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:03,268
You're not "happy" with our dynamic?

612
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:06,271
Well, I'm not happy with your attitude.

613
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:08,607
If anything,
you're taking me for granted.

614
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:11,861
- Sir--
- We had a deal, Jackie.

615
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:14,697
And I am perfectly willing
to hold up my end of the bargain.

616
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,907
But do not be under any illusions.

617
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,326
This is not a partnership of equals.

618
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,952
Nothing close to it.

619
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:25,457
If you are to be my vice president,
you will do what I ask.

620
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:28,043
And we will not have this conversation

621
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:31,714
every time you feel uncomfortable
with what I ask you to do,

622
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:34,842
or how I choose to conduct myself.

623
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:38,178
That's our dynamic.

624
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:48,606
- Are we still sticking to the timeline?
- I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you.

625
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:50,941
Are we still sticking to the timeline?
I drop out next week?

626
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,443
I see no reason why you shouldn't.

627
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:54,612
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- See you in Iowa.

628
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:59,157
Why did you change your hair
back to blonde?

629
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:00,992
That's your burning question?

630
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:02,703
I'm curious.

631
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:06,123
How does that help the book?

632
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:08,793
Who knows? But right now, I got nothing.

633
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:12,922
We changed it because blonde polls
better with the voters.

634
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:14,381
We?

635
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:18,594
There's a whole gaggle of people

636
00:39:18,677 --> 00:39:22,139
that weigh in on how you look,
and what you wear,

637
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:27,018
whether an event calls for...
heels, earrings, no earrings.

638
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:30,397
You hate it, don't you?
Campaigning?

639
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:33,108
Everybody hates campaigning.

640
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:35,820
Except for the politicians.
They feed off the energy.

641
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:38,447
And their spouses.

642
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,074
You think Francis feeds off me?

643
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:43,911
You are literally giving your blood.

644
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:46,622
Plenty of people give blood
who aren't married to politicians.

645
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:51,502
Very few people campaign
for someone who just fired them.

646
00:39:54,546 --> 00:39:56,214
He tell you that?

647
00:39:56,298 --> 00:40:00,511
He said he betrayed you. Three days later,
you change your hair back to blonde

648
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:03,889
and resign so you can, quote,
"devote yourself to the campaign."

649
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,851
I did the math.

650
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,271
You and Francis, you've....

651
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:14,232
We've what?

652
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,322
He's shared a lot.

653
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,993
Does that bother you?

654
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,494
Why would it?

655
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:28,413
Another betrayal?

656
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:30,415
No.

657
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:32,083
You're...

658
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:39,884
Are you okay?

659
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,593
Just a little light-headed.

660
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:49,226
- Here.
- Thank you.

661
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:02,990
I was thinking.

662
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:04,449
About what?

663
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,954
Mrs. Underwood?

664
00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:10,288
Jumping.

665
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:14,710
- Jumping?
- Mm.

666
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:16,503
You ever have that feeling?

667
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:19,256
- Conversation?
- Which feeling?

668
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:24,720
On a bridge, you look over and...

669
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:28,139
step back.

670
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,644
Do you need me to get someone?

671
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:36,189
He proposed and I said...

672
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:39,109
I said seven years.

673
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:45,824
If it's still good, another seven.

674
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,451
If not...

675
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,914
Every seven years.

676
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:57,586
I don't hate campaigning.

677
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,214
What I hate is...

678
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:08,513
how much I need us.

679
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,599
How much you need each other?

680
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:18,107
I didn't jump.

681
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:19,900
I didn't step back.

682
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:26,531
I didn't...

683
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:27,992
Mrs. Underwood?

684
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:32,871
Hey!

685
00:42:32,955 --> 00:42:34,539
- What happened?
- She passed out.

686
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,916
Let me see. Mrs. Underwood?

687
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,044
Can you hear me? Mrs. Underwood?

688
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:41,672
So all these three girls,
they got a different papi or what?

689
00:42:41,755 --> 00:42:45,509
They got the blonde, they got
the redhead, they got the brunette.

690
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:48,971
- And that's Petticoat Junction, right?
- Sir?

691
00:42:49,054 --> 00:42:51,556
- May we speak privately?
- Oh, let me let y'all be.

692
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,267
- You're in the middle of your story.
- Sir, if you don't mind.

693
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:56,311
- Is it classified?
- No, it is not.

694
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:58,355
Then talk.

695
00:42:58,438 --> 00:43:01,232
Jackie just stopped by my office.
She's upset.

696
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:03,986
I think we need to take her views
more into consideration.

697
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:07,698
- She's being ridiculous.
- I think she made some valid points.

698
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:13,328
Who do you work for, me or her?

699
00:43:13,411 --> 00:43:15,664
I'm just trying to communicate
her concerns.

700
00:43:15,747 --> 00:43:17,875
She'd better get in line and so had you.

701
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:20,002
I'm never gonna win
if I have to spend my time

702
00:43:20,085 --> 00:43:21,753
explaining myself to my subordinates.

703
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:24,214
- Look, let me let you--
- No, no. Now, Freddy, sit down.

704
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:27,509
Do you remember when we
talked about how you treat your staff?

705
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:31,013
You want to win? You sure as hell
won't do it without any of them.

706
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,223
You keep on like this,
you won't have any of them left.

707
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:37,268
Are you talking about loyalty? The only
brand of that I accept is unconditional.

708
00:43:37,352 --> 00:43:40,814
- Anything less is a--
- Y'all should put this on pay-per-view.

709
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:44,026
But you. You a big guy.
But this sucker,

710
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:47,946
I've seen him go through
a rack of ribs like it was wet tissue.

711
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,908
- Who'd you put your money on?
- Oh, I'm not gonna fall into that trap.

712
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:53,410
- You.
- Sir? It's your wife.

713
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:55,370
- She passed out giving blood.
- What?

714
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:57,372
She's okay,
but, uh, Mr. Yates is on the line.

715
00:43:57,455 --> 00:43:59,791
I'll take it in my private study.

716
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:06,423
Don't do no good
callin' a man out like that.

717
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:11,053
It's like...
blamin' a snake for having fangs.

718
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:13,597
- I couldn't help myself.
- Mmm...

719
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,807
- Could you do me a favor?
- What's that?

720
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:19,269
Cover for me.
I got work to do and he needs company.

721
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:21,897
Back at the ribs joint,
I could just walk back in the kitchen

722
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,066
when I got tired of hearing him talk.

723
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:27,194
- Yeah. I'll tell him your boss came over.
- Thank you, brother.

724
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:45,170
Put her on the phone with me.

725
00:44:45,254 --> 00:44:47,464
She didn't want me to call,
but I thought I should.

726
00:44:47,547 --> 00:44:50,217
- Well, is she nearby?
- I think she's embarrassed.

727
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:52,052
I'm her husband.

728
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:55,639
The nurses are with her. Maybe you should
just hold off for a few minutes.

729
00:44:55,722 --> 00:44:58,391
Tell the head of her detail
to get her on the plane right away.

730
00:44:58,475 --> 00:45:01,186
She has to come back here
and see the White House physician.

731
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,648
My guess is she'd be even more embarrassed
if she had to cancel her events.

732
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:07,609
This isn't about how she feels.
This is about what's best for her.

733
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:11,196
She doesn't need a doctor.
She needs you.

734
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,948
What do you mean?

735
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:16,118
She said some things,
about every seven years.

736
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:19,788
About being in limbo,
on the edge of a bridge.

737
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:23,541
Listen, just because I may have shared
with you a few things about our marriage

738
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,961
does not give you the right
to interfere with it.

739
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:28,463
Now, please have her
call me when she's ready.

740
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:36,805
Well... this is it.

741
00:45:36,888 --> 00:45:39,933
- Sixty days.
- Sixty days.

742
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,936
That movie freaked me out.

743
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:46,731
The whole world can fall apart
in sixty days.

744
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:49,818
Or a guy can get sober.

745
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:53,404
I washed my hands for ten minutes
last night before bed.

746
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:55,657
You turned me
from an alcoholic to a germaphobe.

747
00:45:56,783 --> 00:45:59,119
That's not a bad trade-off.

748
00:45:59,203 --> 00:46:01,621
The 14 years I got by on my own...

749
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:05,917
They mean nothing compared to the last
eight weeks you've been here with me.

750
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:07,627
Well...

751
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:09,921
You would have done the same for me.

752
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:12,174
I'd like to think so.

753
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:15,468
Know so.

754
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:19,639
I love you, brother.

755
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:42,704
Call me when you land.

756
00:46:42,787 --> 00:46:44,956
Jesus, you sound like Sarah.

757
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,014
So we want to focus on ad-buys

758
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:03,850
more in the Quad Cities market,
less so in Des Moines.

759
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:07,687
You're stronger in the East and we want
to turn our twos there into ones.

760
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:11,816
The "vision" message really resonated
in our focus groups post-debate,

761
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,569
so I think we should cut
a new ad centered on that

762
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:16,696
and weave it into the stump.

763
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,159
Sir?

764
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,203
I'm sorry, what?

765
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:26,081
Are you good if we change the stump
to focus on the "vision" theme?

766
00:47:26,164 --> 00:47:28,417
I want to go to New Hampshire tomorrow,
first thing.

767
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:29,876
We have you going to Iowa.

768
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,628
I know, but I want
to change the schedule.

769
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:35,715
In every campaign,
there comes a time for taking stock.

770
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:38,135
A time for soul-searching. And...

771
00:47:38,218 --> 00:47:42,347
in the past 24 hours,
I have done just that.

772
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:46,017
And the conclusion
that I have come to is this:

773
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:50,563
If the goal is a safer,
more prosperous America,

774
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:53,108
I don't need to run
for us to achieve that.

775
00:47:53,191 --> 00:47:57,988
All I need to do and what I encourage
all of my supporters to do

776
00:47:58,071 --> 00:48:02,033
is to help elect Heather Dunbar
to the White House.

777
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,288
- Judas bitch.
- While I may be ending my camp--

778
00:48:12,377 --> 00:48:15,172
I'm just pissed off.
I'm sorry if I offended.

779
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:19,717
Yeah, I wonder what she offered her.

780
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:21,470
Nothing.

781
00:48:21,552 --> 00:48:23,472
Yeah, right.

782
00:48:23,554 --> 00:48:25,390
I know for a fact.

783
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,393
You knew about this?

784
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:38,945
You should call the president.

785
00:48:56,171 --> 00:49:00,549
"A very hairy, terribly scary
tarantula named Tina.

786
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,136
I found her in a shoebox
in New York City.

787
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,014
When I first saw Tina I shrieked..."

788
00:49:06,097 --> 00:49:07,516
Eek! Eek! Eek!

789
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:08,808
Were you scared?

790
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:11,061
Oh, I was terribly scared.

791
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:14,523
"Tina had poked her head up
out of the left shoe..."

792
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:17,942
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Shh... She doesn't either.

793
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:21,029
"So there I was,
not knowing what to believe.

794
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:25,075
Should I leave Tina in the shoebox
or set Tina free?"

795
00:49:25,158 --> 00:49:27,327
- Leave her in the box!
- Set her free!

796
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:28,995
- Set her free!
- Leave her in the box!

797
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,788
Oh, my goodness!
I don't know what to do!

798
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:32,290
Nothing! Do nothing!

799
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:34,751
Sir, Mr. Grayson
needs to speak with you.

800
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:37,003
- Tell him I'll call him back.
- He says it's important.

801
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:40,298
Later. I'm with my wife.

802
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:42,800
I don't know what to do!

803
00:49:42,884 --> 00:49:44,802
You shouldn't do anything.

804
00:49:44,886 --> 00:49:47,431
- Let her out!
- Don't do anything?

805
00:49:55,387 --> 00:50:00,779
