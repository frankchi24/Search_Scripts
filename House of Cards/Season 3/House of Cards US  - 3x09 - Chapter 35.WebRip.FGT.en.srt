1
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:01,363
Well, the president just saw me come.

2
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:03,239
Oh...

3
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,495
- You don't like my giraffe?
- No.

4
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:15,084
You know I'm divorced twice
and have a daughter in college, right?

5
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:19,006
- It's on your Wikipedia page.
- Wikipedia.

6
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,716
Christ.

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,677
I don't have any expectations.

8
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,180
I never have, of anyone.

9
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:29,725
You shouldn't either.

10
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:34,813
How many events have we skipped today?

11
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:37,066
Mm...

12
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:42,153
Three so far.

13
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,656
And we're about to skip a fourth.

14
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,243
- All on the Telegraph's dime.
- Hey, I'm a free agent.

15
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:51,538
Means I'm free to bail on a speech
I've already seen ten thousand times.

16
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:54,541
You are entitled...

17
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:58,503
- to nothing.
- Stop.

18
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:01,339
Let me be clear.
I say, I say...

19
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,133
Come here, boy.

20
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,552
You are entitled...

21
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:07,054
To nothing!

22
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:10,390
Now, here's the truth:
The American dream is broken.

23
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:13,310
And when we are robbed of our dreams,

24
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:15,896
well, let me ask you, folks,
what are we left with?

25
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,147
Nothing!

26
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,525
And when I asked Congress
to help me take this country

27
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:26,031
from a welfare state to a fully-employed
nation, what did Congress do?

28
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:27,240
Nothing!

29
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:30,285
And when we proved that
America Works actually works,

30
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:34,665
when we created 50,000 jobs
in Washington DC,

31
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:37,417
Congress didn't just stop at nothing,

32
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:40,754
they killed progress in its tracks.

33
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:47,136
Believe me, I know how you feel.

34
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:49,096
But we have to remember why we're here.

35
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:52,474
We have to turn that anger into action.

36
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,102
Ma'am, the Secretary General...

37
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:58,355
America Works will succeed,
but we need your help.

38
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:59,648
Hello?

39
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:03,777
You need to let them know
that a vote for Frank Underwood

40
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:06,363
is a vote for America Works!

41
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:13,704
A vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works!

42
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:19,543
Now, I had the great pleasure of meeting
a woman this morning named Gloria.

43
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:23,005
She has a degree
from Iowa State University

44
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:26,633
and even with her degree,
she can't get employed.

45
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:29,761
Now, why?
Why is that the case?

46
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:33,140
Becau-- My wife, ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:45,610
I think what my wife is gently trying
to tell me is that I've run overtime.

48
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:50,199
She has a very clever nickname for me.

49
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,575
- "Verbosity."
- Yeah.

50
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:55,913
Now, the main difference
between Claire and me,

51
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:58,498
aside from her stunning beauty,
of course,

52
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:01,376
is that she actually knows
what that word means.

53
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,298
Now, look, I would love to stay here all
afternoon and answer all your questions,

54
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:10,635
but then I'd leave all your friends
in Cedar Rapids waiting for me

55
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,513
even longer than they have
and we don't want to do that.

56
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:17,017
So I want to thank you all
for coming out to see me today,

57
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:19,728
to hear about this battle,
this fight we're in.

58
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,855
I want you to caucus for me,

59
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,817
and let's help get Gloria a job!

60
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:29,238
America Works only if you make it work!

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,366
God bless Iowa!
God bless the United States of America!

62
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,287
- Thank you!
- Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!

63
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:41,374
An IED right off Route 90,
three kilometers from the Jordan River.

64
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,043
- When?
- Thirty-six minutes ago.

65
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:45,629
Russian unit was on patrol.
Two armored vehicles were destroyed.

66
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,798
- All eight troops were killed.
- Who's Cathy spoken to?

67
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,549
Foreign Minister
hasn't returned her call.

68
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,010
We have to make sure the Secretary
General doesn't say anything

69
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:54,972
until we have a better handle. Remy,
I need to speak to Petrov immediately.

70
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:57,474
I contacted the Kremlin.
They said he'll reach out soon.

71
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,268
We need the UN
to investigate the blast site.

72
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,895
The Russians have cordoned it off.
They're not letting anyone in.

73
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,396
- Why not?
- We don't know.

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,774
We had a unit nearby that
heard the blast, went in to help.

75
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:08,068
- Russians turned them away.
- I don't like the feel of this.

76
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:10,237
Cathy says the Israelis want
to send in their own team.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,906
We can't let that happen. The second
Israeli boots hit the ground--

78
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,533
Remy, I don't care what you have to do,
you get Petrov on the phone.

79
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,119
We need to head this off at the pass.

80
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:19,663
And make sure no one in Congress
overreacts either.

81
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:47,299
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

82
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,680
How was the game?

83
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:02,766
Great, until my phone
started blowing up.

84
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,727
Let me see what you have so far.

85
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,315
Um... no.

86
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,985
This is no good.
The language is too obtuse.

87
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,281
- Simpler. More direct.
- Look, here's the deal:

88
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:20,450
If the Russians don't play ball,
the Israelis will get nervous.

89
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,120
If the Israelis send troops in,
the Palestinians will go apeshit.

90
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:25,622
If the Palestinians go apeshit,
there could be mortar attacks.

91
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,708
And if there are mortar attacks,
the whole peacekeeping mission

92
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,169
- could go down the drain.
- You want me to actually say that?

93
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:33,797
God, no.
We need to say the opposite.

94
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,801
Look, make it as clear as the doomsday
scenario that I just described,

95
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:41,012
but then flip it around
and put a happy face on it.

96
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,682
We can reschedule
everything else,

97
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:47,894
- but I'm concerned about Harlan Traub.
- The IDP Chairman.

98
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,314
And President
of the Food Processors Association.

99
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:52,983
He's big for us statewide. We were
supposed to meet with him tonight.

100
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,901
Well, this is a national
security emergency.

101
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:56,361
He hasn't met with Dunbar yet.

102
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:58,071
If we cancel,
she gets a clean shot at him.

103
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,407
- All right, so put him on the plane.
- FEC rules.

104
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,534
Campaigning on Air Force One
costs 179,000 an hour.

105
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,745
- Aside from the message it sends--
- So I won't campaign.

106
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:08,248
I won't have time anyway.
Uh, just make him feel special.

107
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:10,167
Give him some face time in Washington.

108
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,251
Anything?

109
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:13,586
Moryakov's office
is giving me the runaround.

110
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,964
An IED
has killed eight Russian troops

111
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,424
on patrol in the Jordan Valley.

112
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,344
So far, no one has claimed
responsibility for this attack.

113
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:23,305
The only reaction from the Kremlin,
a brief written statement

114
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:26,016
from Foreign Minister Bugayev
that reads, quote,

115
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,978
"The perpetrators will be found
and brought to justice." End quote.

116
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:33,064
- Wheels up in 20 minutes.
- I gotta grab my bags from my room.

117
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:35,650
- Okay. Meet me out front.
- We should take separate cars.

118
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,777
A cab won't even get here
before the plane takes off.

119
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:39,821
You're coming with me.

120
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,239
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:43,158
Not a good day to play hooky.

122
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:46,036
It's gonna be a late night here.

123
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:49,580
It depends what Petrov does.
So far, just incredibly loud silence.

124
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:53,084
I gotta go, hon. Foreign Affairs
is holding an emergency session.

125
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,295
I love you, too.

126
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:59,007
- I don't have much time.
- Neither do I.

127
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,510
Talking points.

128
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,600
These make me uncomfortable.

129
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:12,312
Even in a closed session,
whatever I say will get out.

130
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:14,647
- I'll take hits in Iowa.
- You can't criticize the mission.

131
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,066
We need you to keep everyone calm.

132
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,568
You know how I feel about
unnecessary military involvement.

133
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:21,321
You asked to be on the ticket, Jackie.
It's been non-stop resistance.

134
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,073
If you don't want
to support the president,

135
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,909
you shouldn't want to be his number two.
I'm sick of pulling teeth.

136
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:30,914
You're right. I'll do what I can.

137
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:32,999
Jackie...

138
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,714
I didn't mean to snap.

139
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:45,262
I know it's hard having a presence here
and campaigning at the same time.

140
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,306
I'm sure it's tough on Alan
and the kids, too.

141
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,434
Alan's been a big help, actually.

142
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:57,107
I'm glad he's stepping up,
giving you the support you need.

143
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,110
I thought I would hate it,
the whole marriage thing.

144
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:01,778
But it's nice.

145
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:06,657
When I can get home,
everyone around the table.

146
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:10,537
I even cook sometimes.

147
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,623
- Badly, but they indulge me.
- No.

148
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:16,334
- I have my June Cleaver moments.
- Apron and all?

149
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:17,794
Don't push it.

150
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:25,510
I can't remember the last time
I had a home-cooked meal.

151
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:32,016
- Session's about to start.
- Yeah.

152
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,810
I'll fill you in after.

153
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,278
Tom.

154
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:49,659
- Where have you been all day?
- Sorry. Working on the book.

155
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,911
I know we were supposed to have
an opportunity to speak,

156
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,080
- but obviously now, it's--
- Of course.

157
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:56,207
Listen, you can come up
and sit up front if you like.

158
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,336
- I spoke to Claire about it.
- I'm fine back here. Thanks.

159
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:00,795
Okay.

160
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:24,735
I need to know this passport lock
is being lifted.

161
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:28,990
- Show me what you got.
- I'm tired of being strung along.

162
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:33,995
- You have a location?
- Yeah. But I want a timeline.

163
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:35,830
- Week or two.
- No.

164
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:37,624
They've stopped giving me
new assignments.

165
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:39,417
That means they're getting ready
to fuck me.

166
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,169
It has to happen sooner than that.

167
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:46,090
What are you doing?

168
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,220
E-mailing a friend in Homeland.

169
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,263
He always gets back to me quickly.

170
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,352
You satisfied?

171
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,042
Rachel.

172
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,837
- It says Jane Doe.
- No, it's her.

173
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:27,798
It's her.

174
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,760
She ghosted the identity of a girl
named Rebecca Sands.

175
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:34,138
The birthday's pretty close.

176
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:38,017
It's August 1990, then she died
in '93, along with her whole family.

177
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:40,353
But her social went active
about six months ago.

178
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:44,232
But this doesn't say Rebecca Sands.
It says Jane Doe.

179
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,651
State troopers
found her body in a ditch,

180
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:50,655
in an abandoned construction site
outside of Tucson.

181
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:54,659
I mean, there's no--
There's no picture.

182
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:57,495
There's no proof of anything.

183
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,348
"And do not grieve
the Holy Spirit of God

184
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:20,310
by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.

185
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:24,355
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger

186
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:28,693
and clamor and evil speaking
be put away from you."

187
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,333
No.

188
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:49,756
- No, no. That's not her.
- Come on, man. There's fingerprints.

189
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:52,342
Fingerprints from the Tale of Two Cities
book that you gave me.

190
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,552
I ran it against the autopsy report.

191
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:00,224
It was a ten-point match with Jane Doe.

192
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,984
I need the passport lock lifted now.

193
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:14,656
- Uh!
- Oh!

194
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,783
- I'm on it.
- When will you be on it?

195
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,242
- Soon.
- Soon? How soon?

196
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,119
As soon as I can!

197
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:28,044
I did my part.
Get the lock lifted.

198
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,988
You've reached Seth Grayson.
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.

199
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:00,410
I need to see him.

200
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,370
My mother died.

201
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,519
Come on!

202
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,730
Hey!

203
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,191
Are you okay?

204
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:34,944
Hey, man. What the fuck?

205
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,240
Sorry.

206
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:42,076
You believe this guy?
You want to say it to her, shithead?

207
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,994
Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

208
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,414
- Drinks on me.
- We don't want drinks, shithead.

209
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,999
You need to get out of here.
Tommy, this guy's trashed.

210
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,336
Here. Drinks on me.

211
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,798
No, no. We don't want drinks.
We want you to leave.

212
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:56,716
Come on. Just take it.
I said I was sorry.

213
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,551
- I don't give a shit.
- Take it.

214
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:01,679
No, he's apologizing.
I'm telling you.

215
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:02,806
Sorry.

216
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:05,725
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- I will bust your fucking face!

217
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,894
- Calm down. Let me get you a cab.
- Okay.

218
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:16,319
Hello, everyone.
I'm afraid I don't have much news.

219
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:19,989
We are in touch, uh, with the Russians,
but there's very few details.

220
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:21,991
I'm waiting to speak
with President Petrov.

221
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:25,077
- Any reason for the delay?
- He just lost eight soldiers.

222
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,747
Talking to their families
is his priority as it would be mine.

223
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:30,291
Think this could jeopardize
the peacekeeping mission?

224
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:32,418
Well, every country
that contributed troops

225
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:35,004
knew that something
like this was a possibility.

226
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:38,299
But the Russians fought this plan hard.
This gives Petrov the perfect out.

227
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:41,302
I wouldn't presume to know
what President Petrov is thinking.

228
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:43,554
I'll know more once we have
a chance to speak.

229
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:46,390
What about Congress?
They weren't fans of this mission.

230
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:49,352
I'm gonna consult with Congressional
leadership as soon as we get back.

231
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:52,438
In the meantime, my focus is to help
the Russians in any way that I can.

232
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:55,065
How can you help them when they won't
let anyone near the blast site?

233
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,651
Well, that hasn't been confirmed.

234
00:16:56,734 --> 00:17:00,321
Unless, of course, you have better
intelligence than the Pentagon.

235
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,825
Thank you all very much.
More soon.

236
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:20,800
Israel wants to go public,
blame Palestine for the attack.

237
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,092
There's no evidence yet.

238
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:26,055
Yes, well, the message is that Palestine
should be keeping its people in check.

239
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,265
They've also moved 500 troops
to a staging area

240
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,770
- across the border from Beit She'an.
- Christ. Try the Kremlin again, please.

241
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,569
You try yawning?

242
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:42,321
That works for you, not for me.

243
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:44,281
What about some water?
Sometimes that helps.

244
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:47,785
I don't need water, I need a phone call.

245
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,080
Maybe you should talk to Traub
while you're waiting for that phone call.

246
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:59,047
- You're not eating?
- I'm not hungry.

247
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:00,882
I think you don't like to fly.

248
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:03,300
Holding onto that table
like it's a stripper's tits.

249
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:05,636
Harlan. I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

250
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,680
Please, don't get up.
How's your lobster?

251
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,473
It tastes like it was caught
this morning.

252
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:13,269
Well, it was.
Nothing but the best for Air Force One.

253
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:15,354
Sir, I know you have a million things
on your mind,

254
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:17,690
but I would just love to talk to you
about how to modernize

255
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:19,901
the food-processing industry in Iowa.

256
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:23,446
Please, slit my wrists
with his butter knife.

257
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:26,365
We can't talk election on the plane,
Harlan. That's an FEC no-no.

258
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:28,034
This isn't about the campaign.

259
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,620
We're talking about the economy,
not the caucus. Right, Harlan?

260
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,246
That's right.

261
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:34,624
I'm sure you're aware, sir,
that we lead the states

262
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,751
in corn and soybean production.

263
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,169
It's a good thing,
given the trend towards vegan.

264
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,671
But our food-processing plants--

265
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:43,424
- Well, the largest industry in Iowa.
- That's correct.

266
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,384
And they're slow on the uptake, sir.

267
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:47,511
We need federal funding
to help subsidize

268
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:50,681
- the transition toward healthier--
- Mr. President. Your call from Russia.

269
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,224
Oh. I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

270
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:55,103
But Harlan, we'll get into it,
I promise.

271
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:58,522
Viktor, it's a terrible tragedy,
Mr. President.

272
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:00,024
I feel for your loss.

273
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:02,819
This is why your people
were so persistent?

274
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:05,529
So you could offer your sympathy? Hm?

275
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,074
It's important that we talk.

276
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:10,451
You're not letting anyone
near the blast site.

277
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:12,703
We're conducting our investigation.

278
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:15,665
Well, is there anything wrong
with allowing UN investigators

279
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:17,500
to work in conjunction with your people?

280
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,210
UN Command sent my men on that patrol,

281
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:23,172
the most dangerous stretch
of Route 90 in the entire valley.

282
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:26,676
- And you sent my men.
- Me? What are you talking about?

283
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,928
You saw my men as expendable.

284
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:33,099
Viktor, I don't personally oversee
the peacekeeping forces,

285
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:36,185
and you can't possibly think that
there was some deliberate attempt

286
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:39,188
- to put your men in harm's way.
- So I am to believe, what?

287
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:42,692
That this was a random
act of fate, yes?

288
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:47,155
Listen, whoever's responsible, we can't
let them foment distrust between us.

289
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,198
If we do, then they win.

290
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:52,660
Let's show them that an incident
like this makes us stronger.

291
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,787
Let us help you find out who did this.

292
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:57,456
Russians are dead.
Russia will find the killers.

293
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,959
I don't understand
why you're refusing our assistance.

294
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,585
Because we don't need it.

295
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,213
Well, can we at least
keep the dialogue open?

296
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:07,008
Consult with each other
before you make any move?

297
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:10,887
I'm going to do what I must,
Mr. President.

298
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,306
Viktor, please listen to me.
We have--

299
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,643
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but the line has been disconnected.

300
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:22,023
He hung up on me.

301
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:30,364
Cathy Durant, please.

302
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:33,743
Baldwin was right.

303
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:36,495
Those eight bodies give Petrov options.

304
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:39,999
He's not shedding tears,
he's popping champagne corks.

305
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,959
I can hear them.

306
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:57,850
Not here. Sir.
Restroom's this way.

307
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:02,980
Who was that?
The guy who just came in?

308
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:04,857
Didn't see him.

309
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:25,039
I would've come to your office.

310
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,875
This is the only room
at the UN we don't monitor.

311
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,670
- I'm assuming you don't either.
- No, we haven't bugged it.

312
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:36,633
- So we can speak openly.
- I think we should.

313
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,430
You talk. I'll listen.

314
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:49,397
Palestine says it can't control Hamas
if Israeli troops cross into the valley.

315
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:55,278
We have to back channel this, Alexi.
Petrov won't listen to Francis.

316
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:05,495
Alexi, please. This whole thing,
you can't let it devolve

317
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,748
into something nobody can control.

318
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:10,626
Well, maybe that was the objective.

319
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:13,796
What was?

320
00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:19,385
The president...
never wanted the peacekeeping mission.

321
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,846
You said "objective." Are you telling me
this was somehow planned?

322
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,475
- I haven't said anything.
- But you want to.

323
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,771
The whole world wants to know
who is responsible.

324
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:33,732
Your troops won't let anyone
near the blast site.

325
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:41,991
Because they don't want
the world to know.

326
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:44,827
My brother... he's in the FSB.

327
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,705
We spoke a week ago.
I haven't heard from him since.

328
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:51,917
Are you absolutely certain about this?

329
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:57,673
Alexi, go public.

330
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:01,969
We'll protect you.

331
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,595
Like you did Xander Feng?

332
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:07,308
That was different.

333
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:09,977
I have a family.

334
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:15,024
The FSB has conducted
these sorts of operations before.

335
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,900
The apartment complex that blew up,

336
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:19,778
Petrov used that
to justify invading Chechnya.

337
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:21,947
The opera house that was gassed,

338
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,325
he removed all provincial
governors after that.

339
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:27,036
We do believe the FSB
participated in the first.

340
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,372
We're still uncertain
about the opera house.

341
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:33,709
But blowing up his own soldiers,
I find that very difficult to believe.

342
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:37,587
Did he tell you point blank?
Did he say the words?

343
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:40,966
He said as much as he could.

344
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,677
But the implication was crystal clear.

345
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,553
I'm sure he was very convincing.

346
00:25:45,637 --> 00:25:48,516
All Russian diplomats go through
FSB counter-intel training.

347
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:51,394
They're trying to provoke
some sort of reaction out of us.

348
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:52,895
But what about his brother?

349
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:55,272
It is true that his brother
works for the FSB,

350
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,233
and that we lost track
of him last week.

351
00:25:57,316 --> 00:26:00,194
- That part of the story holds up.
- What's our profile on Moryakov?

352
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:03,030
We have our agent who's been
assigned to him, sir. Jim?

353
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:06,616
Moryakov has been considered
a bit of a wild card in Moscow.

354
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,576
Petrov considered recalling him twice,

355
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,414
but held off because
his father's a family friend.

356
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:13,790
Now, we picked up some chatter
in recent months,

357
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:17,920
his misgivings with how the Kremlin's
been handling the Jordan Valley.

358
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:20,464
But does he strike you as a traitor?

359
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:23,342
He's a complicated man.
Fiercely nationalistic.

360
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:26,136
But he definitely
has doubts about Petrov.

361
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:32,600
Shouldn't we at least
entertain the possibility?

362
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:35,645
Yeah, but how can we determine it
one way or the other? Definitively?

363
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,481
Our satellites aren't enough.

364
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:41,735
We'd have to get men to the blast site,
retrieve soil samples and blast debris.

365
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:45,281
How soon could we get a team in?

366
00:26:45,364 --> 00:26:46,990
I'd estimate 72 hours.

367
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:49,326
Well, three days seems
an awfully long time.

368
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,870
Don't we already have the basics
in place for deployment?

369
00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:54,206
That doesn't take into account
the Russian forces.

370
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,999
We'd want better intel before deploying.

371
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,881
Am I correct in assuming
that every hour that passes,

372
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:06,594
our chances of retrieving
any proof diminish?

373
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:08,137
That is correct, sir.

374
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,680
What's the absolute soonest
you can deploy?

375
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:15,727
Twelve hours, Mr. President. But that
would involve an extremely high degree--

376
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:18,646
Yeah, I'm aware of the risk, Admiral.

377
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,399
What are the odds of success?

378
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,945
Honestly, sir,
without proper intelligence,

379
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:26,905
I can't say better than 50/50.

380
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:31,452
You're certain?

381
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,912
Yes, I am.

382
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,460
Let's put it in motion.

383
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:43,964
- Mr. President?
- Mark.

384
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:47,176
Shouldn't the UN be conducting the
investigation instead of the Russians?

385
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:50,513
The Russians have been our partners in
this mission from day one of deployment,

386
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:53,516
so I would say that they're conducting
their own investigation

387
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,478
on behalf of the United Nations,
not instead of.

388
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,480
- Mr. President?
- Sara.

389
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:02,608
Is it correct to say that they are
in no way reporting to UN Command?

390
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,319
In peacekeeping missions,
nations volunteer their forces.

391
00:28:05,402 --> 00:28:07,655
They answer to their own
governments first and foremost,

392
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:11,116
then they cooperate with the UN Command.
That's an important distinction to make.

393
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,869
Now, any other questions
with respect to the Jordan Valley

394
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,663
should be directed
to the State Department.

395
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,541
But if any of you have questions
that don't relate to yesterday's events,

396
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:20,750
I'll take one or two.
Yeah, Stephanie.

397
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,212
Mr. President,
Kate and I both had a question.

398
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,505
Thank you, Stephanie.

399
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:27,341
Mr. President, are you aware, sir,
that campaigning on Air Force One

400
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:30,260
- is a violation of FEC rules?
- Yes, in general, I am.

401
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:33,472
Harlan Traub was on the plane yesterday.
It's hard to imagine he was there

402
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:36,016
for any other reason than you'd be
seeking his support in Iowa.

403
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,102
You don't know how long I've known him,
and yes, he was on the plane yesterday.

404
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:42,105
But it's not a violation
if you don't campaign, which I didn't.

405
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:45,526
I think the extent of our conversation
was asking him how he liked his meal.

406
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,777
But I'm happy to let the FEC decide.

407
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:51,073
Now, does anybody else have any question
that somebody else asked them to ask me?

408
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:53,492
Where's Traub now?

409
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:55,536
At the Hay-Adams.
Should be here in an hour.

410
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:57,663
It'd be bad if anyone saw him
at the White House.

411
00:28:57,746 --> 00:28:59,373
Well, I don't even
want him in DC now.

412
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,709
The last thing we need
is some bullshit FEC story

413
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,460
while I'm trying to deal
with the Russians.

414
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:05,337
Let's get him back to Iowa.
And you handle this.

415
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:07,339
You have better people skills
than Vaughn.

416
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:10,967
And you talk to Baldwin. You make it
crystal clear we violated no regulations.

417
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:14,304
Sir? I got a voicemail
from Doug last night.

418
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:17,683
- He said his mom died.
- My God, that's awful.

419
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,103
Except Julia Stamper
passed away ten years ago.

420
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:22,896
I know, I was at the funeral.

421
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:25,649
Send some flowers.
Actually, get Doug in here.

422
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,984
I'd like to give my condolences
in person.

423
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:33,616
There's a whole host of ways we can
revolutionize food processing in Iowa

424
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:35,951
through America Works.
The subsidies you want for R and D

425
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:38,537
- can be financed as a jobs--
- You don't have to do this.

426
00:29:38,621 --> 00:29:40,205
- Do what?
- Sweet talk me.

427
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:42,708
And a cab would've been fine.

428
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:47,087
I wanted to drive you myself so we had
a chance to talk about your concerns.

429
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,674
Well, I'm used to talking to candidates,
not chauffeurs.

430
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:56,888
- I'm not a chauffeur.
- Hm?

431
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:59,141
Well, it's your hands on the wheel.

432
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,467
Seth?

433
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:06,375
- Shit.
- Registration and insurance, please.

434
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,960
I'm sorry, officer.
I left my wallet at work.

435
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,879
Registration? Proof of insurance?

436
00:31:10,962 --> 00:31:13,549
- In my wallet.
- You're supposed to keep it in the car.

437
00:31:13,632 --> 00:31:16,677
Yeah. But if someone steals
your car, why give 'em the paperwork?

438
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,971
All right, I'm gonna need you to step
out of the car for a moment, please.

439
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:24,184
Officer, my name is Remy Danton.
I'm Chief of Staff to the president.

440
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,312
Without your identification, sir,
I don't know who you are.

441
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:29,981
- Got my government pin.
- That doesn't matter, sir.

442
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:33,026
I still need to see your identification.
Would you step out of the car, please?

443
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:35,904
Officer, you run a search on Remy Danton,
you'll get my photo.

444
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:38,824
Sir, I asked you to step out of the car.
Please.

445
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,249
- Any weapons on you?
- Of course not.

446
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:50,085
All right. You mind stepping
to the rear of the vehicle, please?

447
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,840
I'm gonna pat you down,
just to make sure.

448
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:59,177
Feet back.

449
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,848
Car comes back to a Virginia
corporation, no address.

450
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:05,517
I'm cleared Top Secret,
my information is masked.

451
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:07,936
Sir, I need you to stay here
for a moment, please.

452
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,441
- What do you got?
- No address on file.

453
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:14,443
- Why'd you stop me?
- One moment, sir.

454
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:17,112
No, not one moment. I got the right
to know why you stopped me.

455
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:19,030
Sir, I asked you to keep
your hands on the car.

456
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:22,117
I'm gonna need your badge number. Trying
to show off for your partner, brother?

457
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,160
I'm not your brother.
Don't make us restrain you.

458
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,704
- Officer Davis.
- Sir.

459
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:27,122
Officer Corchoran.

460
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:29,332
Know what? I'm gonna take a photo.

461
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,710
What the fuck?!

462
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,589
- What's your problem?!
- Calm down!

463
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:37,758
Sir!

464
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,259
I'm gonna need your badge number!

465
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:50,353
Mr. Danton, I'm Lieutenant Hixson.

466
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:52,898
I'm very sorry
for this misunderstanding.

467
00:32:52,981 --> 00:32:54,441
Watch your head.

468
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:59,321
I hope you accept my apology
on their behalf.

469
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:03,032
- They said I was stopped for speeding.
- Yes.

470
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:05,661
When they encounter someone
without a license and registration--

471
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:06,995
Write up the ticket.

472
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:09,331
You don't have to worry about that, sir.
You're free to go.

473
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:11,291
If I was speeding,
give me the damn ticket.

474
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:14,586
That's really not necessary
after everything we put you through.

475
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,212
Lieutenant.

476
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:27,307
Hey. I'd invite you up,
but the kids, they're--

477
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,811
We're bringing them to Iowa
this trip and it's a total shit-show.

478
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:33,522
I didn't come here to talk to you
about the campaign.

479
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:37,233
I probably... you know, I shouldn't
have just shown up like this, but...

480
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:39,361
Here. Come this way.

481
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:44,366
It's stupid.
I don't even know why I came over.

482
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:46,409
Did something happen?

483
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:49,955
I got pulled over. For speeding.

484
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,792
Things got out of hand.
A nigger in a nice car.

485
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:56,252
Jesus.

486
00:33:57,546 --> 00:33:58,714
I left my wallet at work.

487
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:01,884
When I tried to tell the guy who I was,
he didn't believe me, so...

488
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:05,136
I don't know.

489
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,889
I didn't believe me.

490
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:11,267
There I was with my hands
in cuffs and it was like, uh...

491
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:16,773
It was like I was outside of myself.

492
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:19,902
I could've been anyone.

493
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:21,319
I wasn't me.

494
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:28,284
- Does that make any sense?
- You got rattled.

495
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:31,038
No, it's not that.

496
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,374
I look at you and Alan,
and even Frank and Claire.

497
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:37,836
This happened and I didn't have
anyone to tell about it.

498
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:41,172
You have me, right?

499
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:44,009
I'm glad you came over.

500
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:49,723
It's not fair.
Intruding on you like this.

501
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:52,768
If I thought you were intruding,
I wouldn't have come downstairs.

502
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:11,202
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

503
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:12,287
I--

504
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:15,206
You still mean a lot to me.

505
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,793
I am there for you, as your friend.

506
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:22,547
You should go back up. Finish packing.

507
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:25,258
Safe flight.

508
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:32,515
We're set to insert at 2100 EST,
0400 local time.

509
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,060
We'll use a Fulton recovery
of any material samples.

510
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:36,352
The extraction?

511
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:40,231
The team will make its way on foot
to this rendezvous point for extract.

512
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:41,942
How are they gonna pass
the Russian lines?

513
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:44,569
Our intel is spotty at best,
but our team is scheduled

514
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:47,781
to link up with a local agent
who will assist.

515
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:50,909
Let's move this down to the Situation
Room. I'll be there in a few minutes.

516
00:35:50,993 --> 00:35:52,577
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

517
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:57,791
Did he say anything?

518
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:00,293
He wouldn't even look at me
when I said hello.

519
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:01,711
Send him in.

520
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,344
Doug.

521
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:27,005
Are you certain?

522
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:37,432
Who gathered all this inform--
Oh, never mind. I shouldn't know.

523
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:42,145
Was it you... who...?

524
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:44,522
No.

525
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:50,779
You shouldn't have brought this here.

526
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:52,697
I wanted you to see it.

527
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,951
So you would believe me.

528
00:37:57,535 --> 00:37:59,079
Brutal.

529
00:38:01,372 --> 00:38:03,625
I'm drunk, sir.

530
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,713
I'm-- I'm drunk right now.

531
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:17,639
This girl really meant something to you,
didn't she?

532
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:19,015
Yeah.

533
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,310
She did.

534
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:28,191
I've been working for Dunbar.

535
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:37,784
I pushed myself too much.
It's my fault.

536
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:43,873
It was for you.
To see how close I could get.

537
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:46,918
If I could find something,
a silver bullet.

538
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:52,548
To prove that...
I was still useful.

539
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:02,267
How can I help you, Doug?

540
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,769
I can't go to rehab.

541
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:07,189
- Just not another hospital, or...
- Okay.

542
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:10,025
I just... I can't... I can't do it.

543
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:13,069
We'll figure something out.

544
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:17,448
I'm not Peter Russo.

545
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:21,410
I won't go like he did.

546
00:39:28,877 --> 00:39:32,255
No, you won't.
You're going to get better, Doug.

547
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:36,134
I promise you that.

548
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:46,102
Yes, send Meechum in here.

549
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:07,916
There's an envelope on my desk.
I need it to be incinerated.

550
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,376
Yes, sir.

551
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:16,549
And then I need you to take Doug home.

552
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:21,846
Come on, Doug, it's time to go.

553
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,527
This way, Mr. Stamper.

554
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:41,824
You stay with him
until we figure out what's next.

555
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:43,243
Yes, sir.

556
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:55,255
Some privacy, please.

557
00:40:57,299 --> 00:41:00,093
- This is Heather Dunbar.
- I'll connect you momentarily.

558
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:03,263
Heather?

559
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:04,639
Mr. President?

560
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:08,017
Doug Stamper is my friend,
and you came very close to killing him.

561
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,853
- Excuse me?
- You're aware he's an alcoholic?

562
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:13,440
- Yes.
- And how serious his injuries were.

563
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:17,110
- Mr. President--
- But you still put him to work.

564
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:21,114
A man who's trying to recover,
who's trying to get back his life.

565
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:23,450
Did you honestly think
that he could handle that?

566
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:24,826
Douglas came to us.

567
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:29,831
And you should've turned him away
if you had one ounce of decency.

568
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,959
What's happened?
Is he okay?

569
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:35,837
You don't have the right
to ask me that question.

570
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,465
And if you do anything
that endangers his health again,

571
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:44,637
I swear to God,
I will put you in your fucking grave.

572
00:41:58,526 --> 00:42:00,820
Let's continue.

573
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:05,492
Thirty-two thousand feet,
one minute to insert.

574
00:42:05,574 --> 00:42:07,702
Let's hear comms.

575
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:09,454
Audio on.

576
00:42:09,537 --> 00:42:11,498
Stand up!

577
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:14,209
Twenty seconds. Last checks.

578
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:17,920
Last checks! Gather round.

579
00:42:26,554 --> 00:42:30,517
Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven,

580
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,061
six, five, four,

581
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:36,605
three, two. Green light.

582
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:40,318
- Video will go dark once they jump.
- Go. Go.

583
00:42:48,826 --> 00:42:50,870
Chutes deployed.

584
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:53,456
The rally point.

585
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,459
Link-up with indig agent happens here,

586
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:58,127
half a klick from the drop zone.

587
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:00,422
He'll arrange safe passage
to the blast site.

588
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:17,230
Motherfucker!

589
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:20,649
Agent is rogue.
Repeat, we have a bad agent.

590
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:22,985
- We've been compromised.
- Man down! Man down!

591
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:24,279
- Fuck.
- Over there!

592
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:26,697
- Agent is kilo.
- Get pressure on that wound.

593
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:29,117
We should abort, sir.

594
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,369
- Mr. President.
- Shut it down. Bring them home.

595
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:33,121
"Match Stick," I repeat, "Match Stick."

596
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:35,831
Head directly to waypoint X-ray.
How copy, over?

597
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:37,584
Proceeding to X-ray.

598
00:43:49,178 --> 00:43:51,680
- Hello?
- He's in the bedroom.

599
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:07,614
Hey, brother.

600
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,680
Say again. Over.

601
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:36,518
Confirmed, sir.

602
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:41,022
The element is off the X and moving
to extract. Three wounded, one KIA.

603
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:44,150
I'll need the name, next of kin.

604
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:45,692
Yes, sir.

605
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:17,183
Yes?

606
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:21,103
Sir, President Petrov
is on the line.

607
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:23,606
I'll take it in here.
Shut the door, please.

608
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:29,153
- Viktor.
- We know it was your men.

609
00:45:29,237 --> 00:45:30,737
What was?

610
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:32,948
Did you think we wouldn't detect you?

611
00:45:33,032 --> 00:45:35,784
Whatever you're accusing us of,
I don't know anything about it.

612
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:38,705
Oh, yes, you do.
And so do the Israelis.

613
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:40,873
We leaked footage
of the firefight to them.

614
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:44,043
I can't imagine they'd be pleased

615
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:48,464
America is conducting covert operations
without consulting with them first.

616
00:45:48,548 --> 00:45:50,633
You killed your own men, Viktor.

617
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:54,803
It was your man who got shot last night.

618
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:57,557
I mean the blast. We have the intel.

619
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,560
It was you, not terrorists.
It was FSB.

620
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:04,397
So you humiliate me in Washington,
humiliate me in Moscow,

621
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,275
and now you insult me
with these ridiculous fantasies.

622
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:09,444
What do you want
out of all of this, Viktor?

623
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:12,947
Justice, for my soldiers who died
on a mission you devised.

624
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,157
If anyone is to blame
for their deaths, it's you.

625
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:16,409
Goodbye, Viktor.

626
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:21,623
Francis, what did he say?

627
00:46:24,459 --> 00:46:26,335
I have to finish this letter.

628
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,479
Over the last several hours,

629
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:46,522
Israeli forces entered
the Jordan Valley.

630
00:46:46,606 --> 00:46:50,652
Eyewitness reports say they've taken up
positions near the encampments

631
00:46:50,735 --> 00:46:53,696
where Russian troops are refusing access
to a blast site

632
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,324
where eight of their countrymen
were killed two days ago.

633
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:59,285
The Israeli Prime Minister
had this to say, quote:

634
00:46:59,368 --> 00:47:01,621
"With both Russian forces
refusing to leave

635
00:47:01,704 --> 00:47:04,749
and the presence of covert operations
from other nations..."

636
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:07,460
Hamas and Hezbollah
are getting involved.

637
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:09,337
How?

638
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,381
They've vowed to raise local militias
if the Israelis cross the border.

639
00:47:12,465 --> 00:47:15,551
...nor has the American government
regarding covert operations.

640
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:19,054
- This is gonna be bad.
- Yeah, it sure is.

641
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:21,056
I should get to the White House.

642
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,393
- Lock the door on the way out?
- Mm-hm.

643
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:41,243
The Israelis.

644
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:43,996
I know,
I've been watching the news all night.

645
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,165
We should get to the Situation Room.

646
00:47:46,248 --> 00:47:48,125
Let me finish this first.
I'll be right down.

647
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:49,752
All right, I'll see you down there.

648
00:48:53,982 --> 00:49:00,716
