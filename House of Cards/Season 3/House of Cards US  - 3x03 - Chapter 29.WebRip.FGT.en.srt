1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:10,261
- Viktor Petrov!
- Fascist jerk-off!

2
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:13,264
- Viktor Petrov!
- Fascist jerk-off!

3
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,976
This is what the freedom
to assemble looks like!

4
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,811
Stop silencing the press!

5
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,313
Stop persecuting the opposition!

6
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:23,775
Stop imprisoning people
simply because they're gay!

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,694
You're destroying Russia's future!

8
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:27,612
When Petrov's motorcade arrives,

9
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,823
have the band already playing
as loud as they can.

10
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:30,991
I'll speak to the colonel.

11
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,159
- What about the Pussy Riot girls?
- I briefed them myself.

12
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,537
Here's a list of the issues
they want you to discuss with Petrov.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,872
- We're good to go.
- Tell them I did.

14
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,790
Sure it's a good idea
to have them at the dinner?

15
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:40,333
It's a smart idea.
They're dissidents.

16
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,168
They've been nothing but a pain
in Petrov's ass.

17
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,044
He wants to co-opt them
with a photo? Fine.

18
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,964
If it's important to him,
it's important to me.

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,716
- Bob.
- Mr. President.

20
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,885
We have to get these amendments
out of committee.

21
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:51,553
Get AmWorks on the floor.

22
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:54,014
We might be able to squeeze
a couple through, but not all seven.

23
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,390
Then restructure the funding.

24
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,225
Shoot for one amendment
in one committee.

25
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,476
Try Ways and Means.

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,478
The Republicans
will never go for a lump sum.

27
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:02,689
We have to split it up
into jurisdictional parts.

28
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,984
When I announced America Works,
I promised ten million jobs.

29
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,319
- Maybe it's time to lower expectations.
- No, look--

30
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:11,447
Pardon me, sir.
President Petrov's motorcade is 15 out.

31
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,991
- Thank you.
- I'll let you go.

32
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,076
Bob, we have a few more minutes.
Please sit down.

33
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,536
You have a lot on your plate today.

34
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,705
Why don't we pick it up tonight
at the state dinner?

35
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,749
Looking forward to it, Mr. President.

36
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,421
What is the face of a coward?

37
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,673
The back of his head
as he runs from the battle.

38
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:54,699
- Welcome, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

39
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,785
This is your first visit
to the White House?

40
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:00,246
Yes, yes.
But my third president.

41
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:11,132
I have reviewed your proposal
for the Jordan Valley.

42
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,427
Impressive.

43
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:19,057
So you liked the proposal?

44
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,893
The answer is no.

45
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:23,853
It's not a joke, Mr. President.

46
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,524
I have no interest whatsoever
in pursuing your plan.

47
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,437
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

48
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,548
The Jordan Valley
is the trees instead of the forest.

49
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,135
And this bilateral approach,
it's... alienating.

50
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:22,180
I don't often see eye to eye
with Ms. Caspi,

51
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:25,975
but it does feel like
you're asking the state of Palestine

52
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:29,437
to support a plan without
having a seat at the table.

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,314
Well, our goal is to soften Russia,

54
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,525
to bring them in as a partner first--

55
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,029
If we can get the Russians
to agree to a joint force,

56
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:41,323
monitor the valley together,
then they're invested.

57
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,534
They won't be a thorn in our side
when we move forward--

58
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,870
How can we count on the Russians?

59
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:49,124
Does your husband truly
believe he can trust Petrov?

60
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,168
The president is optimistic.

61
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:54,545
All we ask is that you
remain open-minded.

62
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:59,092
I hope you'll convey our dissatisfaction
directly to your husband.

63
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,094
I'll be sure to share your concerns.

64
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,847
Ambassador Underwood
will remain in contact with both of you.

65
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,986
I shouldn't have
interrupted you earlier.

66
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,113
In the meeting.
It was out of place,

67
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:22,406
and I should have let you
do all the talking.

68
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,992
It's fine.

69
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,288
I know you have doubts about me.

70
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,832
The recess appointment.
We haven't discussed it.

71
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,918
- And we should.
- It really isn't necessary.

72
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:37,880
It is an unorthodox dynamic, yes.
You will always be the First Lady.

73
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,883
This is your plane, after all.
But we can work around that.

74
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:41,968
Yes, I know,

75
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,761
but I want you to know that--

76
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,763
Mrs. Underwood,
the president is on the line.

77
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,817
- Hi.
- Hey. How'd it go?

78
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,069
- Should we conference Cathy in?
- No, just tell me.

79
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:01,821
A lot of pushback. They aren't happy.

80
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,032
Well, they'll get on board
when the time comes.

81
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,326
- What about you?
- He said no.

82
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,037
- First word out of his mouth.
- No to everything?

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,956
Oh, he might just be playing mind
games, trying to throw me off balance,

84
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,500
but this is a guy who was brought up
through the KGB, after all.

85
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,961
We're gonna have to have you
and Cathy use the light touch.

86
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,547
- We need to massage this.
- Let's include her in this phone call.

87
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,174
No, just tell her.
I have to go in soon.

88
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,718
It's important we don't bypass her.

89
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,221
If it looks like we're
leaving her out of the loop, Francis...

90
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,555
All right, put her on.

91
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,765
I can't tell you how much
it would mean to the team.

92
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,518
To have your qualifications,
your expertise on board.

93
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,562
Even just having your name
on the website.

94
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,689
I appreciate your saying that,
Congressman.

95
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,441
Brad. Please.
Congressman's what the interns call me.

96
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,194
All right. Brad it is.

97
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:44,322
Now as for your title,
I was thinking Special Advisor?

98
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,949
- Title doesn't matter to me.
- You pick what you want.

99
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,409
And you make your own hours.
Come and go as you like.

100
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,788
Uh, compensation,
would 220 a year work for you?

101
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,833
The cap is 173.

102
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,544
Well, the extra 50K
would come out of my re-election fund.

103
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,671
I mean, you deserve more than the cap.

104
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,925
- That's a very generous offer.
- Well, I expect you to earn it.

105
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,928
I really want
to make my mark this session.

106
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,972
- That's more than Underwood paid me.
- I'm sorry?

107
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:12,767
When I was his chief of staff,
I made the cap.

108
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,310
He never came anywhere near 220.

109
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,978
Well, like I said, I think you deserve--

110
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,189
It's too much money, Congressman.

111
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:19,648
Well, I disagree, but,

112
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,734
hey, I'm not gonna argue
if you want to get paid less.

113
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,612
As I was saying, this transpo bill,

114
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,906
we really have an opportunity
to make a difference.

115
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:37,666
Ladies and gentlemen,
the session is over.

116
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,502
Please, right this way.
Thank you for coming.

117
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,387
I hear you've recently taken up surfing.

118
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,099
We have a few spots on the Black Sea.

119
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,268
It's mostly so I can pose
for the photos.

120
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,019
Yes, I've seen them.

121
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:01,649
It plays well with the young people.

122
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,859
It's important they see
their president has some fun,

123
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,569
doesn't take himself too seriously.

124
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,740
I have a gift for you.

125
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,664
I'm sorry for the delay.

126
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,916
I hope we didn't keep you
waiting too long.

127
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,296
Shall we?

128
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:28,009
This was handmade by Tomas Vu,
a very talented American artist.

129
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:32,638
He laser-etches images on one side,
and on the other side...

130
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,267
- he puts Beatles lyrics.
- Uh-huh.

131
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,102
Hm. Back in the USSR.

132
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,562
It's a museum piece,
but you can still ride it.

133
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,441
You should come out
to my dacha in Sochi sometime.

134
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,984
We'll surf together.

135
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:49,113
The water is cold as hell, but...
the women are very warm.

136
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,532
Oh, I'm not sure what Claire
would think about that.

137
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,494
Well, bring her along.

138
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,371
It's crawling with artists out there.

139
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:57,997
She might find something she likes.

140
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:03,044
Mr. President, I'm intrigued.

141
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:06,047
The first thing you say to me
is "no" the second you arrive,

142
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,799
and the next moment
you're inviting me to your dacha.

143
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,426
Who am I dealing with?

144
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,637
I believe I was clear when we first met.
What confuses you?

145
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:16,015
Our delegations have been discussing
these issues for months.

146
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,352
Yes, but discussions
are not the same as commitment.

147
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,979
And, uh, I'm telling you now.

148
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,190
There will be no commitment.

149
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,359
You could've told me that on the phone.

150
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,156
I assumed you were undoing
an insult by having me here.

151
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,657
What insult is that?

152
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,785
Two of your predecessors
never invited me to Washington.

153
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,996
This summit is not just for show.

154
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,665
I want to make meaningful strides
toward peace.

155
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,502
The Middle East is hopeless.
History tells us that.

156
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,255
I'm offering you
the chance to make history.

157
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:48,381
I'll be honest with you,

158
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,092
because you've been kind enough
to invite me to your country.

159
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:55,721
Russia has nothing to gain
from peace in the Middle East.

160
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:00,226
And more importantly, nothing
to gain from working with America.

161
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,188
Israel has always distrusted us.

162
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:07,608
- You expect that to change?
- We expect to build trust over time.

163
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,906
How was your meeting
with the ambassadors this morning?

164
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,742
Ambassador Aruri called me.

165
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,162
They have their doubts, but we
encouraged them to keep an open mind.

166
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,830
He described it as grave concerns.

167
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,665
They will acclimate
as soon as we establish--

168
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,835
Has your husband made direct overtures
to Israel and Palestine?

169
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,215
All formal communication has been
handled through the State Department.

170
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,509
But your husband can't possibly
believe they'll comply.

171
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,219
Gentlemen,
for the purposes of these talks,

172
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:38,680
I'd appreciate it if you refer to him
as the president, not as my husband.

173
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,433
Of course, Madam Ambassador.

174
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,643
And you really should be addressing
Secretary Durant.

175
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,313
She speaks on his behalf more than I do.

176
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,984
Our apologies, Madam Secretary.
Please, continue.

177
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:55,323
We'd like to finish reviewing
the specifics, so page 12, please.

178
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,576
Mr. President, we're already
working together on several fronts:

179
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,870
nonproliferation,
the War on Terror, North Korea.

180
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,624
I don't see any reason that
the Middle East should be any different.

181
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,959
- Because it's an American plan.
- It's not an American plan.

182
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,211
- I'm promising equal terms.
- Oh, promises.

183
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:12,047
Carter promised equal involvement,
then shut us out of Camp David.

184
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,716
- Clinton did the same with Bosnia.
- I'm the president now.

185
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,010
That won't happen this time.

186
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,221
Until 18 months from now,
when you are replaced.

187
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,143
I'm jealous, Viktor.

188
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,814
You don't answer to anyone.
You have no real opposition.

189
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,817
You know exactly how
every election is gonna turn out.

190
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,154
Well, it's not like that
in the United States.

191
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:41,118
I'm not running because I can do things
a candidate can't do, like this proposal.

192
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:44,704
Please, Mr. President,
we both know you'll run.

193
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,376
Now, whether you win...
Who knows?

194
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,046
Brass tacks. If you could have anything,
what would it be?

195
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,342
I came with nothing to ask.

196
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,929
Men like you don't show up for dinner
without an appetite.

197
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,354
It was a long flight, Mr. President.

198
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,232
How about we stop here for now.

199
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,069
I rest my eyes a bit and put some
thought into this with a fresh mind.

200
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,780
Maybe I'll...
think of something I want.

201
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:24,078
- We'll talk more later, at dinner.
- Of course, if that's what you prefer.

202
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,208
He knows exactly what he wants,
but he needs to be wooed.

203
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,543
Progress, nonetheless.

204
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:34,088
You can't turn a "no" to a "yes"
without a "maybe" in between.

205
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,558
Gentlemen...

206
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,935
Deputy Director coming through.

207
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,015
Orsay? Come with me, please.

208
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,685
We got Asher.

209
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,438
Two-thirty this morning.
He was scared to death.

210
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,399
By 2:45, he gave us six terabytes
of compressed files.

211
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:37,693
All 25 million AT&T users.

212
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,403
You hid your goodies
with the wrong person.

213
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,615
- He wasn't the only one.
- I think he was.

214
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,493
You can't arrest me for charges
that have already been dropped.

215
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,328
Relax. No one's arresting you.

216
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,625
From the reports I've been getting,
you've been doing an excellent job for us.

217
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,835
If you stay straight, sky's the limit.

218
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,546
Bigger assignments.
Manage your own team.

219
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,256
You know I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

220
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,509
But you do have a choice.

221
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,637
You can make the most
of this second chance if you want to,

222
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,641
but... you have to prove you want it.

223
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,353
- Names.
- That's all I've ever wanted.

224
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,356
No.

225
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,695
Asher's going to give up names.

226
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,782
- He wouldn't do that.
- He might.

227
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,536
Let's hope none of them tell us about
anything we didn't charge you for.

228
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:34,333
You have a future here, Gavin.

229
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:39,087
All right. Back to it.

230
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,051
Keep up the good work.

231
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,137
We have to wine and dine.

232
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,931
- Charm them senseless.
- Them? Who's the other?

233
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,268
Birch. He's sitting on AmWorks
like his ass is afraid of the sun.

234
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,437
Please don't make me talk to Bob.

235
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,232
You just focus on Petrov.
I'll deal with Bob.

236
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,401
Excuse me, sir. We're all set.

237
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,319
President Petrov is in the Yellow Oval.

238
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,945
Thank you, Calista.

239
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,660
I think I may need to do
some damage control with Cathy.

240
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:12,287
- Why?
- I've been trying to be deferential,

241
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,874
but I think it's coming off
as patronizing.

242
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,001
- Well, that was the risk.
- I know.

243
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,045
Is she feeling threatened?

244
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,173
Threatened, no.
Possibly overshadowed.

245
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,677
I think I'm getting too much attention
and it's tough to be effective

246
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,847
when I don't have Cathy on my team,
so I may need to win her over.

247
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,683
Well, let's not forget
where the focus is tonight.

248
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,811
Since when can't I do
two things at once?

249
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,021
- You're crooked.
- What?

250
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,819
- Ready for battle.
- Yes.

251
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,567
The Vice President of the United States,
Donald Blythe.

252
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,653
- Mr. President. Welcome.
- Mr. Vice President.

253
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,196
Thank you.

254
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,907
President Petrov, welcome.

255
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,660
It's a pleasure.

256
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,536
Hi. You look beautiful.

257
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,371
Oh, it's serviceable.

258
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,958
- You look fantastic, as always.
- Thank you.

259
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,503
All eyes at the table
will be on you, not them.

260
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,966
Senator Mendoza.
Soon to be candidate Mendoza.

261
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,552
- The rumor mill begins.
- You started with Reagan, no?

262
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,346
Staffed on his '84 campaign.

263
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,432
He has a portrait of the Gipper
in his office wearing a cowboy hat.

264
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:59,019
Hm. When men were men. Hm?

265
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,276
Bob, I had a thought. Dave Blanchek
is on Armed Services and--

266
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,070
I don't want to hold up the line.

267
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,615
- Mr. President, a pleasure.
- I want to move Birch.

268
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,408
Put Mendoza next to me instead.

269
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,453
Alan. You clean up well.

270
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,121
Class by association.

271
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,957
- Where's your date?
- I don't have one.

272
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,669
- I can walk you in too, if you'd like.
- No. Wouldn't want to ruin the picture.

273
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,422
Ah, our special guests.

274
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,216
I'm so delighted
you could be with us.

275
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,426
Thank you so much for coming.
Mr. President.

276
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,388
It's taken us too long
to sit at the same table.

277
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:38,726
Did you discuss
our issues in the closed talks?

278
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,143
We discussed many things.

279
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,271
But specifically our concerns?

280
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,691
Was anything on our list discussed?

281
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,443
- Why don't we take a photo first?
- Good idea. Hm?

282
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,925
Viktor, tell me. Are you in love?

283
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:14,845
I don't know about...
love, but...

284
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,433
I'm learning to enjoy being divorced.

285
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,692
Which translates into:

286
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,319
"Howdy, and please
don't steal the silverware."

287
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,034
Now that I have exhausted
all of the Russian I know,

288
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,704
Claire and I would like to welcome
all of you to the White House,

289
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:45,960
as we host President Petrov
in this historic state visit.

290
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,379
A century ago, a century and a half ago,

291
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:54,468
de Tocqueville wrote, in regards
to America and Russia, the following:

292
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,346
"Their point of departure
and their paths diverse,

293
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,433
nevertheless, each seems called

294
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:05,353
by some secret desire of Providence,

295
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:10,776
to one day hold in their hands
the destinies of half the world."

296
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,529
Well, I'd like to amend that tonight
and say, not just half the world,

297
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:19,034
the entire world looks to us
for leadership.

298
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:23,705
So, to President Petrov,
and all of the great things

299
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,166
that our great nations
will do together.

300
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,919
- Mr. President.
- Hear, hear!

301
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,846
Which is Russian for,
"Never trust the French."

302
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:45,310
And thank you to the president and First
Lady for your grace and hospitality.

303
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,105
Now, a little more recently
than de Tocqueville,

304
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,899
about, uh, 30 years ago,

305
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,527
Mikhail Gorbachev came
to this very house

306
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,197
and talked of an end
to our "winter of discontent."

307
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:03,578
I think it's safe to say that
that winter seems far gone now.

308
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:08,834
And here, on this beautiful May evening,
I welcome a "spring of enchantment."

309
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:13,505
Now we all know which of you
brings the enchantment to the table.

310
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,883
To you, Mrs. Underwood.

311
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,931
- And, of course, your lesser half.
- Ah, thank you.

312
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:31,190
Now I'd like to toast three others
in this room tonight.

313
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:35,152
Nadya Tolokonnikova,
Masha Alyokhina,

314
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,112
and Pyotr Verzilov.

315
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:39,823
Now, I know we had our differences.

316
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:43,744
But I also know they come
from something we all share:

317
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,915
a deep love of our country.

318
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,669
To you. And to Russia.

319
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:57,507
Mr. President, Nadya and Masha
would like to make a toast.

320
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,975
To Viktor Petrov,
whose loyalty runs so deep

321
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,852
he's given his friends
half of the country.

322
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,982
Who's so open to criticism,
that most of his critics are in prison.

323
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,243
You made your point.

324
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:30,082
Now, please, sit and let us all

325
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,794
drink and laugh,
like true Russians do. Hm?

326
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,349
Well, Mr. President,

327
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:52,562
this is proof why you made the
right decision never to have children.

328
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,489
My staff prepped them.

329
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,992
- They assured us.
- It's nothing.

330
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,578
- I admire your grace.
- Please. Not another word.

331
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,791
I knew Pussy Riot was a bad idea.

332
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,794
- You should go.
- No. Best thing is not to comment.

333
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,921
It lowers us to their level.

334
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,674
Juice or soda?

335
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,425
Diet something, if you got it.

336
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,512
Who are they?

337
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,433
My brother's kids.

338
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,061
Adorable.

339
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,571
- I got a job offer.
- Yeah? Where?

340
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,574
Brad Petite. Special Advisor.

341
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,286
From Hawaii.

342
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,121
- Junior congressman?
- That's right.

343
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:54,249
I like him. He's a good guy.
He's ambitious.

344
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,459
He offered me a lot of money.

345
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,046
- Yeah?
- Two-twenty.

346
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,964
Jesus.

347
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,718
That's more than I would ever make
at the White House.

348
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,266
- You arrange the job?
- No.

349
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,060
Did the president?

350
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,645
- What are you talking about?
- Don't bullshit me, Seth.

351
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,396
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

352
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,609
Who's the senior congressman
from Hawaii?

353
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,572
Chair of Appropriations.

354
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,782
I know him,
I'm just drawing a blank right now.

355
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,245
It's not him, it's a her.

356
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,331
Francine Tenaka.
And if you don't know who Tenaka is,

357
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,666
there's no reason you should know
who Brad Petite is,

358
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,378
or that he's ambitious or a good guy.

359
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,881
This job offer came from you
or the president.

360
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,175
And I'm telling you that it didn't.

361
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,221
Well, I'm turning it down.

362
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,641
You tell the president that I'm ready
to come back whenever he needs me.

363
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,810
I don't need training wheels.

364
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,244
I need you to work on Birch
while you're here.

365
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,038
See if you can get that list
of possible candidates.

366
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,332
I don't think putting him down
the far end of the table's

367
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,583
put him in a very chatty mood.

368
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:25,215
Refrigeration.
Are you talking about refrigeration?

369
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,634
- No.
- Re-bridge nations.

370
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,845
We need to re-bridgenate ourselves
so we'll more trust each other.

371
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,555
Da? Yes.

372
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,933
Let's get these amendments
out of committee.

373
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,393
Not all of them, just some of them.

374
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,895
The Speaker would go ballistic
if I started meddling in the House.

375
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,440
Not if it means he's going to battle
with the presumptive nominee.

376
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,108
He knows where his bread is buttered.

377
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:46,236
You shove your wife's recess appointment
down my throat, now you want my help?

378
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,612
I had to fill the post.

379
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,240
And you have a city
full of career diplomats.

380
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,200
Her appointment was
a slap in the Senate's face.

381
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,453
Let's not get hung up
on appointments, all right?

382
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,704
Hector, whatever
you want me to sign, I'll sign.

383
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,832
I will not hold a veto over your head.

384
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,919
You can veto whatever you want.
Just helps our case in 2016.

385
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,796
Excuse me.

386
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,805
Which is more intoxicating,
this wine or Claire Underwood?

387
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,476
How often do you use that line?

388
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,687
- Not as often as you use yours.
- Which line is that?

389
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,815
"Viktor, are you in love?"

390
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,238
President Descoteaux told me you asked
him the same thing when he was here.

391
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,869
I believe my husband quoted a Russian
author the night he gave that toast.

392
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,872
- Don't say, uh... Tolstoy?
- Pushkin.

393
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:43,751
"A deception that elevates us
is dearer than a host of low truths."

394
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:47,130
Ah... He didn't make that toast.

395
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:51,510
- No, he didn't.
- No, no.

396
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,678
Tell me, do you
actually know your Pushkin,

397
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,431
or did you just study up
before I arrived?

398
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,641
Does it really matter?

399
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,481
So, this is what he does?

400
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,565
He leaves the seduction to you.

401
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,237
Isn't there a...
a word for that in English? Um...

402
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,698
- For what?
- "Pimping," yes?

403
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,658
He's pimping you out.

404
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,287
How charming you are.

405
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,122
Thank you.

406
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:24,251
And you make a much better First Lady
than ambassador,

407
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,378
from what my people tell me.

408
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,507
Only teasing.

409
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:35,178
More wine... for the ambassador.

410
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,721
Please.

411
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,069
I'm gonna have to go
in a couple minutes.

412
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,321
Ah!

413
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:56,783
Mr. President, my gift for you.

414
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,786
Best vodka in the world.

415
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,289
Osobaya Sayanskaya.

416
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,250
Solid gold.

417
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,211
Each one of these bottles is 750,000.

418
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,090
Now, a toast.

419
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:19,097
To friendship, to good food,

420
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,102
and to Leo Tolstoy, who said,

421
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,314
"If you want to be happy, be."

422
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,857
Drink!

423
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:35,989
Ah!

424
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,117
Now... you sniff your bread.

425
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,914
Say "Nu."

426
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,416
Nu!

427
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,460
Then whistle.

428
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,044
Sniff your sleeve.

429
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,424
And... eat your pickle.

430
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,760
Now, why we do all this?

431
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:02,182
No one knows.

432
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,517
Again!

433
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,935
- Oh, no. Now, Mr. President.
- Mm, mm!

434
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,648
Now, you, Mr. Vice President.

435
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,859
- A toast!
- Oh! Uh... Um...

436
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,612
Uh, to, uh... further cooperation

437
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,824
between our two countries
and, uh... continued... uh...

438
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:23,537
Oh, hell. Here's how!

439
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,584
Again!

440
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:35,298
Now, you... Mrs. Underwood.

441
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,221
To President Petrov and his...

442
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:44,391
little pickle.

443
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,392
Drink!

444
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,772

Oh, no, no, no.

- ♪ The Southland ♪

466
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:41,382
♪ Gave birth to the blues ♪

467
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,219
♪ That the Southland ♪

468
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:50,099
♪ Gave birth to the blues ♪

469
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,269
That's all I have...

470
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,774
Beautiful.
Beautiful, Mr. President.

471
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:59,900
Now... now, Mr. Cincotti,

472
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,362
uh, you might not know this one.

473
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,406
But, um... it's easy to follow. Hm?

474
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,785
Um... You have a C for me?

475
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,894
You offered vetoes for sale to Mendoza?

476
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,855
Bob, shh... the president's singing.

477
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,690
Is that why you sat him next to you?

478
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:41,735
Bob, as you said,
the Republicans control Congress.

479
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,326
Any luck with Birch?

480
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,038
No list yet.
I'll keep working him.

481
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,290
Where's Dr. Cooke?

482
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,334
He got called away to surgery.

483
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,964
Save it for Svetla.

484
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,466
That's not her name.

485
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,802
She looks like a Svetla.

486
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:44,380
Hey!

487
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:48,426
Well, I don't think we can end
the evening on a higher note,

488
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,470
so I want to thank you all for coming,

489
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:53,556
for the singing
and the dancing and the vodka.

490
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,600
But most especially to my friend,
Peter Cincotti.

491
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:56,684
Thank you.

492
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,561
Coming all the way here
to the White House.

493
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,648
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

494
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,609
Wonderful.
And thank you to you, Mr. Cincotti.

495
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:05,902
Thank you. Thank you.

496
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,739
Your motorcade is ready, Mr. President.

497
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:10,949
I'll walk you out.

498
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,326
But first, I want to show you something.
Come with me.

499
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,328
- We'll be right down, Calista.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,166
What if I get you transferred?
To some other agency.

501
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,418
It doesn't matter
who I work for. He'll find a way.

502
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,216
How much do you care about staying here?

503
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,093
- What, DC?
- In this country.

504
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:35,306
I'd have been long gone if they didn't
put a travel lock on my passport.

505
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,141
So let's unlock it.

506
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:42,271
Is that something you can do?
If I get you what you want?

507
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,900
I need to know exactly where she is.

508
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,403
Not a state. Not a city.
An address.

509
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:53,616
If I use the Bureau's software and
get caught, I'll give them your name.

510
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,535
I understand.

511
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,334
All right.

512
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,420
Tell me everything you know about her.

513
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:08,923
Good night.

514
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,637
- How about a night cap?
- Oh, it's late.

515
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,348
And I haven't had that much vodka
since college.

516
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,808
Tulane, right?

517
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,019
So they tell me.
It's all a bit of a blur.

518
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,521
What did you drink in school?
Hurricanes?

519
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:26,858
Oh, we weren't barbarians.
Scotch, no ice.

520
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:29,986
Oh... Two Chivas, neat.

521
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,533
Cubans. Smuggled in.

522
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,702
I thought you might
appreciate the irony.

523
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,620
Ah. I do.

524
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,420
Ah. And where does this lead?

525
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,005
Basement entrance.

526
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:51,507
The Nixon kids would
bring their dates up this way.

527
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,844
Kennedy probably used it
for similar reasons.

528
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,930
Well, you know, now that I'm divorced,

529
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,766
I don't have to sneak anyone
in and out of the palace.

530
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,727
They can come through the front door.
With some dignity.

531
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,022
Well, dignity's a bit overrated
for a mistress, don't you think?

532
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:14,405
Ah... you know,
a woman like your wife, for example,

533
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:17,784
would certainly make it worthwhile.

534
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,536
Do you kiss the wife
of every president you meet?

535
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,957
Oh. Not every president's wife
looks like yours.

536
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,168
I'd push him down the stairs
and light his broken body on fire

537
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:32,131
just to watch it burn,
if it wouldn't start a world war.

538
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,300
- May I?
- Of course.

539
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:41,140
Well, do you think
they'll ever come around?

540
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,017
Oh, I don't know.

541
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:45,603
There'll be more summits,
a hundred CoDels.

542
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:49,899
They'll ping-pong back and forth
for months before Petrov shows his hand.

543
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,155
- What?
- Nothing.

544
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,573
Tell me.

545
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:00,910
I was just picturing Bugakov
playing ping-pong.

546
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:04,831
Bugayev?

547
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,207
Imagine him playing beer pong.

548
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,836
Then these negotiations would be over.

549
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:13,714
You are looking at the Delta Phi
beer pong champion.

550
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,257
- No.
- Yes.

551
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,343
Both sophomore and junior years.

552
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,970
And what happened senior year?

553
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,263
Well, I had to start studying
for law school.

554
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:26,894
Well, I wasn't... a champion.

555
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:29,229
- I wasn't too bad, though.
- You?

556
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,941
Mm-hm.

557
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,068
- I think we should play.
- What?

558
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,277
Oh, you can't be serious.

559
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,322
Excuse me? Can you ask housekeeping
to bring us some ping-pong balls, please?

560
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,741
I have got to go home.

561
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,952
We'll be playing by Harvard rules.

562
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:50,543
You have to admire their fearlessness.

563
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,881
None of them understand, do they?

564
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,591
What it takes to govern.

565
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:00,136
They scream and yell
and stomp their feet,

566
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,847
but if they had to spend
just one day in our shoes,

567
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,725
the weight we carry on our shoulders...

568
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:09,395
Like, um... the Middle East?

569
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:14,316
Oh, I know why we're here,
smoking our cigars.

570
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:20,740
- And?
- You're not going to like it.

571
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,495
Yes! Ha-ha!

572
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,372
Drink up.

573
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,712
Okay. For the Crimson.

574
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,178
Damn!

575
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,605
Yes! I still got it.

576
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,194
You don't have to drink that.

577
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,653
I accept your mercy.

578
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:05,243
And I am going to leave
before you challenge me to a rematch.

579
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,287
You're not even gonna give me a shot
at winning in my own house?

580
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,165
First rule of diplomacy:
stop while you're ahead,

581
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:15,253
which is what I should've done,
after that third vodka of Petrov's.

582
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:19,006
What do you think of him?

583
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,969
Petrov? I don't know.

584
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:26,305
You were the one
who talked to him all night.

585
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,141
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.

586
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,726
So, not a fan?

587
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,021
I think he's very intelligent.
And he has a charm.

588
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:36,607
That kiss was... too much.

589
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,026
No, that's just pushing buttons.

590
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,196
The Russians love to do that.

591
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,906
Good night.

592
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:47,952
I don't think he's to be trusted, Cathy.

593
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:51,205
Especially after tonight.
And it made me think...

594
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,042
Go on.

595
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,796
It made me wonder about Francis' plan.

596
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:03,342
I'm not sure that it's a good idea
to be partnered with Petrov.

597
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:07,180
In the meantime,
we alienate Israel and Palestine.

598
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:14,312
Well... between you and me, I agree.

599
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,316
Sit with me.

600
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,443
What would you do differently?

601
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,405
Well...

602
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:29,952
If the goal is to get troops
into the Jordan Valley,

603
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:33,747
well, then there's more than one way
to skin that cat.

604
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,833
A multinational force?

605
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,669
I would go through the UN.

606
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,754
Peacekeeping?

607
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,798
You wouldn't get past Russia's veto.

608
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:47,345
There might be a way, but...

609
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:51,515
you'd have a lot of responsibility
on your shoulders.

610
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,935
Well, if you can give me guidance,
I'm sure I can handle it.

611
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:01,150
There is precedent
with the Uniting for Peace Resolution.

612
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:04,362
We used it to get around
the Russians for the Korean War.

613
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,661
- The whole thing?
- From Poland to the UK.

614
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:15,039
I want the entire
missile defense system gone.

615
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:18,042
You know that's there to defend
against North Korea, against Iran.

616
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,919
And far closer
to my borders than theirs.

617
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,713
I'm asking for a few thousand troops
in the Jordan Valley.

618
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,840
You're asking me to dismantle
Europe's defense system.

619
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:27,385
What you're really asking for
is American forces

620
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,136
just south of the Caucasus.

621
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,555
You must have a strategic play in mind.

622
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,682
This is about stability in the region.

623
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:37,061
You're trying to consolidate
your foothold in the region. Hm?

624
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,814
The Black Sea, Kazakhstan,
Chechnya, Crimea.

625
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:44,651
So, please...
don't insult me with peace.

626
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:52,785
Whatever your strategic goals may be,
the missile defense system is mine.

627
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:58,207
Viktor, I invited you to Washington
with pure intentions,

628
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,419
so that we could break bread
and learn to trust one another.

629
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,546
Francis, I don't get softened up

630
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,591
by a nice dinner
and dancing with a beautiful woman.

631
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:10,886
You asked me what I want.

632
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,055
Well... I told you.

633
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,935
I'll tell you what.

634
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,645
It's my turn to get some sleep.

635
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,272
Let's attack all this with a fresh mind.

636
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:23,983
We've barely smoked our cigars.

637
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:28,321
We're not men of excess, though, are we?

638
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:31,407
Aren't we?

639
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,954
No, no.

640
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,705
No, you're right.

641
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,710
Enough smoke for one evening.

642
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,186
What are you going to do?

643
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:03,439
I don't know.

644
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,399
Try to meet him halfway.

645
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,446
Cathy and I were talking.

646
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,865
Maybe the Israelis
and the Palestinians are right.

647
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,117
We should consider starting with them.

648
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,703
Use the United Nations
to put pressure on Russia.

649
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:21,207
- How?
- Uniting for Peace.

650
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,960
General Assembly overrides
a Russian veto in the Security Council.

651
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:29,173
Well, that'll just antagonize them
even if it works. And it won't.

652
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:32,009
Well, it might work.
Cathy seems to think it could.

653
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,845
I thought you believed in this plan.

654
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,307
We were just...
brainstorming alternatives.

655
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,268
Well, I've worked too hard on it
just to abandon it.

656
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:44,938
Okay, you know best.

657
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:08,670
Do you mind?

658
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:11,882
What?

659
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,217
The light.

660
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,356
Francis.

661
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:31,110
He's a thug.

662
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,028
Smart, but he's still a thug.

663
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:34,821
Don't cower to him.

664
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:48,919
Where I come from, we drop a raw egg
into some tomato juice and drink that.

665
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,879
Luckily, I don't come from there.

666
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:55,884
That's a perfect job for Doug.
I can't imagine why he'd turn it down.

667
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:57,761
He thinks we were behind it.

668
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,306
I told him we weren't,
but I don't think he believes me.

669
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:02,266
Said he doesn't need training wheels.

670
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:05,227
Well, I want you to still stop in
from time to time and see him.

671
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:06,353
Yes, sir.

672
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:10,232
Is the Secretary of Defense here?
Send him in.

673
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,694
- Mr. President.
- We don't have much time.

674
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:17,364
Petrov gets here in 90 minutes.
We need to talk Europe.

675
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,242
The answer is yes.

676
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:07,705
- To some, not all, of what you asked.
- I see.

677
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,209
I'm prepared
to scale back significantly.

678
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:14,838
Now, I have to speak to my team first
and my allies in NATO,

679
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,257
but I'm confident that we can
do something meaningful

680
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,510
in Poland and the Czech Republic.

681
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:21,970
Now, our people
can work out the specifics.

682
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:26,975
And whatever it is we decide
and agree on, the public cannot know.

683
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:34,941
I woke up with the taste
of those cigars in my mouth.

684
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,736
Thinking of Cuba and Kennedy.

685
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,366
I won't be humiliated
the way Khrushchev was with Turkey.

686
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:46,495
Well, you can't possibly compare what
I'm proposing to what happened then.

687
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,582
I can only consider a partial
scale-back if you announce it.

688
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:54,628
This press conference
is about the Jordan Valley.

689
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:57,673
The most important thing about the
missiles is the scale-back, not the PR.

690
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,092
My people would know
I walked away with something.

691
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:04,680
And, by announcing it,
I can keep you to your word.

692
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,474
I am more than
meeting you halfway, Viktor.

693
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:17,859
You know what the best part
of the fall of the Soviet Union was?

694
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,446
The cars.

695
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,199
Have you ever been in, um... a Lada?

696
00:46:24,283 --> 00:46:25,783
Lada? No, I haven't.

697
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,621
No? Oh. It's the worst car ever built.

698
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,289
Tiny, little thing, you know.

699
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:33,791
Your head would hit the ceiling
when you hit a pothole.

700
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,003
And the heat never worked.

701
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:38,589
And no air conditioning.

702
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:41,675
You know, your skin would stick
to the seats in the summer.

703
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:43,552
It was a coffin on wheels.

704
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:48,140
But then, after the fall,
we got the Lexus.

705
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:52,728
Temperature control.
Automatic windows.

706
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,688
And so much room.

707
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:57,775
First time I fucked my ex-wife,
in a Lexus.

708
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,859
You could never do that in a Lada.

709
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:02,404
No space. Huh?

710
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:05,365
You see, Mr. President.

711
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:07,200
I want the Lexus.

712
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:10,663
And you're trying to sell me a Lada.

713
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:39,358
I'll have them bring
your motorcade around.

714
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,738
But the... press conference.

715
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:49,284
Oh. Right!

716
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:51,370
I'd completely forgotten.

717
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:55,123
But I think we're gonna be okay
without one today.

718
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:59,294
Have a safe journey home,
Mr. President.

719
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,348
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. President.

720
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,777
Give me the Secretary of State.

721
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,918
The president will be speaking alone.
No joint conference.

722
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,382
The president will be out shortly.

723
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,433
Last night,
I had the pleasure of hosting

724
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:57,436
some very special guests
here at the White House.

725
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,439
True Russian patriots
who exhibit the very best

726
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,816
that their country has to offer.

727
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,778
Their names: Nadya Tolokonnikova,

728
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:09,197
Masha Alyokhina and Pyotr Verzilov.

729
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:12,785
As you're all aware,
they stood up to President Petrov,

730
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:17,330
and forced him to listen to the truths
that he didn't want to hear.

731
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,461
And, well, that had
a profound effect on me.

732
00:49:22,544 --> 00:49:25,631
Because it made me realize
that I need to stand up to him as well.

733
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,883
As does our country.

734
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:32,220
When I invited the president here,
I set out hoping to find a partner.

735
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:34,765
But the demands
that President Petrov made

736
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:39,728
proves to me that peace
is not a priority for him.

737
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:43,315
Peace should not have to be bought.

738
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,192
Peace should be its own reward,

739
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:49,863
and we will achieve it,
with or without him.

740
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:51,949
Thank you very much.

741
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,242
You have thoughts
on how to bypass Russia.

742
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:57,830
The idea is to negate Russia's
veto in the Security Council.

743
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:01,040
I'll let the ambassador tell you
what we have in mind.

744
